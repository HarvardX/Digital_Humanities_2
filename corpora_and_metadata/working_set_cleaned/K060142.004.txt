geographical account of scotland ii of its lakes and rivers iii of its fisheries including that for pearls iv of the cattle fowls etc v of its manufactures of linen and woollen vi of the grain and

scotland xiv of the order of the thistle xv some brief observations on the whole and the division of scotland into shires etc of all which as succinctly as possible and  i a brief geographical account of scotland scotland is bounded on the north by the irish sea and england from which it is divided by solway firth and the rivers esk and kexsop on the west border by the cheviot hills in the middle marches and by the lower parts of the tweed on the east border on the east it is bounded by the german sea on the north by the deucaledonian sea and on the west by the great western ocean  its greatest length from dungsbyhead or john of grots house in caithness to the mull of galloway toward ireland is no more than about     scots miles but if we reckon directly north from dumfries or the said mull of galloway to the utmost parts of caithness or strathnavern the length will not be so much and less still if we reckon from berwick to either of these places  its breadth from the point of ardnamurchan near the isle of mull about the middle part of scotland in the west to buchanness in the east parts toward the north is about   0 scots miles but the sea running up into the land or the land thrusting out into the sea in many places makes the breadth of it everywhere else very various and disproportionable for in the south parts it is seldom  00 miles over and in the north parts beyond inverness not so many so that there is no house above  0 or    miles from salt water  besides the main land there are about  00 islands some of them very considerable which may be distinguished into several classes the western islands called hebrides or aebudae by latin authors the orcades or orkney islands the islands of shetland or zetland and some few in the firth of forth  the whole country abounds in lakes and rivers many whereof running into creeks and arms of the sea which in several places are very wide and deep afford great and commodious opportunities for fishing and shipping but it is much to be regretted that the land is neither cultivated nor the fishing and shipping carried on and improved to so much advantage as might be expected  though the soil is not generally so level and fruitful as that of england yet the south parts of scotland are far more pleasant than and preferable to the north parts of england and there are everywhere all things necessary for human life and not only sufficient for the inhabitants but also to export and exchange for such foreign commodities as the people want and to return considerable sums  ii of the most remarkable lakes and rivers in scotland the most remarkable lakes in scotland are lochtay and lochness and lochlevin which all send forth rivers of the same name with themselves lochlomond which sends forth the river of lomond and lochiern which sends the river iern it is observed that lochness lochtay and lochiern seldom freeze  lochmyrton in galloway is another and remarkable for this that one part of it generally freezes in the winterseason and the other part seldom does  there is a loch in straitherrach in the lord lovats lands which never freezes however severe the frost be till february and then in one nights time it freezes all over and if the frost continue two nights the ice grows very thick there is a lake of the same nature called lochmonar in the earl of cromartys lands in the north and there is another lake in straglash at a place called glencanich in a high ground betwixt the tops of two mountains the middle of which lake is always frozen throughout the summer notwithstanding the strong reflections of the sunbeams from the mountains which melt the ice at the sides of the lake the ground round the lake has a constant verdure as if there were a perpetual spring and cattle grow sooner fat by that grass than anywhere else and this is so much the more remarkable that there are several other lakes in the neighborhood of as high a situation wherein no such thing is seen  in linlithgowshire is a lake called lochcoat lough from whence a stream runs under a neighboring mountain the murmur of which is heard among the stones and after it has run thus under ground for about two hundred paces it issues with great force from a fountain about three feet broad and forms a stream which turns a watermill  for the convenience of trade and fishing there are so many inlets of the sea that there is scarce any part of it as i have said above  0 miles distant from some bay creek or arm of the ocean and these afford many harbors several of them very good and capable of receiving men of war and ships of the greatest burden  the principal rivers in scotland are tay which divides it in the middle and running by scone perth and dundee empties itself into the german ocean in the southern parts the forth and tweed run into the same clyde runs into the western sea as esk annand nith ken dee and cree do into the irish in the north dee and don run into the german ocean as spey and ness do into murray firth  the most convenient for trade are tay which is navigable to perth forth and clyde which if joined by a canal near the place where the romans formerly built their wall of about  0 miles long to defend their province from the scots and picts would open a communication betwixt the east and west seas to the great advancement of the commerce of the whole island there was much talk of it about the time of the union but as it would undoubtedly be attended with very great charges and other difficulties the project seems to be laid quite aside  i am the briefer in my account of the lakes and rivers in scotland because i shall be obliged to be more particular upon them in their respective places  iii of the fisheries in scotland includeing that of pearls the salmonfishery is particularly the boast and delight of the scots insomuch that for it they too much neglect all the rest  their salmon are accounted the best in europe and though their barrels be a third less than that of berwick yet they have yielded  0 livres more per barrel in france partly because of their goodness and partly because better cured wherein the magistrates and towncouncil of aberdeen take a very particular care salmon abound not only in the navigable rivers of scotland but in those which are less in most parts of the kingdom and they valued them so much formerly that in several of their old acts of parliament they forbad selling them to england except for gold clyde abounds with salmon for which the town of renfrew has been famous and bishop lesley in his description of scotland says they used in his time to employ sixty vessels in fishing most of spring and summer but it is much short of aberdeen where the same author says the rivers dee and don exceed all those of the kingdom for number and goodness of salmon for which he assigns this reason that they delight in clear streams which occasions our rivers in scotland to abound more with salmon than those of other countries where the rivers are more muddy the other places most remarkable for salmonfishing in scotland are in the dovern at bamf the rivers nesse nairn findorn lossey and spey in murray the latter abounds with salmon for  0 miles together lochlomond in lenox is remarkable for salmon of an excellent taste lochou in argyll the like and there is good salmonfishing in the rivers lough and speynie in lochaber in the bay of cromarty near dingwal castle and in the rivers tay and tweed and other smaller rivers in the bordering counties they have marld or speckled salmon in harries northvist and benbecula and in the isle of sky there are no less than  0 rivers all abounding with salmon  as to their codfishing mr spruel an eminent scots merchant who laid an account of the product of the kingdom for trade before their parliament some years ago says he was informed by a yarmouth man who use to buy those fish and salt on the scots coast that he has sometimes got four thousand cured fish in a voyage at   d or   d apiece and retaild them again from    d to   s   d apiece which shows what vast advantage might be made of this trade since the scots cod are reckoned as good or better than those of newfoundland and what contibutes much to the cheapness of this and the herringfishery in scotland is that they are caught with fewer hands and vessels of far less expense than doggers which must be well manned and strong because obliged to lie at sea whereas the scots catch those fish in their own creeks bays and harbors where few hands and open vessels are for the most part sufficient because they are seldom exposed to any danger by storms being always near the shore and laid up at night  herrings abound on all the coasts of the kingdom but especially on the western isles which are reckoned the best and fattest though not so large as those taken on the eastern and northern coasts the scots herringfishing is accounted the best in the world and the dutch have got a great part of their wealth by it  a fishery was attempted in the isles by king charles i in conjunction with some merchants and a magazine was erected for that use in hermetra one of the harries islands and another in the isle of vacksay but the unhappy civil war coming on it was not prosecuted it was renewed by king charles ii and succeeded well for a time the fish they caught were accounted the best in europe and yielded a price accordingly but the king withdrawing his money afterward to supply his pressing occasions the merchants were displeased at it and differing among themselves did also withdraw theirs which ruined the design  some dutch families settled in the village of stornway in the isle of jews soon after that princes restoration and so much improved the inhabitants in the fishing trade during the small time of their abode there that they still exceed all those of the neighboring isles and continent they brought the natives a great deal of money likewise for their sea and landfowl but king charles ii being prevailed on to send away the dutch it was a great loss to the country  herrings are sometimes bought in the isles for   d per barrel and when cured and sent abroad yield from    to  0 s per barrel and sometimes   000 barrels of white herrings have been exported to france from clyde in a season besides what were exported from dunbar and other parts of the kingdom to france and other nations which may serve as a specimen to show how capable that trade is of improvement especially considering the situation of the west of scotland and the isles from whence they may be a month sooner at market with them than from any part of england and holland which with the advantage of taking and curing them cheaper and sooner than the dutch can possibly do considering how far they have to sail backward and forward what risques they run at sea and what numbers of tenders they are obliged to send to and again betwixt their own country and their doggers with provisions salt etc they might soon be outdone in that profitable trade by the inhabitants of great britain who may lie ashore at night and land their fish as soon as caught without any danger from tempests or enemies many of those bays where the herring abound being very safe for ships to ride in  whales in abundance frequent the islands of fladden orkney and jews one hundred and fourteen run ashore on the island of orkney at one time in the year       cod tusk and ling are caught in vast plenty upon all their coasts  haddocks sturgeon turbut trouts perch pike scate greyberd maycril keeling whiting seaurchin catfish cockpadle lyths spirlings soles flukes garvie eels are also caught on the scottish coasts in great plenty for homeconsumption  otters whose skins are useful for muffs etc are very numerous in the isles  shellfish of all sorts as lobsters crabs oysters are also found in vast quantities in the western islands the latter so large that they must be cut in three or four pieces to be eaten  cockles muscles limpets wilks scollops and spouts are cast up by the tide in such numbers on the isles that the people cannot consume them  pearl being the product of fish it is proper to discourse of the scots pearl here mr spruel the merchant abovementioned who understood the pearltrade best of any man in that kingdom having dealt in it above forty years says he has sometimes given a hundred rixdollars which is near    l for one scots pearl and that he had scots pearl as fine clear and more transparent than any oriental pearl though the latter be more easily matched because they are all of a yellow water yet foreigners covet scots pearl the more wrinkles there are in a pearlshell the more sign it is of the age and goodness of a pearl for the smooth shells are young and barren therefore he proposed that a law should be made to forbid the fishing of young pearl for the longer they stay in the water the more valuable they are so that he would have no shells taken up less than four inches in length or two or three in breadth and that none should be allowed to offer any pearl to be sold that weighs less than five grains which is as reasonable as laws to prevent the taking of the young fry of salmon since pearl are of much more value and that they might have time to grow and increase he proposes that pearlfishing should be forbid except once in ten years at least because he has been sorry to see some thousands of young pearls offered to sale that were of no manner of value whereas had they lain in the waters their due time they might have been worth from four to fifty crowns apiece  pearl is found in most places of the nation where salmon are taken and once in twenty years he says there is a great pearlfishing in scotland this does not hinder but that pearlshells of the size he proposes or larger may be taken up at any time when found and these are probably to be had among the unfrequented isles  particular places where pearl abound are the rivers in the isle of sky where they are frequently found in black muscles especially in the rivers kilmartin and ord where pearls have lately been found of  0 l per piece and in a fresh water lake near the south side of locheinardstad in that same island there are also muscles that breed pearl  though the small pearl be not so useful for ornament yet they may be of very good use in physic and make a fine article in the apothecarys bills being reputed the chief of all cordials and very good against the plague violent and pestilential fevers fluxes heartburning giddiness of the head trembling of the heart etc which is sufficient to show that the pearlfishery well deserves encouragement since we may be supplied with it much cheaper at home than from the indies  iv of the cattle horses fowls etc of scotland the country in general abounds in flocks of sheep and herds of cattle which are generally black except in cornsoils where they seldom breed or keep any more than are necessary for the plough or the pail but it is observable that such as are bred in the corncountries are much larger than those bred in other parts and equal in size to those bred in some parts of england even where the land seems to be better  in general their sheep and cattle are much smaller than those of england especially in pasturelands yet are they of a far sweeter and more delicious taste the highlanders bring great numbers of them yearly into the lowlands where some are fatted but the bulk of them and also many of those bred in the lowlands are sent into diverse parts of england especially to st faiths near norwich where they turn out to good account as i have observed in its place  they have also very many hogs and an incredible number of goats particularly in the north and highlands the latter they eat themselves but the former they pickle and export as they likewise do vast quantities of salt beef  in the southern counties there are no deer except in gentlemens parks but everywhere else they are in great plenty  they breed great numbers of horses especially in galloway and the highlands small indeed but capable of great fatigue especially if we consider that they are not only more proper for the saddle and other uses in that country which being hilly will not admit in many places of teams and carriages but are more hardy than horses of a larger size and will thrive upon what would starve great horses nevertheless in many places of the lowlands they can breed horses fit for war coach or carriage  scotland has not only plenty of domestic fowl such as are common to other countries but many that are peculiar to themselves especially in the islands where they are in such multitudes as the inhabitants can neither consume nor vend half of them but their trade for them will still increase as it has done since the union  their fowl and eggs afford a large fund of trade for food and their feathers for bedding and other uses their fat is made use of by the inhabitants not only in many cases where oil is necessary but likewise for physic  v of the linen and woollen manufactures of scotland flax abounds in scotland so that besides what they consume themselves they export great quantities of linen brown and whitened which is one of the greatest manufactures of the kingdom and if duly regulated and encouraged as it is more and more since the union might save a great deal of money in the island besides what it may bring in to it for the scots have improved their linen manufacture much of late and besides fine linen make very good holland cambrick muslins plain and striped calicoes damask ticken for beds etc white and dyed threads laces tape etc  mr spruel in his account current betwixt scotland and england says he has known out of a pound of flax of scots growth which cost but    d six spangles of fine yarn spun which was sold at glasgow at about   s   d per spangle which made the product of that    d to the spinners    s and made into fine muslin that same pound of flax amounted to  0 or    dollars which is   l    s   d or   l    s the charges of weaving and whitening deducted he adds that from one pound of scots flax lacemakers have made lace to the value of   l sterling which is sufficient to show how much the linen manufacture may be improved there and how many poor women who are not capable of employing themselves otherwise may get a livelihood by it and what money it may bring into the nation  their hemp is also capable of being improved not only to save money in the island which is exported for canvas sailcloth etc but also to export and to make nets for their fishery and other uses  the numerous and large flocks of sheep they have in scotland produce abundance of wool from whence come manufactures of several sorts as broadcloth coarse or housewifescloth fingrims serges bays crapes temmin glasgow plaids worsted camblets and other stuffs and stockens for homeconsumption and export besides their tallow and skins their wool in general is not so good as that of england yet they have brought their broadcloth lately to a great perfection but can never equal england in that part of woollen manufacture nevertheless it is very proper for serges bays camblets shaloons and other stuffs and by due regulation is capable of great improvement for a foreign trade they are come to a great perfection in making stuffs and for plaids i shall observe byandby they exceed all the world  an instance of what great improvement may be made of their wool we have from mr spruel in his account current viz that they make such fine worsted stockens at aberdeen that they yield  0     0 and  0 s a pair for womens stockens which is sufficient to show that they are capable of making stockens at lower rates especially considering that they have store of very good wool brought thither from the highlands and isles which because sold at the cross of aberdeen is commonly called crosswool the most remarkable places besides in scotland for good wool are galloway and tweedale from which great improvement might be made in bays serges and shaloons  the scots plaids are a manufacture in which they exceed all nations as i have said both as to color and fineness they have of late been pretty much fansied in england for beds hangings windowcurtains and nightgowns for both sexes so that attempts have been made at norwich to imitate them but they fall much short of the scots in color fineness and workmanship as is evident at first sight their greatest trade for their woollen manufactures and other commodities has for many years been with the united netherlands where they have a conservator who serves both for a consul and envoy to take care of the affairs of their trade being part of the ancient privileges they enjoyed by treaties with the dukes of burgundy and others when sovereigns of the netherlands from this trade the towns of rotterdam and terveer have acquired considerable wealth in return for which the scots have been always well esteemed in those provinces and the states allow them churches and maintenance for their ministers  vi of the grain and pulse of scotland the wheat of scotland is so excellent that joseph scaliger who had been in the country says no bread in europe is comparable to what is made of it for whiteness lightness and easy digestion it abounds in the mers lothian gavrie etc so that they have not only enough for their own consumption but for exportation  oats are the most universal grain of the kingdom and exceed those in england for all uses they grow very well everywhere and in such quantities as afford a considerable fund for export both in grain and meal and make very good bread and drink  pease they have in great plenty both for their own consumption and for exportation and they are so good of the kind that in some parts of the country the laboring husbandmen make good nourishing bread of them  beans they have also in great plenty for their own use and for export  barley grows likewise very well in scotland but they sow more of that sort they call beer which has four rows of grain upon an ear whereas barley has but two of this they make good bread broth ale and beer and export great quantities  rye grows also very well in scotland and makes good bread but this they dont cultivate so much as they do the grains abovementioned  vii of the mountains wood timber etc of scotland the most remarkable mountains of scotland are the grampian mountains which run from east to west from near aberdeen to cowal in argyllshire almost the whole breadth of the kingdom famous for the battle fought on them betwixt the romans and the ancient scots and caledonians under the conduct of galgacus as we find in tacitus the next most remarkable chain of mountains are those of lammermoor which run from the eastern coast in the mers a great way west next to these are pentland hills which run through lothian and join the mountains of tweedale and these again are joined by others which run through the whole breadth of the island other remarkable mountains are those called cheviot hills in the border betwixt the two kingdoms drumbenderlaw and northberwicklaw both in eastlothian arthurs seat in midlothian cairnapple in westlothian tentock in clydsdale brinmore in argyll the ochel mountains in perthshire the lowmonds and largolaw in fife in angus dundeelaw and part of the grampians in caithness ord and in the orkney islands the mountains of hoy  there are many large woods of oak in scotland which afford materials for building and shipping and for the husbandmans use and the country is very improveable this way if planting were more encouraged however they have at present not only such as are fit for the uses abovementioned but also for pipestaves and barrels and their bark is of use to the tanners great quantities of which are annually exported to ireland and elsewhere they have likewise ash trees elms and others fit for building and other domestic uses and great forests of fir which afford materials for building and shipping and might with due care afford pitch and tar without being obliged to bring such large quantities from the northern countries as is usually done by the inhabitants of great britain  there were formerly many great woods in scotland among which the forest of caledonia was famous but there are now scarce any remains of it  the woods are more rare than formerly in the southern parts of the kingdom of which the most remarkable now left are those of hamilton calendar and torwood but in the north especially in perthshire lochaber badenoch and mar there are many forests some of them  0 and some  0 miles in length  they have abundance of fruit trees of all sorts in their gardens and orchards and might by improvement not only have sufficient to afford them fruit for homeconsumption but also cider for their own drinking and export  viii of the medicinal waters fountains springs etc the more remarkable medicinal fountains in scotland are moffat wells which spring from the top of a rock near the town of that name in annandale the wells are two in number near one another the higher well runs through whitish and crystalline stones and the lower through black ones resembling marcasites of antimony the smell of the water is like that of gunpowder and it dies silver of a black color to the stones of the upper well grows a matter resembling stinking sulphur of antimony of a yellowish red color the stones of the lower well are of the color of antimony and some of them contain a metallic matter that sparkles like antimony where the stream of the lower well runs down into a neighboring brook there sticks to the rock a whitish salt and perhaps a nitrous matter which has the diuretic virtue of the water those waters also purge by stool and vomit and are very good against colic and nephritick pains because they powerfully remove the obstructions of the bowels they are outwardly applied to ulcers and against pains in the joints they are strongest in their operation in the driest season of the summer and autumn but are not so good in a rainy or in the winterseason  mahons well near st mahons church has the same virtue but does not operate so strongly and there is a well of the same nature discovered not many years ago at hallyards within six miles of edinburgh  at kinghorne a very clear and cold water flows from the clefts of a rock which quickly passes through the body is of excellent use for recovering a lost appetite and against the gravel and stone it is outwardly applied to watery and itching eyes and against redness and pimples in the face the famous dr p anderson wrote upon its usefulness there flows also from the same rock a whitish viscid liquor which is an excellent cosmetick  arthrey well two miles north of stirling flows from a mountain where is a copper mine with some mixture of gold and silver the water is very cold and being tinctured with the minerals it flows through is of use against outward distempers  in glenelg at a place called achignigle is a stream which turns holly into a greenish stone of which they make moulds for casting musketbullets and meltingpots for melting brass and other metals and whirls for womens spindles  there is a petrifying fountain near the castle of slain the water of which dropping from a natural cave presently turns into pyramids of stones which are brittle and make good lime there is another in hamilton wood the stones made by which resemble putrid moss  at monkton near edinburgh is a well called the routing well because of the noise it makes before tempests from the part of the well which looks to that quarter of the sky from whence the tempest is to blow  there is another on the west side of campsey hills which divides stirlingshire from lenox whose water makes people drunk  ix of precious stones and other valuable commodities the following valuable commodities and precious stones are found in different parts of scotland  coral and coraline in the isles of jews sky and jura ambergris on the coasts of the islands bernera southvist bintire and orkney marcasites lapis ceranius lapis hecticus agat of different sizes and colors all in the isle of sky crystal in the isles of sky arran and st kilda fullers earth in the isle of sky fine shells which pass in africa for money in the isles loadstone in the isle of cannay sperma ceti on the coasts of orkney and other isles mines of gold in crawford moor also azure in the reign of james iv silver mines three miles south of linlithgow in the reign of james vi copper in airthrey near stirling lead in clydsdale of which the earl of hopton makes good account lead and tin in orkney iron at dumfernling in fife coal in lothian fife etc freestone slate limestone marble in great plenty all over the country and sir robert sibbalds asserts that they have also diamonds rubies carbuncles hyacinths jaspers cornelians amethysts etc to whom i refer you for farther satisfaction on this head  x of the customs manners language etc of the scots the scots are divided into highlanders who call themselves the ancient scots and into lowlanders who are a mixture of ancient scots picts britons french english danes germans hungarians and others  buchanan describes the customs of the highlanders graphically thus in their diet apparel and housholdfurniture they follow the parsimony of the ancients they provide their diet by fishing and hunting and boil their flesh in the paunch or skin of a beast while they hunt they eat it raw after having squeezed out the blood their drink is the broth of boiled meat or whey they keep some years and drink it plentifully in their entertainments but most of them drink water their bread is of oats and barley the only grain produced in their country which they prepare very artfully they eat a little of it in the morning and contenting themselves with that hunt or go about their business without eating any more till night they delight most in clothes of several colors especially stripped the colors they affect most are purple and blue their ancestors as do most of them still made use of plaids very much variegated but now they make them rather of dark colors resembling that of the crops of heath that they may not be discovered while they lie in the heaths waiting for their game being rather wrapped up than covered with those plaids they endure all the rigours of the seasons and sometimes sleep covered all over with snow at home they lie upon the ground having under them fern or heath covered with a sheet or blanket the latter laid with the roots undermost so as it is almost equal to feathers for softness but much more healthful for the quality of heath being to draw out superfluous humors when they lie down weary and faint upon it at night they rise fresh and vigorous in the morning they affect this hard way of sleeping and if at any time they come into other places of the country where there is better accommodation they pull the coverings off the bed and lie down upon them wrapped in their plaids lest they should be spoiled by this barbarous effeminacy as they call it  the lowlanders partake much of the temper of the people of whom we have mentioned them to be composed but most resemble the french occasioned by the long league betwixt the two nations their mutual commerce frequent intermarriages and custom of traveling into france to study the law and other sciences and by their affecting to serve in the french armies but since the union of the crowns the english customs and way of living have obtained much in the lowlands where the english tongue has been their natural language for above  00 years but still retains more ancient saxon and french this being extraordinary and perhaps singular that a foreign language should prevail in a country altogether independent of england and where the inhabitants are of another lineage and maintained such fierce and long wars to preserve their distinct sovereignty the scottish antiquaries and historians give the following reasons of it   the frequent saxon auxiliaries sent to assist the picts against the scots which occasioned many of those saxons to settle in the lowlands of scotland then possessed by the picts   the last considerable effort made by the picts in conjunction with the english to recover their country against donald v of scotland who after he had defeated the english and picts upon the river jedd in tiviotdale neglecting to improve his victory was afterward surprised by them near berwick and taken prisoner after a great slaughter of his men upon this success the english under the conduct of osbreth and ella possessed themselves of the country as far as dumbarton without restoring the picts the major part of which retired to denmark and norway and the remainder were cut off by the english to prevent their calling in foreigners thus the english continued in possession of that part of the country from the year     till about the year     when king gregory the great of scotland recovered the country and the scottish proprietors the possession of their estates but willingly entertained the english commonalty and husbandmen who were as desirous to stay their own country being at that time infested by the danes and they rather chose to be under the dominion of the scots who were christians than under that of the danes who were pagans   great numbers of the english came into scotland to assist king malcolm iii against the usurper macbeth whom he rewarded after his victory with possessions in scotland   a great many english came to scotland after the norman conquest with edgar atheling and his sister margaret who was afterward married to king malcolm abovementioned which makes the reasons of the scots historians for the prevailing of the english language in the lowlands of scotland very probable   it has been gaining ground upon the old scots language ever since which is now confined to the highlands and the isles where most of those of note do also understand english though about  00 years ago the old people in galloway generally understood the erse or ancient scots language which is now worn quite out  xi of the religion and ecclesiastical government of scotland the estabished religion of scotland since the revolution and confirmed by the act of union is what is called the presbyterian being a church government by pastors teachers elders and deacons before the revolution the church was governed by bishops but they not coming so readily into the new settlement as the presbyterians did were abolished  the ecclesiastical courts as they now stand are four viz   the kirk session consisting of the minister elders and deacons in each parish who consider the affairs of the parish as a religious society they judge in all matters of lesser scandals can suspend from the communion and regulate all particulars relating to public worship and the poor   the presbytery which consists of the minister and one elder from five to ten twelve or more neighboring parishes who choose one of these ministers to be praeses or moderator here are tried appeals from the kirk sessions and here they inspect into the behavior of the ministers and elders within their respective bounds they supply vacant parishes ordain pastors examine and license schoolmasters and young students for probationary preachers and judge when or on whom to inflict the greater excommunication   the provincial synod this is composed of all the members of several adjacent presbyteries it meets twice a year at some principal place within its bounds is opened by a sermon their business is to receive correspondents from the neighboring synods who are a check upon one another to determine appeals from the presbyteries in their district to inquire into and censure the behavior of the presbyteries themselves they likewise have power to transport or remove a minister from one place to another which often occasions great disturbance hence lie appeals however to   the general assembly the highest ecclesiastical power in the kingdom in which presides a lordcommissioner a man of the first quality as a representative of the kings person all the members of this are annually elected and the last moderator opens the new sessions with a sermon   the same discipline as to the main of the several forms and proceedings was observed in the episcopal times only they had no lay elders the bishop or his deputy being a minister or ministers within the bounds presided in all presbyteries and diocesan synods as the archbishop of st andrews did in the national or general assemblies for it must be observed that episcopacy in scotland differed from the same thing in england for here it was as low as the nature of an episcopal church could admit the bishops were sine quibus non they had no laychancellors but did all things presbyterorum consilio  the number of churches in scotland since the reformation is much less than it was before however there are none now of peculiar or exempt jurisdiction they are about   0 beside some few chapels which make up    presbyteries included in    provincial synods which formerly were divided into two provinces under two archbishops and twelve bishops as follow   the archbishopric of st andrews contained all fife part of perthshire angus and mernis   the bishopric of edinburgh contained the three lothians some few parishes excepted sterlingshire and the merse   dunkeld contained the north parts of perthshire and some part of angus and lothian   dumblane contained the west and south parts of perthshire   breechin contained part of angus and mernis   aberdeen contained all aberdeenshire and part of bamff   murray contained murray nairn part of bamff and inverness   ross contained the shires of ross cromarty and part of inverness   caithness contained caithness sutherland and strathnaver  0 orkney contained all orkney and zetland    the archbishopric of glasgow which was very extensive contained the shires of clyddesdale dunbarton renfrew air dumfries peeblis selkirk and roxburgh    the bishopric of galloway contained the shire of wigton and stewartry of kirkudbright    the isles contained arran bute cumbra and almost all the hebrides or western isles    argyll contained all the shire of argyll lochaber and some few of the isles   the thirteen provincial synods into which scotland is at present divided are   lothian and tweedale consisting of seven presbyteries viz edinburgh linlithgow biggar peeblis dalkeith haddington and dumbar   merse and tiviotdale consisting of six presbyteries viz dunse chirnside kelso jedburgh selkirk

the law of scotland has provided against pluralities and throughout the whole country there are scarce any benefices worth less than  0 l per annum sterling which in that country is a good maintenance  xii of the order of the thistle or st andrew in scotland the order of st andrew or the thistle by reason of its great antiquity and memorable institution is upon all occasions called the most ancient and most noble order of the thistle being founded as all the scots historians assert by achaius the   th king of scotland after a signal victory obtained over the saxons anno     and dedicated to st andrew the patron or tutelar saint of scotland  this order came at length to shine forth in fuller splendour in the reign of king james v who was himself a most splendid and magnificent prince he caused the collar of the order to be composed of two ancient badges or symbols of the scots and picts viz the thistle and sprigs of rue but about the time of the reformation it fell into desuetude and was scarcely used by the knights then being so very zealous for the reformed religion that they left their order where they laid down their popery and it was never after reassumed till the reign of king james vii who for the better regulating of the order in all its proceedings signed a body of statutes and appointed the knights brethren to wear the image of st andrew upon a blue watered tabby ribband and likewise named the royal chapel or abbey church of holyroodhouse to be the chapel of the order the old church of st andrews being ruined at the reformation for which end it was put in excellent repair but was divested of all its beautiful ornaments by a furious rabble at the late revolution  her late majesty queen anne was pleased to revive the said order upon the   st of december   0  and signed a body of statutes wherein the color of the ribband was charged from blue to green to make a distinction between this order and that of the garter all which statuts the late king george i was pleased to confirm with some additional ones among which was that of adding rays of glory to surround the whole figure of st andrew which hangs at the collar and though from the time of the reformation both elections and installments had been dispensed with his majesty was pleased to order that for the future chapters for election shall be held in the royal presence to which end he commanded the great wardrobe to provide the knights brethren and officers of the order with such mantles as are appointed by the statutes of the order  xiii of the civil government of scotland the college of justice commonly called the sessions consists of a president and fourteen fixed senators or judges called ordinary lords of session and two extraordinary lords and they have seven clerks of session and six other inferior officers before this court all civil causes are tried at stated times and they determine causes by acts of parliament and the custom of the nation and where these are defective they determine according to the imperial and civil law not according to the rigor of the letter but according to equity and justice there lies no appeal from this court but to the parliament and the presence of nine judges is required to make their decree valid the parliament has full power to affirm or reverse with costs not exceeding  00 l sterling  this court has distributive justice only both in law and equity but no authority as to life or limb unless for some faults competent to themselves since the union lords of session are appointed a committee for planting of churches and valuation of tithes    the justiciary commonly called the justice or criminal court consists of five lords of the session and the justicegeneral and justiceclerk they try all crimes all prosecutions in this court are raised by the kings advocate and the greatest traitor is here allowed advocates to plead for him    the court of exchequer was established in pursuance of the act of union in the  th year of queen anne and has the same power authority privilege and jurisdiction of the revenue of scotland as the court of exchequer in england has over the revenues there the judges have also the power of passing signatures gifts and tutories etc the court consists of a chief and four other barons and it has two remembrancers a clerk of the pipe attorneys auditors and other officers  the officers of state are   the keeper of the seal and his officers   the lord privy seal and his officers   lord clerkregister and his officers   lord advocate   the faculty of advocates enjoy many and great privileges with the rest of the college of justice and have a dean a treasurer clerk curator and other officers  writers of the signet are those who subscribe all writs and summonss that pass the signet and they as well as the advocates are capable of being made ordinary lords  besides the above national judges every particular county or shire has a chief magistrate or his depute ordinary judge in all cases civil and criminal but there lies an appeal from this magistrate in most cases to the session and court of justiciary  the sheriff is in effect the supreme justice of peace to whom the law principally intrusts the securing the quiet and tranquillity of the part of the kingdom of which he is sheriff king james vi and king charles i bought in some and designed to buy in all the rest of these heretable sheriffalties but most of them yet remain in the great families of the kingdom  bailiffs stewards and constables in their respective districts have the same liberty as sheriffs in their shires  there are three sorts of burghs viz burghs royal burghs of regality and burghs of barony every one whereof is a corporation and holds courts though only the royal burghs send members to parliament  the royal burghs are one entire body governed by and accountable to one general court called the convention of burrows which is annually held generally at edinburgh and have cognizance of all matters relating to the trade and interest of all the burghs in general  regalities are fews granted by the king to some particular subjects whose authority and jurisdiction are very large and extensive both in civil and criminal cases and the lord or his baillie has not only the power of furca and fossa pit and gallows but a jurisdiction with the magistrate in civilibus  as to burghs of barony every one that holds a barony of the crown has a court wherein lesser causes both civil and criminal are tried etc  the commissariot courts are a kind of ecclesiastical courts the commissaries of edinburgh who are four particularly try causes of matrimony and adultery in order to a plenary divorce not only a thoro and mensa but even a vinculo matrimonii so that the innocent party may marry as if the offending party were naturally dead  the court of admiralty is a supreme court in all the causes competent to its own jurisdiction and the lord highadmiral is the kings lieutenant and justicegeneral upon the seas and in all ports harbors and creeks of the same and upon fresh water and navigable rivers below the first bridge or within floodmark and no appeal lies to the court of session for maritime matters all maritime causes crimes faults trespasses quarrels etc are triable before the lordadmirals judge for he himself never judges in person by the civil law and customs of scotland nevertheless there are some particular jurisdictions of admiralty hereditary in some great families as the duke of argyll who is admiral of the western isles the earl of sutherland of the shire of that name the earl of morton of orkney and zetland etc and such men of war as come up the firth of forth for guarding and securing the coasts receive orders from the lordprovost of edinburgh  by the  th of queen anne justices of peace are established in scotland with the same authority as those in england  xiv a short view of the acts of parliament of great britain that have made any

act are complied with  xv brief observations on the preceding xiv articles with the division of scotland into shires etc from the foregoing particulars you will perceive sir that this part of the united kingdom is far from being so inconsiderable a country as some would have it thought who know nothing of the matter and give themselves the license of making national reflections an ungenerous vice to which the english are but two much addicted as well with regard to this as a neighboring kingdom and a still nearer principality you will observe that there are but few things wanting to make scotland as populous and as full of trade shipping and wealth in proportion as most if not the best counties in england those few things indeed are very difficult if not impossible to be obtained as things stand particularly   a change in the disposition of the common people from a desire of traveling abroad to an industrious and diligent application to labor at home   stock and substance to encourage that application sloth is not a disease of the nation the scots are as diligent as industrious as apt for labor and business and as capable of it when they are abroad as any people in the world and why should they not be so at home no doubt they would if they had suitable encouragement   some little alterations in their method of husbandry by which their lands would be improved and the produce thereof turn to better account of all which something shall be said in my progress through the country as occasion offers   if vassalage servi and other bastenures or holdings of l lgally altered and the superiors obliged by law to sell or accept of a valuable consideration for their feuds and superiorities this has been in a great measure effected by virtue of the acts for disarming the highlanders etc see p          if they were more accustomed to leases for years or lives such tenants and leaseholders would be better enabled and encouraged to improve the ground than otherwise they are or can be   if the court resided and parliaments were held sometimes in scotland or near it which would save a great deal of money now spent in journeys to london and attending a long time there which if individuals find their account in is nevertheless a loss to the whole   in the mean time i shall endeavor to show what scotland really is and what it might be if those engagements were fulfilled which were promised to them before the union such as erecting manufactures under english direction embarking stocks from england to carry on trade employing hands to cut down their northern woods and to bring the fir timber and deals to england of which scotland is able to furnish a very great quantity and lastly encouraging their fishery etc  but leaving its manufacturies and wants to the consideration of those in whose power it is to promote and supply them i shall hasten to conclude this letter but first shall give you an account of the present division of this part of the united kingdom into counties etc  scotland then is divided into    shires or counties and two stewarties which i shall give as follows in alphabetical order though from the nature of my work i cannot observe that method in my future letters shires of   aberdeen   air   argyll   bamf   berwick   bute   caithness   clakmannan   cromarty  0 dumbar    dumfries with the stewarty of annandale    edinburgh or midlothian    elgin    fife    forfar or angus    hadington    inverness    kincardin    kinross  0 lanerk    linlithgow or west lothian    nairn    peebles or twedale    perth    renfrew    ross    roxburgh    selkirk    sterling  0 sutherland    wigtown the stewarties of kirkubright and orkney   and now sir having premised these general things which will save me much repetition in my following letters i will conclude this with assuring you that i am  your humble servant  letter ii containing a description of the merse the two lothians of edinburgh leith etc sir i am just now entered scotland by the ordinary way of berwick which stands on the north side of the river tweed and has a bridge by which it is joined to northumberland it was originally a scots town and is to this day no part of england but has diverse distinct customs and privileges and is mentioned in all statutes and proclamations as a place or liberty of itself distinct from england and wales it was formerly the chief town of the merse which to this day is called the shire of berwick it was often taken from and retaken by the scots but the last time it fell into the english hands which was long before the union of the two crowns in the person of king james vi they fortified it more strongly than it had been formerly and manned it with a sufficient garrison so that all the attempts of the scots to regain it afterward proved ineffectual it is a place of no extraordinary trade though a great thoroughfare it has but one church which is under the jurisdiction of the bishop and in the gift of the dean and chapter of durham  as soon as we get out of the town we enter on scots ground though in times of war it used to be part of what was called debateable land and on that account but thinly inhabited for the borderers of each kingdom often made inroads on one another notwithstanding that a great number of men at an incredible trouble and expense kept watch every night besides which there were watchtowers all along the borders at proper distances and several laws relating to the borders made by commissioners from both kingdoms  the first thing we observed was the sea on the right hand and the river tweed which fetches a reach northward on the left the land between lies so high that in stormy weather it is very bleak and unpleasant having little or no shelter however the land compared to what we left in northumberland or what we soon found farther in scotland is good  the first town in scotland is mordington a poor sorry village yet gives the title of lord to a branch of the noble family of douglas the present lord lives in england and is so well known that i need say no more of him  from the brow of a very high and steep hill we had a large view into scotland but we were welcomed to it by such a gust of wind that it obliged us to quit our horses in real apprehension of being blown off besides the wind blowing full north and the road turning toward the same quarter it blew directly in our faces i can truly say i never was sensible of so exceeding keen and sharp a cold for it pierced our very eyes so that we could scarcely keep them open  when we went down the hill the first town we came to is almost as perfectly scots as if you were an hundred miles north of edinburgh and there is very little appearance of any thing english there either in customs habits usages of the people or in their way of living eating or behavior and there are very few english familes to be found among them  on the contrary you have in england abundance of scots men scots customs words habits and usages nay even the buildings in the towns and villages all over northumberland imitate the scots witness their building their houses with the stairs going up to the second story on the outside of the house that one family may live below and another above without going in at the same door which is the scots way of living as you may see in alnwick wirkworth and several other towns witness also their setting their corn in great numbers of small stacks without doors not making use of barns but only a particular building which they call a barn though no more than a threshingfloor into which they rake one of these small stacks at a time and thresh it out  the first town is called ayton from the small river ay on whose bank it stands the church was ruinous and quite destitute of a roof the heritors being of different opinions contributed not a little to the dilapidation such as were episcopally inclined were very backward in contributing their share and the presbyterians thought it hard the whole should lie upon them so that between the two the roof fell to the ground however the minister preached in a barn to the generality of the parishioners and such as were otherwise inclined heard episcopal ministers in the houses of some of the neighboring gentry  about three miles farther east is a small harbor with a town called eymouth aymouth or haymouth where a fort was formerly raised to curb the garrison of berwick this town gave title of baron to the late duke of marlborough but the patent being granted only to him and the heirsmale of his own body the honor extinguished with him it is a good fishingtown and affords a good harbor for fishingvessels in queen elizabeths time the french held it and fortified it as it was the first port in scotland they could safely land their supplies at for the queen mother but they were obliged to quit that and the kingdom some time after by a treaty queen elizabeth supporting the reformers against her  from this bridge we enter upon a most desolate and in winter frightful moor for travelers especially strangers called coldingham moor upon which for about eight miles you hardly see a hedge or a tree and you meet with but one house all the way and that not a house of entertainment  coldingham whence this moor derives its name was an old monastery built by edgar king of scotland about the year   00 and famous for its lady abbess ebba of whom they tell us the following story  this lady was the daughter of edelfred king of northumberland and when her father was taken prisoner by the pagan mercians she got into a boat in the humber with three other women and by their own prayers only were miraculously preserved and carried as far as scotland where under a promontory they were driven on shore by a storm and their boat dashed in pieces  when they got ashore they labored with their hands and made themselves a little hut to lodge in they continued their religious way of living and the country people sustained them with food till at length acquiring a great character by their sanctity and austerity they were addressed to far and near for their prayers and by the charity of the people got enough to build a religious house at coldingham  here as fame says when the cruel danes came on shore the religious lady who it seems was very beautiful too cut off her nose and upper lip and made all her nuns do the same in order to preserve their chastity whereupon the barbarous danes enraged at their zeal fired their nunnery and burnt them all alive from this lady who it is said was sainted for these sufferings the promontory where she landed is to this day called st ebbes head and vulgarly by our sailors st tabbes there was once upon the point of this promontory a strong fort called fastcastle belonging to the earl of hume but it has been some time demolished  a little to the northwest is the town and castle of duns remarkable for the birth of john duns scotus anno      some of whose family are still in being there he was a friar minor and the greatest scholar of his age scaliger says there was nothing his genius was not capable of but his chief study was in points more nice than necessary whereupon he was called doctor subtilis his followers called scotists were great opposers of the thomists another set of scholasticks so named from thomas aquinas he studied at oxford and paris and died of an apoplexy at cologn after berwick was taken by the english the sheriffcourt was kept here which was but lately removed to a market town called greenlow which is also a royal burgh and the principal in the shire belonging to the earl of marchmont  duns was also remarkable for the encampment of the scottish army under general lesley assembled to oppose king charles i when he came to the english borders with an army to persuade that kingdom to obedience it has the best weekly market for cattle in scotland and is a place of the best trade in this county  coldstream is also a market town in this county of merse where was anciently an abbey eccles likewise had another and ersilton is noted for the birthplace of the rhyming poet lermouth so much admired by the vulgar scots hume was formerly the residence of the earls of that name which they derived from the town and they had a strong castle there now demolished  the inconsiderate vanity of the ancient scottish gentry and nobility of deriving their names from the places of their residence had this inconvenience attending it that in a few generations it lost the old name of the family from which these changelings may i without affront call them descended thus the dunbars and humes originally the same came to be thought two distinct ones in like manner the gordons swintons ridpaths nisbets and the spotswoods as some say though all of the same original must have lost the knowledge of it had it not been for tradition or the armorial bearings of the several families which bespeak them to be of the same lineage this hint may serve once for all as to those families called of that ilk i e whose surname and paternal estate are the same and are generally esteemed ancient and honorable  the county of merse or march formerly gave title of earls of march to the family of dunbar who according to camden derived their origin from the famous gospatrick earl of northumberland who retired into scotland on the norman conquest and was honored with the earldom of march and castle of dunbar by the then king malcolm canmore whence his posterity took the name while another branch being possessed of the barony of hume assumed that for their surname which they still retain george de dunbar being proscribed in the reign of james i of scotland the title of earl of march was conferred on the duke of albany then on the family of stewart and lenox which being extinct king william iii conferred it on william douglas brother of the duke of queensbury whose son now enjoys it  having passed over coldingham moor called also lambermoor the lowlands of eastlothian show themselves from the top of a steep hill and give a prospect of a fruitful and pleasant country as soon as we come down the hill there is a village called cockburnspath or cobberspath where nature forms a very steep and difficult pass and where a thousand men well armed and boldly doing their duty could keep out a very great army if there was occasion for it  the next shire is that of eastlothian and the first house of any note we met with in it was that of dunglass the seat of sir james hall we began here to see that scotland was not naturally so barren as some people represent it but might be made equal even to the richest most fruitful most pleasant and best improved part of england if the scots had the same methods of doing it and were as good husbandmen as the english and this might easily be brought to pass would the gentry set about it as this gentleman has in part already done  the truth is the soil hereabout is very good and the seaware as they call the weeds which the sea casts up abundantly supplies the defect of marl chalk or limestone for by laying this continually on the land they plough every year without letting it lie fallow as we do and i found they had as much corn as our ploughmen express it as could stand upon the ground  the next town of note is dunbar a royal burgh which in scotland is much the same with what we call a corporation in england and sends members to parliament in like manner only in scotland these burghs have some particular privileges separate to themselves as that for example of holding a sort of parliament called a convention of burghs a method taken from the union of the hans towns in the north in which they meet and concert measures for the public good of the towns and of their trade and make bylaws or acts and declarations which bind the whole body not have they lost this privilege by the union with england but it is preserved entire and is now many ways more advantageous to them than it was before as their trade is like to be in time more considerable but this i have taken notice of in another place  this town of dunbar is a handsome well built town situated in the mouth of the river forth on the south side toward the german ocean it is a very considerable port and of great advantage to all ships in the river in case of stress of weather but yet its entrance was so difficult by steep rocks in the mouth of the harbor that the corporation had exhausted itself by endeavoring to cut through them and being unable to proceed further in it and at the same time the townhouse and school of the town being run to decay and the town itself destitute of fresh water to answer all these good purposes they procured an act to pass in the year      entitled an act for laying a duty of  pennies scots or one   th part of a penny upon every pint of ale or beer that shall be sold within the town of dunbar for improving and preserving the harbor and repairing the townhouse and building a school and other public buildings there and for supplying the said town with fresh water  this duty has been of very great service to the town and has enabled them to make a great progress in the intended improvements but the principal works which were to dig up part of a rock at the bottom of the harbor to carry out the great pier to the rock called the beacon rock to cut the slope of the island down to a perpendicular and to supply the town with fresh water remaining undone and the act expiring in the year      the same was continued for    years longer by an act passed  0 geo ii which will it is hoped perfect all that remains undone  they had here a great herringfishery which has decayed very much of late years and they cure herrings here as they do at yarmouth in norfolk though i cannot say they cure them so well nor are they so fit for keeping and sending on long voyages the herrings themselves may indeed make a little difference being generally larger and fatter than those of yarmouth which makes it more difficult to cure them so as to keep in a hot climate and on a long voyage here was formerly a strong castle which was demolished by act of parliament during the minority of king james vi  between the town and the great road stands a little but pleasant and agreeable seat of the duke of roxburgh called broxmouth with a park well planted in vistas and walks for the gentlemen of scotland are now set upon planting foresttrees as well for ornament as profit and here i would give an useful hint to the gentlemen who plant trees in scotland the want of which as i have observed at several great houses and parks in that country is the reason they do not thrive as they might otherwise do and this is by securing the young trees by a triangular frame seven or eight feet high which is made by setting three large stakes about them in an equilateral triangle and tree and all with haybands to defend the bark fastened together at the top then as the tree stands in the center of the triangle which way soever the wind blows the root is not shaken or the earth moved and loosened about it  for want of this the tree being left without support before it has taken root the winds shake it every way and loosen the earth about it so that it gets no time to strike this is the reason why in many of the gentlemens parks i saw the trees stunted and balked though they had been planted many years  on the southwest side of this town under the mountains near a place called dunhill is the field where the battle of dunbar was fought between oliver cromwell and general lesly commander of the scots army where the desperate few for cromwells army was not above  000 men defeated and totally overthrew the great army of the other side killed  000 of them and took  0000 prisoners to the surprise of the world  here we turned out of the way to see the marquis of tweedales fine park at yester or zester in the center of which stands a very noble house but in a too low situation  the old earl of tweedale in the reign of king charles ii having seen the plans of greenwich and st jamess parks was so pleased with them that as soon as he went down into scotland he laid out the plan and design of all those noble walks and forests of trees which he planted here a gentleman whose judgment i can depend upon told me that if ever those trees came to be worth but sixpence apiece they would be of more value than the fee simple of the whole paternal estate of the family nor is this unlikely if it be true that his lordship and his immediate successor planted above  000 acres of land with firtrees and wherever any of them failed they were constantly renewed the next year  the park itself is said to be eight miles round and exceeds in many respects the new park at richmond in surrey but the plantation of fir is not confined to this estate for the family has another seat at pinkey near musselburgh where the same lord planted also a great number of trees as his successors have likewise done at another seat which they have in fife near aberdour  as this planting is a great encouragement to the nobility of scotland to improve their estates by the same method so we find abundance of gentlemen follow the example insomuch that you hardly see a house of note especially in the south parts of this country but is adorned with groves and walks of firtrees about it by which we may reasonably expect that in a little time scotland will have no need to send to norway for timber and deal but will have sufficient of her own and perhaps be able to furnish england too with considerable quantities  from this town of dunbar to edinburgh the country may be reckoned as fruitful pleasant and rich as any in scotland or indeed as most in england the sea is on the right hand at a moderate distance and the hills on the left farther off which are habitable and feed large flocks of sheep and have many open roads leading over them from edinburgh and other parts toward england  the most material thing this country wants is more enclosed pastures by which the farmers would be enabled to keep a sufficient stock of cattle well foddered in the winter and thereby not only be furnished with store of butter cheese and beef for the market but likewise by the dung of the beasts nrich their soil according to the unanswerable maxim in grasing that stock upon land improves land  two other articles would increase and enrich them which they seldom or never practice   folding their sheep within moveable hurdles   fallowing their ploughed land   the first would fatten the ground and the latter destroy the weeds which would be of great service to the land at a distance from the sea where they have not the benefit of seaweed which i have just now mentioned  but at present for want of enclosures they have no winter provision for black cattle and therefore the farmers have no dairies no butter or cheese in any quantity and no heaps of dung in their yards to return upon the land for its improvement thus a good soil is impoverished for want of husbandry  from dunbar we pass another river tyne which to distinguish it from the two tynes in northumberland i shall call scots tyne though not so distinguished here it rises in the hills near yester and watering part of the fine and pleasant vale i mentioned before runs by haddingtoun a royal burgh and an old halfruined town with the remains of an old nunnery it was formerly large handsome and well built and reckoned very strong for besides the walls of stone which were in those times esteemed very good the english fortified it with lines and bastions four of which latter were very large as may be seen by what remains of them to this day it had also a large ditch and was so strong that the english commanded by sir george wilford defended it against a great army of french and scots though his garrison were almost all swept away by the plague till he was relieved from england when he quitted it after demolishing the fortifications  they have a good stone bridge here over the tyne though the river is but small the church was large but has suffered in the ruin of the rest and but part of it is repaired though big enough for the number of inhabitants there are in it some monuments remaining of the duke of lauderdale and other maitlands ancient lords of this part of the country but as the choir of the church is open and defaced they have suffered with the rest  in and about this place i saw something of a manufacture and a face of industry which was the first i had hitherto seen the least appearance of in scotland particularly here was a woollen manufacture erected by a company or corporation for making broadcloth which they call english cloth and as they had english workmen and english wool they really made it very good but i cannot say they could bring it so cheap to the market as they do in england this was the reason that though before the late union the english cloth being prohibited upon severe penalties their own cloth supplied them very well yet as soon as the union was made by which the english trade was opened the clothiers from worcester gloucester wilts somerset and devonshire brought in their goods and underselling the scots those manufacturies were not able to stand it however the people turn their hands to other things are still employed in spinning dying weaving etc and carry on a good deal of that sort of business  on the northside of the mouth of the forth stand the remains of tantallon castle infamous in the scots history for being the seat of rebellion in the reign of king james v hence came the odd fancy among the soldiers that the drums beating the scots march which was invented by the kings soldiers when they marched against the earl of angus who held out this castle against him say ding down tantallon but it is now no more a fortress being entirely demolished  over against this in the mouth of the same river stands a steep rock called the bass inaccessible on all sides except by one narrow passage it was formerly slightly fortified rather to prevent its being made a retreat for pirates and thieves than for any use it could be of to command the sea for the entrance of the forth is so wide that ships can go in and out without the least danger of being hurt by any thing that could be offered from the bass  in the times of the late king charles ii and his brother king james vii it was made a stateprison where the western people called in those days cameronians were confined for being in arms against the king and after the revolution a desperate crew of people got possession of it and having a large boat which they hoisted up upon the rock or let down at pleasure committed several piracies took a great many vessels and held out the last of any place in great britain for king james but their boat being at last either seized or lost and not being seasonably supplied with provisions from france as they used to be they were obliged to surrender  the solan geese are the principal inhabitants of this island a fowl rare as to its kind for they are not found anywhere in britain that i can learn except here in some of the lesser islands in the orcades and in the island of ailzye in the mouth of the clyde they come as certainly at their season as the swallows or woodcocks with this difference if what the people there tell us may be depended on that they generally come exactly to the very same day of the month  they feed mostly on herrings and therefore it is observed they come just before or with them and go away with them likewise though it is evident they do not follow them for they go all away to the north but whither is not known as they live on fish so they eat like fish which together with their being so exceeding fat makes them in my opinion a very coarse dish rank illrelished and soon gorges the stomach but here they are looked upon as a dainty  it is a large fowl rather bigger than an ordinary goose it is webfooted but its bill is pointed like a crane or heron only much thicker and not above five inches long when they are coming they send some before to fix their mansion which for that reason are called scouts the inhabitants are careful not to disturb them till they have built their nests and then they are not to be frightened by any noise whatsoever they lay but one egg at a time which they so dexterously fix by one end to a point of the rock in the middle of the nest that if it be pulled off it is difficult to fix it so any more they hatch it by holding it fast under one foot and seldom leave it till it be hatched the fish caught by the old ones often serve the inhabitants for food and the sticks they bring to make their nests supply them with fuel they make great profit both of the flesh and feathers of their young ones which are taken from their nests by one let down the rock with a rope when young they are of an ash color but when old white  at the top of the rock is a fresh water spring with a small warren for rabbets but the bottom of it is almost worn through by the tide it was formerly the possession and sometimes the seat of the ancient family of lawder who a long time refused to sell it though often solicited to it by several kings king james vi told the then lord he would give him whatever he pleased to ask for it whereby that gentleman had a fine opportunity of making a good bargain but after he had told his majesty that he would sell it upon these terms and the king desiring to know what he would ask he answered your majesty must even resign it to me for i will have the ald craig  i e rock back again however the family at last coming to decay it was purchased by king charles ii  from hence keeping the shore of the forth due west we find a range of large and populous villages all along the coast almost as far as leith  all this part of the country is delightfully spread with the seats of noblemen and gentlemen as the duke of roxburghs near dunbar the earl of haddingtons at tinningham the lord beilhavens at beilhaven and that of the family of dalrymple earl of stair who have fine seats at the burgh of north berwick where there is a small but pretty good market hales and in the neighborhood of this place  the house and estate of dirleton now in the family of nisbet is pleasantly seated in this part of the country as is ormistoun a thriving little town belonging to the family of cockburn round which they have a handsome estate so well planted and improved that i dont remember to have ever seen a more beautiful spot of ground they have also a pretty good seat here but when i saw it it was very much out of repair  i must here add the ancient and noble houses of seton and winton both palaces for so they deserve to be called of the late earl of winton who did so many weak and rash things in the affair of the late rebellion they are now in a state of ruin as is the estate on which they stand which for its value is as fine as any in scotland lying all contiguous with itself and valued at almost  000 l sterling per annum but all being under forfeiture it was sold to the yorkbuildings company the fine gates and stone wall were demolished by the government after it had been made a garrison by the highlanders who from hence began their harebraind march to england which expedition ended at preston the name seton was given the family from the term seton which one of the ancestors of it used to the soldiers he commanded when entering upon an engagement they were reckoned a very gallant as well as loyal family and no true scotsman can well omit telling the memorable story that in the year      when edward ii came before berwick where sir alexander seton was then governor he summoned him to surrender and threatened to hang his two sons whom he had among his hostages if he delayed accordingly a gallows was erected near the town wall and the young men led forth tenderness for his children began to move the governor when his lady of the name of cheyne came and told him he and she were both young enough to have more children but if he surrendered he could never recover his honor upon this he refused and the tyrant cruelly murdered the young gentlemen but the lady was rewarded with two sons afterward  the towns upon this coast as i said stand very thick and there are two or three articles of trade which render them more populous and more considerable than they would otherwise be   there are great quantities of white fish taken and cured all along this coast and i observed that they were very well cured merchantable and fit for exportation   there is great plenty of coal in the hills so near the sea that the carriage is easy a great deal of which is carried to edinburgh and other towns thereabouts   they make very good salt at almost all the towns upon the shore as at seton cockenny prestonpans and several other places they have a very great trade for this salt to norway hamburgh bremen the baltic and even holland and the number of ships loaded with it here yearly is very considerable   they take great quantities of oysters here also with which they not only supply the city of edinburgh but carry abundance of them in large open boats called cobles as far as newcastle upon tyne from whence they generally bring back glass bottles   at several of these villages are little moles and harbors or peers built up at a considerable expense for securing the ships that come to load salt and other goods as at north berwick aberlady preston prestonpans which is also noted for good malt liquor cockenny portseton etc  the country hereabouts is both pleasant and populous and full of gentlemens houses among which is salton belonging to mr fletcher  we came next to musselburgh an ancient burgh of regality in this town are many hands employed in the woollen manufacture especially in coarse stuffs for the use of the poor and they have continued many years successfully this branch of trade without any rival  a little west from this lies fisherraw so called from a very large row of houses mostly inhabited by fishermen who were formerly more numerous here than at present for the muscle trade which was of old reckoned very valuable is now given over and their chief business at present consists in catching cods haddocks whitings and some few shellfish  more to the south are two small villages called newbigging and goodspeedall but they are so nearly joined to musselburgh and fisherraw that a stranger would take them to be all one continued town nevertheless they have not had a church since the reformation but are only a part of the parish of inveresk an adjoining village so called because it stands on the river esk which though it be sometimes so full of water as to overflow its banks yet being rapid it is not made navigable  this village enjoys so good an air that the eminent dr pitcairn called it the montpelier of scotland it is very full of people and there are several very handsome houses and gardens in it which invite the citizens of edinburgh to take lodgings here in the summer as the londoners do at kensingtongravelpits hampstead hackney and highgate  but the glory and beauty of this parish is pinkey which formerly belonged to seton earl of dumfermline but now to the marquis of tweedale who usually resided here before his house at yester was finished which though it be the most magnificent building yet is not so agreeably situated as pinkey which stands near the sea just as we enter into musselburgh  in the court before the house is a large stone well covered with an imperial crown of stone supported by pillars of the ionick order the great hall on the right as you enter is adorned with views of the great cities of italy and in a drawing room adjoining to it is a billiardtable the great staircase on the left is balustraded with iron and crowded with pictures  the first apartment consists of a dining room drawing room and bedchamber all very spacious curiously wainscotted with oak and hung with the seasons in tapestry of the small figures and best sort the bed is of crimson velvet in an alcove neatly supported with pillars the chimneys are of marble and above that of the dining room is painted the finest inside of a church that is anywhere to be seen  the great gallery is very long and spacious the ceiling whereof is full of latin inscriptions suitable to the several paintings here is a family picture of the lord seton with his four sons and daughters by hans holbein mr henderson the covenanter by vandyke the whole length of king charles i and his chancellor the earl of dumfermline in his robes by the same hand the first earl of tweedale with his eight sons and seven daughters all in one picture as big as the life takes up almost one end of the room there are fine altarpieces passionpieces and others of that kind that were saved from plunder out of monasteries at the reformation here is likewise a good picture of the earl of strafford and another of the duke of lauderdale who married his only child to the heir of this family with great numbers of family pictures of the hays and setons there is also well preserved the genealogical tree of the family from the year   0 to this time viz the hays giffards and frazers but many of the pictures have been of late carried to yester  the parterre behind the house is very large and nobly adorned with evergreens and on each side of it spacious gardens the whole stands in a park above three miles in circumference well planted with an incredible number of firtrees and walled round with stone i confess if i had been owner of pinkey i should hardly have built yester for pinkey stands nobly and has a commanding prospect not only over the adjacent country but also of the coast of fife over the sea at nine miles distance whereas yester as i have said lies in a bottom and all its views bounded within itself yester it is true is the ancient seat of the family whose title to pinkey is but late and some say was precarious  near this place was fought a battle by edward seymour duke of somerset when he came to force the scots into the marriage of their young queen mary with his nephew king edward vi which was bytheby a very coarse way of wooing here was a great slaughter of the scots but though the english won the battle yet they lost their prize for the young queen was privately embarked carried to france and afterward married to the dauphin who became king francis ii  the english call this the battle of musselburgh but some scots gentlemen riding out with us to show us the place where the action was begun and ended we all agreed that the scots are in the right who call it the battle of pinkey  i now approached the capital city of edinburgh but must say a word or two of its situation before i enter it standing then at a small distance and taking a view of it from the east you have really but a very confused idea of the city because the situation being in length from east to west and the breadth illproportioned to it you view it under the greatest disadvantage possible whereas if you turn a little to the right hand toward leith you have a very handsome prospect of it and from the south you see it to yet more advantage because it is increased on that side with new streets  at the extremity of the east end of the city stands the palace of holyroodhouse leaving which a little to the left you come through a populous suburb to the entrance called the waterport from hence turning west the street goes on in a strait line through the whole city to the castle it is above a mile in length and is perhaps the largest longest and finest street for buildings and number of inhabitants in the world  from the palace door which stands on a level with the lowest of the plain country the street begins to ascend very gradually being nowhere steep but this ascent being continued for so long a way it is easy to understand that the further part must necessarily be very high for the castle which stands as it were at the extremity west as the palace does east makes on all the three sides that only excepted which joins it to the city a frightful and impassable precipice  together with this continued ascent you are to suppose the edge or top of the ascent so narrow that the street and the row of houses on each side take up the whole breadth so that which way soever you turn you go down hill immediately which is so steep that it is very troublesome to those who have not very good lungs to walk in those sidelanes which they call wynds by this description you will perceive that the city stands upon the narrow ridge of a long ascending mountain  on the northside of the city toward the west end of it where the castle stands is a lough or lake of water which has a small brook that runs through it so that it cannot be said to be quite standing there was formerly another lake on the south side of it which being now filled up is built into a street though so much lower than the high street that as i said before the lanes between them are very steep  the town is so ancient that no history has recorded when by whom or on what occasion it was built yet it seems most natural to conclude that such a situation could not be chosen but for a retreat from the outrages and attempts of the britons saxons danes or other enemies for having an impregnable castle at the west end and a lake on either side the inhabitants had nothing to defend but the entrance at the east end which it was easy to fortify  if this was not the reason for choosing the situation what should have hindered them from building the city in a pleasant delightful valley with the sea flowing up to one side and a river running through the middle of it such as that space of ground between it and the sea where the town of leith stands there they would have had a noble pleasant and most useful situation a very fine harbor for their trade a good road in the firth for their ships of burden a pleasant river which with small art and charge might have been so drawn round the city as to have filled its ditches and made its fortifications almost impregnable as the french did when they fortified leith or had they gone to the south side of the city and extended it toward libertoun and goodtrees they had found a plain large enough to have contained another london watered on the southpart with a pleasant brook capable by the help of pipes to have conveyed water into every street and house  these things they did not foresee or not understand in those days but regarding immediate safety fixed on the hill as a sure strength formed by nature ready at their hand by this means the city lies under such inconveniences as are made a subject of scorn and reproach by some as if the people delighted in stench and nastiness whereas were any other people to live under the same unhappiness of a rocky and mountainous situation a throng of buildings from six to ten stories high a difficulty of obtaining water that little they have being to be carried up to the uppermost apartments we should find a london or a bristol as dirty as edinburgh and perhaps less able to make their dwelling tolerable at least in so narrow a compass for though many cities have more people in them yet i believe there is none in the world where so many people live in so little room  on the northside of the city as i have said is a spacious rich and pleasant plain extending from the lake which joins it to the river of leith at the mouth of which is the town of leith at the distance of a long scots mile here were not the northside of the hill which the city stands on so exceeding steep that it is not only impassable for carriages but can hardly be clambered up on foot and were the lake filled up as that on the other side is the city might have been extended upon the plain below and fine streets would no doubt have been built nay i question much whether in time the high streets would not have been forsaken and the city as i may say run all out of its gates to the north  this might have been the consequence if the city had been in a state of increase for had their trade flourished as was reasonably expected if the business of darien had succeeded or upon the union the inhabitants would have likewise increased  having thus considered the city in its outward appearance and in its situation i must look next into its inside where we shall find it notwithstanding all its discouragements and disadvantages a large populous noble rich and even royal city the main street as above is the most spacious and best inhabited in europe the buildings are surprising for their strength their beauty and their height and are mostly of freestone yet so firm that though they stand so high and in a country where storms and violent winds are so frequent it is very rare and only on such occasions as i shall mention byandby that any damage is done here  from the palacegate westward this street is called the canongate as belonging to the canons of the abbey which is a kind of suburb by itself as southwark is to london in this part of the street though otherwise not so well inhabited as the city itself are several very magnificent houses of the nobility built for their residence when the court was here of these the duke of queensburys the earl of wintons the duke of roxburghs the earl of panmures and the earl of murrays are the chief the first and last are very large and princely buildings all of freestone large in front and have good gardens behind them  at the upper or west end of this street where it joins to the city is a gate which like ludgate parts the city from the suburb but does not discontinue the street which rather widens and is more spacious when you are through the gate than before this is the famous netherbow port whose doors were like to have been taken away by the parliament when the affair of captain porteous was under their consideration as i shall mention more particularly byandby  just at this gate on the outside are two streets one of which is called st mary wynd and the other leith wynd the first leads out of the city south into the great road for england by the way of kelso and at the foot of it is a gate turning westward into the low street called the cowgate because the cattle are driven through it to and from the great marketplace the other leads north into a suburb called the calton from whence there is a very handsome gravelwalk  0 feet broad continued to the town of leith which is kept in repair at the public charge and no horses suffered to come upon it  we now enter the city at the netherbow port and have an open view up the high street it must not be expected i should describe all the buildings of the city i shall therefore touch upon some few and go on the first of any note is a fine house on the south side of the street a little within the gate belonging to the marquis of tweedale with a plantation of limetrees behind it the place not allowing room for a large garden adjoining to this are very good buildings which if set out in handsome streets would adorn a very noble city but being crowded together in narrow wynds and alleys deserve no notice  a little further on the same side is the trone kirk and near it in the middle of the street stands the guardhouse where two companies of disciplined men clothed and armed like grenadiers at the charge of the town do duty every night and keep the public peace of the city  about midway between the netherbow and the castle is the great church which before the reformation was collegiate and dedicated to st gyles but it was afterward divided into several preachingplaces and districts of the city were allotted to them so as to be parochial when king charles i erected a new bishopric at edinburgh which before that time was in the diocese of st andrews it was made a cathedral and the dean was forenoon minister of that part of it called the new kirk which is the choir chancel or eastern part in it is a noble gallery for the king or his commissioner here also the magistrates assemble and the judges in their habits in time of session in a large chapel on the southwest part of this church the general assembly hold their sessions as does also the commission of the assembly in the interval between the general meetings  the great cross under the tower is called the old kirk and the front or westpart of the great church is divided into two parts that on the south is called the tolbooth kirk and that on the north haddos hole from the lord of haddo grandfather to the present earl of aberdeen who being a great royalist and anticovenanter was kept prisoner in a vault there till he was beheaded  the steeple in the middle is very high and of good architecture the summit of it resembles an imperial crown here they have a set of bells which are not rung out as in england for that way of ringing is not known in this country but are played upon by the hand with keys like a harpsichord the person playing having great leather covers to his fists by which he is able to strike with the more force they play all manner of tunes very musically and the town gives a man a yearly salary for playing upon them from half an hour after eleven till half an hour after twelve every day sundays and holidays excepted  on the south side of this church formerly the churchyard is a square of very fine buildings called the parliament close the west and southsides of which are mostly taken up with the parliament house the several courts of justice the council chamger the exchequer the public registers the court for the royal boroughs to assemble in the lawyers library the post office etc the great church makes up the northside of the square and the east and part of the south side is built into private dwellings very stately lofty and strong being seven stories high to the front of the square and the hill they stand on having a very steep descent some of them are no less than fourteen stories high backwards in the middle of this square is an equestrian statue of king charles ii which is reckoned the finest of its kind in europe  the parliament house is a stately convenient and large structure over its entrance are the arms of scotland well cut with mercy and truth on each side for supporters and this inscription stant his felicia regna importing that these virtues make kingdoms happy and under the arms was this motto unio unionum relating not only to the union of the two crowns but signifying that their advice was necessary for the maintenance of it the room for meeting of the parliament had on that occasion a high throne for the sovereign or the commissioner with benches on each side for the nobility and bishops and forms conveniently placed in the middle for the commoners without the area was a pulpit for sermons to the parliament on particular occasions and behind the pulpit a large partition for others besides members to hear the sermons and debates of the house when they thought fit to allow it this building in some measure resembles westminster hall and though not quite so large has a much more curious roof in the south or upperend one of the ordinary judges sits every week in sessiontime to hear causes in the first instance but when the parliament sat that court was removed to another part of the hall at the west end of it are kept the sheriff and commissary courts near the northend is the town councilhouse or guild hall and over it is the justciary or criminal court at the southeast part of the parliament house is a door from what they call the outerhouse where the lord ordinary sits into the inner where sit the other fourteen judges or lords of session which is the supreme civil judicature of scotland over which are apartments for the lords of exchequer and for the privy council when in being  in the lowerpart under the parliament house is a noble library of books and mss belonging to the college of justice or gentlemen of the law  near the council chamger stands the royal exchange made up of a double row of shops and another exchange inferior to this  the great opening into the high street being the only passage into it for coaches is at the northeast corner a little from which is the marketcross where all their proclamations and public acts are read and published by heralds and sound of trumpet here is the great parade where gentlemen meet for business or news as at the exchange every day from eleven to one  near the west end of the great church stands the tolbooth or common prison as well for criminals as for debtors it was formerly the place of residence for the provost of st gyless as most of the adjacent houses were for the canons and choiristers of that church  the great church and this prison both standing in the middle of the street the breadth and beauty of it is for some space interrupted but those buildings past the street opens again to its former breadth and is now called the lawnmarket from the linenmarket being kept here this part of the street extends west to a narrower one which leads to the castlehill at the upperend of it is a stone building appropriated to several public offices of lesser value called the weighhouse for below stairs are warehouses with public weights and scales for weighing heavy goods  here the high street parts into two one of which leads to the castle hill as already noticed and the other turns southwest and descending gradually leads to the grassmarket a place very like smithfield in every respect where is kept a weekly market for black cattle sheep horses etc this street which is called the westbow is inhabited mostly by wholesale dealers in iron pitch tar oil hemp flax linseed drugs woads and suchlike heavy goods  this city has seven gates or ports as they are here called viz   the netherbow port this is the chief gate it was magnificently built in   0  and adorned with towers on both sides this is the entrance from the palace and the principal suburb called the canongate   the cowgate port at the east end likewise gives entrance to the street of that name leading to the abbey by a backway   the potterrow port gives entrance to the suburb so called and leads to dalkeith kelso etc southward   the society port called so from the society of brewers who have a great square court near it with stately houses and buildings round it   the west port the only gate at the west end of the city which leads through a large suburb to glasgow sterling queensferry and from thence to the west and north highlands   the new port at the east end of the lake leading northward toward a village called mouters hill and leith   the collegekirk port leading also to leith   the markets here are very well supplied with all the necessaries of life and are mostly kept in distinct marketplaces walled in and reserved for the particular things they are appointed for such as   the meal market   the flesh market   the poultry market   the fish market   the corn market   the leather market   besides these there is a weekly market for all sorts of woollen manufactures and linen cloth kept in that part of the high street called the lawn market just now mentioned there is also in the same street below the cross an herb and fruit market kept every morning but abates before noon so that it is no encumbrance the market for black cattle sheep horses and grass is kept in that large space of ground within the west port called the grass market as i have already mentioned  on the south side of the city toward the east end stands a large building erected at the charge of the surgeons and apothecaries of this city in which is their great hall hung round with the pictures of all the surgeons of this place that have been since this building was founded here they have also a theater for dissections and a chamber of rarities in which there are several skeletons of uncommon creatures a mummy and other curiosities  near the potterrow port stands the college or university it consists of three courts two lower and one higher equal to the other two these courts are encompassed with neat buildings for the use of such students as please to lodge in them for they dont live in common nor are they obliged to reside but only to attend their classes at certain hours there is a high tower over the great gate looking to the city  the public schools are large and commodious there are accommodations for students handsome dwellings for the professors and fine gardens for their recreation it was founded in    0 by king james vi upon a petition from the city to grant them a charter with the privilege of an university but the foundation was not perfected till      the persons established by the foundation were a principal or primate a professor of divinity four regents or masters of philosophy and a professor of philology called prof humaniorum literarum or regent of humanity in    0 the town added a professor of mathematics to which have been lately added professors of ecclesiastical history civil law theoretical and practical medicine chemistry etc the dignity of chancellor and vice chancellor of the university is in the lordprovost and town council  they have a very good library which was founded by clement little one of the commissaries of edinburgh since which it is much increased by donations from the citizens persons of quality and others who had their education there the library is neatly kept well furnished with books put in very good order cloistered with wire doors which none but the keeper can open which is more commodious and less encumbering than multitudes of chains commonly used in other libraries the books given by the grand benefactors are kept in distinct apartments and the donors name over them in letters of gold  over the books hang the pictures of several princes and of the most eminent reformers at home and abroad and near them is kept the skull of the famous buchanan very entire and so thin that the light may be seen through it it was deposited there by mr adamson formerly principal of the university who procured it to be taken out of his grave and fastened some latin verses to it in commendation of that celebrated historian there is also the original of the bohemian protest against the council of constance for burning john hus and jerome of prague anno      with  0  seals of bohemian and moravian grandees annexed to it it was procured by a scots gentleman in his travels and given to the university  under the library was the kings printing house for bibles etc at the farther end of the library is a staircase which leads to the higher and lower common halls where they hold their commencements and college entertainmenrs in this place are several maps globes books and rarities and among others a crooked horn cut out of a womans head when fifty years old and who lived twelve years after it it is several inches long and was taken out of her head by a surgeon anno      here also are lectures read exercises performed and apartments for the professor of divinity to teach his pupils in and for a select library proper for divines  in this higher common hall which is a very spacious room are placed such books as have been bought by or given to the college since the library below was full and in the southend of it is a curious and noble museum collected by the very eminent sir andrew balfour who was once tutor to the famous earl of rochester it contains a vast treasure of curiosities of art and nature domestic and foreign from almost all parts of the world and is greatly valued by the virtuosos containing some rarities that are not to be found either in those of the royal society at london or the ashmolean at oxford sir robert sibbald having a mind to engraft his name and merit on that of the celebrated balfour made a present of a great number of shells and other curiosities to the college on condition the magistrates would print the account of it called auctarium musei balfouriani e museo sibbaldiano to which i refer the reader  eastward from the college is the highschool well endowed and with proper apartments for one master and four ushers who teach youth grammar and rhetoric  in graysclose near the cowgate port is the minthouse in a large court with neat and convenient buildings and other accommodations for the master officers and workmen it is now disused for that purpose and is a sanctuary or place of privilege  at a small distance from the college are two neat hospitals with pretty gardens to each of them and a little further is the churchyard of the franciscans or gryfriars the common burialplace for the whole city within the walls where are a great many fine and curious monuments it contains about two acres of ground  adjoining to it is heriots hospital a large and stately building the most magnificent of its kind in the world adorned with a consecrated chapel large walks delightful greens and pleasant gardens it was built by the rev dr balcanqual to whom george heriot jeweller to king james vi left near   000 pounds to be disposed of in pious uses which that worthy dean did by building and endowing this house and giving statutes to it which he ordered should be unalterable it is a nursery for an indefinite number of the sons of freemen who are maintained clothed and educated in useful learning till they are fit for apprenticeships or to go to the university where they are allowed handsome salaries and exhibitions  on the south side of the city in the way to leith is a beautiful collegiate church built by queen mary of guelders queen to king james ii and dedicated to the holy trinity but now parochial though nothing but the church part was ever finished  near it is st thomass hospital wherein old decayed citizens and their widows are very decently provided for and allowed a chaplain  over against it is bridewell or the house of correction in which dissolute people undergo discipline and are kept to hard labor there is an apartment in it for lunatic and distracted persons  of late years mrs hare left a noble benefaction for a new hospital for female orphans of decayed freemen which created a laudable emulation in many others whose united contributions have raised another for the same good purpose  an infirmary called the royal infirmary after the example of those at london winchester etc has been lately erected at edinburgh by the liberal contribution of many welldisposed persons and there was so general a good will to the work that the like spirit has hardly ever been known anywhere the proprietors of several stonequarries made presents of stone to it others of lime merchants contributed timber the wrights and masons were not wanting in their contributions the neighboring farmers agreed to carry materials gratis the journeymen masons contributed their labor for a certain quantity of hewn stones and as this undertaking is for the relief of the diseased lame and maimed poor even the daylabourers would not be exempted but conditioned to work a day in a month gratis to the erection the ladies too contributed in their own way to it for they appointed an assembly for the benefit of the work and it being wellattended every one contributed bountifully to it it has met with no small encouragement from the nobility and gentry and his majesty was pleased to give  00 l toward it so that it is really a noble work and is now in a flourishing condition the following is the inscription on the first stone the royal infirmary at edinburgh founded aug        earl cromarty g m  another necessary charity was setting on foot as a correspondent writes me word in a letter dated edinburgh july       0 and it is to be hoped will be attended with the desired success the following is an abstract of the letter amongst the several pious and commendable designs which have of late years been formed for the relief of the helpless and forlorn pity it  that one case as claimant as any viz the incurables has hitherto escaped public no thse poor creatures have in common with the others abovementioned every thing that can move sympathy being equally destitute of health subsistence and care but with this one distinguishing aggravation of their calamity that they are without hope which is the finishing stroke of distress and changes misfortune into misery when the learned in physic and surgery have pronounced their diseases desperate and irremediable and when upon that account they have been set out of the infirmary or refused admittance into it as being without compass of the power of medicine or skill of the physician to recover them many of them have no houses of their own where they may languish out the tedious remains of a comfortless life so that if they do not soon die in the streets or fields they must wander to places where they can have neither ministers nor physicians to bring them that assistance and those softenings which may make unavoidable death more easy and happy to them  the consideration of this moving case being suggested at a late meeting of some persons in edinburgh they touched with compassion of their fellow creatures in such dismal circumstances and thankful for the goodness of god to themselves in preserving them from such distress judged it worthy of attention and proposed to raise by subscription a fund for this charitable use to be under the guardianship and administration of the governors of the orphanhospital at edinburgh    what will be done in this case i cannot judge but my friend has set it forth with so much honest warmth and good sense that nothing need be added to it to show the necessity of so excellent a design  the physicians were incorporated in      by king charles ii and have their college near the netherbow in the fountainclose they are deservedly esteemed learned and able and give not place to the physicians of any country the late dr pitcairn has left behind him ample testimonies of his skill in nature and medicine and bore a character that no man of his time abroad or at home eclipsed  on the northside of the city is an excellent physickgarden containing some thousands of exotic plants and simples the late learned and industrious mr james sutherland its then intendant published an account of it in      under the title of hortus medicus edinburgensis they are all disposed into the most rational method according to that of the learned dr morison the late oxford botanist a native of scotland  the city is governed by a lordprovost whose office is much the same as that of the lord mayor of london four bailiffs who besides the power of aldermen in the government of this city have that of sheriffs and a common council ordinarily consisting of twentyfive persons but extraordinarily of thirtyeight all these are chosen annually and the provost dean of guild and treasurer are to be merchants or if any tradesman be chosen he must quit his trade and not return to it without leave of the magistrates and towncouncil and he must also be a year or two a member of the common council no one is to continue in the council above two years at a time except he be a member of it by virtue of a superior office the bailiffs are to be chosen indifferently out of twelve candidates proposed and none is to be elected deacon of any of the fourteen incorporated trades except he has been master of his trade two years at least and must not continue deacon above two years at a time the fourteen incorporated trades are surgeons goldsmiths skinners farriers hammermen wrights masons tailors bakers butchers cordwainers weavers wakers i e fullers bonnetmakers the magistrates are chosen annually upon the tuesday next after michaelmasday by thirtyeight electors whereof twenty are to be merchants and tradesmen who are to choose such as in their conscience they think best qualified and these magistrates and the towncouncil have the administration of the government except in some reserved cases as the election of magistrates dean of guild and treasurer and setting of fews or leases giving boundaries and places and other public matters in which cases they are to consult the fourteen deacons of trades  none of the merchants or traders are to have any particular conventions or make any bylaws among themselves without consent of the magistrates and towncouncil except to choose their own deacons at the appointed time to make persons free of their trade or to try their work and one of the commissioners for parliament was always to be chosen out of the tradesmen and another out of the merchants the auditors of accounts are to be chosen out of an equal number of both the lordprovost dean of guild and treasurer are not to continue longer than two years at a time and the bailiff must be one year a bailiff one year old bailiff and one year free of office before the union the lordprovost for the time being was always one of the privy council  the trained bands of the city consist of sixteen companies besides which they have a standing company of town guards  and here it will be proper to take notice of the notorious riot committed in this city on the  th of sept      in relation to capt porteous which made so much noise and brought down upon this famous city the resentment of the legislature of great britain  the case was this one andrew wilson was condemned for a robbery of the public money committed on the highway and on wednesday the   th of april      the day appointed for his execution the magistrates being apprehensive that a rescue would be attempted ordered capt john porteous at the head of a detachment of the city guard to attend the execution and powder and ball were delivered to them for that purpose that while wilson was hanging the populace insisting he should be cut down before the usual time and being refused attempted to do it by force and meeting opposition from the captain and his guard they outrageously pelted them with stones and hurt several of the detachment that hereupon the captain ordered them as he was accused but which he denied to fire and upon the mob continuing their insults and the captains men firing over their heads to intimidate them the captain ordered them to level their pieces and fired himself both which however he denied and by that means six persons were mortally wounded and fourteen others very desperately maimed and hurt that hereupon the captain was brought to his trial and on a very solemn hearing was found guilty of firing a gun himself and ordering his men to fire and so was condemned to be hanged upon a gibbet on the  th of sept      the captain drew up a petition to her late majesty then regent of the kingdom in the absence of the king and insisted on his innocence praying for mercy and great application having been made to her majesty for changing the sentence to transportation a reprieve for six weeks was granted which arriving on the  d of september at edinburgh occasioned the most extraordinary riot that ever was known or heard of all circumstances considered except that at york against the jews mentioned in its place  for on the  th of september the night before the captain was to be executed had he not been reprieved about ten at night some men by surprise entered the city seized all the firearms battleaxes and drums belonging to the city guard  the mob hereupon in a few minutes locked and secured all the city gates and with drums beating an alarm attempted with hammers and other instruments to force open the  tolbooth prisondoor but failing they desperately set fire to it and burnt it when they entered the prison they made the underkeeper open the double locks of the apartment where the captain was he begged in vain to be spared till the afternoon and making some resistance they dragged him down stairs by his legs and hurried him away this was about eleven at night and they marched out with lights before them in their way to the grassmarket passing by a barbers signpost some called out to hang him up there but it was resolved to hang him where the murders for which he was condemned were committed so they proceeded to the place where on executions the gallows used to be fixed where they kept him above a quarter of an hour till they opened a shop and brought out a rope one end of which they threw over a signpost about  0 feet high he desired some time to prepare for death but was answered they would allow him no more than those had who were shot they then pulled him up in the dress in which they found him viz a nightgown and cap his hands not being tied he fixed them betwixt his neck and the rope whereupon one with a battleax struck at his hands they then let him down and he having on two shirts they wrapped one of them about his face and tied his arms with his nightgown and then pulled him up again where he hung next morning till daylight when he was cut down and carried to the greyfryars church upon inspecting his body it appeared his leftshoulder was wounded his back discolored and his neck broke he denied his giving orders to fire with his last breath  it was observed that this mob was under a stricter concert and better conduct than usual for marching along to the execution the unhappy man observing a gentleman of his acquaintance he gave him a purse of twentythree guineas which he desired might be delivered to his brother which they offered not to obstruct they left indeed the prisondoors open whereby several prisoners escaped but after they had perpetrated the unprecedented fact they left the arms and drums at the place of execution where they were found next morning moreover during the tumult parties of armed men with drums patrolled in the different streets to prevent any surprise from the kings forces quartered in the suburbs the magistrates attended with several of the burgesses attempted as was said to disperse the mob but were pelted with stones and threatened with firearms if they did not retire after the execution was over they went to the lordprovosts house and telling him they were satisfied departed without offering any other violence nay it was said that to do the act with more decency having no clergyman they ordered two of the gravest among them to exhort the unhappy man as they carried him to execution  the boldness secrecy and conduct of this enterprise was the most extraordinary instance of its kind that ever was known and the keeper declaring that though the persons who first entered and demanded the keys wore leather aprons but were otherwise well dressed it made some imagine that persons above the vulgar rank had a hand in it  be this as it would the insult on the sovereign authority was too flagrant to be overlooked proclamations with rewards of  00 l sterling were issued for apprehending the rioters and when the parliament met vigorous measures were taken in the affair the lordprovost was ordered up to london in custody the magistrates were ordered up also to attend the house of lords at london and finally an act of parliament was passed to disable alexander wilson esquire from holding or enjoying any office of magistracy in edinburgh or great britain a new provost was enjoined to be chosen and a fine of two thousand pounds levied upon the city of edinburgh for the use of the widow of captain porteous as punishments for their respective remissnesses in not endeavoring to prevent this insult on sovereignty and all lawful authority  this act however passed not without great debates and as some thought it impossible to prevent a design so well concerted and so suddenly and boldly executed they were of opinion that the city of edinburgh was treated with too much severity but after all it could not be expected but that the legislature should show the highest indignation against so insolent a riot  this act was passed in the  0th year of his majesty and in the same session was also passed another for the more effectual bringing to justice any persons concerned in this strange attempt in which fugitives not surrendering were made liable to death the concealing of those who should be declared fugitives was also made death this act was to be read before morning sermon in every church of scotland every sunday for a year impeachers were to be encouraged and discharged informers rewarded with  00 l sterling for every person they should convict and be admitted witnesses  but so secretly was this dark affair managed that i dont remember any body has suffered on the account and the reading of the act was but indifferently digested by many in that kingdom  greater severity was intended such as the imprisoning as well as disqualifying the lordprovost for a year for abolishing the townguard of the city of edinburgh and for taking away the gates of the netherbow port and keeping open the same but the city of edinburgh was happily saved from this disgrace  it is now time to return to our subject  the churches in this populous city and suburbs are twelve including the chapel of the castle the ministers about twenty besides three chapels  the twelve churches are   the canongate kirk   the collegiate or college kirk   the trone kirk or christs kirk all these are parts of the cathedral of st gyless   the new kirk   the old kirk   the tolbooth kirk   haddos hole kirk   the lady yesters kirk   0 the greyfriers kirk now divided into two    the west kirk or st cuthberts    the chapel of the castle   there are also about twenty meeting houses of the episcopal party for though presbytery be the established religion of scotland since the revolution yet a great number of the people of all ranks are not of that opinion especially in the nothern parts  the churches are always very full for the people in this country do not wander about on the sabbath days as in england they have also one very good custom as to their behavior in church which i wish was practiced in england if any person comes in after divine service is begun he takes no notice of any body nor any body of him whereas we make our bows and cringes even in the middle of our prayers not that the scots want manners for they show them more properly after the sermon is done and the blessing given when they all look round upon their friends especially to persons of distinction and make their civilities as courteously as we do  the city is encompassed with a kind of roman wall on every side except the north where it is secured by a lake  the castle only and the palace remain to be mentioned the first is strong both by situation and art but far from being impregnable as has been experienced more than once it was formerly called the maiden castle because the pictish kings kept their daughters in it still more anciently it was called alatum castrum or the winged castle perhaps from its form and standing on so high a hill as it were in the air it is situated at the west end of the city as we have said where the rock rises to a high and large summit it is inaccessible on the south west and north the entrance is from the town where the rock is also very high and is defended by a round battery and an outwork at the foot of it in the castle is a royal palace of hewn stone where are kept the regalia and chief records of state as also the magazine for the arms and ammunition of the nation  a chapel is also in it for the use of the garrison and it is furnished with water by two wells in the rock from the castle is a delightful prospect over the city and neighboring country and to the river of forth from whence it is saluted by such men of war as come to anchor in leith road the governor is always a person of prime quality and general of the forces  the governor lieutenant governor fortmajor and some other officers have very good apartments and there are deep vaults in the rock which they say are bombproof  the palace called holyroodhouse is a very handsome building rather convenient than large the entrance is majestic and over the gate is a large apartment which the duke of hamilton claims as hereditary keeper of the palace within this is a large irregular court where are coachhouses and stables which i think are very improperly placed here for if they had stood farther off either in the park or without the outgate and a barrack or guardhouse like the horseguards at white hall built in their stead it would have been much more becoming a royal palace  this may be called the escurial of scotland being both a royal palace and an abbey founded by king david i for canons regular of st austin who named it holyroodhouse the entrance from the great outer court already described is adorned with pillars of hewn stone under a cupola in the form of an imperial crown balustraded on each side atop the forepart has two wings on each of which are two turrets that toward the north was built by king james v whose name it bears in letters of gold and that toward the south as well as all the rest by king charles ii whereof sir william bruce was architect the inner court is very stately all of freestone well hewed with piazzas round it from which there are entries into the several apartments truly royal and magnificent but above all the long gallery is very remarkable being adorned with the pictures of all the scots kings from fergus i to james vii inclusive by masterly hands those kings that were eminent and all the race of stuarts are in full length the others are but bustos  you turn to the right to the royal apartments as at st jamess and the staircase and guardroom run exactly as there but far more lofty and magnificent duke hamiltons apartment as hereditary keeper is in the double tower to the north and the great council chamber in the tower to the south the earl of perth when chancellor in the late king jamess reign converted this noble room into a popish chapel and his apartment behind it was the jesuits school which being demolished by the mob at the revolution has been neglected ever since the chimneypieces are all of marble and the apartments two pair of stairs for the officers of state are very well kept being lent to many of the nobility who now live in them  behind this palace the conventual church makes a wing to the north and eastward from it is st annesyard which was designed to be branched out into gravelwalks adorned with statues but the revolution coming on attended with a long and expensive war and afterward the union with england prevented its being put in execution  the church is very high to the roof and the pillars are as exquisite as those of st georges chapel at windsor it is an ancient very reverend but declining fabric and used only as a burialplace for persons of quality in it king james vi was crowned by bishop hepburn assisted by john knox as was king charles i by archbishop spotswood  king james vii began to erect a magnificent throne here for the sovereign and twelve stalls for the twelve knights companions of the most noble and ancient order of st andrew or the thistle which he had revived after a long disuse the finest carvers and other masters in europe were employed in it but at the revolution the rabble demolished all and ransacking every corner fell upon a vault quite built up so as not to be known what it certainly was in which were found the bodies of king james v and magdalene of valois his first queen together with lord darnleys all embalmed and preserved in pickle whereby the malice of buchanan and others to blacken queen marys memory was discovered for she gave him a royal funeral suitable to his high dignity and did not carry him by porters privately to a common burialplace as that author had asserted  the adjoining park is about four miles in circumference but which is very odd there is neither deer nor tree in it and though it be very mountainous affords good pasture for cattle there is a very high and craggy rock in it near half a mile to the top called arthurs seat from arthur the british king who they say used to view the adjacent country from thence  this palace or abbey and park is sanctuary for debtors and no one but by the kings order only can arrest any man who has entered his name in an office kept there for that purpose  it may not be amiss to observe that according to several acts of parliament diverse great public works have been undertaken and mostly brought to perfection for the benefit of the city of edinburgh and town of leith and their vicinities within these few years past by benefit partly of the easy scottish tax of twopence scots on every scots pint of ale and beer sold in the said city and partly of the discontinuance of what they called the pettyportcustoms there some of which works are as follow  the magistrates have at a great expense collected the springs and renewed the pipes which convey water to the town rebuilt the fountains in the high street enlarged the harbor of leith and deepened its chanel have built several hundred feet of key there in a very sufficient manner have built two new churches have paved at a great expense with causeystone the whole highstreets and ways leading to their city have made a good highway from edinburgh to leith have built a large workhouse for the poor to be employed in manufacture and endowed the same with  00 l per annum also have settled salaries on the law professor at edinburgh and stipends on the ministers of the two new churches have rebuilt the city walls and taken measures for paying their old debts as well as those incurred on account of the rebellion in       they further proposed also by means of this fund to narrow the noxious lake on the northside of the city commonly called the north loch into a canal of running water to erect a street of communication to the fields on the northside of the city to build a proper hall for the court of justiciary and an edifice for the public records to establish a salary to a professor of civil history and greek and roman antiquities another to a professor of scots law and other publickspirited purposes and all this is provided for and established by an act which passed   george i anno      confirming and continuing a scottish act of parliament      and an act of   george i to which act of   george i we refer the reader  i shall just stop to mention an odd circumstance that was of fatal consequence to the poor dogs about edinburgh and leith in the month of april      a mad bullbitch having bitten many dogs in the fleshmarket to prevent the bad consequences that might follow the magistrates of edinburgh issued a proclamation ordering all the dogs in that incorporation to be forthwith put to death under penalty of   l sterling and imprisonment to the owners for twelve calendar months and to prohibit all persons from keeping dogs for thirty days from that time and the magistrates of leith joining in the order nothing was to be seen for several days but chasing hacking slashing hanging and drowning of dogs and great lamentations were heard from diverse for the loss of their favorite puppies for with such zeal was this order executed that the ladies had enough to do to preserve any of their lapdogs and as it was many gentlemen got rid by it of formidable rivals  i shall also take notice here of the mischiefs done by a terrible storm which happened jan         in this city and the adjacent parts of the like of which we have hardly any example the wind began to blow pretty hard between eleven and twelve the preceding night and before one it rose to a complete hurricane and continued with surprising fury till four in the morning  as the houses in edinburgh are built high they suffered considerable damage the leads which covered the stately building in the parliamentclose were carried off the roofs some of them more than forty feet in dimensions the canongate church suffered exceedingly and the fine portico there was almost demolished the consternation was heightened by the alarm of the firedrum for the brewery at the east end of the meadow belonging to one mr bryson taking fire the wind increased the flame insomuch that the waterworks proved so many useless machines so that the brewery and house were consumed and some low houses at a considerable distance catching the flame were likewise reduced to ashes nor was the fire confined to that quarter for near the canonmills on the opposite part of the town a farmhouse belonging to one mrs angus likewise took fire which consumed it together with the cornstacks and outhouses these fires happened not through any negligence but were entirely occasioned by the impetuosity of the wind which having got entrance to the houses scattered the fire and set it in a glow a large new house at the back of the canongate consisting of five stories was entirely beaten down this was the more remarkable as it had been twice destroyed before and the owner had built it so strongly that she promised herself security against any accidents of that kind the buildings in the castle were prodigiously damaged their fine lead coverings were carried off and thrown upon the rocks the magazine was almost demolished and other considerable damages done the houses at the multrieshill which lay much exposed were almost all unroofed and the new playhouse was quite uncovered  this violent tempest confined not itself to this city at leith it produced likewise very dismal effects several houses were damaged and the end of one struck down the leadmill was uncovered several of the ships in the harbor broke loose and with such violence that they carried along with them the great iron rings to which they were fastened  the shire of air produced no less dismal accounts at irvine it blew so hard that many of the ships suffered much and many of the buildings in the town were thrown down at air the loss was much greater a general havoc was made among the houses and shipping most of which suffered and the anne galley bound for jamaica drove on shore and was dashed to pieces but the crew were happily saved  the like dismal account they gave from the merse where the storm occasioned a terrible destruction few houses being left undestroyd and several churches blown down and numbers smothered in the ruins and a general havoc made among the sheep and cattle  this storm did very great damage in other parts of the island in south as well as north britain but the effects of it at edinburgh were so terribly remarkable that we thought the above particulars would not be amiss to insert here  now we are on the subject of melancholy accidents the reader will excuse me for the following account of a very deplorable one which happened at kirkaldy jan        0  it is a wellknown custom that in these parts the first monday of the year is always observed with uncommon gaiety and mirth and in consequence becomes a holy day to apprentices and servants fourteen of which belonging to pathhead a little village adjacent to kirkaldy having got a little money went to divert themselves with a common amusement among boys by throwing up thistles or crowns the place they chose was a cave or a large hollow below a rocky eminence as they were thus innocently amusing themselves the rock tumbled down and crushed them topieces it is scarce possible to form an idea of the ghastly sight which their mangled bodies exhibited parents could not distinguish the corpses of their own children the parts of some who were close together when the rock fell were so mingled that there was no distinction and the carnage was the most dismal that could be imagined one escaped by his being at a greater distance from the rock but his leg was broke in a vast number of places this fatal catastrophe caused an extraordinary grief especially as some parents lost two others all their children  the following odd accident happened at edinburgh in september    0 a soldier belonging to the regiment in the canongate went to the kings park on a sheepstealing expedition where he unluckily happened to engage with a large headstrong ram near one of the precipices at arthurs seat mentioned above which pushed him headlong from the top of the rock so that they both fell down together and had their necks broken the unhappy fellow was found next morning with a handful of the rams wool clenchd in his fist  we next visited leith the seaport of edinburgh which is a large and populous town or rather two towns for the river or harbor parts them but they are joined by a stately stone bridge to which ships of burden may come and at high water lay their sides close to the shore  here is a very fine quay well wharfed up with stone and fenced with piles able to discharge much more business than the place can supply though the trade is far from being inconsiderable at the mouth of the harbor is a very long and well built pier or head which runs out beyond the land a great way and defends the entrance into the harbor from being filled up with sand as it would otherwise be when the wind blows hard at northeast there are also ranges of piles or breakwaters as the seamen call them on the other side of the harbor all which are kept in good repair and by this means the harbor is preserved and kept open in spite of a flat shore and a large swell of the sea  on the other side of the bridge are the remains of a strong castle built by oliver cromwell to command the port which is not yet so far demolished but that a little expense would soon restore it here the late rebel highlanders made a bold stop and took possession of it for one night but not finding their friends in the city in any condition to join them and the troops preparing to attack them they quitted it in the night and marched off to the earl of wintons house as i have already related  this town was once very strong for the french held it for some years against the reformers but were at last driven out by an army which queen elizabeth sent from england to assist the protestants it is under the jurisdiction of the magistrates of edinburgh and is governed by a bailiff under them  at leith the firth is seven miles over and holds that breadth for five or six miles but is narrower a little beyond cramond and at queensferry is reduced to two miles in breadth this place is a very good town as well as ferry and a corporation or royal burgh near the water of leith is a good copper mine  at cramond just mentioned and in the lands of inglestown as well as at other places in this county roman antiquities have been found particularly near the former place were dug up two stones late in sir robert sibbalds yard at edinburgh upon one of which is a laurel crown and on the other a roman securis they are supposed to have been part of a pillar erected in domitians time when agricola was in these parts near this place in the beginning of december    0 a whale between  0 and  0 feet in length and    in depth was cast on shore whose mate afterward tumbling about above the ferry was heard to make a hideous moan as is supposed for its loss  between edinburgh and this town the country is thronged with the seats of noblemen and gentlemen among which the marquis of annandale has a very pretty one with a fine garden enclosed with a brick wall a thing hardly to be seen anywhere else in scotland the want of which is the reason why the wallfruit does not thrive so well as it would otherwise do for the stone does not hold the warmth of the sun after it is gone as the bricks do  but the beauty of this part of the country is hopton house built upon a delightful plain on the bank of the river it was originally a square but there are two wings lately joined to it which add greatly to the beauty of the building the situation is so extremely good and gives so elegant a prospect as well to the sea as to the land that nothing can be finer it is exquisitely finished both within and without and there are some pieces of curious painting in it besides a great number of family pictures the stables and ridingplace are by far the finest and most magnificent in scotland and his lordship who delights in good horses has the best without comparison in all the country hawthornden also is celebrated for its caves hewn out of the rock and roslin for a great stately chapel  from hence the firth widens again and soon after is three or four miles wide and makes a safe and deep road with good anchorground where if there was a trade to answer it a thousand sail of ships of any burden might safely ride  on the southshore upon a narrow point of land running into the water stands blackness castle wherein stateprisoners were confined in former times especially such as were taken up for religious differences many of whom miserably perished here either by the unhealthiness of the place want of conveniences or something worse this castle might be of use if the harbor was frequented but as it is not there seems to be no occasion for it at present  farther west is borrowstounness a long town consisting only of one street which is extended along the shore close to the water it has been and still is a town of the greatest trade to holland and france of any in scotland except leith but it suffers very much of late by the dutch trade being carried on so much by way of england however if the glasgow merchants would settle a trade to holland and hamburgh in the firth by bringing their foreign goods by land to alloway and exporting them from thence as they proposed some time ago it is very likely the borrowstounness men would come into business again for as they have the most shipping so they are the best seamen in the firth and are very good pilots for the coast of holland the baltic and the coast of norway  but it is time to put an end to this letter which i do by assuring you that i am sir  your most humble servant  letter iii containing a description of the following shires and towns viz annan dumfries galloway air renfrew glasgow stirling linlithgow clidsdale tweedale roxborough etc sir as i entered the east side of scotland at berwick upon tweed and have carried on my account through the lothians so having traveled over the west part at another journey when i went from england by a different road i shall here give you the particulars of that also  passing the river esk or as it is commonly called the solway firth beyond carlisle we entered scotland on the side of dumfriesshire the division of this county into eskdale nithsdale and annandale is but the ordinary marking out the rivers esk annan and nith as i observed of the rivers teesdale tyndale swaledale and others in the north of england for the whole province makes but one shire viz that of dumfries  the esk is a pretty large river and gives name to the southeast part of this county but we saw very little near it worth our notice except kirsop a very small town on a river of the same name which afterward falls into the esk and is famous for being the place where by a treaty after the battle of pinkey the limits or borders of the two kingdoms were settled though the borderers did not long observe it but robbed and plundered one another upon all occasions as opportunity offered  this river soon leaves scotland and running into the english border empties itself into the solway firth which receives all the rivers on this part of the island as well from england as from scotland  the first place of note we came to in scotland was annand the chief town of annandale which being a seaport and having a good harbor was once a town of pretty good trade but it was often taken by the english who at last burnt it to the ground in the reign of king edward vi from which it never recovered here was a good salmon fishery and a trade to ireland by the isle of man but most of the merchants and men of substance being removed to dumfries the town continues to all appearance in a state of irrevocable decay  the town and castle of lockmaben is a royal burgh as well as annand three parts of it are surrounded by lakes which afford excellent fish and one particularly which is found nowhere else the castle as well as that of annand is now demolished  mffet is remarkable for its medicinal springs they rise from the top of a rock near the town there are two wells near one another the waters purge and vomit and are very good against colicky and nephritical pains powerfully removing obstructions in the bowels they are applied outwardly to ulcers and for pains in the joints they have more virtue in dry seasons and in summer and autumn than in winter and rainy weather  the town of rivel also deserves to be mentioned on account of a very good salt made out of a particular sand there which they gather up and boil  from annand keeping the sea as close as we could to the left we went on due west to dumfries a seaport town at the mouth of the river nid or nith which gives name to the third division of the county called nithsdale but this town is the capital of the whole shire and indeed of all the southwest part of scotland here as in some few other ports on this side of the island the benefits of commerce obtained to this country by the union appear much more visible than on the east side  dumfries was always a good town with large streets and full of reputable and wealthy merchants who trade into foreign parts and employ a considerable number of ships especially since they have embarked in trade to england and the english plantations this town is also advantageously situated for an increase of commerce on the river nid or nith for though it stands near two leagues from the sea yet the tide flows up to the town and ships of burden come close up to the key and about four miles below it the largest merchantships in britain may ride in safety  over the river nith is a very fine stone bridge at this place with nine arches and so broad that two coaches may go abreast on it here they have also an exchange for the merchants a handsome church a tolbooth or prison and a town hall for the use of the magistrates they had formerly a woolen manufacture here but the union has in great measure suppressed these things in scotland the english supplying them much better and cheaper yet at the same time it must be observed that the scots have more than an equivalent by an open trade to england and all the english plantations  the castle in this town is very old yet is still pretty good and strong this castle as well as that at carlavrok near the mouth of the river which has been a very magnificent structure belonged formerly to the ancient family of the maxwells earls of nithsdale the only remaining branch of which being unhappily embarked in the late rebellion and taken in arms at preston made his escape out of the tower and is now abroad under forfeiture  the inhabitants of the town of dumfries exerted themselves in a distinguishing manner for the present establishment in the year      fortified the town at a great expense and provided themselves with arms and ammunition this involving them in a larger debt an act passed anno      for laying a duty of two pennies scots upon every scots pint of ale or beer sold within the town and its privileges for paying the said debts and for building a new church the other being not capacious enough to hold the inhabitants and also to make a convenient harbor there for the preservation of ships and improvement of trade  this act enabled them to make some progress in the designed projections but the town having been forced to rebuild part of their old church the councilhouse and prison which were become ruinous they were rendered unable to proceed in the most useful parts of their undertaking and as the act expired in the  0th of king george ii they procured the same to be continued in that session for    years longer and also an additional duty on the tonnage of shipping and on goods imported and exported into and out of the port of dumfries which they hope will enable them completely to finish all they intended  there are many considerable woods in this county the chief of which is holy wood where was an abbey which gave surname to the famous astrologer johannes de sacro bosco or holy wood drumlanrick also the noble palace of the duke of queensberry is remarkable for its wood of oak six miles long  at this town the river nith parts the stewarty of galloway and the shire of dumfries and in the middle of the bridge over it is a gate which is the limit between them this neighborhood of galloway which is a great and rich province promotes the trade of this place very much  in november    0 here was a great struggle in view to the elections of members for the succeeding parliament and the town of dumfries signalized themselves by the following extraordinary act which we shall give without making any remarks upon it or the occasion of it at dumfries august       0 the said day the deacon convener and deacons of the several corporations having the advice and consent of the grand committee and of the community and whole members of the corporations taking to their consideration the reports and suspicions now going current upon persons setting up for deacons and the offering and giving or promising compliments rewards gifts remunerations and good deeds by themselves or trustees interposed or persons for their behoof either at this present or at a greater distance with prospect and view of the election for the five burghs for the parliament of great britain when the ensuing session is determined and being desirous to suppress such methods and any report thereof do according to all laws divine and human equity and reason enact and declare and be it enacted and declared by these presents that after the date hereof no person or persons members of the several corporations whether deacon late deacon boxmaster late boxmaster masters late masters or other members who are qualified to elect or be elected in any station of the corporation shall give promise offer or accept by himself or any interposed persons relations or others for their behoof or being meaned for the behoof of the person who may be thought capable to receive or give a vote either to put himself into any station of his corporation or capaciate him to vote therein or in council of the burgh for any person in of the council or out of the council any money valuable subject as remunerations reward and compliment for any good deed or promotion to any station or office whatsoever under the pain of such persons who shall be found giving or receiving promising or accepting as above their being dismissed and removed from their stations and losing their votes in the corporations besides if deacon or in order to promote themselves in that station to pay to the general boxmaster the sum of thirty pounds sterling money and this to be prosecuted before the convener and deacons or civil judge at their option by the general boxmaster and the probation be by oath writ or witnesses if the same can be found and these presents are signed by the deacons as instructed by their corporations and in their name place and day aforesaid    we could not pass dumfries without going out of our way to see the castle of drumlanrig the fine palace of the duke of queensberry just mentioned which stands at    miles distance upon the same river the vale on either side is pleasant and tolerably good but when these rapid rivers overflow their banks they do not like nile or even like the thames and other southern streams fatten and enrich the soil but on the contrary they lodge so much sand and splinters of stone upon the surface of the earth and among the roots of the grass that it spoils and beggars it nay the water is sometimes hurried on with such force that it washes the best part of the earth away where the soil is light  drumlanrig is like a fine picture in a dirty grotto or an equestrian statue set up in a barn it is environed with mountains which have the wildest and most hideous aspect of any in all the south part of scotland  we were not so surprised with the height of the mountains and the barrenness of the country beyond them as we were with the manners of the people who are not so polished here as in the other parts of scotland but what was most wonderful was to see so glorious a palace with such fine gardens and every thing about it so truly magnificent standing in a wild and mountainous country where nothing but what was desolate and dismal could be expected however the situation like that of chatsworth in derbyshire is certainly a foil to the buildings and sets them off with greater advantage  if you come to the palace by the road which leads to it from edinburgh you pass the river nith which is there both broad and deep over a stately stone bridge erected by the noble founder of the castle and builder of the house the first duke of queensberry  the building is apiece with roundels in the inner angles of the court in every one of which is a staircase and a kind of tower on the top it stands on the summit of a rising ground which is beautifully laid out in slopes and terraces at the extent of the gardens are pavilions and banquetinghouses exactly answering to one another and the greens espaliers and hedges are in great perfection  the apartments are fine and richly furnished the gallery is filled from one end to the other with family pictures of the dukes ancestors most of them at full length and in their robes of state or of office william the first of the family was a younger son of james earl of douglas who got the barony of drumlanrig by a deed from his father as his portion in the time of king robert iii he was afterward sent ambassador to england to ransom king james i who was detained there in the year   0  the late duke of queensberry was created duke of dover as also marquis of beverly and baron of rippon in england  the next trip we made was to galloway so called from the gauls from whom the ancient inhabitants descended it is divided into two different districts that toward the west is called the shire of wigton and the other toward the east which as i said before begins at the middle of the bridge of dumfries is called the stewarty of kirkcudbright of which the maxwells earls of nithsdale were heretable stewards the country hereabouts seems one continued heath proper for grazing small cattle which are generally sold in england and wherever you perceive a grove of trees you may depend upon it there is a lairds house near it which are mostly old towers of stone strongly built to prevent a surprise from inroads which were frequent between the two nations before the death of queen elizabeth  the first town of note on the coast is kirkcudbright though its situation is extremely convenient for carrying on a very advantageous commerce we saw nothing but a harbor without ships a port without trade and a fishery without nets this is owing partly to the poverty and partly to the disposition of the inhabitants who are indeed a sober grave religious sort of people but have no notion of acquiring wealth by trade for they strictly obey the scriptures in the very letter of the text by being content with such things as they have the river dee which enters the sea here and forms the harbor comes out of the mountains near carrick and is so full of turnings and meanders that though it is not above  0 miles in a line it runs near  00 miles in its course  the country of galloway lies due west from dumfries and as that part of it they call the upper galloway runs out farther into the irish seas than the rest all that bay on the south side may be reckoned part of solway firth as all on the northside is called the firth of clyde though near  0 miles from the river itself  the western galloway or the shire of wigton runs out with a peninsula so far into the sea that from the utmost shores you see the coast of ireland as plain as you see calais from dover port patrick which is the ordinary place for the ferry or passage to belfast and other ports in ireland has a tolerable good harbor and a safe road but there is very little use for it the packetboat and a few fishing vessels are the sum of its navigation there was nothing here to invite our stay for it is a mean dirty homely place and as we had no business but to see the coast we came away very ill satisfied with our accommodation upon a hill near the town we could plainly see ireland to the southwest the coast of cumberland and the isle of man to the southeast and the isle of ila and the mull of kintyre to the northwest  as we passed into the peninsula we stopped at stranrawer situate on the northside of the isthmus which is formed by two arms of the sea one on the northside called lochrain and the other on the south called the bay of glenluce on each side of this isthmus is an excellent road for ships but we could discover no genius in the people for trade or for sea affairs of any kind  six miles south of wigton lies whithern the ancient candida casa a royal burgh but very poor especially since the dissolution of the priory in this town was the seat of the bishop of galloway which was founded by st ninian about   00 years ago  but though the people of galloway especially on the sea coast are much to blame for not falling in to commerce navigation etc yet they are not quite idle for they are great cultivators of the earth and breeders of cattle of which they send above  0000 head every year to england besides they have the best breed of strong low punch horses in britain if not in europe which are from thence called galloways these horses which are very much bought up in england are remarkable for being good natural pacers strong easy goers hardy gentle wellbroken and above all not apt to tire  proceeding from lower galloway hither we had like to have been driven down the stream of a river though a countryman went before for our guide for the water swelled upon us as we passed and the stream was very strong so that we were obliged to turn our horses heads to the current and sloping over edged near the shore by degrees whereas if our horses had stood directly cross the stream they could not have kept their feet the inhabitants follow fishing as well in the sea as in the rivers and loughs which lie everywhere under the hills it which about september they catch an incredible number of excellent eels by which they are no less gainers than by their little horses  this part of the country is very mountainous and some of the hills prodigiously high but they were all covered with sheep and other cattle the gentlemen hereabouts being the greatest sheepmasters for so they call themselves and the greatest breeders of black cattle and horses in the whole kingdom  we now entered the shire of air full north from the mull or northpoint of galloway and as we before coasted the south bay or firth of solway which parts england from scotland so now we coasted the firth of clyde which for near  0 miles lies on the west side of the shore standing away northeast from the point of the mull this shire is divided into three great bailleries viz carrick kyle and cunningham  carrick is a more fruitful and better cultivated country than galloway and not so mountainous but it does not so much abound in cattle especially sheep and horses though there is no considerable port in this part of the country yet the people begin to trade here and those who live toward the coast are great fishermen and are employed by the merchants of glasgow and other places to catch herrings for them maybole is the chief town but though it stands on the coast it has no harbor and is poor and decayed the market is pretty good because there are many gentlemen in the neighborhood and the coast near it full of people but the houses are mean low and very coarse the family of kennedy earls of cassils are or were lords of great part of the country and have a good ancient seat but we did not go to see it  coming to the north bounds of carrick we passed the river dun over a bridge of one arch consisting of  0 feet which is much larger than the rialto at venice or the middle arch of the great bridge at york we found many large ones in this country though i think none so large as this except at glasgow and stirling this bridge led us into the county of kyle the second division of the shire of air here i observed that contrary to our expectation we found the farther north we traveled the country was the finer better and richer  kyle is more populous than carrick and the soil being better here and the country more plain and level so on the banks of the river there are abundance of gentlemens seats though most of them are built castlewise because of enemies but that fear being now over they begin to plant and enclose after the manner of england  the scots writers tell us a long story of a great battle in this country between coilus or kylus a british king and their fergus i where the former was killed and from thence the country took his name many monuments of this battle are still to be seen here the place where were it was fought is called coilfield a church near it is called coiltown kirk the river near which it was won and which falls into the river air four miles above the town of air is called coil a lake not far from it near which the scots encamped is called lake fergus a trumpet resembling a crooked horn which has a very shrill sound was dug up in the field of battle and is still kept in the lord of capringtons house called coilfield and made use of to call his servants and workmen together here or as some say at largis in the bay of clyde was another bloody battle in the year      between king alexander iii of scotland and acho king of norway who came to the port of air with a great fleet of ships and  0000 men who after ravaging the country was routed and lost both his army and   0 ships at this last battle an irish gentleman of the name of mackenzie behaved so well that king alexander gave him the lands of kintail which continued in the possession of the earl of seaforth his successor till the late earl taking part with the pretender his estate became forfeited from this brave irishman are descended the numerous name of mackenzie  over the river air is a bridge of four arches near the new town and south of the bridge stands the old town of air or erigena famous for its antiquity and privileges it has a very large jurisdiction of near    miles reaching from the mouth of clyde to the borders of galloway it stands on a sandy plain but has pleasant green fields two miles south and north of it in the fields betwixt the mouth of the river dun and air stands a very beautiful church the town has a very good harbor in the river and lies conveniently for trade and it is easy to see that it has been much larger than it is at present it is now like an old beauty and shows the ruins of a good face but is still decaying every day and from having been the fifth best town in scotland as the townsmen say it is now the fifth worst which is owing to the decay of its trade so true it is that commerce is the life of cities of nations and even of kingdoms what was the reason of the decay of trade in this place is not easy to determine the people themselves being either unwilling or unable to tell here over the river irvin which divides air from cunningham is a good bridge of four arches air is noted for the treacherous murder of many noblemen and gentlemen by the english in wallaces time when they were called together during a truce after edward i had overrun the country on pretense of holding a court of justice and were treacherously hanged one after another as they entered the kings large barns where the court was held  this was as severely as justly revenged by wallace with whom as warden of scotland they had made the truce and whom they endeavored to entice thither by their charter of peace as they had done a great many others of quality but he having notice of what had passed surprised them that very night in their jollity rejoicing that they had as they thought by these treacherous murders secured scotland for ever and having set guards round the barn that none should escape he burnt all the english in them the ruins of those barns are still shown here  oliver cromwell built a citadel at air well fortified with a fosse and a stone wall at the restoration it was demolished and at present only some houses and angles of the ramparts are standing  two miles north of air town stands kincase which has been from time immemorial a place of retirement for leprous persons  from air keeping still north we came to irwin upon a river of the same name here they have a port which formerly was in much better condition than it had been for some years past the harbor being so much decayed by length of time and other accidents that the trade of the town began to decay for the water not being confined to its proper chanel the harbor became so choked up with sandbanks that it was of little use to what it had been so that ships of very small burden were freqently shut up for several months in the river before they could sail out to sea at the same time the townhouse church streets and other public works as the common gaol and one of the arches of the bridge were all in a ruinous condition all which occasioned an act of parliament to pass in the ninth of king george ii for laying a duty of twopennies scots upon every scots pint of ale or beer sold in the town of irvin and its liberties and a duty of a penny sterling upon every ton of coals shipped off for transportation by which means the harbor will soon be restored to its pristine goodness and the town to its former flourishing condition but thus much must be said that notwithstanding the declining condition of its harbor before this act passed it carried on a greater trade than most of the ports between air and dumfries their chief trade is in scots coal which they export in great quantities to ireland for the neighboring hills abound with this commodity irvin is the capital of that division of the shire of air which they call cunningham and is really within the firth of clyde though not actually within the river itself the name of cunningham signifies the kings habitation from the beauty of its situation  as it has more trade than the other parts i have been speaking of so it is better built here are two handsome streets a good quay and a capacious harbor the country is rich and fruitful filled with gentlemens seats and well built houses and wherever you turn your eye you see nothing but beautiful enclosures pleasant pastures and grass grounds so that we thought ourselves in england again it is said this enclosing the ground was owing to the english soldiers who were placed here and in kyle by oliver cromwell for at air he built a citadel as i have said these prompted and encouraged the people to enclose and improve their lands and instructed them in the manner of husbandry practiced in england which they have not forgot to this day  a very extraordinary storm of thunder and lightning happened here on the   th of november    0 which deserves to be taken notice of for the terror it occasioned it being equally uncommon for the season of the year and the climate  at noon began to fall a very heavy rain which ended in such a shower of large hail that every body betook themselves to shelter from its violence this was followed with a sudden and most dreadful flash of fire and crack of thunder the lightning accompanied the thunder which did not continue rolling as usually short and quick but the noise seemed greater and more frightful than as if all the ordnance on earth had been at one instant discharged the whole seemed to break upon the tolbooth and steeple drove in much of the roof on two sides so as wagons might pass through the steeple was much shattered and the crevices large the townclock was broke to pieces the work either calcined or melted the strong door of the prison was burst up notwithstanding its large iron bars a lad of fourteen was killed as he stood at a window and his clothes entirely consumed his brother aged twelve was thrown down near by him another brother was struck blind their aunt had all her clothes burnt to ashes on one side and even her skin flayed off worse than could have been done by any blisteringplaister her other side seemed untouched it is observable that not one bone of any of them was broken though every hair was singed and that the sulphurous stench about them was intolerable many other persons were also grievously hurt two sailors coming from the quay said that a large pillar of fire struck them in the face which brought them to their knees one mr cunningham said it appeared to him as a most voluminous pillar of fire proceeding quick as from the mouth of cannon and that he thought from the uncommon smoke over the tolbooth that it had been all on fire he was thrown down and his foot much hurt the people had scarce recovered their senses when two other cracks of thunder gave fresh grounds of terror so that it was apprehended the general judgment approached and every one prostrated themselves in humility imploring mercy from on high but these last though terrible and uncommon were nothing to the first great hewn stones were carried violently out of the steeple to baillie nesbitts house where they left impressions  a little from irvin stood kilmarnock castle the seat of the family of the boyds earls of kilmarnock which on the   th of march       was entirely consumed with the furniture and a curious collection of books in mss nothing being saved but the charterchest on the other side is the castle of eglington the seat of the ancient family of the montgomeries earls of eglington on the northeast borders of this county where it joins to clydsdale is the castle of london the noble and beautiful seat of the earl of london  upon the bay of clyde stands the town of largis famous for the defeat of the norwegians by king alexander iii of scotland which some give to kyle as we have said above  kilmaers in the same county is the seat of the noble and ancient family of cunningham earls of glencairn camden says that the family derives its original from one of that name concerned in the murder of thomas a becket who fled into scotland on that account and therefore bear an episcopal pall in their arms but it is plain from their motto over fork over that it is a fork and not an episcopal pall and the family no doubt is of a much higher and nobler original  in the sea lies lady isle where is great plenty of rabbets and fowl but no inhabitants  with the division of cunningham i quitted the shire of air which is without exception one of the pleasantest counties in scotland  joining to it north and bordering on the clyde itself lies the shire or rather barony of renfrew which was the ancient estate of the stuarts before they succeeded to the crown of scotland and his royal highness the prince of wales among other titles is now styled baron of renfrew it is a pleasant rich and populous country and though the soil is not thought to be so good as in cunningham yet that is abundantly recompensed by the neighborhood of glasgow and the clyde and the great commerce of both  we kept our rout from irvin along the coast as near as we could so that we saw all the firth of the clyde and the very opening itself which is just at the westcorner of this county there are some villages and fishing towns within the mouth of this river which have good business  the first town of note is called greenock which seems not to be an ancient place but to be grown up in later years by being a good road for ships to ride in that come into and go out from glasgow as ships for london do in the downs the town is well built has many rich trading families in it and a castle to command the road it is the chief place in the west of scotland for the herring fishing and the merchants of glasgow who are concerned in it employ their vessels for catching and curing the fish and for carrying them abroad to market afterward and their being ready on all hands to go to sea makes them often leave the care of their own ships to the greenock men who are good seamen and excellent pilots for those difficult seas  at the west end of a bay on the firth is a small town called gowrock where is a noted road and harbor lately fitted up  paisley also stands in this county on the river cart and though no borough is larger than renfrew and was formerly noted for its noble abbey of the order of cluny the monks of which wrote a chronicle called the black book of paisley the abbey and church with fair gardens and orchards and a little park for fallow deer are all enclosed with a stone wall about a mile in circuit the water of the river whitecart upon which paisley stands is commended for its largeness and the pearls frequently found thereabouts and three miles above they commonly fish for them in summertime and meet with them in a shellfish larger than an ordinary muscle at the bottom of the water it lies on the west side of clyde over against glasgow the remains of the abbey are still to be seen and the town bears the marks of having been fortified at the west end of the town are the remains of a large roman camp and praetorium supposed to be vaulted underneath because the ground when trod upon sounds hollow here it was mary queen of scots was defeated by her rebellious subjects under the bastard earl of murray from whence she took refuge in england and was there most inhospitably imprisoned for several years and at last beheaded in the lands of newyards near paisley on a high ground is a fountain noted for ebbing and flowing with the tide  the country between paisley and glasgow on the bank of clyde i take to be one of the most agreeable places in scotland for its situation fertility healthiness and for the benefits it receives from the neighborhood of glasgow and the sea  i am now come to the bank of clyde but my method here as in england forbids my wandering north till i have given you a full view of the south the clyde and the forth may be said to cross scotland here their two firths not being above  0 miles distant from one another which if joined would divide it very near in the center  nor can i refrain mentioning how easy a work it would be to make a navigation from the forth to the clyde joining the two seas as the king of france has done in a place five hundred times more difficult namely from toulouse to narbonne and as the late czar of muscovy peter justly surnamed the great did in several places of infinitely greater difficulty and expense what an advantage in commerce would this be it would establish a trade between ireland and the merchants in glasgow and open a communication between the westcoast of scotland and the east of england even to london nay several ports of england on the irish sea from liverpool northward would all trade with london by such a canal it would take up a volume to lay down the several advantages that would immediately accrue from such a navigation and in particular in times of war but it must lie till posterity by the rising greatness of their commerce shall not only feel the want of it but find themselves inclinable as well as able to effect it  glasgow is the emporium of the west of scotland being for its commerce and riches the second in this northern part of great britain it is a large stately and well built city standing on a plain in a manner apiece and the four principal streets are the fairest for breadth and the finest built that i have ever seen in one city together the houses are all of stone and generally uniform in height as well as in front the lower stories for the most part stand on vast square dorick columns with arches which open into the shops adding to the strength as well as beauty of the building in a word it is one of the cleanliest most beautiful and bestbuilt cities in great britain  it stands on the side of a hill sloping to the river only that part next the river for near onethird of the city is flat and by this means exposed to the water upon any extraordinay flood it is situated upon the east bank of the clyde which is not navigable to the town but by small vessels its port therefore is newportglasgow which stands near the clydes mouth and is an harbor for ships of the greatest burden here it is on a good wharf or quay the merchants load and unload their customhouse is also here and their ships are here repaired laid up and fitted out either here or at greenock where work is well done and labor cheap  the city is joined to the suburbs on the west bank of the clyde by the noble bridge i have mentioned  where the four principal streets meet the crossing makes a very spacious marketplace as may be easily imagined since the streets are so large as we come down the hill from the northgate to this place the tolbooth and guild hall make the northwest angle or right hand corner of the street which is now rebuilt in a very magnificent manner here the towncouncil sit and the magistrates try such causes as come within their cognizance and do all their other public business so that as will be easily conceived the tolbooth stands in the very center of the city it is a noble structure of hewn stone with a very lofty tower and melodious hourly chimes all these four principal streets are adorned with several public buildings  but the chief ornament of this city is the college or university a most magnificent and stately fabric consisting of several courts the front to the city is of hewn stone and excellent architecture its precincts were lately enlarged by some acres of ground purchased for it by public money and it is separated from the rest of the city by a very high wall  it owes its erection to archbishop turnbull and was legally founded by king james ii in      by virtue of a bull from pope nicolas v granting it all the privileges liberties honors immunities and exemptions given by the apostolical see to the college of bononia in italy for teaching universal learning a rector a dean of the faculty a principal or warden who was to teach theology three philosophyprofessors were established by the first foundation and afterward some clergymen taught the civil and canon law there  in      king james vi established a principal three professors of philosophy four bursars a steward to furnish their table a servant for the principal a janitor to look after the gate and a cook  the family of hamilton gave some of the ground on which the college stands with an adjacent field  kings parliaments the city of glasgow several of the archbishops and many particular persons have been benefactors to it  in      the earl of dundonald gave  000 l sterling to it for the maintenance of poor scholars the great buchanan and the famous cameron had among other eminent men their education here  several fine roman stones dug up in the latterend of    0 near kirkentilloch with very curious inscriptions have been removed to this university where before was a good collection of pieces of antiquity chiefly found near the same place  in the higher part of the city stands the great church formerly cathedral and metropolitan dedicated to st mungo who was bishop here about the year   0 it is a magnificent and stately edifice and surprises the beholders with its stupendous bigness and the workmanship of the artizan the several rows of pillars and the exceeding high spire which rises from a square tower in the middle of the cross show a wonderful piece of architecture it is now divided into several preachingplaces one above the other  near the church stands a ruinous castle formerly the residence of the archbishop who was legal lord or superior of the city which stands on his ground and from whom it received its first charter and many privileges it is encompassed with an exceeding high wall of hewn stone and has a fine prospect into the city  the duke of montrose has so great an interest here and in the country round that he is in a civil sense governor of this city as he is legally of their university and much beloved in these parts  glasgow is a city of business and has the face of foreign as well as domestic trade nay i may say it is the only city in scotland at this time that apparently increases in both the union has indeed answered its end to them more than to any other part of the kingdom their trade being new formed by it for as the union opened the door to the scots into our american colonies the glasgow merchants presently embraced the opportunity and though at its first concerting the rabble of this city made a formidable attempt to prevent it yet afterward they knew better when they found the great increase of their trade by it for they now send near  0 sail of ships every year to virginia new england and other english colonies in america  but if this city could have a communication with the firth of forth so as to send their tobacco and sugar by water to alloway below stirling as they might from thence again to london holland hamburgh and the baltic they would very probably in a few years double their trade  the share they have in the herring fishery is very considerable and they cure their herrings so well and so much better than they are done in any other part of great britain that a glasgow herring is esteemed as good as a dutch one  i have no room to enlarge upon the home trade of this city which is very considerable in many things i shall therefore touch at some few particulars    here are two very handsome sugarbaking houses carried on by skilful persons with large stocks and to a very great perfection here is likewise a large distillery for distilling spirits from the melasses drawn from sugars by which they enjoyed a vast advantage for a time by a reserved article in the union freeing them from english duties    here is a manufacture of plaiding a stuff crossstriped with yellow red and other mixtures for the plaids or veils worn by the women in scotland    here is a manufacture of muslins which they make so good and fine that great quantities of them are sent into england and to the british plantations where they sell at a good price they are generally striped and are very much used for aprons by the ladies and sometimes in headcloaths by the meaner sort of englishwomen    here is also a linen manufacture but as that is in common with all parts of scotland which improve in it daily i will not insist upon it as a peculiar here though they make a very great quantity of it and send it to the plantations as their principal merchandise nor are the scots without a supply of goods for sorting their cargoes to the english colonies without sending to england for them and it is necessary to mention it here because it has been objected by some that the scots could not send a sortable cargo to america without buying from england which coming through many hands and by a long carriage must consequently be so dear that the english merchants can undersell them  it is very probable indeed that some things cannot be had here so well as from england so as to make out such a sortable cargo as the virginia merchants in london ship off whose entries at the customhouse consist sometimes of two hundred particulars as tin turnery milanery upholstery cutlery and other crookedlane wares in short somewhat of every thing either for wearing or housefurniture building houses or ships  but though the scots cannot do all this we may reckon up what they can furnish which they have not only in sufficient quantities but some in greater perfection than england itself    they have woollen manufactures of their own such as stirling serges musselburgh stuffs aberdeen stockens edinburgh shalloons blankets etc   the trade with england being open they have now all the manchester sheffield and birmingham wares and likewise the cloths kerseys halfthicks duffels stockens and coarse manufactures of the north of england brought as cheap or cheaper to them by horsepacks as they are carried to london it being at a less distance   they have linens of most kinds especially diapers and tablelinen damasks and many other sorts not known in england and cheaper than there because made at their own doors   what linens they want from holland or hamburgh they import from thence as cheap as the english can do and for muslins their own are very acceptable and cheaper than in england   gloves they make better and cheaper than in england for they send great quantities thither   another article which is very considerable here is servants which they can transport in greater plenty and upon better terms than the english without the scandalous art of kidnapping wheedling betraying and the like for the poor people offer themselves fast enough and think it their advantage as it certainly is to serve out their times soberly in the foreign plantations and then become diligent planters for themselves which is a much wiser course than to turn thieves and then be transported to save them from the gallows this may be given as a reason and i believe it is the only one why so many more of the scots servants who go over to virginia settle and thrive there than of the english which is so certainly true that if it holds on for many years more virginia may be rather called a scots than an english plantation i might mention many other particulars but this is sufficient to show that the scots merchants are not at a loss how to make up sortable cargoes to send to the plantations and that if we can outdo them in some things they are able to outdo us in others if they are under any disadvantages in the trade i am speaking of it is that they may not perhaps have so easy a vend and consumption for the goods they bring back as the english have at london bristol or liverpool for which reason they have lately set up a wharf at alloway in the forth whence they send their tobacco and sugars thither by landcarriage and ship them off from thence for holland hamburgh or london as the market offers and indeed they carry on a profitable trade with england in tobacco which from the difference of duty etc they do with no small advantage  now though the carrying their tobacco and sugars several miles over land may be some disadvantage yet if on the other hand it be calculated how much sooner the voyage is made from glasgow to the capes of virginia than from london the difference will be made up in the frieght and in the expense of the ships especially in time of war when the chanel is thronged with privateers and the ships wait to go in fleets for fear of enemies for the glasgow vessels are no sooner out of the firth of clyde but they stretch away to the northwest are out of the road of the privateers immediately and are often at the capes of virginia before the london ships get clear of the chanel nay even in times of peace there must always be allowed one time with another at least fourteen or twenty days difference in the voyage both going out and coming in which taken together is a month or six weeks in the whole voyage and considering wear and tear victuals and wages this makes a considerable difference in the trade  one thing still i must take notice of before i quit glasgow i have mentioned more than once the duties laid on ale and beer sold in diverse towns in scotland for the benefit and public emolument of the said towns but have here to take notice of the like duty laid for a different purpose that is to say for a punishment the case was this  when the maltduty was extended for the first time to scotland it occasioned much murmuring and particularly daniel campbell esquire who lived at glasgow and was member for that town having given his vote for it in parliament the populace rose entered his house destroyed all his goods and furniture and committed other acts of violence and outrage  this the legislature resenting as a defiance of lawful authority an act passed in the   th of king george i      to take from the town of glasgow the benefits of an act before passed for laying a duty of two penies scots on every pint of ale or beer brewed for sale in the said city and its privileges and vesting it for the remainder of the term which was for thirteen years to come  viz from      to      in his majesty to be put under the commissioners of excise in order to raise the sum of  0 0 l for satisfying the damages and losses sustained by mr campbell in the said riot but it was provided that when the said sum was paid the duty of two penies scots was to return for the remainder of the term to the magistrates for the purposes for which they were originally granted this occasioned no good blood it may be believed between the city and mr campbell but yet this was not the last time this city had the honor to be represented in parliament by the same gentleman as it is joined with the burghs of renfrew ruglen and dunbarton  so placable and so forgiving are the generous scottish nation or at least so little title has the city of glasgow in particular to the national motto of scotland  nor did this good behavior of theirs turn out to its disadvantage for in the  th of george ii a new act passed continuing the former act for twentyfive years longer and extending it to the villages of gorbells and port glasgow both which places were in the jurisdiction of the city and reaped all their advantages from its neighborhood the latter especially at which the people of glasgow had built and constantly maintained a very commodious harbor and yet were neither of them in the former act  from glasgow i went eight miles southward to hamilton a town pleasant and well built the church of which is the buryingplace of the noble family of hamilton but it is chiefly noted for its fine palace the seat of the duke of hamilton premier peer in scotland and nearly related to the royal family of the stuarts the house at present is large though part of the design is yet unfinished it has a fair front with two wings and two more are laid out in the ichnography of the building which are not yet begun  the front is very magnificent all of white freestone with regular ornaments according to the rules of art the wings are very deep and when the other two are added the sides of the house will be like two large fronts rather than wings the apartments are very noble and more fit for the court of a prince than the house of a subject the pictures the furniture and other decorations are exquisitely fine and suitable to the dignity of the great possessors the late duchess marrying a branch of the family of douglas obliged him to take the name of hamilton and so continue the estate in her name her grace had six sons four of whom were peers either by birth or creation viz the late duke who was killed in a duel with lord mohun anno      charles late earl of selkirk so created by king james vii john earl of ruglen and george late earl of orkney the other two were lord basil and lord archibald late one of the lords of the admiralty  the situation of the house has all the advantage imaginable for it stands in a plain country near enough to the banks of clyde to enjoy the prospect of its stream and yet far enough from it to be out of the reach of its torrents and floods  the great park is about seven miles in circumference and noted for its fine oaks and firs and the small river aven runs through it it is walled round with stone and well stocked with deer the lesser park is rather a great enclosure than a park though this as well as the other is extremely well planted with trees the gardens are finely designed but i cannot say they are so well finished and kept as those at drumlanrig  ruglen is another town in this county which gives title of earl to a branch of the family of hamilton as has been said  here is also the town and castle of douglas which gives title and surname to the dukes of douglas of which family more anon  crawford lindsey in this county gives title also to the earl of crawford who claims precedence as first earl  in crawfordmoor gold has been found in the sand of the brooks after rain and that in pretty large pieces and they dug up lapis lazuli there the remains of a roman causeway are to be seen in this county from one end to the other  we then turned to the left for stirlingshire and after passing the clyde came to kilsyth a good plain country burgh tolerably well built but not large near which the marquis of montross gave a great overthrow to the covenanters in the civil wars here upon a particular occasion we went to see the ancient seat of calendar which seems now in its decline the town of falkirk is near calendar house but has nothing remarkable in it except the other old decayed house of the earl of calendar  here we plainly saw the remains of the ancient work which they call severuss wall adrians wall or grahams dyke for it is known by all these built by the romans cross this narrow part of the country and fortified with redoubts and stations to defend the south country from the incursions of the picts irish and other wild nations in the highlands this wall reached from dunbriton firth so they called the firth of clyde to the forth and was several times repaired till the destruction of the roman empire in britain with which it perished yet neither this while it stood nor the stronger one at newcastle called severuss wall could so well preserve the country from the invasion of picts and scots but the romans were often obliged to send powerful succors to the relief of the distressed britons camden thinks that this wall was built by antoninus pius who being adopted by adrian assumed his name be this as it will it is certain that in all the scottish histories it is called grahams dyke  the manner of the wall is best understood by mr ponts description in dr gibsons now lord bishop of london translation of camdens britannia p     first there appears a ditch of    feet wide before the wall toward the enemies country the wall is  0 feet thick but it is not known how high it was at first there is a paved way at the foot of the wall five feet broad watchtowers within call of one another where sentinels kept watch day and night a court of guard to lodge a sufficient number of soldiers against all sudden alarms and a void within for the soldiers lodgings besides these there are along the wall great and noble forts strongly entrenched and though within the wall able to receive a whole army together the forts which remained in mr ponts time who traced them all were these one at langtoun a mile east of falkirk one just at rouintree burnhead one at westergowden about st helens chapel one at the croykill a very great one at the top of the banhill one at atchindevy one at kirkintilloch or kaerpencolloch one at eastcalder one at hilltouncalder one at balmudy one at simerstone and over kilvin river and carestoun one at atermynie one at balcastle over against banhil one at kaellybe over against croyhill one at the rochhill over against the westwood a large one at bankyir over against castlecairy one at dumbase in the ruins of that at bankyir was found a large iron shovel or some instrument resembling it so weighty that it could hardly be lifted by one man at the same fort also were discovered several sepulchers covered with large rough stones and at dunchroe chyr by monyabroch were formerly large buildings the length of the wall was    scots miles beginning between queens ferry and abercorn it ranged along west by the grange and kineil to innereving so on to falkirk from whence it proceeded directly to the forest of cumernald next it ran to the great fort at the banhill where have been found several stones some with pictures engraven upon them and with inscriptions from whence it went to the peel of kirkintilloch the greatest fort of all and so westward to dumbarton with a great ditch upon the northside of the wall all along it had also many square fortifications in form of roman camps  from kilsyth we mounted the hills black and frightful as they were to find the road over the moors and mountains to sterling and being directed by guides we came to the river carron the chanel of a river appeared indeed and looked as if it had been cut out by art through horrid precipices to mark out a course for the water but yet not a drop was at that time to be seen great stones square and formed as if cut out by hand of a prodigious size lay scattered in a confused manner in the very course of the river which as we were told the fury of the water at other times had hurried down from the mountains if so they must have been some ages upon their jouney down the stream for it is not probable that a flood often comes with a force sufficient to move such stones as these unless a great quantity of ice as well as water comes down upon them together but in all probability they are not not driven down by the force of the water at all but are roman monuments of which more byandby  here we passed another bridge of one arch not quite so large as that we saw in galloway but very like it it is finely built of freestone but the shores being flat it rises so high that it is not every head can bear to ride over it but there was a necessity of building it with one arch only for no piers in the middle of the chanel could have borne the shock of the great stones which sometimes come down this stream  from hence descending on the northside we had a view of the firth of forth on our right and of the castle of stirling on our left in going to the latter we passed the water of bannockburn famous in the scots history for the great battle fought here between king robert de bruce and the english army commanded by king edward ii in person in which the english were utterly overthrown and that with so terrible a slaughter that though it was the greatest army that ever marched from england into scotland very few escaped and the king with much ado saved himself by flight how he could save himself by a little boat as mr camden says i cannot understand there being no river near that had any boats in it but the forth and then the king must have fled north whereas to be sure he fled to england with all the speed he could he might indeed have made use of a boat to pass the tweed but that was at least  0 miles from the field of battle  whether the scots magnify this victory or not is not my business to inquire it is certain that the english army was totally overthrown here for they lost  0000 men among whom were abundance of their nobility and gentry  this place is also remarkable for the execrable murder of king james iii whose young son was by some discontented nobles worked up to this impious deed but when his understanding ripened he saw the action in its proper light and was so greatly affected by it that he did penance for ever after by constantly wearing an iron chain near his flesh  sterling was our next stage an ancient town and an important pass which together with dumbarton is the defense of the lowlands against the highlands for as one very knowingly said dumbarton is the lock of the highlands and stirling castle keeps the key the town is situated exactly as edinburgh on the ridge of a hill sloping down on both sides and the street gradually ascending from the east to the castle which is at the west end it is large and well built and though it is ancient yet the buildings are not unlike those of edinburgh  the church is also a very spacious building but not collegiate it stands in the upper part of the town toward the end is of good architecture and adorned with a lofty tower there was formerly a church or rather a collegiate chapel in the castle and likewise a private chapel or oratory in the palace for the royal family but they have been long disused  the castle is not so very difficult of access as that at edinburgh but is esteemed equally strong for the works are capable to mount more cannon and there is a battery that commands the bridge which is of the utmost importance and seems to have been the main end and purpose for which it was built the walls and all the outworks are so firm that they seem in as good condition as if they had been lately built  the palace and royal apartments are very magnificent but are all in decay and likely to continue so this is at present also the fate of the palaces of linlithgow falkland dumfermling and all the other royal houses in scotland holyroodhouse at edinburgh excepted  in the park adjoining to the castle were formerly large gardens the figure of the walks and grassplots is still plainly to be seen  the park here is large and walled about as most of the parks in scotland are but there is little or no wood in it the earls of mar of the name of ereskin who claims to be hereditary keeper of the kings children and of this castle had a house at the upper end of the town very finely situated for prospect but not for security being too near the castle for were the castle ever to suffer a close siege and be vigorously defended it would run a great risque of being demolished on one side or other besides this nearness to the castle makes the site more confused to the eye  from a pretty little flowergarden upon one of the bastions on the northside of the castle we had a most agreeable prospect over the valley and of the meanders turnings or reaches of the river forth which are extremely beautiful they are so spacious and return so near themselves with so regular and exact a sweep that i believe the like of it is not to be seen in britain and perhaps not in europe especially in so large a river the seine indeed between paris and roan fetches a sweep something like these and some miles longer but then it is but one whereas here are three double reaches which makes six returns together and each of them above three scots miles in length and as the bows are almost equal for breadth as the reaches are for length it makes the figure complete it is an admirable sight indeed and continues from a little below the great bridge at stirling to alloway the seat of the earls of mar the form of this winding may be conceived by the length of the way for it is twentyfour miles from stirling to alloway by water and hardly four miles by land  one would think these large windings of the stream would check the tide very much but on the contrary we found the tide of flood make up very strong under stirlingbridge though it does not flow above seven or eight miles farther for the stream grows narrow apace and the rapid current of all rivers in this country checks the tide when it comes into narrow limits the same is the case in the tyne at newcastle and the tweed at berwick in both which though the tide flows as strong in at the mouth of these rivers as in this yet the navigation goes not near so far up  the bridge of stirling has only four arches but they are very large and the chanel widens considerably below it at alloway it is above a mile broad and deep enough for ships of any burden so that the glasgow merchants are certainly in the right to settle warehouses there and ship off their goods for the eastern countries  i was very curious to inquire into the course of this river as i had been before into that of the clyde to see if there was a possibility of uniting their waters for an inland navigation because i had observed that the charts and plans of the country brought them almost to meet but when i came to survey the ground exactly i found the mapmakers greatly mistaken and that they had not only given the situation and courses of the rivers wrong but the distances also however upon the whole i saw plainly that notwithstanding several circumstances which might obstruct it and cause the workmen to fetch some winding turns out of the way yet a canal of about    miles would fairly join the rivers and make a clear navigation from the irish to the german sea and that this could be done without any considerable obstruction for they would not have occasion for above four sluices in the whole way and those only to head a basin or receptacle to contain a flush of water to push on the vessels either way as occasion required  how easy such a work would be and how advantageous not to scotland only but even to england and ireland the thing itself will explain at first sight i could enter upon particular descriptions of the work and answer all the objections raised from the great quantity of waters in the winter and the force and fury of their streams but i have no room for it here  there is a very considerable manufacture at stirling for serges or shalloons which they make and dye very well nor has the english manufacture for shalloons broke in so much upon them as it was apprehended it would this manufacture is a great support to the poor people that are employed in it who are thereby enabled to live very comfortably  the family of ereskine is very considerable here for besides the earls of mar and buchan there are several gentlemen of quality of that name  we had here a very fine prospect both east and west eastward we could plainly see the castle of edinburgh and the hill called arthurs seat in the royal park at holyroodhouse and westward we could see dumbarton castle to the northward we saw dumblane and the field of battle called sheriffmuir between it and sterling  but our business was not to the north yet for having a part of the border to view we went from stirling to the southeast over some of the same hills we passed at our coming hither that we might leave nothing behind to oblige us to come this way again the duke of argyll has a small house here which the family call the lowland house to distinguish it from the many seats they are possessed of in the highlands this seat belonged formerly to the earls of stirling the county round it south of the forth is called stirlingshire or strivelingshire  stirling was one of the boundaries of the roman empire in britain as appears by the inscription on a stone below the castle toward the bridge importing that one of the wings of their army kept guard there on the right of the town stood the noble abbey of cambuskenneth the river carron which i mentioned before is famous for some roman monuments particularly two little hills called by the vulgar dunipace i e hills of peace and two miles lower is a round edifice of stone which by the description resembles what the romans called the temple of terminus but buchanan thinks they were rather monuments of some great actions performed here  from stirling we went directly to linlithgow a large town well built with a stately townhouse but most famous for the noble palace of the kings of scotland which is the least decayed of all the rest for king james vi repaired or rather rebuilt it and his two sons prince henry and prince charles afterward king of england had apartments here which a traveller may easily distinguish by the different coats of arms especially over those called the princes lodgings  this palace stands on a rising ground which runs into the lake in form of an amphitheatre and has a descent resembling terracewalks there are two towers at each corner of the court with apartments and a curious fountain in the middle adorned with several fine statues from whence the water rises to a good height a noble park also belongs to it  the church of st michael makes a part of this building and is a wing on the right hand of the first court as the proper offices make the left the innercourt is very large and elegant for the taste of the times in the middle of this is the large fountain i have mentioned which still shows the remains of some good carving and other ornaments  here king james v restored the order of the knights of st andrew as the order of knights of the bath lately was in england and erected a throne and stalls for them in st michaels church making it the chapel of the order he was likewise the first who ordered the thistle to be added to the badge of the order and the motto viz nemo me impune lacesset which is worn about it in the royal arms was of his invention this prince seems to have been very much honored in the world for he wore the badges of three orders besides his own viz that of the garter conferred upon him by his uncle the king of england that of the golden fleece by the emperor then king of spain that of st michael by the king of france  in his time the green ribband was worn by the knights companions of this order but king james vii changed it to the blue like that of the knights of the garter in england after the union queen anne the sovereign of both to distinguish them restored the green ribband and intended to have called a chapter of the order to bring it once more to its full luster but was prevented by death  in this town the earl of murray lord regent was murdered with a musketbullet shot by one hamilton this earl was a natural son of king james v and aspiring to the crown joined with the reformers having first got the revenues of the convents of st andrews and pittenweem whereof he was abbot or prior secured to him and his heirs his ambition and intrigues were the chief cause of almost all the troubles of queen marys reign but i shall have occasion to mention him in another place  at linlithgow is a great linen manufacture as there is at glasgow and the water of the lake here is esteemed so extraordinary for bleaching or whitening of linen cloth that a vast deal of it is brought hither from other parts of the country for that purpose this lake is situate on the northside of the town and between it and the palace are terracewalks which are so beautiful that a more delightful place can scarce be seen  in the year      an act passed for laying twopenies scots on every scots pint of ale or beer sold in linlithgow and its liberties in order to repair the public buildings which were run to decay such as the church and townhouse etc to supply such parts of the town with fresh water as want it to pave and amend the streets and also the avenues within a mile round the town for discharging the towndebts and other necessary purposes great progress was made in these laudable undertakings by virtue of this act but the end being not sufficiently attained nor likely to be at the expiration of the act these duties were farther continued for    years more by an act which passed in the year      which it is not doubted will completely answer all the proposed ends to the great advantage of the town and country  forfichen formerly the residence of the knights of malta is two miles southwest from linlithgow  near a place called kips south from this town is an ancient chapel or altar of great unpolished stones leaning so as to support one another the vulgar call them arthurs oven but the learned think them to be a temple of terminus built by the romans and others still there are who conjecture them to be a temple of the celts or druids near this chapel or altar is a circle of great stones and on two adjacent hills are the remains of old camps with great heaps of stones and ancient graves which some think roman works  about four miles north from linlithgow lies the castle of abercorn supposed to be the kebercurnig of bid where began the roman wall thought to be begun by severus  from linlithgow we turned to the right and following the clyde upwards from a little above hamilton where we were before we came into the shire of clydsale this tract has some remains of roman antiquity for from errickstone to mauls mitre which borders upon the shire of renfrew are evident footsteps of a roman causeway for several miles together and there is a tradition that another roman street went from lanark to the roman camp near falkirk  lanark is the capital of this county but is no extraordinary town its bridge however is very remarkable it was built at a vast expense by the inhabitants but the violent current of the water rendering the keeping it in repair too chargeable for the town to support and making it require frequent reparations an act of the scottish parliament passed anno   0  impowering them to collect tolls for pontage in order to keep up the same this act was in force for    years and there was so much reason for it and the bridge was of so great use to the county that though the duties expired in the year      yet the rates were voluntarily paid for many years till some disputes arising with some selfish persons who wanted to reap the fruits of other peoples labor for nothing an act was passed in the  0th of king george ii for enabling the magistrates to repair and maintain so useful a work this act is to continue in force for    years and is so reasonable that it ought and perhaps will be perpetuated for the rates are only   d sterling for every coach or chariot drawn by four or more horses   d for every cart or wheelcarriage   d for every sledge or horse loaded or unloaded twothirds of a penny for every ox cow or bull onesixth of a penny for every calf hog sheep or lamb and the same for every foot passenger who must be a worse beast than any i have named to grudge it for so great a convenience  a little below this town the river douglas falls into the clyde and gives the name of dowglasdale to the lands near it in a dull vale near this river stands a very old castle which has been the paternal seat of the great family of douglas for above a thousand years for which reason it is still kept in repair but by the frequent additions to the building it is become such a wild irregular mass that at a distance it seems rather like a town than a single fabric though the apartments are very noble  the complete history of this family would take up a volume by itself as it actually has in a late work where the heroes of the name are fully set forth and all the illustrious actions they have been concerned in i shall only observe that there are no less than seven branches of this family in the peerage of great britain namely the duke of douglas who is chief of the name the duke of queensberry and dover the earls of morton dumbarton and march and the lords mordington and forfar the latter of whom was unhappily killed at the fight near dumblaine against the pretender  the country abounds with coals peat and limestone but what turns to the greatest profit are the leadmines belonging to the earl of hopton not far from which after rains the country people find pieces of gold some of which are of a considerable bigness this is thought to be what camden calls crawfordmoor where lapis lazuli is daily dug up with little trouble as i have said  here we left the lastmentioned wild place on the right and went westward into the shire of peebles the first town we came to of any note was peebles which stands on the bank of the tweed and is capital of the county the town is small and but very indifferently built or inhabited yet there are some good houses in it it was formerly remarkable for three churches three gates three streets and three bridges of which that over tweed has five arches  the country hereabouts is very hilly but those hills are covered with sheep which are a principal part of the estates of the gentry a great quantity of them are sent into england to the great damage of the poor who are thereby deprived of the advantage of manufacturing their wool they used formerly to export it to france but by the act of union the exportation of it was prohibited upon the severest penalties and to make the gentlemen of the southern counties amends for this loss a great sum of money was at that time granted them as an equivalent as i have mentioned before to encourage them to set the poor to work  this county of tweedale has two remarkable lakes in it the one called westwater lake abounds so with eels and other fish about august that during a west wind they come out in such shoals into a small river which runs from the lake that we were told they are ready to overthrow the people who go in to catch them the other is lochgenen lake upon genenhill which falls into annandale from a precipice of   0 feet high that many times fishes are killed by the fall of the water  the frazers were ancestors by marriage to the family of tweedale and of this name was that great captain who contributed so much to the victory which the scots obtained in one day over three english armies at rosbin   0  during wallaces administration  merlin is said to be buried in the churchyard of drumelzier in this county and according to an old prophecy that the kingdoms should be united when tweed and pausel met at his grave they say that it happened so by an inundation when king james vi came to the crown of england anno   0  the only time before or since it ever did so  some remains of antiquity are visible in this county the place called randals trench seems to have been a roman camp and a causeway leads from it half a mile together to the town of line  in this county are two very lively monuments of the vanity of human glory the first is the foundation of a prodigious building more like a royal palace than the seat of a private nobleman begun by the earl of morton whose head was no sooner cut off than his design perished for it has never since been carried on  the other is the palace of traquair built and finished by the late earl of traquair for some years lord high treasurer of scotland and a person in the highest posts both of honor and profit in the kingdom who yet lost all by the fatality of the times for growing into universal dislike by his conduct under king charles i he sunk into the most abject condition of human life even to want bread and to take alms and died in those miserable circumstances about a year before the restoration the house is noble the design great and well finished but the owner was soon turned out of it by his enemies who thought the sparing his life an act of great mercy  bishop burnet represents this earl as a very meanspirited man and one that suffered himself to be made so vile a tool in other peoples mischiefs that he fell unpitied it is very remarkable that he was despised even by the party which he had served and but too faithfully adhered to  here we saw the ruins of the once famous abbey of melross the greatness of which may be a little guessed at by the vast extent of its remains one may still distinguish many noble parts of the monastery particularly the great church or chapel as large as some cathedrals the choir of which is visible and   0 feet in length besides what may have been pulled down at the east end and by the thickness of the foundations there must have been a large and strong tower or steeple in the center of the church there are likewise several fragments of the house itself and the court and other buildings are so visible that it is easy to know it was a most magnificent place in its day  following the course of the tweed we passed by abundance of ancient seats of gentlemen whose possessions are large in this country such as that of the family of douglas of whom one is called douglas of cavers who is hereditary sheriff of the county and who shows the standard of the brave lord douglas who was killed at the battle of otterburn falsely as the scots say called cheviot chase which i have mentioned in vol iii just as he had gained the victory as also the mace of iron he fought with  the country southeast from tweedale is called tiviotdale or the shire of roxburgh in which are some footsteps of roman encampments and a military way runs from hounam to tweed called the roman causeway and vulgarly the rugged causeway  the town and castle of roxburgh are both now demolished they were famous in the history of both nations during their mutual wars when the town was frequently taken and retaken and in the siege of which king james ii of scotland was killed by the bursting of a gun  jedburgh is a royal burgh on the river jed it was one of those towns that suffered in the rebellion in      and being beside in debt and its revenue small to answer its outgoings and it being well situated for manufacturing coarse wool but greatly suffering for want of fresh water and its public buildings bridges streets and works greatly out of repair for these reasons and also to enable the inhabitants to erect workhouses etc for the manufacture aforesaid an act passed    0 imposing a duty of twopenies scots upon every pint of scots ale etc to be vended within the said town and its liberties and it now reaps the good effects of it  the duke of roxburgh has a very great estate his graces house called fleurs has been finely embellished of late years and is a noble seat and the country about it which was formerly wild and rugged is now greatly impaired and cultivated and fine plantations of trees and vistas surround the house  from hence we came to kelso a handsome market town upon the bank of tweed which being so near the english border and having one of the great roads from edinburgh to newcastle lying through it which is a nearer way by far than by that through berwick is a considerable thoroughfare to england they only want a good bridge over the tweed for at present they have only a ferry just at the town and a good ford through the river a little below it  the country about kelso is very pleasant and fruitful on both sides the tweed the river here does not part england from scotland but you are upon scots ground for four miles or thereabouts on the south side of the tweed and the farther west the more the tweed lies within the limits of the country  from kelso we went north where we passed through lauderdale a long valley on both sides of the little river lauder from whence the family of maitland first earls then dukes and now earls again took their title  the country is good here and fenced with hills on both sides the river lauder runs through it keeping its course due north  the town of lauder is a royal burgh the seat of the commissariot and very pleasantly situated it is remarkable for the execution done upon the minions of king james iii who headed by the earls of angus took them out of the court and hanged them over lauderbridge the seat of the noble family of maitland earls of lauderdale is called lauderfort it is a stately house about the middle of the valley on the river but not large  we kept the great road over a high ridge of mountains from whence we had a plain view of midlothian one of these mountains is called soutrahill and belongs to a branch of the family of maitland the elder brother of which house was a gentleman of great merit and raised himself by his personal accomplishments to the highest posts in the army at the battle of treves in germany where the french army under the marshall de crequi was defeated by the germans commanded by the old duke of zell he had the misfortune to lose one of his hands which he supplied with another of steel from whence he was called handy maitland about the time of the union he was lieutenant general of the queens armies colonel of a regiment of foot and governor of fortwilliam and inverlochy  i could not pass this way to edinburgh without going off a little to the right to see two very fine seats one of them is an old abbey belonging to the marquis of lothian of the ancient name of ker a younger branch of the house of roxburgh at newbottle whose predecessor mark ker being abbot of it turned protestant and got it settled on him and his heirs it is an old building but finely situated among the most agreeable walks and rows of trees all full grown and contains one of the best chosen collections of pictures statues and busts in scotland  about a mile from hence is the duke of buccleughs house at dalkeith without exception the finest and largest newbuilt house in scotland it was built by the late duchess relict of the duke of monmouth on the ground where the old castle of dalkeith stood which was the estate of the great earl of morton regent of scotland who was beheaded under king james vi by an engine he himself had introduced into this country as i have mentioned at halifax in vol iii he suffered for being accessory to and acquainted with the barbarous design of the lord darnleys murder  this palace stands on a rising ground on the edge of the river northesk from whence it overlooks the plain with a majesty like that of windsor on the bank of the thames making some allowance for the difference of the two rivers the park is very large and beautified with waterworks jets d eau and a canal the expensive work of the late duchess and the present duke  the inside of this magnificent palace is answerable to the grandeur of the family being very richly furnished and adorned with many fine paintings especially of the ladies of the english court and some royal originals  just beyond the park is dalkeith a pretty large market town and the more considerable for being so near edinburgh for great quantities of provisions are brought hither from the southern countries which are sold here and afterward sent to that city  i will conclude this letter with the following inscription on the tombstone of one margaret scott who died in the town of dalkeith february        stop passenger until my life you have read the living may get knowledge by the dead five times five years i lived a virgin life ten times five years i was a virtuous wife ten times five years i lived a widow chaste now tired of this mortal life i rest i from my cradle to my grave have seen eight mighty kings of scotland and a queen four times five years the commonwealth i saw ten times the subjects rose against the law twice did i see old prelacy pulled down and twice the cloak was humbled by the gown an end of stuart s race i saw no more i saw my country sold for english ore such desolations in my time have been i have an end of all perfection seen   i am sir yours etc  letter iv containing a description of the ancient caledonia or northern part of scotland and particularly of the shires and towns of fife st andrews perth dumblain alloway culross scone angus dundee montrose aberdeen buchan murray elgin inverness and the highlands etc sir i am now to enter the true and real caledonia for that part of the country on the north of the firth of forth is alone called by that name and was anciently known by no other  i crossed the river at queensferry seven miles west of edinburgh into the shire of fife and as the most considerable places in this county are on the seaside or near it i directed my journey east along the coast the first place we came to was the burgh of innerkeithin an ancient walled town with a spacious harbor opening from the east into the river which has been lately much neglected for want of trade the town however is large and still populous  i cannot pass over a tragical story which happened in this town in the reign of the late queen anne the master of burleigh so the eldest son of a lord or viscount is called while the father is living fell in love with a young woman in his fathers family but could not prevail with her either to marry him or to sacrifice her virtue to him which being known she was sent away and he persuaded to travel however before his departure he declared she should be his wife at his return and if any one else should marry her in his absence he would murder him this passed without much notice and the young woman was soon after married to a schoolmaster in this town  the gentleman returned and understanding who was her husband went to his house at noonday pulled out a pistol and shot him dead on the spot making his escape unmolested  but a proclamation being afterward issued with a reward of  00 l for apprehending him he was at last taken and tried at edinburgh by the lords of the justiciary and condemned to have his head cut off great intercession was made to the queen for his pardon which proving ineffectual he found means to make his escape out of the tolbooth of edinburgh disguised in his sisters clothes the night before he was to have been executed  after that he appeared in the late rebellion and was in the battle of dumblane or sheriffmuir but escaped again with his life though his estate which was but small was forfeited among the rest  near innerkeithin a little within the land stands the ancient town of dumfermling which is now in a very ruinous state for   here is a decayed monastery which before the reformation was very large but then demolished saving a part which was turned into a parochial church and even that is now decayed and with it the monuments of several kings and queens of scotland particularly that of malcolm iii who founded the monastery    here is a decayed court or royal palace of the kings of scotland but by whom built is uncertain almost all king james the sixths children were born in it particularly king charles i and the princess elizabeth afterward queen of bohemia and his queen made this place her particular residence and had it settled upon her as her jointure here she built herself an apartment over the arch of the great gate for her particular retirement having a gallery reaching from it to the royal lodgings all is now ruinous    here is a decayed town the natural consequence of the decay of the palace the treatment king charles ii met with here from the covenanters was sufficient to make him take a disgust to the place  the church has still a venerable face and at a distance seems a mighty pile the building being once vastly large what is left appears too heavy for the present dimensions the church itself is said to be as long as the cathedral of carlisle designed by the model of that at glasgow but i rather think that at glasgow was designed by the model of this at dumfermling for it seems the most ancient  the people are poor but would be poorer if they had not the manufacture of linen for their support the diaper and better sort of linentrade being carried on here and in the neighboring towns with more hands than ordinary the marquis of tweedale has a great estate in these parts and is hereditary chamberlain or keeper of the royal house  the rocking stone near balvaird in fife was a remarkable curiosity it was broken by oliver cromwells soldiers and then it was discovered that its motion was performed by an eggshaped extuberance in the middle of the under surface of the upper stone which was inserted in a cavity in the surface of the lower stone as the lower stone was flat the upper was globular and not only a just proportion in the motion was calculated from the weight of the stone and the wideness of the cavity as well as the oval figure of the inserted prominence but the vast bulk of the upper stone absolutely concealed the mechanism of the motion and the better still to impose on the vulgar there were two or three surrounding flat stones though that only in the middle was concerned in the feat by this pretended miracle they condemned of perjury or acquitted as their interest or affection led them and often brought criminals to confess what could be no other way extorted from them  from turning east we saw many seats of private gentlemen and some of noblemen particularly one belonging to the earl of morton at aberdour which fronts the firth to the south and the grounds belonging to it reach down to the shore  from this part of the firth to the mouth of innerkeithin harbor is a very good road for ships the water being deep and the ground good but the western part which they call st margarets bay is a steep shore and rocky there being  0 fathom water within a ships length of the rocks so that if a southeast wind blows hard it may be dangerous riding in it but this wind blows so seldom that the ships often venture it  he that will view the county of fife which is wedged in by the forth and the tay and shoots out far into the east must as i said before go round the coast and yet there are four or five places of note in the middle of the county which are superior to all the rest and must not be omitted kinross lessly falkland melvil balgony and cowpar the last a town the others great houses and one viz falkland a royal palace and once the most in request of all the royal houses in scotland  an english reader will be surprised to hear of such numbers of palaces but however mean our thoughts may be of the scots court in ancient times their kings had more fine palaces than most princes in europe for in the time of king james iv they had all in good repair and in use the several royal palaces of holyroodhouse and the castle at edinburgh the royal palace in the castle at sterling linlithgow dumfermling falkland scone the castles of dumbarton blackness and inverness  besides lesser seats and huntinghouses of which king james v had several and the several palaces of earl morton and others which were forfeited into the kings hands  the south coast of the county of fife abounds with towns and the following thirteen are royal burghs viz innerkeithin bruntisland kingborn kirkaldy dysart pittenweem anstruther wester anstruther easter kilrinny crail st andrews all on the coast dumfermling and cowpar in the midst of the county and it contains also these other towns of note viz toryburn aberdour the two weemyss levinsmouth ely st monans and newburg on the tay and it has in it four presbyteries viz at cowpar st andrews kirkaldy and dumfermling  the shire itself takes its name from fyfus surnamed duffus to whom it was granted by king kenneth ii for his valor against the picts about the year   0 his posterity were first called thanes of fife and afterward earls by malcolm ii about the year  0   and endowed with greater privileges than any other earls of the kingdom because of their extraordinary services a famous monument of which was that called clan macduffs cross on the public road near abernethy to which if any within the  th degree to the great macduff who was the chief instrument of subduing the tyrant macbeth should have recourse in case of manslaughter he was to be pardoned on paying a small number of cattle this monument had an inscription importing those privileges now worn out and was in such antiquated terms mixed with macaronick or half latin words that few men now living would have been able to make it out  from this macduff the families of douglas weemys and the clan chattau are said to be descended the earl of rothes is hereditary sheriff of fife  having seen aberdour i took a turn at a friends invitation to lessly but by the way stopped at kinross where we had a view of two things worth noting first the famous lake or lough called lough leven in an island of which stands the castle where queen mary commonly known in england by the name of queen of scots was confined by the first reformers being first compelled to quit her favorite bothwell and afterward her crown but from which she found means to make her escape though as it proved out of the drying pan into the fire  the lough itself is worth seeing it is very large being above  0 miles in circumference in some places deep and famous for fish formerly it had good salmon but now chiefly trouts perch pikes and other small fry out of it flows the river leven which runs from thence to lessly  at the west end of the lake the gardens reaching down to the very waters edge stands the most beautiful and regular piece of architecture for a private gentlemans seat in all scotland i mean the house of kinross belonging to sir john hope bruce bart the town which has a very good market and a street tolerably well built lies at a little distance from the house so as not to obtrude upon its privacy and yet so as to be ready to wait upon its call it is all beauty the stone is white and fine the order regular the contrivance elegant the workmanship exquisite drydens lines intended for a compliment on his friends poetry are here literally true strong dorick columns form the base corinthian fills the upper space so all below is strength and all above is grace   sir william bruce the surveyorgeneral of the works the wren of north britain was the founder as well as architect of this house that gentleman has left many noble monuments of his admirable skill and taste in those parts such as the palace of holyrood at edinburgh the house of rothes and this at kinross besides several others  the situation of this house of kinross would be disliked by some for its being so very near the water insomuch that sometimes when the lake is swelled by winter rains and melted snows it reaches to the very gardens but as the country round is dry free from stagnated boggs and unhealthy marshes this is of very little inconvenience if any sir william planted numbers of firtrees upon the land round his house which the present possessor sir john hope bruce is as careful to improve as his grandfather was to plant posterity will find the advantage of this taste which if it spreads as it has begun will in time make scotland a second norway for fir for the lowlands as well as the highlands will be overspread with timber  from kinross i came to lessly where i had a full view of the palace of the earl of rothes built in the reign of king charles ii by the said sir william bruce  here it was king james ii when duke of york lodged most part of the time when he was obliged by his brother to retire into scotland and his apartments are still called the duke of yorks lodgings  the magnificence of the inside of this house is unusually great but what is very particular is the long gallery which is the full length of one side of the building and is filled with paintings but especially as that is at drumlanrig of the great ancestors of the house of rothes or lessly at full lengths and in their robes of office  the rooms of state at kinross are well supplied with very fine and valuable pictures many of which are of princes etc but most if not all the full lengths in this gallery of rothes are of the family and the immediate ancestors of the present earl most of them having been peers and possessed of the greatest places of trust in scotland from the year    0 to      so that you may imagine there may well be enough to furnish a gallery  though the house is magnificent i cannot say the situation of it is so advantageous as that of some other seats for it has no excellent prospect from the grand town though it stands on the banks of the leven just where another smaller river joins it  the park on the south side is very beautiful six miles in circumference walled round and diversified with little woods of firtrees which have vistas reaching through them up to the house the gardens are at the east end of the house well designed and planted extending to the angle where the two rivers meet so that they are watered on the north and east side and on the south are parted with a wall from the park the west end of them beginning from the house  the town of lessly seated at a small distance west from the house or a little northwest has a good market but is in no other respect considerable the house aforesaid is the principal glory of the place  from lessly we turned south to the coast and came to bruntisland situated in the middle of the northside of the river forth just opposite to leith so that we have from hence a fair prospect as well of the road of leith as of the city and castle of edinburgh here is a very commodious harbor which has no bar but enters as if it had been made by hand into the center of the town so that the ships lie with their broad sides to the very houses and it is the common port of safety to all ships that happen to be forced up the firth by storms or contrary winds and ships trading on this coast frequently winter here the water is commonly    and at springtides    feet deep within the harbor so that it is capable of receiving and careening the largest men of war the town is adorned also with a beautiful church and has a large townhouse and gaol but the harbor having suffered much by time and by storms and the church townhouse and gaol becoming ruinous an act passed anno      for laying a duty of twopenies scots upon every scots pint of beer etc sold within the town and liberties for increasing the revenues restoring the harbor and repairing the public structures abovementioned  here is a manufacture of linen as there is upon all the coast of fife and especially for greencloth as it is called which has been several years in great demand in england for printing or painting in the room of calicoes which are prohibited there  next to bruntisland upon the same coast is kinghorn noted for its thread manufacture which the women chiefly carry on the men being generally seamen upon all this coast as high as the queensferry  great numbers of porpoises are seen almost constantly in this firth which the men make a practice of shooting and then bring on shore and boil their fat into train oil as they do whales and several other great fish which they sometimes meet with thereabout but the firth affords a much more regular fishingtrade lower down of which in its place  the ferry from leith to the shore of fife is fixed in kinghorn which is of considerable advantage to it though sometimes the boats by stress of weather are driven into bruntisland  east of this town is kirkcaldy a larger more populous and betterbuilt town than the other and indeed than any on this coast it consists chiefly of one street running along the shore from east to west a full mile very well built it has some considerable merchants in it in the most extensive sense of the word besides others that deal very largely in corn exporting great quantities of it both to england and holland others again trade in linen to england who in return bring back all needful supplies of foreign manufactures  here are several coalpits not only in the neighborhood but even close to the very sea at the west end of the town and where one would think the tide should make it impossible to work them at the east end of the town is a convenient yard for building and repairing of ships and farther on several saltpans for boiling and making salt  dysert boasts as i said of being a royal burgh but notwithstanding it is a very decaying corporation the only support of it is that the lord dysert the landlord has a good saltwork here and in the lands adjoining an excellent vein of scotch coal both which are easily put on shipboard at a small wharf adjoining this i think is the whole trade of the town except what arises from a few nailmakers and hardware workers  i take the decay of most of these seaport towns which it is evident have made a much better figure in former times to be owing to the removing of the court and nobility of scotland to england which has been doing ever since the junction of the kingdoms under the same prince in james i and vi and more completely by the union their seaport towns had before a trade when their court was magnificent when their nobility built fine houses and lived in them they then exported goods infinitely more in value than what they received and therefore the balance was evidently on their side whereas now the union has opened a door to all the english manufactures and suppressed many of the scots has prohibited their wool going abroad and yet scarcely takes it off at home if the cattle are sent to england the money is too generally spent there likewise the troops raised here are in english service and scotland receives no premium for the levies which she might have done had they been sent abroad as the swiss and other nations do at this time  but the benefits that will attend its principal ports on the repairs of their harbor and public structures by the many acts already passed and every session of parliament passing by the twopenies scots levied for those purposes will in time very probably turn the scale in favor of the union and increase the trade of this part of the united kingdom as by virtue of that act it stands on the same foot of advantage with england and has so many good ports to receive shipping and carry on a commerce with foreign parts as well as coastwise to england and ireland of this the towns of glasgow dundee dumfries irvin dunbar pittenweem montrose inverness elgin aberbrothock bruntisland lanark linlithgow etc will bear testimony as i have and shall observe in their proper places indeed it is pity but scotland should find its account in this respect in general for it must be owned as i have in part observed before that it has a plentiful product for exportation and were the issue of that product returned and consumed at home it must necessarily grow rich and flourish  to take only a short view of the commodities it exports into foreign countries england included for i am now considering scotland as if not united carried to england corn black cattle sheep wool linen of several sorts some woolen manufactures stockens in particular to holland bremen and hamburgh corn lead salt coal barrelld pork and salmon note the dutch buy the barrelld pork from aberdeen for victualling their east india ships it being much better cured than that from any other country to norway salt oatmeal salmon lead stockens and linen to sweden dantzick and riga salt woolen manufactures of sterling and aberdeen to spain and the streights herrings pickled barrelld and dried salmon herrings and whitefish to france coal salt lead herrings whitefish and wool for all these exportations the returns are or at least were before the union from england pewter blocktin wrought iron glass ware sugars tobacco drugs and dyers stuffs all the english woolen and silk manufactures were prohibited upon the severest penalties so that the returns from england in goods were very small the grand return from thence was in specie and it is known that above an hundred thousand pounds was paid into scotland every year for cattle only from holland some fine linens but not much because of their own lace and fine threads gimp incle etc east india goods linseed and lint or flax linseedoil trainoil and whalebone from norway pitch and tar deals and firr timber from sweden iron in bars and copper deals and timber from dantzick koningsberg riga narva and petersburg plank called east country clapboard or wainscot oak timber and in quarters hemp pitch tar turpentine sturgeon and flax from france wine brandy apples rennets resin cork paper wrought silks raw silks toys perfumes etc from the royal canal through france oil and italian pickles from leghorn from hamburgh staves for casks clapboard rhenish wine and old hock   all these sorts of goods are returned into scotland but the quantities are very small the chief articles to sum up all in a little are  from england sugar and tobacco from france wine and brandy from the east country naval stores from sweden iron and copper from norway deals and timber from holland lint and linseed  now these put together if i am rightly informed do not balance the lead coal and salt which they export every year so that the balance of trade must stand greatly to the credit of the scots account which would be all returned into scotland in specie every year if there was not a neighboring gulf into which it is all sunk and what a figure would such an advantage of running cash be able to make  i have already touched upon the advantages that will probably accrue to scotland by the method they have fallen upon of augmenting and repairing their ports and harbors by virtue of the twopenies tax and some will further add to balance the disadvantages they lie under from the union that it is now established in a lasting tranquillity and an end put to those wars that used to lay waste the borders of both nations that this will give encouragement to the improvement of the land and consequently of raising the value of estates that the taxes are easy and ascertained that the charges of defending the country both abroad and at home lie upon england and the west india trade abundantly pours in wealth upon her and all this is true but is it not pity for all that that her own nobility should not like true patriots lend a helping hand to the rising advantage of their own country and spend some of the large sums they get in england in erecting manufactures employing the poor and propagating the trade at home which they may see plainly has made their united neighbors of england so much exceed them  but to return to our travels we came next to a village called the westerwemys belonging to the earl of wemys whose house stands a little farther east on the top of a high cliff with its front looking down upon the sea at the west end of this cliff is a small plain once a bowlinggreen where the late earl being admiral had some small fieldpieces planted to answer salutes behind the house is a small and irregular courtyard with two wings of building being offices to the house on one side and stables on the other gardens there are none only a large wellplanted orchard between which and the house the road goes on to easterwemys  from thence you come to another village called buckhaven inhabited by fishermen who are employed wholly in catching fresh fish every day in the firth and carrying them to leith and edinburgh markets the buildings are but a miserable row of cottages yet there is scarce a poor man in it but they are in general so very clownish that to be of the college of buckhaven is become a proverb  here we saw the shore of the sea covered with shrimps like a thin snow and as you rode among them they would rise like a kind of dust and hop like grasshoppers being scared by the footing of the horse  the fishermen of this town have a great many boats of all sizes which lie upon the beach unrigged ready to be fitted out every year for the herring season in which they have a very great share  beyond this is the ely a little town but a very safe and good harbor firmly built of stone almost like the cobb at lime though not projecting into the sea so much as that it stands a little on the west side of the mouth of the leven the salmon of which river are esteemed the best in this part of scotland  to this town the earl of wemys brings his coal which he digs about two miles off on the banks of the river leven as also what little salt he can make the coalworks are greatly prejudiced by the breaking in of the water notwithstanding the immense charges they have been at to prevent that inconvenience  the people who work in the coal mines in this country partly from their poverty and hard labor and partly from the black hue which they get from the coal make such a frightful appearance that their own countryman drumond of hawthornden in his famous macaronick poem called polemomiddinia thus describes them coalehewers nigri girnantes more divelli   from hence we have several small towns on the coast as criel or crail anstruther or anster as it is usually called also the port of pittenweem these are all royal burghs  pittenweem is a port and harbor very conveniently situated near the mouth of the forth in the shire of fife and great quantities of herring cod and other fish are taken here but it has had two great difficulties to encounter with that is to say the low situation of the town close on the harbor by which means the inhabitants were at a great and constant expense beyond their ability to maintain a pier and other works to defend both the shipping and its people the other that the entrance was very narrow and strait and several rocks lay in the way of the shipping which was a great hindrance to its trade and commerce but in the year      an act passed for laying a duty of twopenies scots upon every scots pint of ale etc sold within the town and its liberties for remedying these inconveniences  over against this shore and in the mouth of the forth opposite to the isle of the bass lies the isle of may known to mariners by a lighthouse upon it the only constant inhabitant is said to be the man maintained there by the government to take care of the fire in the lighthouse it was famous in former times for barren women going to st adrians shrine there  here the french fleet lay with some assurance with the pretender on board in   0  when the english squadron approaching the four oclock gun gave the alarm upon which they immediately weighed got under sail and made the best of their way the english pursuing in vain  the shore of the firth or frith ends here and the aestuarium or mouth opening the land of fife falls off to the north making a promontory of land which the seamen call fifeness looking east on the german ocean after which the coast bends away north and the first town you come to is st andrews an ancient and once flourishing city the metropolis of all scotland and the seat of the first university and before the revolution an archbishops see  it is remarkable for a fine situation surrounded with extensive cornfieldsd abounding in excellent wheat and barley and the pleasant downs called the links lying on the seaside toward the north the famous physician cardan esteemed it the healthiest town he ever lived in having occasion to experience it some months when he came over from italy at the request of the pope to prescribe to archbishop john hamilton whom he recovered of a consumption and twenty years before it had the approbation of the most eminent physicians of the country when a house was fitted up here for the reception of magdalen daughter of francis king of france who married james v king of scotland in      but that lady died shortly after her arrival at holyroodhouse in edinburgh and never reached st andrews  the town of old consisted of four large streets lying from east to west almost parallel to one another the northermost of the four called swallowstreet though formerly the principal is now totally ruined not so much as one house remaining the other three by their regularity do not seem to have been a fortuitous concourse of houses as most of the other towns of this country do all of them terminating eastward at the cathedral which look upon each other and seem to lament their decaying condition for though the town was heretofore about two miles in circumference there remain now hardly  000 houses and of those near  00 are become ruinous and not habitable the number of inhabitants still amount to above  000 but many of them have nothing to do there being neither trade nor manufactures in the place though at the same time it has a harbor but capable only of small vessels near the town is plenty of freestone of which all the houses are built  before the reformation this city was crowded both on account of trade and religion pilgrims coming hither in great numbers to visit the relics of st andrew said to be brought over by st regulus about the end of the fourth century from patras in greece where that apostle suffered martyrdom here were three religious houses a franciscan dominican and augustine priory the last founded by robert bishop of st andrews who died      and was established upon some of the revenues formerly belonging to the ancient culdees of this place james stewart afterward earl of murray and regent of scotland was in his younger days prior of it this monastery was more like the magnificent palace of a prince than a convent of monks professing poverty as appears still by its ruins and particularly by the wall that encompassed it of fine hewn stone with many battlements and turrets  here is now only one parish church that of the holy trinity remaining but there are two others which are rather chapels one to st salvators college of which however no use is made it having no endowment and the provost of that college being often a layman even in a presbyterian sense the other is the chapel belonging to st leonards college the provost whereof must be a minister  the church of the holy trinity is an ancient and stately edifice built with fine freestone in form of a cross and has at the west end a handsome spire in good repair in it is a fine monument of archbishop sharp who was assassinated upon a moor as he was coming home in his coach it was erected by the archbishops son sir william sharp bart who to secure it from the fate he feared it might be liable to mortified  000 merks to the city of st andrews to keep it in constant repair which has had its intended effect for the magistrates are very careful of it and would be very severe upon any who should attempt to deface it  on the northside of the town was the old castle of which now nothing is remaining but the walls built by roger bishop of st andrews who died   0  being the second son of robert beaumont earl of leicester and chancellor of scotland it was repaired by cardinal bethune and archbp hamilton the former of whom procured george wishart to be burnt here in the parade while from his window he glutted his eyes with so horrid a spectacle but was himself afterward assassinated      in the same place to revenge whose death the queen regent permitted it to be attacked by the french from whom it suffered greatly but at the reformation it suffered more and its ruin has been completed since the revolution  to the east of the castle are the ruins of the stately cathedral founded by bishop arnold who died      and finished by bishop lambertoun who died      it was in length from east to west   0 feet and the cross from south to north   0 its breadth    and its height  00 feet though some draw another kind of ichnography and make it seven feet longer and two broader than st peters at rome and for the height as well as the beauty of its pillars and the symmetry and proportion of the whole it was one of the best gothic structures in the world  it was sometimes called killrimont from the church built by hergust king of the picts in the fourth century but the name of st andrews has prevailed for many ages the cathedral was near demolished at the reformation but was repaired in some measure by the succeeding archbishops but since the revolution it has been entirely in ruins as we now see it  near the ruins of the cathedral are still remaining the walls of the most ancient chapel of st rule with the great square spire still very entire it is in height  0  feet and made of such large and durable stones that though it was built so many ages ago yet so little has it suffered by the injuries of the weather that a small sum would save it from falling for many ages to come and as this is probably one of the most ancient monuments of christianity in great britain it is pity it should go to ruin for want of a suitable reparation this besides would be the most proper chapel and chapter house for the noble knights of the most ancient order of the thistle since under the patronage of the apostle st andrew whose relics were preserved at this place that order of knighthood had its rise and foundation and by king james viis letters patents reviving and restoring this noble order which were dated at windsor the   th of may      it appears the knights of the thistle or st andrew formerly held their chapters in the great church of st andrews which being demolished his said majesty ordered them for the future to be kept at the chapel royal of holyroodhouse  this city is famous particularly for its university consisting of three colleges founded by henry wardlaw bishop of st andrews in the year      it obtained very ample privileges and immunities from pope benedict xiii which were afterward confirmed to them by king james i of scotland and by several other succeeding kings during episcopacy the archbishops were chancellors of it the rector is chosen yearly and by the statutes ought to be one of the principals of the three colleges here called st salvators st leonards and the new college  st salvators college was founded by james kennedy bishop of st andrews anno      who erected the edifice furnished it with costly ornaments and endowed it with sufficient revenues for a doctor a bachelor and licentiate of divinity four professors of philosophy and eight poor scholars the earl of cassils settled a maintenance for a professor of philosophy it has a good library founded by dr sheen the edifice itself is a most stately pile of fine hewn stone has a large vaulted chapel covered with freestone and over it is a very lofty spire the common hall and schools are vastly large and the cloisters and private lodgings for masters and scholars have been very magnificent and convenient but the fabric is of late become very much out of repair nor is the college revenue able to support it  st leonards college was founded by john hepburne prior of st andrews in the reign of king james v with salaries for a principal or warden four professors of philosophy and eight poor scholars a professor of philology was added by sir john scot of scotstarvet with a liberal salary he also augmented the library very considerably and sir john wedderburn at his death left a great collection of books to it forduns ms of the scottish history is in this library  the new college was founded by archbishop bethune uncle to the cardinal of that name with endowments for a principal and professor of divinity and some students in the same faculty for no philosophy is taught in this college  these last two colleges having a better revenue to support them than that of st salvator are in much better repair in the latter king charles i held a parliament in a large spacious room able to seat  00 persons in regular order and it still retains the name of the parliament room  a professor of mathematics was of late years added to this university as was also not long since a professor of medicine with a handsome endowment by his grace james duke of chandos whom the university upon the death of the duke of athol in gratitude chose to be their chancellor which office is during life and to that alone and that of his vice chancellor belongs the conferring of all university degrees  mr james gregory professor of mathematics in this university famous for his knowledge in that science has erected in the college gardens a commodious observatory and furnished it with good mathematical instruments  it has produced many learned men among others the famous lord napier who invented the logarithms sir robert murray sir andrew balfour and the great lawyer sir george mackenzie  the harbor here has suffered so much by the encroachments of the sea that i fear it will never be sufficiently repaired the pier is founded upon a rock of freestone in length about   0 feet but this rock extends itself into the sea  00 feet further on the point of which stands a beacon and the great rolling of the sea breaking over the rock between the pierend and this beacon makes the harbor very dangerous in the year      it was proposed to be repaired and the pier carried as far as the beacon and a brief was granted for that purpose but the collections were too small to make any great advances  by all we have said it will appear that this ancient city and its university too are in a very declining state the archbishops seat and ecclesiastical courts kept there beside the great resort of pilgrims to the convents brought great business thither which being now disused and one new college erected at edinburgh and another at aberdeen contribute much to the decay of both the city enjoys still some privileges by the original charter yet extant whereby it was incorporated by king david anno       from st andrews we proceeded on to two very agreeable seats belonging to the present earl of leven one called melvil and the other balgony melvil is a regular and beautiful building after the model of sir william bruces house at kinross described before balgony is an ancient seat formerly belonging to the family of lessly and if not built was enlarged and repaired by general alexander lessly noted for his services in germany under gustavus adolphus king of sweden and at last against king charles i  the river leven runs hard by the walls of the house and makes the situation very pleasant the park is large but not well planted at least the trees do not thrive  from hence we went north to cowpar the shire town and turned to the northeast part of the country to see the ruins of the famous monastery of balmerinoch of which mr camden takes notice but we saw nothing worth our observation the very ruins being almost eaten up by time the monastery was founded by queen ermengred wife of king william of scotland  hence we came to the bank of another firth called the firth of tay which opening to a large breadth at its entrance as the firth of edinburgh does draws in afterward as that does at the queensferry and makes a ferry over at the breadth of two miles to the town of dundee and then the firth widening again just as that of the forth does also continues its breadth from four to six miles till it comes almost to perth as the other does to sterling  this river tay is without exception the largest river in scotland though not of the longest course for it rises out of the mountains near the edge of argyllshire and running first north into the district of braidalbin there receiving many other rivers spreads itself into a large lake called lough tay extending near  0 miles in length and traversing the very heart of scotland comes into the sea near this place now as i design to keep in this part of my work to the east coast of the country i must for the present quit the tay keeping a little on the hither side of it and go back to that part of the country which lies to the south and east of dumbarton or lenoxshire so drawing an imaginary line from sterlingbridge due north through the heart of the country to inverness which i take to lie almost due north and south  in this course i moved from the ferry mentioned above to perth lying upon the same tay but on the hither bank it was formerly called johnston or st johns town from an old church dedicated to the evangelist st john which is still remaining and so big as to make two parochial churches and can serve the whole town for their public worship  perth is the second town of scotland for dignity near it stood anciently the town of berth which being overflowed by an inundation of the tay occasioned the building of this where it now stands  the chief business of this town at present is the linen manufacture which is so considerable here that all the neighboring country is employed in it and it is the wealth of the whole place the tay is navigable up to the town for ships of good burden and they ship off here vast quantities of linen for england  the salmon taken here and all over the tay are extremely good and the quantity prodigious they carry them to edinburgh and to all the towns where they have no salmon and barrel up great quantities for exportation the merchants of this town have also a considerable trade to the baltic and norway  this town was for some time the seat of the late rebellion but by a peculiar felicity the townsmen got so much money by both parties that they have ever since been enriched by it as appears not only from particular families but from the public and private buildings which they have raised since that time particularly a new tolbooth or town hall  it will seem a little strange to us in the south that any place should be enriched by a rebellion but a few words will explain it it must be observed that the pretender and his troops having their quarters hereabouts a considerable time occasioned a great consumption of victuals and drink which are so plentiful in these parts that it is frequent for towns to petition the government to have regiments of soldiers quartered upon them though in england nothing gives greater uneasiness  again as the pretender was here and at scone it occasioned a great confluence of persons of note who gathered about him waiting the issue of his fortunes till they found the storm gathering from the south and no probable means to resist it and then they shifted off as they could  while they resided here lodgings in the town let at such a rate as was never known before provisions were dear trade brisk and had it lasted two or three months longer it would have made all the towns rich in the neighborhood  when this cloud was dispersed the victors entered new officers succeeded the routed party still the head quarters were here and afterward the dutch troops continued here most part of the winter all this while the money flowed in and the town made their market on both sides they were gainers even by war and foreigners  the linen trade which we have mentioned before has mightily increased since the act of parliament in england for suppressing the use of printed calicoes in the room of which scotch and irish linens have been bought and printed in england so that the worsted and silk weavers in london seem to have had very little benefit by the act  at ardock in perthshire are the remains of a roman camp and near perth is a roman way where several medals sepulchral urns and other monuments of antiquity have been found  from perth i went south to that part which they call clackmanan lying west from dumfermling and extending itself toward sterling and dumblain none of which part i had gone over before  northeastward from perth to brechen lies a vale which they call strathmore esteemed the most fruitful in corn of all that part of the country here are a great many gentlemens seats though on the northside of the tay particularly the noble palace of glames the hereditary seat of the family of lion earls of strathmore the heir in reversion now enjoys the title and estate though it very narrowly escaped being forfeited for the elder brother entertained here the pretender very magnificently making up for him and his retinue fourscore and eight beds and afterward espoused his cause so strenuously that he lost his life in his service at the battle of sheriffmuir the estate being entailed descended to the second son or younger brother who is now earl of strathmore  it is one of the finest oldbuilt palaces in scotland and by far the largest when you see it at a distance it is so full of turrets and lofty buildings spires and towers some plain others shining with gilded tops that it looks not like a town but a city and the appearances seen through the long vistas of the park are so different that you would not think it the same house any two ways together  the great avenue is a full half mile planted on either side with several rows of trees when you come to the outer gate you are surprised with the beauty and variety of the statues and busts some of stone some of brass some gilded some plain the statues in brass are four one of king james vi one of king charles i booted and spurred as if going to take horse at the head of his army one of king charles ii habited like that in the royal exchange london and one of king james vii after the pattern of that which is at whitehall  from hence i came away southwest and crossing the tay below perth but above dundee came at last to dumblain a town pleasantly situated on the banks of the river allan but without any sort of trade it contains the ruins of a church of excellent workmanship but within our own memory it was made famous by the battle fought between the army of king george i under the command of the duke of argyll and the pretenders forces under the earl of mar on sheriffmuir between this place and sterling we took a full view of the field of battle and could not but reflect with surprise that a rabble of highlanders appearing in rebellion armed in haste and headed by a person of no experience in war should come so near to the overthrowing an army of regular disciplined troops and led on by experienced officers and so great a general  from hence i proceeded on in sight of sterlingbridge but leaving it on the right hand turned away east to alloway where the earl of mar had a noble seat and where the navigation of the firth of forth begins this is as i hinted before within four miles of sterling by land and scarcely within    by water occasioned by those uncommon meanders and reaches in the river which gives so beautiful a prospect from the castle of sterling  this fine seat was formerly called the castle of alloway but is now so completely modernized that no appearance of a castle remains  the gardens of alloway house are by much the finest in scotland and not outdone by any in england consisting of above  0 acres of ground and the adjoining wood which is adapted to the house in avenues and vistas above three times as much  here is a harbor where ships of burden safely ride the glasgow merchants have erected warehouses to which they bring their tobacco and sugars by land and then ship them for holland or hamburgh or the baltic or england as they find the market  the high street of alloway reaches down to this harbor and is a very spacious well built street with rows of trees finely planted all the way here are several testimonies of the goodness of their trade as particularly a large dealyard or place for laying up all sorts of norway goods which shows that they have a commerce thither they have large warehouses of naval stores such as pitch tar hemp flax two sawing mills for cutting or slitting of deals and a ropewalk for making all sorts of ropes and cables for rigging and fitting ships with several other things which convinces us they are no strangers to other trades as well by sea as land  east from alloway is a small county called clackmannanshire from the head burgh and is part of fife the country is plain the soil fertile most of it proper for pasture and what lies below the orchilhills producing corn very well but the shire is chiefly known for yielding the best of coal and the greatest quantity of it of any country of scotland so that it is carried not only to edinburgh but also to england holland and france but while the freight from scotland is so dear and the tax in england so heavy the price of these coals must always be so high at london as will not fail to restrain the consumption  on this shore of the firth farther down stands the neat and agreeable town of culross lying in length by the waterside like kirkaldy being likewise a trading town as trade must be understood in scotland here is a pretty market a plentiful country behind it and the navigable firth before it the coal the linen manufacture and plenty of corn will always keep something of trade alive upon the whole coast  here is a very noble seat belonging to the bruces earls of kincairn and is well worth a travellers notice and indeed these instances of magnificence are so frequent in scotland that were we to dwell upon each of them such of our readers as know nothing of scotland would be apt to think we were too partial in its favor but it is certain that no gentry or nobility in the world exceeded the scots while an independent kingdom in noble houses and all manner of magnificence as their families for antiquity of descent hardly have any equals in any one country on earth  culross is a royal burgh in the shire of perth but in the confines of fife famous for a branch of the iron manufacture in making girdles i e broad round plates on which they bake their oaten cakes they told me of mines of copper and of lead lately discovered in fife and of silver also but i could not learn that any of them were actually wrought it is however not improbable but that there are such mines and particularly the two lomons which are remarkable mountains in this shire seem to promise metal in their bowels if they were thoroughly searched they rise up like two sugarloaves in the middle of a plain country not far from falkland and give a view of the firth of edinburgh south and the firth of tay north and are seen from edinburgh very plain  having made this little excursion to the south from perth you may suppose me now returned northward again and we proceeded to scone that ancient seat of royal ceremony where almost all the kings of scotland were crowned since the conquest of the picts  the celebrated wooden chair with the stone in it was brought away from hence as is well known by the victorious king edward i and placed in westminsterabbey where it now is but the scottish royal blood succeeding to the english crown in the person of king james i of england and vi of scotland verified the following prophetic distich though at the time it was accounted no small loss and disgrace to the kingdom the lines were these ni fallat fatum scoti quocunque locatum invenient lapidem regnare tenentur ibidem thus translated by the scots unless old prophets fail and wizards wit decay wherever this stone is found the scots shall reign for ay   it is said to have been first dignified by k kenneth who having fought a bloody battle here with the picts in which he gave them a great overthrow sat down to rest him upon this stone after he had been tired with the slaughter of the enemy upon which his nobles came round him to congratulate his success and in honor to his valor crowned him with a garland of victory from whence he dedicated the stone to the coronation of all the future kings of scotland hoping from this omen that they should like him be victorious over all their enemies  but the better sort of scots historians say their kings brought it from ireland into icolmkill in the isles and from thence to scone or scoon when they had subdued the picts  the palace of scoon though ancient is not so much decayed as those i have already spoken of and the pretender found it very well in repair for his use here he lived and kept his court in all the state and appearance of a sovereign but it was a shortlived splendour for in  0 days he was obliged to quit the kingdom by the advance of the royal army in this palace is the longest gallery in scotland and the ceiling painted but the painting very old  the building is large the front being above  00 feet it has two extraordinary fine square courts besides others which contain the offices outhouses etc the royal apartments are spacious and large but the whole building is entirely after the ancient manner  from scoon to dunkeld is so little a way that we could not help visiting it being the place where a skirmish was fought between the forces of king william after the revolution and some of the viscount of dundees men who pursued the kings forces as they were obliged to retire from gillicranky after lord dundee himself had been killed there the duke of athol has a noble old house here in one of the courts of which that part of the action happened  here was formerly a beautiful and magnificent cathedral church dedicated to st columba the seat of a bishop whose chapter or prebendaries were culdees or black monks but they are now dissolved and most part of the church in ruins  dunkeld is the chief market town of the highlands and supposed to have been formerly the chief town of caledonia it is situated on the northside of the tay at the foot of the grampian hills and is surrounded with pleasant woods  upon the river tay also lies errol the seat of the earl of that name chief of the ancient family of hay who derive their origin from a famous peasant who in the reign of kenneth iii being at plough with his two sons and perceiving the scots fleeing before the danes he and his two sons stopped their flight renewed the battle and gained the victory for which they had the lands of errol bestowed upon them and the family arms is three bloody shields supported by two naked men with yokes in remembrance of this famous victory the father and two sons having no other weapons when they put themselves at the head of the flying scots but the yokes they took from their ploughs of this family are besides the earls of errol the marquis of tweedale the earl of kinnoul etc  but our determined rout lay up the eastern shore and through the shires adjacent on that side as particularly angus mearns mar aberdeen buchan and so as i laid it out before to inverness  mr camden tells us that the firth of tay was the utmost boundary of the roman empire in britain that julius agricola the best of generals under domitian the worst of emperors though he pierced farther and traversed by land into the heart of the highlands yet seeing no end of a barbarous country and no advantage by the conquest of it withdrew and here fixed the roman eagles that he frequently harassed the picts by excursions and inroads but always returned to his post here making the tay his frontier  but our english caesars have outgone the romans for edward i as is said before passed the tay and rifled the abbey at scoon and if we may believe history penetrated into the remotest parts which however i take to be only the remotest parts of what was then known to the english for as to the highlands the mountains of loquhaber ross murray sutherland and caithness we read nothing of them from these retreats the scots always returned antaeus like with double strength after every defeat till in the next reign they overthrew his successor edward ii at bannockbourn and drove the english out of the whole country following them over tweed into england and ravaging the counties of northumberland and cumberland  oliver cromwell indeed according to the motto of a noble house in scotland rode through penetrated to the remotest part of the island and that he might even literally rule it with a rod of iron built citadels and forts in all the angles and extremes where he found it needful to place his stationary legions just as the romans did as at leith at st andrews at inverness perth air and several other places we have since seen the forces of king george i making the same rout nay ferrying over into the western and northwestern islands here again imitating the prudence of the old romans who employed their soldiery in mending roads and making causeways over mountains that were before thought inaccessible  where armies have marched there is room enough no doubt for travelers with this assurance therefore we cheerfully crossed the tay  we left strathern with the little country of menteith for our return and went down into angus to dundee a pleasant large populous city which as it stands well for trade so it has as large a share of it as most towns in scotland and that as well foreign as domestic  it is exceeding populous full of stately houses and large handsome streets particularly four very good ones with a large marketplace in the middle the largest and fairest in scotland except that of aberdeen  the inhabitants have a very large correspondence with england and ship off a great deal of linen thither and a great quantity of corn is sent from hence to england as well as to holland they have likewise a good share of the norway trade and as they are concerned in the herring fishery they consequently have some east country trade viz to dantzick koningsberg riga etc they send ships also to sweden and import iron copper tar pitch deals etc from the several trading ports of that kingdom  the country behind them called the carse or the carse of gowry with the vale mentioned above of strathmore abounds in corn which the port of dundee ships off in large quantities when a crop allows it to the great advantage of the gentlemen as well as farmers for as the gentlemen receive all their rents in kind they would find a great difficulty sometimes to dispose of it if the merchants here did not ship it off either for london or amsterdam  the town of dundee stands at a little distance from the tay but they are joined by a causeway or walk well paved with flat freestone such as the sideways in cheapside and cornhill and rows of trees are planted on either side of the walk which makes it very agreeable on one part of this walk are very good warehouses for merchandises especially for heavy goods and also granaries for corn of which sometimes they have a vast quantity laid up here and these being near the harbor are convenient as well for the housing of goods when landed as for the easy shipping off what lies for exportation  the harbor of dundee was formerly very good and safe but of late years became so ruinous and choked up with sand that it would not contain as anciently ships of burden except at the highest tides and its piers were so out of repair that ships could not lie in it with safety at the same time the tolbooth and public gaol were so much decayed that they were obliged to be pulled down and the town being greatly in debt besides could not rebuild the same wherefore to answer all these good purposes and to pave the streets discharge their debts and provide salaries for schoolmasters to instruct their children an act passed anno      for continuing the duties imposed by a former act then near expired of twopenies scots upon every pint of ale and beer sold within the town and its privileges for    years longer and the inhabitants now reap the benefit of it and will still more when the proposed works are absolutely perfected  this town was stormed and plundered of great riches by cromwell and the english army  the great church was formerly collegiate and a very large building but part of it was demolished in the civil war the remainder is divided into three churches for the present use of the citizens  they have also a meeting house or two for the episcopal worship for you are to take it once for all that north of tay there are far more of the episcopal persuasion than are to be found in the south and the farther north the more so  the tower upon the great church here is a handsome square building large and ancient and very high and is a good ornament to the city it resembles the great tower upon the cathedral of canterbury but not quite so high there is a fine and wellendowed hospital for decayed townsmen of dundee where they are well taken care of and provided for the pretender was in this city soon after his landing and staid here some time before he advanced to scoon  it was the birthplace of hector boethius the scots historian a man famous in his time and whose work was anciently more in esteem than of late it gave the title of viscount to graham of clavers who commanded the forces that appeared for the late king james at the revolution and was killed at the battle of gillicranky which i have mentioned  near to dundee in the mouth of the river lies brochtycraig formerly wellfortifyd and noted now for a noble salmonfishery in its neighborhood  it is  0 scots miles from dundee to montrose the way pleasant the country fruitful and filled with gentlemens houses among these is the noble palace of panmure forfeited in the late rebellion by the unfortunate earl of that name who was wounded in the fight near dumblain the surname of the family is maul and maulsburgh a small town near montrose is called from it  the town and port of montrose was our next stage standing upon the eastmost shore of angus open to the german or the caledonian ocean and at the mouth of the little river of southesk which makes the harbor  this town is well situated for trade and has a good harbor and the inhabitants always carried on an advantageous trade with norway but as it was still capable of great improvements were a dock to be made for the convenience of shipping and if good fresh water could be procured for it of which it stood in very great want and the two hills that defend the town against inundations having also suffered by tempests the corporation procured an act anno      for laying a duty of twopenies scots upon every pint of ale etc sold within the town and its privileges for effecting these good purposes  the town is adorned with fine buildings and has an hospital for the poorer inhabitants it gives title of duke as it did formerly of earl and marquis to the chief of the ancient and noble family of graham  the french fleet first made land at this port when they had the pretender on board in the reign of queen anne having overshot the mouth of the firth so far whither they at first designed but this mistake which some thought a misfortune was certainly a deliverance to them for as on one hand it gave time to the english fleet to come up with them before they could enter the firth so it left them time and room also to make their escape which if they had gone up the firth they could never have done but must inevitably have been burnt and destroyed or taken by the british fleet under sir george byng which was superior to them in force  the royal burgh of aberbrothock on this coast besides being famous for the stately ruins of the greatest abbey in scotland deserves to be mentioned for its convenient situation for trade which induced some years since the inhabitants to lay the foundation of a new harbor the old one being so decayed that it was hazardous even for small vessels to sail into it but the work exceeding their abilities they procured contributions toward so good a design but still all proving short of what was requisite to complete the work and the town having run itself into debt by what it had done and at the same time the public streets and causeways as well as the townhouse and gaol being in a very ruinous condition they procured an act to pass in the   th of king george ii for laying a duty of twopenies scots upon every scots pint of ale or beer sold within the town and liberties which was to commence in may      and to continue for    years for bringing to effect these good purposes and we may say that of late so many of these acts have passed that scotland will in a few years if harassed by no intestine broils and continuing in peace make a better figure than it has done for centuries past  the abbey was formerly endowed with great revenues by king william i who was buried here under a stately monument  in the inner parts of the shire to the westward is forfar the county town and brechin formerly a bishops see made so by k david and where some part of a small cathedral is still standing it is seated upon the river southesk over which it has a stately bridge of two arches and is considerable for its salmon and cattlemarkets it is also memorable for a great victory obtained here over the danes by the chief of the family of keith earl marshall who having killed their general was advanced to great honors by malcolm ii there was a high stone erected over the grave of the danish general which is still called camuss cross from his name and at  0 miles distance is another cross over the grave of another eminent danish warrior and both of them have antique letters and pictures upon them  from montrose the shore lies due north to aberdeen in the way is the castle of dunnoter once a strong fortification upon an high precipice of a rock the castle was surrounded with invincible walls said the honest scot who showed us the road to it having towers at proper distances after the old way of fortifying towns the earl marshall of the name of keith was lord of this castle as also of a good house near it and a great estate but what he had is now gone for being in the rebellion his estate was forfeited and his lordship making his escape went into the service of spain in which he still continues but we ought to observe that his brother going into the service of russia made such a figure there that he is a lieutenant general in that empire and greatly esteemed for his personal bravery and conduct this gentleman making lately a visit to england was received with great marks of distinction and favor by the court and nobility and may be truly said to be one of the best generals that the late czarina who yet had many excellent commanders had reason to boast of  dunnoter castle is now demolished it is situated in the shire of kincardin called the merns the county is noted for its timber having in it upwards of five millions of firtrees besides vast numbers of other kinds planted within these  0 years by the gentry at and about their seats and which they are yearly adding to and improving kincardin was formerly the countytown but that advantage now by statute belongs to stonehyne  innerbervy on the coast was made a royal burgh by king alexander iii  paldykirk so called from palladius first bishop of the scots is noted for its annual three days fair the principal commodity brought to it is coarse cloth which is commonly transported to the netherlands  on the lands of arbuthie and redeloak are some trenches to be seen cast up by the danes at one of their invasions and round the hill of urie is a deep ditch where the scots encamped  fordun lies also in this county famous in ancient times for the relics of the aforesaid st palladius it is also noted for being the surname of john fordun the scots historian author of the book called the scots chronicon to which all succeeding historians of this nation have been much obliged  the earl marshall was hereditary sheriff of this country  we proceeded then to aberdeen a place so eminent that it commands some stay upon it it stands at the mouth of two rivers and is divided into two towns or cities one called the new the other the old aberdeen about a mile distant from each other one situate on the river don the other on the river dee from whence they are more properly called aberdon and aberdeen  aberdon or the old town lies a mile northward from aberdeen or the new town and is sometimes called bonaccord from its motto it is situated in the mouth of the river don which is remarkable for the multitude of salmon and perch taken in it  the old town must without doubt be very ancient for they tell us the new aberdeen is supposed to be upwards of   00 years old though none of their registers mention the particular time of its being built or by whom the cities are not equally situated for trade one of the rivers being broader than the other and it is the common opinion that part of the old city called the monastery was washed down by the sea so that it obliged the citizens to build farther off that accordingly they built the new aberdeen upon the bank of the other river upon a piece of hilly ground but this is all conjecture and has probability only for its support  old aberdeen was formerly the bishops seat and has a cathedral commonly called st machars a large and stately structure which was anciently much more magnificent it suffered greatly at the time of the reformation and more since the revolution  the chief ornament of this town is the kings college on the south side of it a neat and stately structure  the church and steeple are built of hewn stone and the summit of the latter resembles an imperial crown the windows of the church were formerly esteemed for their paintings and something of their splendour still remains in the steeple are two bells of extraordinary bigness besides others  close to the church is a library well furnished with books  this college was founded by bishop elphinston in the year   00 and the greatest part built by him but king james iv taking the patronage upon him it was called the kings college the bull for it was procured from pope alexander vi in    0 endowing it with as ample privileges as those of paris and bononia  there are in this college a principal a subprincipal who is also one of the regents three other regents or professors of philosophy a professor of humanity or philology a professor of divinity a doctor of physic a professor of the oriental tongues a professor of the civil law and a professor of the mathematics dr frazer has lately been a great benefactor to it  new aberdeen is about a mile distant as we have said from the old situated at the mouth of the river dee it is the county town and by consequence the seat of the sheriffs courts it exceeds all the cities in the north of scotland for largeness extent and beauty it stands in a wholesome air has a great revenue from its salmonfishery and the inhabitants are generally very courteous it stands upon three hills the main part upon the highest and the skirts of it extend into the plain the houses are neatly built are generally four stories high or more and have for the most part gardens and orchards belonging to them which makes the city pleasant and healthful and the prospect of it beautiful at a distance  from a round hill at the west end of the city flow two springs one of clear water and another with water which in taste and quality comes very near the spaw in germany dr william barclay wrote a treatise concerning it  in the high street is a church built of freestone and good architecture  in this city stands the marshal college founded by george earl marshal in the year      to which the city has added many buildings at their own charge  in this college which is a distinct university of itself are a principal four professors of philosophy a professor of divinity and a professor of mathematics and there is lately added a professor of physic it has a very good library which was founded by the city enlarged by the gifts of several learned men and furnished with mathematical instruments  in this city is also a grammar school founded by dr dune having one master and three ushers there is also a music school  the church called st nicolass is a handsome edifice of freestone with a lofty steeple resembling a pyramid it was formerly divided into three churches the body of this church is adorned with a tower and a steeple with pinacles  here is also a prison and a workhouse belonging to the town likewise an almshouse and three hospitals and near the harbor stands the customhouse the marketplace is very beautiful and spacious and the streets adjoining are very handsome and most of the houses are built of stone four stories high with handsome sashwindows and are very well furnished within the citizens here being as gay as genteel and perhaps as rich as in any city in scotland  the bridge at old aberdeen over the don consists of one immense arch of stone sprung from two rocks one on each side which serve as a buttment to the arch so that it may be said to have a foundation coeval with nature and which will last as long the other bridge is upon the river dee west above new aberdeen and has seven very stately arches  the people of aberdeen and indeed of almost all this country are generally of the episcopal persuasion so that were it not for the legal establishment the presbyterian preachers would have but few hearers and slender incomes almost every parish has a meeting house where the liturgy is read at aberdeen and peterhead they have beautiful chapels and even organs  near the city is a stately stone bridge of seven arches over the dee built by bishop gawin dumbar  the air of this county to those who were born in a hotter seems cold but is in itself healthful and temperate the winter is milder than can be expected from such a climate which seems a wonder to danes poles and prussians when they come into this country and consider that with them during the winter there is nothing but perpetual frost and snow the soil in general is not unfruitful if duly cultivated it produces wheat rye barley oats in abundance pease and beans nor do they want roots and herbs for food and physic and foreign plants grow very well there as daily experience testifies the mountainous part of the county affords very good pasturage and the other as good corn  the adjoining sea not only furnishes them with plenty of fish but reproaches them with their negligence when they see the dutch fleets continually fishing on the coasts from whence they reap great gain but it is the humor of the inhabitants to apply themselves to the salmonfishing and to neglect that of all other sorts  the quantity of salmon and perches taken in both rivers is a kind of prodigy the proprietors are united into a company there being so many shares of which no person can enjoy above one at a time the profits are very considerable the salmon being sent abroad into different parts of the world particularly into england france the baltic and several other places  the herringfishing is a common blessing to all this shore of scotland and is like the indies at their door were it properly used by the scots in general but i must observe that by this however the merchants of aberdeen are able to carry on a trade to dantzick and koningsberg riga and narva wybourgh and stockholm  they have also a very good manufacture of linen and likewise of worsted stockens which they send to england in great quantities and of which they make some so fine that i have seen them sold for     0 and  0 shillings a pair they also send them over to holland and into the north and east seas in large quantities  they have also a particular export here of pork pickled and packed up in barrels which they sell chiefly to the dutch for the victualling their east india ships and their men of war the aberdeen pork having the reputation of being the best cured for keeping on very long voyages of any in europe  they export also corn and meal but they generally bring it from the firth of murray or cromarty the corn coming from about inverness where they have great quantities  in a word the people of aberdeen are universal merchants so far as the trade of the northern part of the world will extend and it may be esteemed the third city in scotland that is the next after edinburgh and glasgow  this shire contains in it mar with its appurtenances birse glentaner glenmuick strathdee strathdon braes of mar and cromar most part of buchan formartin garioch and strathbogy  the latter is a large and ancient barony watered by the rivers dovern and bogy it was erected into an earldom by king james vi in favor of the chief of the noble and ancient family of gordon whom he afterward created marquis of huntley strathbogy is very fruitful in corn and pasturage and is remarkable for the fine linenyarn spun by the women there and sold to the merchant  it is mostly inhabited by gordons vassals to the duke of gordon who has a magnificent castle here called strathbogy from the name of the county there are of this name besides the duke the earls of sutherland aboyn aberdeen and late viscount of kenmure likewise a great many gentlemen of note in other parts of the kingdom  the county of mar gave title of earl to the chief of the family of erskine the sheriffdom is the kings gift  in aberdeenshire are quarries of spotted marble and slate and pearls are found in their rivers of a large size and fine color  there was formerly a mint at aberdeen as appears by several pieces of coin with the aberdeae upon them kept in the closets of the curious  other towns in this county are   kintore a royal burgh on the don which gives the title of earl to a branch of the family of keith   inverary made a royal burgh by king robert bruce   peterhead with a good harbor   we ought not to omit that on the  0th of october      an accidental fire broke out in aberdeen whereby the commissaryclerks office was suddenly consumed and at the same time the registers and records of all testaments and confirmations all acts of curacy judicial deeds and other writs and evidences etc were entirely burnt and destroyed which unhappy accident being likely to be attended with pernicious effects to persons rights and properties an act passed   george i for supplying the records so burnt or lost and another in the  th of the same reign for making the former more effectual  the town of aberdeen had suffered much by the public commotions in scotland after the revolution took place so that an act for laying the duty of twopenies scots on every scots pint of ale and beer sold within the town etc had been imposed by the scottish parliament in      and continued by the same in   0  for enabling them to discharge the debts incurred on that occasion and the last act being near expired and debts still remaining unpaid an act passed      for continuing the said duties for the following good purposes viz for paying off the remaining debts of the town for building a new pier on the northside of the harbor for repairing the old pier on the south side which was very much sunk and decayed for repairing the great church called the old church which was in a very decayed condition for rebuilding the townhouse which was also in a very bad state and for maintaining and carrying on other public works for the benefit of the town this act is to remain in force for    years and it may be easily judged that the town of aberdeen will be much improved when the proposed works are all absolutely completed  from aberdeen the coast goes on to a point of land which is the farthest northeast part of britain and is called by the sailors buchanness being in the shire or county of buchan part of which belongs to aberdeenshire it was to this point the french squadron with the pretender on board in the reign of queen anne kept their flight in sight of the shore being thus far pursued by sir george byng with the english fleet but from hence they steered away northeast as if for the norway coast when the english admiral seeing no probability of coming up with them gave over the chase but they altered their course in the night stood away south and came back to dunkirk whence they set out  on the south side of the water of eugic stands peterhead with a road which will hold  00 sail of ships and at this place it is high water when the moon is directly south in many places of this shire are great stones placed circularly one of the largest in the middle toward the south which have the air of places of worship in the ages of heathenism the dropping cave of slanes is very remarkable of the petrified substance whereof is made excellent lime  this country however remote is full of nobility and gentry and their seats are seen even unto the extremest shores the family of frazer carries its name to frazerburgh in the very northermost point of the country ereskines earls of mar had their familyseat at kildrummy in the county of mar a little south of this part of the county where the late unhappy earl first set up his standard for the pretender the hayes earls of errol are in buchan and the family of forbes lord forbes and forbes lord pitsligo are still farther and the latter on the very shore of the caledonian ocean the gordons and keiths are very numerous also in these parts  mr camden relates that on the coast of this country a great piece of amber was driven on shore by the force of the sea as big to use his own words as an horse i shall add nothing to the story because it is hard to give credit to it it is enough that i name my author for i could not learn from the inhabitants that they ever saw any more of it  i ought not to omit innerury belonging to garioch in aberdeenshire being the scotsmans boast for here robert bruce though sick and carried in a horselitter defeated john cummins and those who adhered to him in favor of edward i of england who held scotland in subjection this was the first victory king robert obtained and laid the foundation of the overthrow of the english usurpation in scotland near the same place also in      alexander steuart earl of mar defeated donald of the isles in the bloody battle of the harlow  from hence the east shore of scotland being at an end the land tends away due west and the shire of bamff beginning you see the towns of bamff elgin frazersburg and the famous monastery of kinloss where the murdered body of king duff was after many years dug up and discovered to be his by various tokens  the shire of bamff deserves some notice for the following particulars for that in it is situated strathyla which drives a great trade in lime and fat cattle and it abounds so with limestone that they build their houses with it they carry on a trade in fine linen also by means of their weekly markets at keith a neighboring village upon the banks of the spey which runs through this county lies the bog of gicht now called gordon castle the noblest palace in the north being the duke of gordons chief seat adorned with pleasant gardens and a great park the castle appears so large that it looks more like a town than a noblemans seat the duke is proprietor of this part of the county strathave is the paternal inheritance of his family and his grace has a fine estate and other seats hereabouts the late duke had a little embroiled himself with the affairs of      and his son then marquis of huntley still more but got off without a forfeiture by his prudence and good fortune  the town of cullen an ancient royal burgh stands in the shire of bamff it is chiefly noted for its fruitful soil and salmonfishing for having no port it has little trade except for its corn and salmon  the shire itself takes name from bamff a burgh royal seated at the mouth of doverne in the boyne where the sheriff holds his courts in it are the ruins of an old castle near which is the abbey of deer formerly belonging to the cistercian monks and founded by william cumin earl of buchan in belvenie is found the stone of which alum is made and in the county of boyne great quarries of spotted marble have been discovered  buchan is part in aberdeenshire part in the shire of bamff one of its principal towns is frazersburgh and peterhead is another the latter is a good market town with a port and small harbor with two little piers for fishing but being so near aberdeen has not those helps and advantages that might be otherwise probably given to it so that at low water it is all dry and the smallest ships lie aground in it  the earl of saltoun has very lately built      at frazersburgh a most excellent new pier and bulwark all of freestone which renders that harbor as safe and commodious as any on the east coast so that  0 ships may winter there at once with great safety the water at full sea is    or  0 feet  from the point of land called buchanness the ships begin their accounts for their several voyages what they call their departure as in england they do from wintertonness on the northeast part of norfolk and from the downs for the voyages to the southward  from fifeness which is the northermost point on the mouth of edinburgh firth being the southermost land of fife to this point of buchanness the land lies almost due north and south and the shore is the eastermost land of scotland the distance between them is    leagues   mile which is just  00 miles though the mariners say that measuring by the sea it is but    and from wintertonness near yarmouth to this point called buchanness is just  00 miles  the river or firth of tay opens into the sea about four leagues north from fifeness and as there is a lighthouse on the isle of may as i have said before in the mouth of the firth of forth at edinburgh a little south of this point called fifeness there are likewise two lighthouses at the entrance of the firth of tay for the directions of the sailors when they are bound into that river and particularly for their avoiding the two sands which lie off from the south side of the entrance  buchanness is generally also the first land of great britain which the ships make in their voyages home from archangel in russia or from their whalefishing voyages to greenland and spitsbergen in the north seas and near this point at pitsligo a great ship was cast away in queen elizabeths time bound home from archangel having on board the first ambassador sent by the great duke of muscovy to any of the christian princes of europe he being commissioned to treat with queen elizabeth for a league of peace and commerce he likewise lost a most valuable present designed for the queen of rich and costly furrs in those days reputed inestimable the ambassador was happily saved and brought on shore by the people of pitsligo but the ship and all the goods were lost  from this point of easterly land all that great bay or inlet of the sea reaching quite to the north of scotland is called murray firth and the northermost point is dungsbyhead which is the northeast point of caithness and opens to pentland firth by pentland firth you are to understand the passage of the sea beyond caithness between scotland and the isles of orkney what is called murray firth is not like many others the mouth of a river as that of edinburgh or tay but is an open bay in the sea as the bay of biscay or the gulf of mexico are and reaches as i have said from petershead to dungsbyhead opposite to the orkneys the distance of    miles but it is almost twice as far by land because of the depth of that bay which obliges us to travel from pitsligo west near  0 miles till we come to inverness  this county of buchan is more to be taken notice of from what is to be seen on the sea shore than in the land for the country is mountainous and in some places not very fertile but as we coasted along west we came into a much better country particularly the shires of bamff which i have already mentioned elgin and the county of murray from whence the bay i just now described is called murray firth  murray is a pleasant country the soil fruitful watered with fine rivers and full of good towns and gentlemens seats more than could be expected in so remote a part of the kingdom  this country is a plain for between  0 and  0 miles together and the soil is by that means rendered more fruitful and rich and the temperature of the air more softened than in other parts of scotland insomuch that the harvest here and in the vale of strathbogy and all the country to inverness is observed to be more early than in northumberland nay than in derbyshire and even some parts of the more southerly counties in england as particularly in the east of kent and sussex as a confirmation of this i affirm that i have seen the new wheat of this country and inverness brought to market to edinburgh before the wheat at edinburgh has been fit to reap and yet the harvest about edinburgh is thought to be as forward as in most parts even of england itself in a word it is usual in murray and the country about it to begin with their harvest in the month of july and it is not very unusual to have new corn fully ripe and threshd out shipped off and brought to edinburgh to sale within the month of august  the river lossie in this county is famous for salmon there being annually pickled and exported from  0 to  00 lasts all taken in a few months of the summer and in a space of one mile at a village called germach it abounds with fish to the very head but still the greatest quantity is used for home consumption and taken either with hooked tridents by day or wicker baskets or little boats covered with hides by night none but the natives who are used to them will venture into those boats the common drink in these parts is ale and sometimes beer and they have good french wine very cheap as i and my company experienced but the inhabitants prefer aqua vitae of their own extracting from aledregs and spices to much richer wines than the french of this they drink plentifully themselves and are very liberal of it to their friends and a bottle of this liquor and some cheese will make a murray man undertake the greatest winterjourneys without wishing for any other provision  this county is divided into two shires the greater called the shire of elgin the other the shire of nairn the town of nairn lies on the mouth of the river of that name along which lie the seats of many persons of quality  near the castle of caddel or calder on that river is a vein of freestone and many signs of copper  tarnaway castle on the river findorn in this county is an old castle and seat belonging to the earls of murray  a little lower on the other side stands the burgh of forress in an exceeding pleasant situation the kings of scotland formerly resided here in a castle that is now gone to ruin and lower formerly stood the noble abbey of kinloss  on the road to forress is a large pillar of one stone being a monument of a victory obtained by king malcolm mac kenneth over sueno king of denmark the inscription is now worn out betwixt this place and elgin are numberless seats of the quality  in this rich county on the river lossie which rises a few miles above it and empties itself into the sea a few miles below it lies elgin formerly a bishops see it is situated in a very fruitful soil though somewhat sandy the ruins of the castle are still to be seen on the east end of the town though demolished so long ago as the wars of the danes there was a noble cathedral here which for largeness splendour magnificence and workmanship had hardly its equal in the kingdom the usual place of residence of the bishop was at the castle of spynie within a mile of the town a very noble seat with fine gardens and woods  but though the town of elgin has reason to be proud of its situation it was not very rich in its town revenues for it had long labored under heavy and burdensome debts which being increased by the rebellion in      put a stop to diverse of its new public works and made several others run into decay at the same time the river lossie having very insufficient banks the chanel of it became choked with sand which made it subject to overflow and moreover the harbor of lossie itself which may be called the port of elgin lying not far from it became ruinous and decayed to the great prejudice of persons trading in the murray firth as well as to the town for all these reasons and in order to enlarge and improve as well as repair the said harbor of lossie an act passed in the year      laying a duty of twopenies scots on every scots pint of ale or beer that should be vended within the said town and its liberties so that it bids fair to make as flourishing a figure as it has done for centuries past  above elgin forress and nairn lies that part of the country called the bra of murray no way comparable to the lower part for fruitfulness and beyond this are mountains woods and green valleys particularly strathherin well inhabited and abounding with little towns and villages and strathnairn a still better soil and possessed by several gentlemen strathherin also abounds with lakes mountains and streams  in this county lies lochmoy with an island where the lord of mackintosh a name well known in england as well as scotland by means of the famous brigadier of that name who was taken prisoner at the battle of preston escaped out of newgate and lately died in peace in scotland has his seat this tribe is called clan chattau and are numerous in this county  but to say a few words more of elgin before we leave this county gentlemen of all parties and opinions as if this town was the court for this part of the island leave their highland habitations in the winter and come to live at elgin with very engaging freedom so that it is a place of greater resort than could be imagined at the distance of   0 measured miles from london and more if we must go by edinburgh  this rich country continues with very little intermission till we come to strathnairn or the valley of nairn where it extends a little farther in breadth toward the mountains and is not inferior to the other in fruitfulness from the western part of this county you may observe that the land goes away again to the north and as if you were to enter into another island beyond britain you find a large lake or inlet from the sea of murray going on west as if it were to cut through the island for we could see no end of it nor could some of the country people tell us how far it reached but that it went beyond lochaber so that we thought till our maps and further inquisition informed us it had joined the western ocean  after we had traveled about twelve miles and descended from a rising ground upon which we then were we perceived the lake contracted in one particular place to the ordinary size of a river as if designed by nature to give passage to the inhabitants to converse with the northern part and then it opened again to its former breadth and continued in the form of a large lake as before for many more miles than we could see being in the whole according to mr camden    miles long but if it be taken on both sides the pass it is above    miles in length  this situation must necessarily make the narrow part a most important pass from the more southerly parts of scotland to the northern countries which are beyond it we have been told the romans never conquered thus far and the conquests of oliver cromwell have been much magnified on this account but if what mr camden records and is confirmed by other accounts from the men of learning and observation be true this must be a mistake for we are told that near bean castle in the county of nairn there was found in the year   0  a fine marble vessel curiously carved which was full of roman coins of several sorts also several old forts or mounts have been seen here which by their remains evidently showed themselves to be roman  i now entered the shire of inverness abounding with large woods of firr and oak and having in it some iron mines it contains badenock lochaber and the south and west parts of rosse and the isle of sky of all which i shall speak as they offer in the course i took  in the narrow pass mentioned above over the lake stands the town and fortress of inverness that is a town on the inner bank of the river ness the situation of it as i have said before intimates that it is a place of strength and accordingly it has a castle founded in ancient times to command the pass and some authors write that it was anciently a royal house for the kings of scotland be that as it will oliver cromwell thought it a place of such importance that he built a strong citadel here and kept a stated garrison always in it and sometimes more than a garrison finding it needful to have a large body of his old veteran troops posted here to preserve the peace of the country and keep the highlanders in awe which they did effectually all his time  it is observed that at the end of those troublesome days when the troops on all sides came to be disbanded and the men dispersed abundance of english soldiers settled in this fruitful part of the country from whence it received two advantages   they learnt the art of husbandry in full perfection which they did not understand before which with the help of a rich soil has rendered this part of the country more fruitful than the rest of scotland to this day and to this it is in some measure owing that the harvest is so early and the corn so good as is observed above   as cromwells soldiers initiated them thus into the arts and industry of the husbandman so they left them the english accent upon their tongues which they likewise preserve to this day for they speak perfect english even much better than in the most southerly provinces of scotland nay some will say as well as at london itself   their tongue is not only anglicised but their palates too their way of eating and cookery dress and behavior is according to the southern mode i wish they do not in time degenerate into luxury and forget that military original which first reformed them  the fort which was then built and afterward demolished has been restored since the revolution and a garrison was always kept here by king william for the better regulating the highlands which post was of singular importance in the time of the insurrection of the earl of mar for the pretender when though his party took it they were driven out again by the country with the assistance of the earl of sutherland and several other of the nobility and gentry who stood fast to the kings interest  inverness may be said to be a pleasant clean and well built town there are some merchants in it and it has a good share of trade in it the sheriff keeps his court it consists of two large handsome streets and has a stately stone bridge of seven large arches over the river ness where as i said before it grows narrow between the sea and the lake the water of this river is almost always warm and all the year long is never so cold as to freeze nay in the sharpest winter if cakes of ice are thrown into it they will be quickly thawed by its warmth small vessels may come up to the town but larger ships which often come thither for corn are forced to lie at some distance east from it  but it has been lately improved and is still farther improving for in the year      an act passed for laying a duty of a sixth of a penny sterling on every pint of ale etc sold within the town and its privileges for building a church and making a harbor there the preamble to the act giving a description of the place and the reasons of applying for it i shall insert and is to the following effect  that the town of inverness is situate near the sea and very capable of improvements in its trade and commerce and having but a very small public revenue incumbered with debts and those increased by the expense the inhabitants were at in opposing the rebellion of      and the church of the said town beside being ruinous was not large enough to contain the inhabitants for the effecting of these good purposes the said act was passed  this act was to be in force for    years only and the first five years it produced so well that the magistrates of inverness entered upon a design greatly to enlarge and improve their harbor in order to which they purchased grounds rented quarries built boats for transporting stone deepened their harbor erected bulwarks and quays so that it was made much more commodious than ever but the next    years the produce of the duties was so low occasioned by the excessive use of run tea and brandy which people could buy so cheap that the consumption of beer and ale was greatly lessened and they having run much behindhand were forced to apply for a further continuation of the act and accordingly in the   th year of king george ii an act passed for continuing the same for    years more for paying the debts contracted and effecting the other good purposes i have mentioned which when done will make inverness a place of as great account as any in the north of scotland  when we are over the bridge of inverness you enter that which we truly call the north of scotland and others the north highlands in which are several distinct shires but cannot call for a particular description because they are all one undistinguished range of mountains and woods overspread with vast and almost uninhabited rocks and steeps filled with deer innumerable of various kinds among which are some of those the ancients called hearts and roebucks with overgrown stags and hinds of the reddeer kind  before i describe this frightful country it is necessary to observe that scotland may be divided into four districts which i have not seen any of our geographers do before me yet i believe may not be an improper measurement for such as would form a due idea of the whole in their minds   the southland or that part of scotland south of the river tay drawing a line from the tay about perth to lochlomond and down to dumbarton and the bank of clyde   the middle or midland being all the country from the tay and the loughlomond north to the lake of ness and aber including a long slope to the south taking in the western highlands of argyll and lorn and the isles of isla and jura   the northland being all the country beyond inverness and the lough or river ness north drawing the line over the narrow space of glengary between the ness and aber and bounded by them both from the eastern to the western sea   the islands being all the western and northern islands the hebrides sky orkneys and other isles of shetland   according to this description having passed the bridge over the river ness i am now entered on the third division of scotland called the northland here are not only the best hawks of all kinds but eagles in great numbers which prey upon the young fawns when they fall first and upon wild fowl with which this part of the country abounds  the rivers and lakes also in this country are so prodigiously full of salmon that it is hardly credible what quantities are taken in the spey the nairn the ness and other rivers hereabout  the several countries beyond the ness are ross sutherland strathnavern caithness and beyond those the islands of orkney and shetland  sutherland is called the shire of dornoch from the chief town of the province called dornoch a royal burgh noted for a castle belonging to the earl of sutherland for its cathedral church for the diocese of caithness which once was part of this shire and for its four annual fairs it has three remarkable forests besides abundance of other woods which afford pleasant hunting and fowling one sort of bird is peculiar to this country called knug which resembles a parrot and digs its nest in the trunks of oak with its beak there are about  0 lakes in this county the greatest is lochskin    miles in length in many of them are islands very pleasant for summer habitations in the isle of brora the earl of sutherland has a house which he makes use of when he comes to hunt deer which abound in it and in some of the lakes and rivers of this county as well as in the rivers of aberdeen and rosse are found pearls of great value in short this shire so abounds with lakes rivers and bays that there is scarce a farm in the whole county but is washed either with fresh or salt water so that the inhabitants have store of fish and fowl the beer or big in this county is reckoned excellent it has also silver mines and excellent iron mines coal mines and quarries of freestone but much neglected it has many commodious harbors for ships to export its commodities which are cod salmon salt beef wool skins hides tallow butter cheese etc the bays and coasts also abound with seals have sometimes whales and shell fish of all sorts  the earl of sutherland has a castle beyond inverness called dunrobin situate on the eastern shore of which his lordship was sent down by sea to take an early possession in the late rebellion and which if he had not done would soon have fallen into the hands of the late earl of marrs party but his coming timely thither prevented him and the country on that side from joining the troops of the pretender in the gardens of this seat though so northerly saffron grows very well and comes to maturity  strathnavern is part of sutherland and derives its name from strath a valley situated on the river navern which runs through it the country is mountainous and formerly was noted for breeding greater numbers of ravenous wolves than any other in scotland the bays and rivers are full of fish it is very woody and many lakes are in the valleys there are several monuments in it of victories gained over the danes particularly one at enbo which is a stone cross said to be over a danish king the inhabitants are great hunters and despise those who are not so that venison with them is a common dish the situation of the country not admitting of towns the inhabitants live up and down in small villages on the northern coast of this county are several islands of the many lakes lochnavern and lochyol are the largest and the latter affords an island which is inhabited in the summer time borwe and young are the places of most note the latter the principal seat of the lord rea chief of the mackays who is the principal proprietor of strathnavern but holds it of the earl of sutherland to whose eldest son it gives the title of lord the earls of sutherland were formerly of the name of sutherland to the heiress of which a son of the house of gordon married from whom the present earl is descended they have a long time claimed precedence as the first earls of the kingdom and in order to recover it have reassumed their former name they have great royalties as being admirals of that and some of the neighboring counties and all the gentlemen of sutherland hold of them lord duffus is descended of this family the earl is hereditary sheriff of it the county has several mountains of white marble as we were told  north of the mouth of the river nesse is the famous cromarty bay or cromarty firth noted for being the finest harbor with the least business perhaps of any in britain it is    miles long and in many places two miles broad and like milfordhaven in wales is able to receive the royal navy of great britain both to go out and come in with safety but for want of trade this noble harbor which by geographers and mariners is called portus salutis or the harbor of safety is become almost useless  the shire of cromarty is denominated from a royal burgh standing upon the firth of cromarty the waters of connel are celebrated for the pearls found in them of great part of this county the earl of cromarty is sheriff and proprietor the straths or valleys upon the waterside abound with woods particularly upon the hills is great store of all sorts of game also near alserig upon the waters of braan and on the carron are great woods of fir  all the county beyond the river nesse and the loch flowing into it is called caithness and extends to the northermost land in scotland it is divided from sutherland by the mountain ord and a tract of mountains running from it as far as knochfin  some people tell us they have lead copper and iron in this part of scotland and i am very much inclined to believe it but it seems reserved for a future and more industrious age to search into it should a time come when these hidden treasures of the earth shall be discovered and improved this part of scotland would be no longer esteemed poor for such a production would soon change the face of things bring wealth and commerce to it fill the harbors with ships the towns with people and by consuming the provisions occasion the soil to be cultivated the fish cured the cattle consumed at home and thereby diffuse prosperity all around them  our writers have represented the inhabitants here wild and barbarous they were so formerly perhaps but we see the mackenzies macleods sutherlands mc leans mc donalds gordons mc keys macfergusons mc intoshes and others sprung from thence equally accomplished for the court or camp  it must be owned here are but few towns the people live dispersed in clans under a kind of vassalage submitting to their lords as their lawful monarchs and many of them acknowledge no other though this too is in a manner got over and the clans are less dependent on their chiefs than they used to be by virtue of an act of parliament made for that very purpose  their employment is chiefly hunting for their food though they also breed large quantities of black cattle with which they pay their lairds or leaders the rent of the lands these cattle are driven annually to england to be sold and are bought up chiefly in the counties of norfolk suffolk and essex as i have mentioned in several places in my tour  there are many little towns and villages besides gentlemens seats in caithness as far north as it is but the people are more addicted to good living within doors than to shewy edifices or fine seats the best house in it is castle sinclair so called from the name of the earls of sinclair whose seat it is and they have several other castles in the county the lord sinclair of ravensheugh in fife is chief of the name his ancestors formerly possessed orkney and shetland and were allied to the royal family of denmark but one of the family squandered away his estate and among the rest these islands and got for it the inglorious title of william the waster the chief town and royal burgh in caithness is wick or weich whence it is called the shire of weich this town lies conveniently for trade and has a good harbor for ships on the eastern coast it is the residence of the sheriff or his officer  thurso another town with a good harbor lies also on the northern coast in a little bay the isles of orkney and shetland i refer to the account of the isles  and i shall observe once for all that i am the more particular in my description of these northern parts of scotland because they are least known and less valued and esteemed than they deserve  this county is surrounded with the sea and those two great inlets of water mentioned above called the ness and the abre so that it forms a peninsula by means of that small neck of land of about eight miles long which mr camden calls the garrow or glengarrough others glengary were it not for this the whole division of the northland would be a distinct island separated from all the rest of great britain as effectually as the orkneys or the isle of sky is from this  that part which lies to the east is open to the sea without cover the west and the north are in a manner surrounded with outworks as a defense to break off the raging ocean from the north for the western islands on one side and the orkneys on the other lie as so many advanced fortifications or redoubts to combat that enemy at a distance  from dunrobin castle you have nothing of note offers itself either by sea or land but an extended shore lying north and south without towns and without harbors and as there are none of the former to be found so there are none of the last wanting  the land thus extended lies north and south to dungsbyhead which is the utmost extent of it on the east side of britain north and is distant from cromarty    leagues north from this point of dingsby or dungsbyhead as i observed before of buchan and winterton the sailors take their distances and keep their accounts in their going farther north e g  from this point of dingsbyhead to the fairisle or faro which is the first of shetland or the last of the orkneys call it which you will for it lies between both is    leagues or    miles  from the same dungsbyhead to sumburghhead that is to shetland is    leagues or    miles and to lerwick fort in shetland   0 miles  thus from buchanness to sumburghhead in shetland is    leagues  and from wintertonness near yarmouth on the coast of norfolk to buchanness on the coast of aberdeen is just  00 leagues so from winterton to shetland is     leagues or     miles  i am now to observe that we are here at the extremest point of the island of great britain and that here the land bears away west leaving a large straight or sea which they call pictland or pentland firth and which divides between the island of great britain and the isles of the orkneys a passage broad and fair for it is not less than five leagues over and has a sufficient depth of water for ships to sail in but the tides are so fierce so uncertain and the gusts and sudden squalls of wind so frequent that very few merchant ships care to venture through it and the dutch east india ships which come north about as it is called in their return from india keep all farther off and choose to come by fairisle in the passage between the islands of orkney and shetland whither they generally send their men of war to meet them being sure of not missing them in so narrow a passage  but the passage here is much broader being at least nine leagues from north ranalsha the farthest island of the orkneys to fairisle and five more from fairisle to shetland so that it is    leagues clear open sea between the orkneys and shetland with only a small island in the way which has nothing dangerous about it  in the passage between the lands end of britain and the orkneys is a small island which our mariners call stroma mr camden and others sowna and is much spoken of as dangerous for ships but i see no room to record any thing of that kind any more than the report that it is haunted by witches and spirits which draw ships on shore to their misfortune  at dungsbyhead is the most northerly land of great britain where in the month of june after a clear day we could see to read the smallest print and to write distinctly all night long without the help of a candle  no wonder the ancient mariners be they phoenician or carthaginian who knew nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies when they were driven thus far were surprised to find they had lost the steady rotation of day and night which they thought had spread over the whole globe they imagined the elysian fields must lie this way when they found they were come already to the realm of everlasting day  from hence west we go along the shore of the firth which they call pentland where is the famous house called john a grots we set our horses feet into the sea on the most northerly land as the people say of britain though i think dungsbyhead is as far north it is certain however the difference is but very small being either of them in the latitude of    north and shetland reaching above two degrees farther the dominions of great britain are extended from the isle of wight in the latitude of  0 degrees to the isles of unsta in shetland in the latitude of    degrees  0 minutes being  0 degrees or full  00 miles in length which island of unst or unsta being the most remote of the isles of shetland to the northeast lies     leagues from wintertonness in norfolk  here we found however mountainous and wild the country appeared the people extremely well furnished with provisions especially four sorts in great plenty two of them sufficient for a common table the other two the splendour of the greatest   very good bread as well oat bread as wheat though the last not so cheap as the first   venison exceeding plentiful and at all seasons young or old which they kill with their guns wherever they find it for there is no restraint on which account all the highlanders have firearms and become excellent marksmen   salmon in such plenty as is scarce credible and consequently so cheap that to those who have any substance to buy with it is not worth giving themselves any trouble to catch it this they eat fresh in the season and at other times cured by being dried in the sun and so preserved all the year   they have no want of cows and sheep but the latter are so wild that sometimes were they not by their own disposition used to flock together they would be much harder to kill than the deer   from hence to the west point of the passage to orkney is near  0 miles which may be called the end of the island of britain which faces directly to the north pole so that the tail of the great bear is seen just over your head the day is here in summer said to be    hours long the sun remaining so long above the horizon and when he is set he makes so small an arch of a circle below the horizon that it is much above a twilight all the night but it must be remembered that the dark nights take in winter their turn and are protracted to as great a degree  yet it is observable here that they have more temperate winters generally speaking than we have in the most southerly part of the island and particularly the water in some of the rivers as in the ness for example never freezes as i have observed before which is accounted for from the nearness of the sea which filling the air with salt vapors sheathes as it were the acute particles of the cold  for the same reason the snows are not so deep nor do they lie so long upon the ground as in other places the summits indeed of the high hills whither these vapors cannot reach are continually covered with snow and perhaps have been so for many ages so that this country if any in the world agrees with the following description  vast watery lakes which spread below and mountains covered with eternal snow   on the most inland parts of this country especially in the shire of ross they have vast woods of firtrees for    or  0 miles in length not planted by mens hands as i have described in the southern part of scotland but as they came out of the hands of nature and nourished by her handmaid time if we may believe the inhabitants they are large enough to make masts for the biggest ships and yet are of no service merely for want of the convenience of watercarriage to bring them away but methinks rather than they should remain an useless burden to the earth they might be cut down and burnt from whence might be drawn vast quantities of pitch tar rosin turpentine etc which is of easier carriage and would well answer the trouble indeed an attempt has been made of this kind for potash but it did not succeed rather through the fault of the undertakers at london than any thing else  and now leaving the northern prospect we pass the opposite point west from dungsbyhead and which the people call farrohead though mr camden calls these two points by two different names the east point or dungsbyhead he calls virvedrum promontorium the west point or farrohead he calls sarvedrum promontorium  from hence the vast western atlantic ocean appears for which the geographers have not agreed upon a name there being no country to derive it from  and now we were to turn our faces south for as to the islands of this sea which make the fourth division of scotland as i mentioned before i shall take notice of them under one head in the conclusion of my tour  in our attempt to come down to the southward by the coast of tayne and the shire of ross we should have been extremely disappointed and perhaps have been obliged to get a ship or bark to have carried us round the isle of sky into lochaber had it not been for the extraordinary courtesy of some of the gentlemen of the country  on the other hand we unexpectedly met here some english men who were employed by merchants in the south to take and cure a large quantity of whitefish and afterward of herrings on account of trade here we had not only the civility of their assistance and accommodation in our journey but the pleasure of seeing what progress they made in their undertaking  as for the herrings the quantity of them was prodigious the shoal was beginning to come when we first came to the head of pentland firth and in a fortnights time the body of their numberless shoals began to appear but before we left the coast you would have ventured to say of the sea as they do of the river tibiscus or thiesse in hungary that it was one third water and two thirds fish the operation of taking them could hardly be called fishing for they did little more than dip for them into the water and take them up i make no scruple to say that if there had been  0000 ships to have loaded with them they might all have been filled the fish did not seem to stay but passed on to the south that they might supply other parts and make way also for those innumerable shoals which were to come after  had the quantity of whitefish been any way proportioned to the herrings there would no doubt have been such encouragement to the merchants that they would never have given it over but they found it would not fully answer not but that there were great quantities of cod and the fish were sizeable and good but as they are taken with hook and line they could not with any dispatch get a sufficient loading or lay up enough in large quantities in the season  the bay of tayne is unsafe for ships runs a great way up into the county divides rosse from sutherland and ends at the promontory of tarbat we found the town of tayne and some other villages tolerably well inhabited and some trade also occasioned principally by the communication with the western islands and also by the herringfishing the fishingboats from other parts often putting into those ports for all their coast is full of loughs and rivers and other openings which make very good harbors for shipping and what is remarkable some of those loughs are infinitely full of herrings even where as they tell us they have no communication with the sea so that they must have in all probability been put into them alive by some particular hands and have multiplied there as we find at this time if they have not some communications with the sea which are not discovered to the inhabitants  we could understand no more of what the people commonly said on this side than if we had been in morocco all the remedy we had was that we found most of the gentlemen spoke french and some few broad scottish it was indeed upon other accounts much for our convenience to make the common people believe we were french  should we go about here to give you an account of the religion of the people in this country it would be an unpleasant work and perhaps scarce gain credit you would hardly believe that in a christian island as this is said to be there should be people who know so little of the christian religion as not to distinguish sunday from a common day of labor or the worship of god from an ordinary meeting for conversation i am unwilling to record so ungrateful a truth which may in time find redress but i cannot but say that his majestys gift of  000 l paid annually to the assembly of scotland for sending ministers or missionaries for the propagating christian knowledge in the highlands is certainly one of the most needful charities that could have been thought of and truly worthy of a king and if prudently applied as there is reason to believe it is may in time dispel that cloud of ignorance that has so far overspread this unhappy part of the country the people have the bible in their own language the irs and the missionaries are obliged to preach to them and examine and catechize their children in the irs language so that we are not to despair of having this country as well instructed in time as other parts of britain  the shire of tayne with the little shire of cromarty and part of the shire of inverness comprehends the whole country called rosse the first tract toward the southwest in the county of rosse is kintail separated from the isle of sky by a narrow firth next is a little track called glenelebeg the paternal estate of the earl of seaforth whose chief seat is called castle ylendoven lying in an island of the abovementioned firth farther north on the same coast lies lochew with thick woods where iron was formerly made a little farther north lochbrien runs into this county and is remarkable for its noble annual fishery of herrings  the peninsula which lies betwixt the bay of cromarty and murray is called ardmeanach upon the shore of which stands the town called the chanonry of ross formerly a bishops see it is pleasantly situated in a valley betwixt fruitful hills it had once a stately cathedral and castle where the bishop dwelt here the late earl of seaforth had a noble house beaulieu formerly a pleasant and rich abbey lies near the mouth of the river farrar and is now possessed by the lord lovat the earl of seaforth had near it a castle called kildun there are other seats of ancient families in this county which my compass will not let me describe and i shall mention them at the latter end of my tour in a general list that you may be enabled to form an idea of the numerous families of gentry which scotland produces  on this coast is the isle of sky lying from the westnorthwest to the eastsoutheast and bearing upon the main island only separated by a narrow straight of water something like as the isle of wight is separated from the county of southampton we left this on our right and crossing the mountains came with as little stay as we could to the loughs called lochyol and lochlochy which run through that large country called lochaber that is ver the lochs and which some affect to call the river aber or abre i e the water which as i said above assists with loughness or lochness to separate the north land of scotland from the middle part  this is a long and narrow inlet of the sea in length above    miles the depth unknown which opening from the irish sea southwest meets the river abre or as the scots much more properly express it the water of abre for it is rather a large lake or loch than a river and receives innumerable small rivers into it it rises in the mountains of ross or of glengary within five or six miles from the shore of the lochness or the water of ness which is a long and narrow lake like itself and as the ness runs away east to innerness and so into the great gulf called murray firth so the abre becoming presently a loch or lake always goes away more to the southward and sloping southwest runs into the irish seas as above  lochaber is  0 miles in a strait line from inverlochy to inverness and is one of the most barren countries in north britain though the people have wood goats and deer in plenty glenco is almost the only town in it noted for the barbarous and inhuman massacre perpetrated there by k williams soldiers quartered in those parts and who cut off men women and children without mercy a massacre that made a great noise and was universally detested and what made it still the more odious was that the commander in that bloody work found friends enough to screen him from the inquiry that was attempted to be made into the horrid fact in order to find out who gave him his orders for it  lochaber is noted in history for banco its gallant thane about the year  0 0 who was murdered by the tyrant macbeth because of a prophecy that his posterity should enjoy the crown for a long series of years which accordingly happened for his son flying into wales married the prince of north waless daughter by whom he had walter afterward steward of scotland from whom the royal family of stuart was descended it was on this story that our celebrated shakespeare founded his tragedy called macbeth  on this water of abre just at the entrance of the loch was anciently a fort built to curb the highlanders on either side called inverlochy it was formerly of great strength and yet often destroyed by the danes and norwegians and at the revolution king william caused it to be rebuilt or rather erected a new fort there which is called castle william as the village is maryburgh and there is always a good garrison kept in it for curbing the highlanders it is so situated that though it may indeed be blocked up by land and distressed by a siege yet as it is open to the sea it may constantly receive supplies by shipping  from inverlochy to lochness has general wade with the most commendable industry and pains through almost inaccessible mountains and mosses and morasses made a most convenient road which even surpasses the county considered what the romans had done with their several military ways and shows that the soldiery might be made useful even in times of peace and rather a benefit than a burden to the country and at the same time so inure them to toil labor and hardiness as would render them fitter for their countrys service in time of war to defend this road from the rage of the highlanders and at the same time to keep them in awe the general built a regular fortification which is called fort augustus by this means the highlands which before were inaccessible but by highlanders who eluded always the resentment of their pursuers are easily entered and traversed at the pleasure of the kings forces and even the noted rob roy himself so famous for his excursions and plunders on the lowlands and the kings friends and who notwithstanding the proclamations and rewards issued for apprehending him could never be taken were he alive would not be able now to find a place of refuge from his pursuers and this must be in time a great help to the civilizing of the highlanders as the schools established among them of which more byandby will be another  at this place we take our leave of the third division which i call the north land of scotland for this fort being on the south side of the lochaber is therefore called innerlochy as the other for the like reason was called innerness  we have nothing now remaining for a full survey of scotland but the western part of the middle division of scotland and this though a large country yet affords not an equal variety with the eastern part of the same division  to traverse the remainder of this country i must begin upon the upper tay as we may justly call it where i left off when i turned away east and here we have in especial manner the countries of badenach athol and braidalbin this is a hilly country indeed but as it is watered by the tay and many other pleasant rivers which fall into it there are several fruitful valleys interspersed among the hills nor are even the highlands themselves or the highlanders the inhabitants any thing so wild untaught or untractable as we have been made to believe and as are to be found in the north land division that is to say in strathnavern ross tain etc  the duke of athol is lord i had almost said king of this country and has the greatest number of vassals of any nobleman in this or any part of scotland  the late duke was always an opposer of the union in the parliament holden at edinburgh for passing it into an act but he did not carry his opposition to a height of tumult and rebellion if he had as some were forward to have had him done he would possibly at that time have bid fair to have prevented the conclusion of it but the hour was come when the calamities of war which for so many hundred years had vexed the two nations were to have an end and though the english government had never less power than then in scotland yet the affair was carried through with a high hand all the little tumults and disorders of the rabble as well at edinburgh as at glasgow and other places being timely suppressed and others by prudent management prevented  the duke has several fine seats in this country as first at dunkeld upon the tay which i mentioned before where there was a fight between the regular troops and the highlanders in the beginning of the reign of king william another at huntingtour in the strathern or valley of ern where the duke has a fine park and great store of deer which may be called his huntingseat whither he sometimes retires for sport  he has another seat at the castle of blair farther north and beyond the tay on the edge of braidalbin upon the banks of a clear and fine river which falls into the tay a few miles lower  the country of braidalbin has not so much as a single village in it of ten houses yet from its latin name albania gives ofttimes the title of duke to some of the royal family it is seated very near the center of scotland and is alleged to be the highest ground in it for that the rivers which rise here are said to run every way from this part some into the eastern and some into the western seas  the grampian mountains here are said to cut through scotland as the country is rough and uncultivated the inhabitants are a hardy race of men who make excellent soldiers when they are listed abroad in regular and disciplined troops and i must add that they are much civilized from what they were formerly these mountains abound with flocks of black cattle sheep horses and goats the beef and mutton are of a delicious taste and the wool is valued for its whiteness and softness  the duke of athol though he had not till of late an estate equal to some of the nobility yet was master of more of the superiorities as they are called here than many of those who have twice his estate and i have been told that he can bring a body of above  000 men together in arms at very little warning  the pomp and grandeur in which this noble person lives is not to be imitated in great britain for he is served like a prince and maintains a greater equipage and retinue than five times his estate would support in another country  the duke has also another seat in strathern which is called tullibardin and which gives title of marquis to the eldest son of the house of athol for the time being at the lower part of this country the river ern falls into the tay and greatly increases its waters this river rises far west on the frontiers of the western highlands near glengyl and running through that pleasant country called strathern falls into tay below st johnston  the present duke is the only peer that i know of that is so by statute rather than patent for his eldest brother the marquis of tullibardin being attainted for his adherence to the pretender the title would of course have failed but that together with the estate it was settled by act of parliament on the second brother who is also lord of or king in the isle of man and also lord strange of knocking to both which he succeeded by the death of his cousin james late earl of derby  soon after the ern shoots forth from the mountains it spreads itself into a loch as most of those rivers do called lochern and then runs by duplin castle the seat of the earl of kinnoul whose eldest son is thence called lord duplin the present earl of kinnoul when lord duplin married the daughter of the earl of oxford when lord high treasurer of england and was on that occasion made a peer of great britain by the title of lord hay of peperdon his estate here is a very good one but not attended with vassals and superiorities as i observed the duke of athols is the several owners of this seat having been pretty much used to reside in it have adorned it at several times each according to his particular genius it has lately received a new decoration two wings being added for offices as well as ornament  the old building is spacious the rooms large and ceilings lofty filled with furniture suitable to its outward magnificence particularly with abundance of fine paintings some of the royal family among which is one of king charles i with a letter in his hand held out to his son the duke of york afterward king james vii which they said he was to have carried to france there is also a statue in brass of the same king on horseback a picture of oliver cromwell another of general monk both from the life there is also a whole length of that earl of kinnoul who was lord chancellor of scotland in the reign of king james vi and king charles i with several other pieces of italian masters of great value  duplin castle is remarkable also for the greatest defeat the scots ever received from the english in the reign of edward baliol whom the english came to assist in this battle fourscore of the family of lindsay perished and of the family of hay so many that the name had been extinguished had not the chief left his lady with child  from this place we went to brechin in angus formerly mentioned an ancient town with a castle finely situated but the grandeur of it is lost the family of panmure to whom it belonged chiefly having forfeited it in the late rebellion  here i shall mention the cataract near blair drummond on the keith which empties itself into the tay which makes so great a noise among the rocks that it stuns those who come near it  we were now after a long mountainramble come down to the lowlands and into a pleasant and agreeable country but as we had yet another journey to take westward we had a like prospect of a rude and wild part of scotland to go through  the highlands of scotland may be divided into two parts the west highlands and the north highlands the latter i have spoken of at large containing the countries of athol lochaber badenach strathspey innerness ross sutherland and strathnavern together with the isles of sky lewis etc  the west highlands contain the shires or counties of dunbritton or dunbarton alias lenox bute and argyll which last contains the districts of cowal knapdale lorn and cantyre the isles of mull jura isla etc  braidalbin is sometimes reckoned a part of the north and sometimes of the west highlands  on the banks of the river ern lies a very pleasant vale which continues from the tay quite up to the highlands called by claudian glacialis ierne but now according to the usage of scotland strathern or the vale of ern it is an agreeable country has many gentlemens seats on both sides the river but being near the highlands has often suffered by depredations in former times  in it are many roman camps particularly one at ardoch besides a roman highway toward perth several roman medals have also been found there and of late two tabulae curiously enamelled with a sepulchral stone the ochilhills which run along the south parts of perthshire abound with metals and minerals particularly they find good copper and lapis calaminaris and at glenlion they meet with lead here is great want of coal but their excellent peat and abundance of wood supply that defect  the family of montrose whose chief was sacrificed for the royal cause in the late civil broils had a strong castle here called kincardin which was demolished in those wars and is not rebuilt the castle of drummond is almost in the same condition bng deserted by its owners the two late earls of th father and grandfather of the present earl were forced into exile for adhering to the late king james ii and the pretender king james had the latter in such esteem that he not only made him a duke and knight of the garter but governor to the chevalier  the western highlands properly so called are the only remaining part of scotland which as yet i have not touched upon this is that particular country which a certain man in king james iis time called the kingdom of argyll complimenting king james upon having conquered two kings when he suppressed the duke of monmouth whom in derision they called the little king of lime and the earl of argyll whom they called with much more propriety the great king of the highlands  but though the greatest part of these western highlands may be said to be subject to the house of argyll or to speak more properly to the family or clan of the campbells of whom the duke of argyll is the chief yet some of the western gentlemen are not so blindly guided by their chiefs as those in the north nor when led on are they so apt to commit outrages and violence  but though the people are different in these western and northern highlands the countries are much alike only in the former there are not such extensive woods of firtrees nor such quantities of large eagles  the people also dress alike in both in the played and the trouse go naked from below the knee to the midthighs wear a durk and a pistol at their girdle and a target at their shoulder  some reckon the shire of braidalbin to belong as i have said to these western highlands not that it is west in its situation for it is rather north but i suppose because one part of it is inhabited by the campbells whose clan as i have observed generally possesses most of the west highlands  but if they claim the country they will have no reason to boast of the people who are if i may give my opinion some of the most barbarous and illgoverned of all the highlands of scotland desperate in fight fierce in conversation apt to quarrel mischievous and even murderers in their passion  at the fight which happened at gillekranky in athol against the viscount of dundee they tell us a story of a combat between an english soldier and a highlander the englishman understood the backsword very well but the scotchman received all the blows upon his target and yet at the same time laid so hard at his antagonist with his broadsword that he cut him in two or three places at which the englishman enraged rather than discouraged cried out to him you dog come out from behind the door and fight like a man but the scot though as brave as the other knew better things he pursued him in short so closely that he was just going to kill him when some of the regiment that saw him distressed came up and rescued him and took the highlander prisoner  it is hard to say whether the northern or western highlanders make the best soldiers it is certain they both of them are defrauded of an honor due to them when we attribute several gallant achievements to the irish battalions abroad which were performed by the scots thus in particular it is said the irish troops beat the germans out of cremona after they had got possession of the town and had taken the french general the marshal villery prisoner that the irish battalions in the spanish service behaved gallantly in sicily and so on many extraordinary occasions now though it is true that the scots came originally from ireland yet it is to be observed that these soldiers were most of them scots highlanders who upon all occasions get over into france there list among the irish troops nay in the late wars it has been observed whole regiments of highlanders have been raised for the service who when they were got abroad would take the first opportunity to desert and go over to the french and so list in the irish battalions their original countrymen and who still speak the same language  leaving the country about brechin and the lowlands of strathern we went away west but were presently interrupted by a vast inland sea rather than a lake called lochlomond it is indeed a sea and looked like it from the hills from whence we first descried it it contains thirty islands three of which have churches and several of the rest are inhabited the chief is inchmurin about two miles and a half in length fruitful in corn and grass and abounds with deer which the scottish kings were accustomed to hunt there the others most remarkable are nachastel so called from the old castle in it inchdavanan noted for broom abundance of wild berries pleasant habitations gardens and fruit trees inchonnaugan noted for birchtrees and cornfieldsd inchnolaig noted for yewtrees which grow nowhere else in these islands and rouglash where the lord of macfarlan has a handsome seat on the east side of the lake kilmaronoch a fine seat once belonging to the earls of cassils but now to the earl of dondonald buchanancastle and several others  this lake or loch is one of the largest in scotland being more than  0 miles long and generally eight miles in breadth though at the north end of it it is not near so broad it receives many rivers into it but empties itself into the firth of clyde at one mouth  this lake abounds with fish of several sorts particularly a sort called poans and by some pollacks peculiar to it a kind of eel very delicious to eat this gave occasion to the mistake of authors who said this lake had fish without fins so the beams fastened together in some places of the lake by the inhabitants and covered with turf for them to have recourse to in time of war and to move from part to part gave rise to the fable of floating islands here  the famous grampian mountains begin near this lake and run northward toward aberdeen  the county of lenox on which this lake lies is in length about    miles and in breadth about twenty the lower part is very fertile in corn the higher is hilly moorish and more fit for pasture it is the paternal estate and property of the stuarts and extends itself from both sides the levin which is the river that as i said before empties the lochlomond into the clyde on this side eastward lenox joins to monteith which is part of perthshire and runs up for some length on the east side of the loch and on the west side it extends to the edge of the lochloing and a great way north almost to the mountains of lochaber  all our writers of the description of lenox enlarge upon its family of stuarts as proceeding from the royal line of scotland and in some respect the royal line may be said to proceed from this house henry lord darnley eldest son of matthew earl of lenox having been married to queen mary by whom he was father of king james the sixth and first he was most barbarously murdered the queen was unjustly blamed for it whereas murray projected it bothwell put it in execution morton and others were privy to it as the said earl morton and others who suffered for it declared at the last  from this earl matthew descended charles duke of lenox and richmond who dying without issue in      the estate and honor devolved to king charles ii as heir at law which he conferred on his natural son by the duchess of portsmouth and to whom he gave the surname of lenox from whom is descended the present duke of richmond and lenox  the buchanans among many illustrious names are originally of this county whence the famous george buchanan one of the great ornaments of his age for all polite learning and not hitherto equalled by any poet or historian since his time for smooth and elegant latin but his excessive bias for the earl of murray and his inveterate prejudice against the unfortunate queen mary has quite lost him the title of impartiality insomuch that his history of scotland was condemned by act of parliament when first published anno      whence sir george mackenzie took occasion to say he was both decus and dedecus patriae the grace and disgrace of his country  dunbarton is the county town of lenoxshire it was once considerable for its trade which is now much decayed but is still remarkable for its castle one of the strongest by nature in europe being secured by the river on one side the firth of clyde on the other by an impassable morass on the third and the fourth is a precipice of this castle the earl of hay is governor  take buchanans description of it to the following effect betwixt the conflux of clyde and leven is a plain about a mile long at the end of which where the rivers join is a rock with two summits on the westermost is a watchtower affording an extended prospect into the neighboring country the eastern summit is lower and betwixt them are steps cut out of the rock passable only by one man at a time when any part is cut or falls off from the rock it emits a sulphurous smell at the upper part of the castle is a great rock of loadstone the rock is very steep on all sides but toward the clyde where the ascent is more easy and betwixt the two rocks is a space of ground enclosed by art and nature which contains many houses makes a safe harbor for ships under protection of the castle and opens a passage for boats to the very gate on the ascent in the middle are houses which look like another castle separated from the former the same serves for a ditch on the west and the clyde on the south and the tide comes up to the east side and on the north where the rock is steep is a green plain three wells are in the castle always flowing with water besides many springs so that it may well be deemed impregnable the town lies about half a mile from it on the bank of the levin  the roman wall which begins at abercorn runs through this county and ends at kilpatrick on clyde a regality of the lord blantyres  we now entered the large extended country of argyll or the western islands commonly called the shire of innerary from the principal town where the duke of argyll has his residence it comprehends as i have said argyllshire knapdale caval kintyre and lorn with the western isles of coll illcollimkil isla jura lismore mull tereff and wist it is   0 miles long and  0 broad it joins to perthshire on the east to lochaber on the northeast to the isles on the northwest and to the irish sea on the south  kintyre is a peninsula which runs  0 miles out into the irish sea and is no more than    some say    miles from ireland campbeltown made a royal burgh by king william with a safe harbor for ships lies in this county camden says the people of this part formerly made excursions into ireland and possessed themselves of the provinces of gline and roll  knapdale joins to kintyre on the north by a narrow neck of land scarce a mile over through which the people of the country draw their small vessels to avoid sailing round to kintyre it abounds with lakes and bays several of which contain islands and castles and the soil is generally fitter for pasturage than cultivation yet it produces corn in great plenty  lorn is the pleasantest and most fruitful part of the shire of argyll the castle of dunstafage stands in this county formerly a royal seat where several of the ancient kings are buried the family of campbell was made earls by king james ii of scotland they were a long time lords justices general of the kingdom but surrendered that office to king charles i on a valuable equivalent besides having the jurisdiction of argyll and the isles and are still great masters of the kings household in scotland they derive their surname from the castle of campbell and according to camden their pedigree from the ancient kings of argyll by a long series of ancestors the earl of loudon the earl of braidalbin the earl of isla and other great men are of this family  the whole shire of argyll taking in the above parts has seven bays of the sea entering into it called by the inhabitants lochs the chief is lochfyn famous for the number and goodness of its herrings it is said to be about  0 miles in length and at the narrowest place about four in breadth lochew according to bishop lesly is almost as large as lochlomond and contains twelve islands in one of which is the castle of enconel in another that of gleurquhart and where it enters the sea abounds with salmon the seacoast of argyll or as far as lochfyn abounds with high rocks and black mountains covered with heath which afford pasturage for black cattle and deer the black cattle run for the most part wild but are excellent meat and their fat when boiled does not congeal as others but continues for some days like oil the inhabitants make great profit of them by selling them to the lowlanders  the duke of argyll is hereditary sheriff of this county it is an old right of this family that when they marry any daughter their vassals are obliged to pay their portion and are taxed in order to it according to the number of their cattle  from the mull of cantyre you see ireland very plain it being not above    or    miles from the point of land which they call the mull to the fair foreland on the coast of colrain on the north of ireland in the mouth of this sea of clyde lies a rock somewhat like the bass in the firth of forth or of edinburgh not for shape but for this particular that at the bass the solan geese are noted to come in the season of the fishery and then fly back again this island is called the ailzey  i shall here mention the isles of bute and arran buchanan says that of bute is eight miles long and four broad bishop lesly that it is  0 miles long it is fruitful in corn and pasturage it has a royal burgh called rothsay with an ancient castle from this the royal family of stuart is supposed to derive their origin and duke of rothsay is now one of the titles of the prince of wales it has another castle called the castle of kermes and four churches this island lies in the mouth of the clyde eight miles west from arran and is remarkable for its herringfishing the isle of bute gives title of earl to a branch of the noble family of hamilton who is the chief proprietor and heretable coroner of the island and has a seat at rosa as callartine has at kermes and stuart of ascog another queen mary before she married lord darnley conferred upon him the title of duke of rothsay near bute are two small islands called great and little cumbrays the property of the earl of glasgow  the isle of arran which with bute make up one sheriffdom lies also in the mouth of the clyde    miles in length and near    broad fruitful in corn and pasturage it is very well inhabited on the coast and is a safe and good harbor covered by lamlash or the holy isle it has two churches and several castles of which that of brodich is the strongest and most noted and is the residence of the hamilton family when in these parts who also have a forest here containing about  00 head of deer and the island gives title of earl to the duke of that name the island has several rivers in it which abound with salmon as the sea about it does with herrings cod and whitings  the people are protestants speak the irish language and are still composed of several tribes or clans the most ancient are maclewis of french extraction in english named fullerton and lairds of kirkmichael where they reside  these two islands are surrounded with a tumultous and dangerous sea especially in a hard southwest wind which brings the sea rolling in upon them in a frightful manner but the above harbor of lamlash stands them in great stead in this case  now we are upon these western coasts i shall mention that in the month of august    0 an attempt was made by diving to come at one of the largest ships of the spanish armada stranded in      on these coasts another was dived for some years ago but the sand being loose it turned to little or no account the other which was lost near portincross was begun to be searched after by sir archibald grant and captain roe in august    0 and the following was the account that was transmitted to us which we the rather insert as it gives some notion of the operation by the divingengine  the country people had preserved by tradition the spot pretty near where she sunk and gave them all the information they were able immediately the diverse went to work and swept for her which they do thus they have a long line which they sink with leads one end of the rope is fixed to one boat and the other end to another they row and whatever interrupts them the diver goes down to make a discovery they soon happened on the place where the ship lay which is scarce a quarter of a mile from the shore in ten fathom and a foot water captain roe immediately went down and found the vessel to be very entire to have a great number of guns on board but to be full of sand the first thing he fixed upon was a cannon which lay upon the sand at the head of the ship to this he fixed his tongs which are made of strong bars of iron they are open when they are let down and have teeth which join into one another as soon as they are fixed upon any thing he gives the signal when they are made to shut and the heavier the subject the closer they hold the cannon was drawn up with a good deal of difficulty it measures full nine feet is of brass greenishcoloured but nothing the worse on the breach there is a rose with an e on the one side and an r on the other with this inscription richard and john philips brethren made this piece anno      but we may be allowed to observe that by the e r on the cannon which denotes eliz regina and the rose as also the english inscription of the makers it should seem to us that it could not belong to the armada but rather to some english ship that might have been cast away there ten of these brass cannon and ten iron ones have been since carried into dublin and they hope to recover sixty out of this ship the guns were all charged and the metal of some by lying so long under water moulders away like clay  several people have scraped the iron guns which are as moldy as bricks and by keeping the metal some time in their hands it grows so hot that they are not able to bear it but when it is exposed two or three hours in open air it loses all its burning quality this is accounted for in the following manner viz  dr tournefort a french physician in his voyage to the levant part i says it is certain that the filings of iron steeped in common water will grow considerably warm and much more so in sea water and if you mingle therewith some sulphur powdered you will really see this mixture burn  sir isaac newton in the last edition of his optics page     says that even the gross body of sulphur powdered with an equal weight of iron filings and a little water made into a paste acts upon the iron and in five or six hours grows too hot to be touched and emits a flame  now it is certain that cast iron contains a great deal of bitumen or sulphur in its composition and that iron in its sensible quality effects heat and cannot be perceived without the admission of air which is the reason why the scrapings should grow hot although the guns are actually cold to the touch  as i have given accounts of several public charities and other laudable institutions in the southern parts of britain it would be inexcusable not to mention the society in scotland for propagating christian knowledge in the highlands it being one of the worthiest designs of the present age and as we shall include in it also a description of the said highlands and of the scots islands besides we cannot insert it in a more proper place it is comprehended in a letter written june      from a gentleman who is a great encourager of this noble institution to his friend and is as follows the extent of the highlands of scotland is much greater than has commonly been imagined from the mull of kintyre to farohead in strathnavern is more than  00 miles in a strait line from south to north and from farohead to john a grots house is above  0 miles along the north and northern coast of the continent besides there is a vast number of inhabited islands of which some are both large and populous for instance jura is    miles long isla    mull    sky    long island comprehending bara southuist northuist and jews  00 and many others from two to    miles in length the isles of orkney and zetland are to be considered by themselves for to orkney alone belong thirtythree inhabited islands one of which is    miles and another    in length in zetland there are about  0 inhabited islands some of which are six others seven miles long many of these islands lie at considerable distances from the continent and from one another and are in extent about one half of scotland  in this large track of country ignorance and superstition greatly prevail in some places the remains even of paganism are still to be found and in many others the reformation from popery has never yet obtained the parishes where ministers are settled are commonly of very great extent some  0  0  0 miles long and generally divided by impassable mountains and lakes so that most of the inhabitants being destitute of all means of knowledge and without any schools to educate their children are entirely ignorant of the principles of religion and virtue live in idleness and poverty have no notion of industry or sense of liberty are subject to the command of their popish disaffected chieftains who have always opposed the propagating christian knowledge and the english tongue that they might with less difficulty keep their miserable vassals in a slavish dependence the poorer sort have only the irish tongue and little correspondence with the civilized parts of the nation and only come among them to pillage the more industrious inhabitants they are brought up in principles of tyranny and arbitrary government depend upon foreign papists as their main support and the native irish as their best correspondents and allies this has been the source of all the rebellions and insurrections in that country since the revolution  on the other hand they are naturally of a quick genius of great bodily strength inured to hardship their country is commodiously situated for the noblest fishery in the world of which our neighbors have made immense profit they have mines and woods and great quantity of black cattle and vast tracks of improveable land which lie waste for want of industry in the people and not considering the advantage of their situation they are a numerous and prolifick people and if reformed in their principles and manners and usefully employed might be made a considerable accession of power and wealth to great britain some clans of highlanders well instructed in the arts of war and well affected to the government would make as ae and formidable a body for their countrys defense as great britain or switzerland or any part of europe are able to produce  in the year   0  some gentlemen of edinburgh first considered of proper methods for civilizing and reforming them and agreed that the setting up of schools in different and convenient places for the instructing of their youth in the english tongue and principles of the christian religion and disposing them to virtue and industry would be the most likely and effectual means they joined in a voluntary subscription among themselves and engaged as many others in it as they could which laid the first foundation of this great and public design they soon found the work too heavy a burden for a few private hands and made application to her late majesty queen anne who was graciously pleased to approve and recommend the same by her royal proclamation in the year   0  and in   0  granted her letters patent constituting and appointing a certain number of the subscribers to be a society or body politic by the name of the society in scotland for propagating christian knowledge in the highlands and islands etc with full powers to receive donations of money etc and to purchase lands etc not exceeding  000 l a year and with the profits and yearly interest of the same to erect and maintain schools with many other privileges and regulations the lords of session or judges in scotland according to her majestys commission nominated    subscribers to be the first members of the society all of them persons of the best and most distinguished characters who at their first general meeting chose a president a treasurer a secretary and other officers they also chose a committee of fifteen who meet every month or oftener as they have occasion there is a general meeting of the whole society every three months when they assume new members make general regulations give orders to the committee and receive their accounts all proceedings both of the committee and of the general meeting are recorded in distinct books which are always open to the examination of every contributor the names of the contributors are kept in a distinct register with an account of the several benefactions  in the year    0 they began to settle schools in such places as had never been reformed from heathenism and their capital stock having yearly increased by the liberal contributions of many persons of all ranks in great britain and amounting to above  0000 l most of which is laid out upon good security they have increased their schools in proportion their number at present is about  00 where above  000 are taught gratis to read write arithmetic and psalmody many of the poorer scholars have a weekly allowance for their maintenance and clothes and books provided for them great care is taken that the schoolmasters are men of probity capacity and well affected to the government and they are obliged besides the teaching the children in the schools to instruct those in the principles of religion who are too old to come to school and at too great a distance from the parish church many popish parents have at length permitted their children to be instructed  this society has appointed persons of character and consideration to be visitors of their schools and to examine the conduct and diligence of the schoolmasters and the proficiency of the scholars and to transmit accounts to them at edinburgh all possible care is taken to manage the money to the best advantage not a farthing being diverted to any other purpose and all the principal officers of the society serve gratis the success of the undertaking has answered all the pains and expense of the society there appears a great disposition in the rising generation to be instructed many have learned to read the scriptures and attend divine service in english where formerly the irish tongue was only understood several of the scholars are capable of assisting the masters and some of them of being masters of the societys schools many of them have attained to such degrees of knowledge as to be admitted to the celebration of the lords supper the face of reformation and virtue begins to appear everywhere and there is reason to apprehend that in a few years ignorance popery and the irish language will be utterly extirpated and in their stead virtue loyalty and industry will take place  nevertheless the present fund is far from being sufficient to the vastness of the design as appears from the report of the commissioners appointed by his late majesty king george anno      to inquire into the state of the highlands and islands of scotland in pursuance of an act of parliament of the preceding session who gave it as their opinion that no method was so likely to reduce these countries to a state of peace among themselves and hearty subjection to the present government as that of establishing schools among them and that over and above the present number one hundred and fifty more were absolutely necessary to render the design fully effectual  this report had so good an effect that it was enacted  anno   georgii in the act for vesting the forfeited estates in trustees etc that a sum not exceeding  0000 l shall be appropriated toward making a capital stock for a yearly interest or income out of the moneys which shall arise by sale of the said estates which are in scotland toward erecting and maintaining schools in the highlands etc and in the act   georgii for laying a duty on wrought plate there is a proviso that nothing therein shall invalidate the said provision for schools in the highlands etc but notwithstanding this charitable provision of the legislature it is much to be lamented that neither that country nor this society ever reaped any benefit by it the produce of the said estates having been applied to other purposes whereby the reforming and civilizing of that country is left to depend very much on private contribution  i must not forget to observe that the societys charter extends to popish and infidel countries beyond the seas and that four missionaries are maintained for converting the native indians in america to the christian faith three of which are stationed on the frontiers of new england between our settlements and those of french canada by which means the indians in those parts will more easily be kept in subjection to our government the charge of these three is in a great measure defrayed out of an estate left to the society by a late worthy clergyman in england for that purpose the other missionary is entirely supported at the societys charge in the new colony of georgia where several of the poorer people are gone to reside  and to render this design more fully a national benefit his present majesty from an earnest desire to promote the good of his subjects in all parts of his dominions was graciously pleased in the year      to grant his royal additional charter to cause such children as they should find proper to be instructed in husbandry housewifry and manufactures the society is taking all proper measures for erecting workingschools and have good encouragement to hope that the landed gentlemen in the highlands and isles will not suffer themselves to be outdone by their protestant neighbors in ireland who took the first hint from their design but will like them let out and make grants of small parcels of ground to build their schools and for kitchengardens and agriculture and for the raising of hemp and flax for the linen manufacture which is now so greatly improved in that country this is the distinct state of the case in all the circumstances and steps of it  as this undertaking is not the work of a party or faction but the common cause of christianity and an attempt to civilize vast numbers of people near half a million and make them useful to society who have been in a great measure useless and in some circumstances very hurtful to it it is apprehended that the wealthy and welldisposed who have an hearty zeal for the honor of god and the good of the souls of men a true love for their country and the public welfare or a due concern for the protestant religion and the present happy establishment cannot easily find any instance of usefulness more likely to turn to account or capable of answering more noble and extensive purposes of good    thus far this gentleman we shall add that his majesty gives  000 l per annum toward this noble design  i shall here subjoin the following list of

w sinclair s of may scelbo lord duffus s murkle earl of caithness s hemprigs sir w dunbar s duren mr sinclair s etc letter v sir i shall now present you with as brief and accurate an account as i can give you of the islands of most considerable note lying adjacent or belonging to this northern part of the island of great britain beginning first with  the western isles of scotland these islands lie in the deucaledonian sea and were called by some hebrides the most southern of them is the isle of man which for several generations has belonged to families who have been homagers to the crown of england for it wherefore i shall pass it by with these remarks that when it became entirely subject to the english it kept a distinct bishop of its own whose successors continued the title of episcopi sodorenses as well as added that of mannenses as if they had been bishops of the isles also whose cathedral was at sodor and as many of the towns therein are called by scots names so at present it belongs to a scots peer james duke of athol who lately succeeded to this isle as heir at law to his cousin james earl of derby  the isles of bute and arran i have already mentioned  ailsa or islesay in the mouth of the clyde is a steep rock something resembling the bass in the mouth of forth being inaccessible in all places but only by one pass and not inhabited except at one time of the year when a great fleet of vessels come thither to fish for cod it abounds with variety of seafowl especially solan geese and has multitudes of rabbets it belongs to the earl of cassil who receives by the produce of hogs fowl down and fish about  00 marks scots yearly from hence  near the isle of bute lie two islands called cumbra the greater and lesser the first is about a mile in length has a church in it and a well the waters of which are reckoned by the natives good against all diseases the other island is less and both belong to montgomery of skelmerly the larger is fruitful in corn and the smaller abounds with deer  near the isle of arran is flada a small island which abounds with rabbets  southwest from bute lies mernock about a mile long and half a mile broad fruitful in corn  about a mile from the promontory of kintyre lies avona which signifies a good harbor the danes came hither with their fleets when they were masters of the isles  the next remarkable island is gigaia four miles from kintyre six miles in length and a mile and a half in breadth the inhabitants are protestants there is a church in this island and a sepulcher for the macneils the proprietors of it corkir which dies a crimson color and crostil which dies a philamote grow upon the stones here the soil is good for pasture and arable they have also a medicinal well which they esteem a catholicon  a quarter of a mile south lies carry about a mile in compass has good pasturage and abounds with rabbets it belongs to the family of macalister  jura lies twelve miles from gigaia is  0 miles long and six or seven broad it belongs to the duke of argyll and makes part of the shire of that name this is very barren but reckoned one of the wholsomest places in scotland here women seldom die in childbed and one macrain died in the reign of king charles ii who had been   0 christmass in one house it abounds with many deer has good pasturage for other cattle has many good springs and one against nauseousness of the stomach and stone here are two very high mountains called the paps of jura which are noted seamarks for a very great way from march to september the air is perfectly pure there are very good salmon in the rivers of this island they have one church here called killearn the inhabitants who speak irish and wear the played and bonnet are protestants  two miles from jura lies scarba four miles long and one broad noted for its extraordinary tides and the longevity of its inhabitants one of whom a woman lived   0 years  near to these lie many islands of less note which i have not room to name lismore or lessimore the seat of the bishop of argyll who from thence was called episcopus lismorensis is about eight miles long and two broad and lies eastward from mull in the mouth of lockyol which goes up to innerlochy in lochaber  bernera formerly a sanctuary in popish times has a noble wood of yew in this isle which is five miles in circumference and lies about two leagues to the south of harries were as mr toland relates two ravens which beat off all birds of prey and when their young are able to fly abroad they expel them also out of the island but not without many blows and a great noise in this island moreover there is a fresh water lake called lochbruist where many land and seafowl build there were according to the same author a couple of ravens like the former in a small isle near northvist as also upon the isle of troda near sky  southwest from jura lies ila    miles long in some places eight and in others sixteen broad it abounds with corn and cattle has store of deer and lead mines with limestone in vast quantities it has several rivers that abound with salmon and other fish of several sorts in the center of it lies lochfinlagan three miles in circumference it abounds with salmon trouts and eels and has an island in it where macdonald king of the isles had his residence and made it the seat of his government the ruins of whose court are still to be seen here there are several fresh water lakes in this island with forts upon them it has also a medicinal well much frequented by the natives for all diseases there are several caves here one of them capable of holding  00 men the country is indifferently fruitful it lies lower than jura consequently is wetter and less wholesome the inhabitants are protestants there are four churches and a chapel in this island the most remarkable of which is st columbuss church it gives the title of earl to a son of the family of argyll but campbel of calder is the chief proprietor and also steward of the crown here  there are many small islands about this which we cannot mention  two leagues north  ila lies colonsa separated from oransa only  de of flood it is four miles in length and a  broad not so fruitful as the other there is one church besides two ruinous chapels in this isle some fresh water lakes abounding with trouts and several forts the proprietor is the duke of argyll and the inhabitants protestants  oransa is four miles in circumference and fruitful in corn and grass it has also a church and a chapel and had formerly a monastery dedicated to st columbus the proprietor is macduffi  farther west lies the small isle of dowhirta the natives have a tradition that pygmies once lived here the duke of argyll is proprietor  northeast from ila lies the isle of mull    miles in length and near as much in breadth it lies in the shire of argyll the air is temperate cold and moist but qualified by fresh breezes from the mountains the natives when the season is moist take a large dose of aquavitae for a corrective and chew a piece of charmel root when they intend to be merry to prevent drukenness this island in general affords good pasturage for cattle of all sorts they have a great many deer and abound with wildfowl and very fine hawks their horses are little but very sprightly their black cattle excellent meat their corn is barley and oats it formerly abounded with wood but most of it is now cut the heaths besides pasturage for cattle afford good fuel for the natives the bay of duart on the west side is a good anchoringplace upon this stands the castle of duart the seat of the head of the ancient family of maclean who were the chief proprietors of this island but sir john maclean having forfeited it is now possessed by the duke of argyll there are two other castles and several anchoringplaces about this island it has several rivers which afford salmon and abound with black muscles which breed pearl there are also some fresh water lakes in it which afford trout eels etc several lesser isles lie about it and in its bays several of which are very fruitful and some are impregnable the bay called lochleffan abounds with herring and shellfish the inhabitants of this isle profess protestantism and have two parish churches besides several ruinous places formerly used for devotion in the sound or bay of mull betwixt this isle and lochaber a great ship called the florida belonging to the spanish armada was lost in the year      persons from several places have often dived for her and found good account in the guns and other valuable effects they have got out of her i have already mentioned page     the further attempts of this nature by captain roe  near this lies the island of st columbus two miles in length and about a mile broad it abounds in all things produced in this climate was noted for ancient monuments and particularly as being the residence of st columbus famous for his discipline and sanctity it had two monasteries one for men and another for women besides several chapels endowed by the kings of scotland and of the isles it is called in the irish language icolmkil some call it iona it contains now about  0 poor families the bishops of the isl had formerly their seat here this island is famous in history for being a seminary of ecclesiastics and in a manner the mother church of all the dominions of the scot and picts and though the abbot was only a presbyter yet all the clergy of the province and bishops themselves were subject to him as is mentioned by bid the church dedicated to st mary is entirely demolished and overgrown with grass and weeds nor is there any regular place of worship in the whole island here the vicar of sbee as dean of the isles used three or four times a year to catechize and preach to the people the old monastery or college of monks was a place of great sanctity and privilege of which temporal privileges the abbot was superior and in many things exempt from the bishop being subject only to the pope or his delegates the bishops of the isles were called episcopi sodorenses from sodor which is usually said to have been a village in this island but i very much question it for some critics say it should be soterenses from the church dedicated  to our savior which however seems too learned an etymology for the time of building the church or from st ourens church which by corruption or an easy transition might soon dwindle from santurensis into sodorensis if this conjecture be true then st ourens was the cathedral and the church in the abbey conventual only  six miles west from this island lies tyrety eight miles long and three broad it is reckoned to be the most plentiful of all the islands in necessaries of human life abounding with corn cattle fish and fowl here is a fresh water lake with an island and an old castle in it and an harbor for longboats which are used in that country it formerly belonged to the family of maclean but now to the duke of argyll there is one church in this island called sorabi whereof the dean of the isles was minister the people are protestants they are not very healthy as the country lies low  near this are two islands called kerniberg so strong by nature that a little art would make them impregnable  about half a league to the northeast lies the island of coll ten miles long and two broad and is very fruitful it has several rivulets which afford salmon and a fresh water lake that has trouts and eels the proprietor is a branch of the family of maclean the inhabitants are protestants they have a notion here that tyrety breeds more women than men and coll more men than women so that they may people each other without the assistance of their neighbors the coasts of this island abound with larger cod and ling than are to be found on the coasts of the neighboring isles and continent  north from this lies the isle of rum six miles long and four broad it is mountainous and heathy but the coast is arable and fruitful it is but thinly inhabited and the sea fowl lay their eggs in such quantities that in the spring any one may gather what number he pleases the rivulets of this island afford salmon and there is plenty of land and sea fowl especially those called puffins there are also abundance of deer in the mountains the proprietor is maclean of coll and the inhabitants are protestants  half a mile from rum lies canney two miles long and one mile broad surrounded with an high rock but plentiful in corn and grass and the coasts abound with cod and ling in the northend there is a rock of loadstone as some think because it disorders the needle of the compass when any ships come near it it has one church and good anchorage on the northeast the proprietor is one of the macdonalds and the inhabitants papists  muck lies southwest of rum is about four miles in circumference fruitful in corn and grass surrounded with rocks and noted for good hawks  egg lies not far from coll is three miles in length and a mile and a half in breadth and the whole pretty good for pasturage and cultivation on the southend of it is a mountain and on the top of that a high rock of about   0 paces in circumference with a fresh water pool in the middle of it there is only one pass up to it so that it is a natural fort on the southwest side of the isle is a cave capable of containing some hundreds of people and there are several medicinal wells in this island the proprietors are some of the macdonalds the inhabitants bigoted papists  north from this lies sky    miles long and in some places  0 in others  0 miles broad it is separated from the shire of inverness to which it belongs by a firth so narrow that a man may easily call from one side to the other it is navigable by the largest ships of war the current there is so violent that no vessel is able to sail against it though the wind prove ever so fair so that the tide must always be observed the way of ferrying cows in the narrow ferry called the kyle where the tide is very rapid is thus they tie a with about the cows lowerjaw and bind five of them together after which a man in the end of a boat holds the with that ties the foremost and rows over carrying in the space of a few hours at low water three or four hundred cows the country is populous the people handsome and very healthy almost all the inhabitants of sky are protestants none of them possess any land it is very high ground as well on the coast as up in the country where there are seven lofty mountains which lie near one another almost in the center of the island it has a great deal of arable land which yields a good increase so that they supply the neighboring continent with barley and oats it has many excellent bays and harbors for the convenience of fishing and other trade and about  0 rivers which afford salmon  st columbuss lake has an island and a chapel in it most of the bays abound with herrings all the summer the natives dry and preserve them without salt for eight months without any other art than taking out their guts tying a rush about their necks and hanging them up by pairs upon a rope of heath across the house cod ling mackrel haddock whiting turbet etc abound on this coast as do oysters and all other sorts of shellfish there are many large caves in this island from the roof of some of which there drops a water which petrifies into a white limy substance one of them in slate called the golden cave is said to be seven miles long there are abundance of old forts on the coast which seem to have been erected by the danes they stand on rising grounds and so near one another that by a beacon fired on any one of them the notice of any approaching danger by invasion was immediately spread through the whole island there are also several little houses of stone built under ground for hiding people and their goods in time of war and others above ground capable only of holding one person which seem to have been designed for contemplation there are several of the druids houses yet entire in the isle of sky and in some other isles the vulgar in the islands still show a great respect for these houses and never come to the ancient sacrificing carns but they walk three times round them from east to west according to the course of the sun the cattle here are horses cows sheep goats and hogs the cows frequently feed on the seaweed and observe the tide of ebb for that end as exactly as any man can do this island abounds with land and waterfowl of many sorts and among others they have hawks and eagles it belongs to sir alexander macdonald some of whose ancestors were called kings of the isles the middle parts belong to mackinnon of that ilk and the northwest parts belong to macleod all three chiefs of their several clans  sotabritil lies a quarter of a mile south of sky is five miles in circumference full of bogs and fitter for pasturage than cultivation on the west side it is covered with wood the coasts of this island abound with cod and ling  on the northside of sky lies scalpa five miles in circumference it has wood in several parts of it and is fruitful in corn and grass  a little farther north lies raarsay seven miles long and three broad it has much wood and is fitter for pasture than cultivation on the east side of it is a spring which runs down from a rock and petrifies into a fine white lime of which it yields great quantities here is also a quarry of good stone on the west side are abundance of caves where people lodge who go thither in the summer upon the account of fishing or grazing of cattle there are several forts in this island some of which are naturally very strong the proprietor is a cadet of the family of macleod and is as much respected by the inhabitants as if he were a prince  a quarter of a mile farther north lies rona three miles in length it is fruitful in pasturage and the rocks about it are of hectic stone  alsvig lies on the southwest corner of sky is two miles in circumference fruitful in corn and grass and noted for the vast shoals of herrings about it which sometimes entangle the fishingboats  fladda two leagues distant is but two miles in compass but much noted for its fishing of all sorts and for big whales which pursue the fish on the coast of it the sea fowl called coulternebs are very numerous here and a great flock of plovers come hither from sky in the beginning of september and return again in april there are several rocks about this island particularly one called the round table about half a mile in circumference with a fresh water spring which makes an impregnable fort there being only one way to climb up to it by one man at a time the natives of sky and the neighboring islands have a peculiar way of curing the distempers which are incident to them by simples of their own product wherein they are successful to a miracle they have also several medicinal wells but i have not room to insist upon these things  eighty miles west from sky lie nine islands the chief of which is vatersa which beside many other conveniences has a large harbor capable of the greatest ships where at stated times great numbers of fishermen meet from the neighboring countries  two miles from vatersa lies barra seven miles long and three broad called so from st bar the tutelar saint it is fruitful in corn and noted for its codfishing the sea enters this island at a small chanel and afterward inlarges itself into a round bay in which is an island with a very strong castle it has a good harbor on the northeast side where is plenty of fish and the rivulets on the east side abound with salmon  about a quarter of a mile south from barra lies kismul the seat of macneil of barra which is encompassed with a stone wall two stories high within which there is a tower a hall a magazine and other houses they have a church in this island and a chapel where the macneils are buried the natives are papists and generally very ignorant and superstitious  here are several other less islands belonging to macneil some of them fruitful enough in corn and grass others left for pasturage and some of them remarkable for fishing of ling and cod the inhabitants are very healthful and hospitable they have abundance of seafowl and when they kill any of them for use they salt them with the ashes of burnt seaware which preserves them from putrefaction macneil holds his lands of sir alexander macdonald of slate to whom he pays  0 l scots per annum and a hawk if required and is obliged to furnish him with a certain number of men on extraordinary occasions  betwixt barra and vist lie fourteen small islands not very considerable  a little north of barra lies southvist    miles long in some places three and in others four miles broad the east side is mountainous but the west plain and arable the island abounds with fresh water lakes which have plenty of fowl and fish particularly trouts and eels in several of them are islands with forts there is one lake three miles long into which the sea has made its way though the people did all they could to hinder it the inhabitants are healthy one man lately lived   0 years and retained his understanding the irish tongue is here spoken in great perfection the macdonalds descended from the ancient kings of these islands are proprietors and with the inhabitants profess the popish religion the soil is generally sandy but yields a good produce of barley oats and rye ambergris is sometimes found upon the coast  betwixt this island and northvist two miles north lies benbecula the ground is all plain and sandy betwixt them except two little channels about kneedeep at a tide of ebb but the whole is navigable by boats at a tide of flood and there lie several small islands on the east of these channels benbecula is three miles long and three broad it has a bay on the east side for small vessels where herrings are sometimes taken the east part of this island is arable it has several fresh water lakes well stored with fish and fowl and some small forts upon the islands in those lakes the natives are papists and the proprietor is one of the macdonalds  a little north of this island lies northvist belonging to sir alexander macdonald nine miles long and about thirty in circumference it is fitter for pasturage than cultivation on the east part where it is mountainous but the west side is plain and arable and where it is not ploughed is covered with clover daisy and variety of other plants very pleasant to the sight and of a very fragrant smell and affords good pasturage the grain here is barley oats and rye which yields from ten to thirtyfold and there is no doubt but wheat would grow here very well this island has several bays on the east side where ships may ride the chief of which are locheport lochrona and lochmaddes the latter is capable of hundreds of vessels of the greatest size  00 vessels have been laden with herrings there in a season cod ling and all sorts of fish that frequent the western seas are to be found here there is a small island in this bay upon which a magazine was erected for carrying on a fishery in the reign of king charles i there is such a number of fresh water lakes in this island as can hardly be believed they are generally well stored with trouts and eels and which is more strange with cod ling and other seafish brought in to them by the springtides these lakes have many small islands which abound with variety of land and sea fowl and some of them have islands with forts it has also several rivers which afford salmon and some of them speckled with large scales the inhabitants are protestants  there are several other lesser islands which lie on both sides of northvist the most remarkable of which is eousmil on the west a rock about a quarter of a mile in circumference noted for its sealfishing about the end of october where three hundred and twenty are sometimes taken at once  three leagues and a half farther west lie nine or ten more rocks which abound with sea fowl and great numbers of seals  a little farther north lies borera four miles round it has a fresh water lake well stored with large eels this island affords the largest and best sort of dulse it is possessed by the family of maclean  half a league south from this lies lingay which furnishes the neighboring islands with peat for fuel it has abundance of black cattle that make excellent meat the natives salt it in the hides which they say preserves it and makes it taste better than when salted in casks this island abounds also with deer sea and land fowl of all sorts among the rest with hawks eagles and swans the inhabitants of south and northvist are generally well proportioned and healthful and many of them live to a great age they are very hospitable and kind to strangers  the isle of jews derives its name from the irish word leog signifying a lake with which this island abounds it is by the islanders commonly called the long island it is near  00 miles from north to south and from    to    in breadth it is reckoned part of the shire of ross but the isle of jews properly so called is but    miles in length and  0 or    broad belonging to the earl of seaforth it reaches from the north of bowlinghead to the south of hassiness the southern part is named harries the air is temperately cold and moist and the natives use commonly a dose of usquebaugh for a corrective the island is healthful especially in the middle from south and north it is arable on the west side for about    miles on the coast and is likewise plain and arable in several places in the east it is fruitful in corn and yields a good increase their common grain is barley oats and rye and they have also flax and hemp there are several convenient bays and harbors here particularly lochstornvay on the east side in the middle of the island the birkin island seven miles southward locheolmkil three miles farther south lochsefort and lochcarlvay    miles southwest this bay is remarkable for great numbers of cod ling and whales which frequent it and all the bays and coasts abound with cod ling herring and all other sorts of fish taken in the western seas besides plenty of shellfish of all sorts in such vast numbers that the inhabitants are not able to consume them coral and pearlshells are also found in the bays and coasts there are several extraordinary springs and fountains in this island and abundance of caves on the coasts which otters seals and fowl frequent in great numbers that obelisk if i may call it so in the parish of barvas in the island of jews called the thrushelstone is very remarkable being not only above  0 feet high but likewise almost as much in breadth which no other comes near the dun or fortification built on an eminence in st kilda which is an old fort is about    leagues distant from north vist and  0 from the middle of jews or harries to be seen only in a very fair day like a blueish mist but a large fire there would be visible at night as the ascending smoke by day in this same isle where are many such duns north of the village of brago is a round fort composed of huge stones three stories high that is it has three hollow passages one over another within a prodigious thick wall quite round the fort with many windows and stairs  here also at the village of classerniss is a druidical temple extremely remarkable the circle consists of    obelisks about seven feet high each and distant from each other six feet in the center stands a stone    feet high in the perfect shape of the rudder of a ship directly south from the circle stand four obelisks running out in a line another such line due east and a third to the west the number and distances of the stones being in these wings the same so that this temple the most entire that can be is at the same time both round and winged but to the north reach by way of avenue two strait ranges of obelisks of the same bigness and distances with those of the circle yet the ranges themselves are eight feet distant each consisting of    stones the   th being in the entrance of the avenue this temple stands astronomically denoting the    signs of the zodiac and the four principal winds subdivided each into four others by which and the    stones on each side the avenue representing the cycle of    years it appears to have been dedicated principally to the sun but subordinately to the seasons and the elements particularly to the sea and the winds as is manifest by the rudder in the middle  this island abounds with cows horses sheep goats and hogs the black cattle are small but very prolifick and make excellent meat the horses are likewise smaller than on the continent but as serviceable for all domestic uses and live very hard having little to feed upon in the spring but seaware the inhabitants are well proportioned and in general healthful and strong and of a sanguine complexion they are very quick of apprehension and lovers of poesy and music they are dextrous at swimming volting and archery and make stout able seamen  in a little island near the greater one of jews were a couple of eagles which would never suffer any other of their kind to continue in the place driving away their own young ones as soon as they were able to fly the natives said that those eagles were so careful of their habitation that they never killed any sheep or lamb in the island though the bones of lambs fawns and wildfowl were frequently found in and about their nests so that they made their purchase in the opposite islands the nearest of which is a league distant  there are many other lesser islands which lie round this the chief of which are garve in the mouth of lochcarlvay a high rock half a mile in compass affording good pasturage and naturally a strong fort the two berneras one two miles and the other four miles long and four miles broad both fruitful in corn and grass  near carlvay bay lie four small islands which belong to the inhabitants of jews who go thither every summer and bring from thence great store of fowls eggs down feathers and quills one of them is called the island of pygmies because many little bones resembling those of men are dug out of the ground there  twenty leagues from the point of nesse in jews lies rona a mile long and half a mile broad it has a hill on the west part which makes it visible from jews in the summertime it was inhabited by about five families who had the island and the fishery about it divided among them and were very exact and nice in their properties and when their number increased the supernumeraries were sent to their landlord in jews who once a year sends the minister of his parish and a servant to visit them and bring his rents which are paid in barleymeal sewed up in skins sea fowl and some fish etc they have a chapel dedicated to st ronan in which they repeat the lords prayer creed and ten commandments every lords day buchanan says that the inhabitants were in his opinion the only people in the world who never wanted any thing and were satisfied with their condition having plenty of all that they desired being equally ignorant of luxury and avarice and possessing through their freedom from vices that innocence and tranquillity of mind which others can scarcely attain unto by great labor and with the help of the best instructions mr martin affirms in his description of the western islands that ancient race of poor people was all destroyed about  0 years ago in the following manner first a swarm of rats none knows how came into the island and eat up all their corn in the next place some seamen landed and robbed them of what provisions they had left by this means they all died before the usual time of the arrival of the boat from jews upon which another colony was sent thither  four leagues east from rona lies soulisker a rock a quarter of a mile in circumference which abounds with vast numbers of sea fowl particularly solan geese on this rock there builds one fowl not found elsewhere called colk it is less than a goose and all covered with down but of different colors which it casts when it hatches it has a tuft on its head resembling that of a peacock and a train longer than that of a housecock there were formerly    churches in jews and harries and the islands belonging to them but alas to our shame may it be said as papists were prosecuted or discouraged profaneness gained ground of superstition and one sort of ignorance succeeded another for few or no ministers being sent with suitable provision and encouragement places of religious worship became ruinous and the service of god and the edification of the people very much neglected so that several parishes in the highlands and isles at present are  0  0 or near forty miles long and very often without any minister at all  that part which is called harries produces the same sorts of corn but with a greater increase than jews the west side is for the most part arable on the coast it has a noble harbor called scalpa a mile and a half long and a mile broad and there are two other harbors within three leagues of it which abound with oysters and other shellfish they have excellent springs here some of which are medicinal one particularly near marvag is excellent for restoring a lost appetite and one near borve good against the colic and gravel there are several caves on the mountains and on each side of the coast and in the middle of a high rock capable of holding  0 men has two wells and but a narrow pass to it by climbing up the rock so that in time of war it is an impregnable fort there are likewise several ancient forts in this island the hills and mountains abound with deer which none are allowed to hunt without leave from macleod the proprietor metricks a fourfooted creature about the size of a large cat are pretty numerous here their skins are very fine of a brown color and make good fur and it is said the dung of this animal yields a scent like musk there are abundance of otters and seals here great plenty of land and sea fowl and among others eagles and very good hawks the inhabitants both of jews and harries are protestants  there are other islands of small extent belonging to the harries the chief of which are bernera two leagues to the south it is five miles in circumference very fruitful in barley and rye and yields sometimes from  0 to  0 fold there are two chapels in this island  half a league from thence to the westward lies pabbay three miles in circumference and fruitful in corn and grass it has also two chapels  half a league to the north lies sellay a mile in circumference it yields extraordinary pasture for sheep which it fattens very soon and those bred there have very large horns  taransay a league farther north is three miles round fruitful in corn and grass and yields much yellow talc  there are several other islands in the neighborhood of two or three miles in circumference each all tolerably fruitful in corn and pasturage particularly hermatra where a magazine for the fishery was erected in the reign of king charles i  eighteen leagues west from northvist and  0 from harries lies the island called st kilda or hirta as this hirta is the most northwest so dow hirta is the most southwest of all the scots islands the first properly called st kilda is two miles long and one broad faced round with a steep rock except at the bay on the southeast where vessels enter the land rises high in the middle and there are several fountains of good water on each side the island their grain is oats and barley the latter accounted the largest in the western isles the inhabitants are about two hundred in number very well proportioned and comely they are protestants and very zealous according to their knowledge which is but small for want of instruction they are very regular and just in their conversation and strangers to luxury and excess being ignorant of the use of money they have a chapel where they assemble on the lords day to hear the lords prayer creed and ten commandments and neither work themselves nor will allow any stranger to work on that day it belongs to the lord of macleod the chief of that ancient clan who commonly makes some cadet of his family steward of this island to receive his rents which are paid in fish fowl feathers wool butter cheese cattle and corn and the stewards deputy is in his absence the chief man of the island and generally except when a minister is sent thither from harries baptizes and marries they have an altar and crucifix in their chapel which have continued there since the time of popery and though they pay no worship to the crucifix yet they swear decisive oaths by laying their hands upon it and take the marriage oath in the same manner not long ago an illiterate fellow one of the natives imposed upon their ignorance by pretending that st john the baptist and the virgin mary had appeared to him and taught him sermons prayers and hymns the latter he alleged were effectual to secure women against miscarriage and his price for teaching them was a sheep he told them of a little hill where st john and the virgin appeared to him and made them believe that if any of their black cattle or sheep came near to taste the grass of that hill they must immediately be killed and eaten and it was necessary that he himself should always partake of the treat he was discovered at last by his lewd attempts upon several women and being by macleods order transported from thence to harries he made public confession of his imposture in several churches and seemed to be very penitent but was not allowed to return any more their houses are low built of stone and a cement of dry earth and covered with turf thatched over with straw they make their beds in the walls of their houses and lie commonly on straw though they have great plenty of feathers and down they live all together in a little village on the east side of the island in good harmony are very exact and nice in their several properties and allow no encroachment upon one another nor will they admit of it from their landlord or his steward but pay exactly what they agree on the island is naturally strong and with a little art might be made impregnable there is an old fort at the southend of the bay  in the island of st kilda is the house of a druidess built all of stone without lime or mortar or earth to cement it it is also arched and of a conick figure but open at the top and a fireplace in the middle of the floor it cannot contain above nine persons to sit easy by each other from the side of the wall go off three low vaults separated from each other by pillars and capable of containing five persons apiece  just such another house in all respects but much larger and grown over with a green sod on the outside is in borera an isle adjacent to st kilda which was the habitation of a druid  at the northend of st kilda were a couple of eagles who drove away all others of the same kind even their own progeny and brought their prey from other parts without plundering the place of their own residence  they have two other islands which belong to them one called soa about half a mile from the westside of st kilda a mile in circumference and very high and steep all round  the other is called borera lies about two leagues north of st kilda is about a mile in circumference and most of it surrounded with a high rock all three afford good pasturage and abound with prodigious numbers of sea fowl from march till september they have solan geese in such numbers that they keep about  0000 annually in little stone houses built on purpose for them and for preserving their other fowl eggs etc the latter they preserve some months in the ashes of peat and they preserve their fowl without salt they eat the solan geese eggs raw and say they are good pectorals they have another bird here called fulmar about the size of a moorhen it picks its food out of live whales and other fishes when any one approaches them they spout out pure oil from their bills which the natives have a way to catch when they surprise the fowl and make use of it for their lamps and likewise as a remedy against rheumatick pains aches and other distempers it serves them also for vomits and purges for swellings or strains and discussing of tumors in all which cases they say it is very successful both sexes have a genius for poesy are very hospitable to strangers and charitable to their own poor for whose maintenance they all contribute in proportion they have but one boat belonging to the island in which every man has a share proportionable to the rent he pays the men are generally strong are stout rowers and will tug a long time at the oar without intermission they use no compass but take their measure from the sun moon or stars and chiefly from the courses of the flocks of the sea fowl because they know very well to what rocks or islands they resort they are excellent at climbing of rocks being accustomed to it from their infancy in order to catch the fowl which build on them they have two ropes which belong to them in common for climbing the rocks they are    fathoms in length each and covered with cows hides salted to prevent their being cut by the rocks the men climb by turns and bring home some thousands of eggs and fowls at a time they also make gins of horsehair for catching the fowl yet sometimes they lose their lives by climbing the richest man in the isle has not above eight cows eighty sheep and two or three horses they have no money but barter with one another for what they want  mr martin to whom i am obliged for most of these particulars relating to the islands for it cannot be supposed i could think of entering every one of them in person gives an account of that called the second sight which he says is a representation by way of vision of something to come and makes such a strong impression upon the seers that they cannot see or think of any thing else while the vision lasts and they appear cheerful or otherwise according to the nature of the object represented they use no previous means to attain it and to most of them it is very troublesome the instances of the truth of this second sight as it is called are so many and so frequent that it can scarcely be disputed it is certainly a strange illusion but i shall not venture to give my opinion about it only observing with others that this faculty decays in proportion as christianity increases among them and as they improve in knowledge some of the people to whom those visions have been frequent have learned by experience as we were told to determine the time when the things represented shall come to pass the reverend mr john frazer the late dean of the isles has writ a small treatise upon this subject called   we shall conclude our description of these islands with an extract from mr tolands specimen of his history of the druids where he treats in general of the properties of all these isles whither it seems he had intended to have traveled in order to perfect his history and rescue many valuable pieces of antiquity from utter oblivion  it is certain says that gentleman no country abounds more with the necessaries of life and at less labor or charge than the hebrides in the first place there is known to be in those islands a prodigious plenty of flesh and fish their cattle of all sorts as cows sheep goats and hogs are exceeding numerous and prolifick small indeed of size as are likewise their horses but of a sweet and delicious taste so are their deer which freely range in herds on the mountains no place can compare with this for tame and wild fowl there being of the latter nowhere in the world a greater diversity many sorts of them extremely beautiful and rare or utterly unknown elsewhere the like may be said of their various amphibious animals numberless are their fountains and springs rivulets rivers and lakes very wholesome in their waters and everywhere superabounding with fish especially the most delicate as trout and salmon nor is it by herrings alone that all europe knows no seas to be better stored nor with more kinds from the shrimp to the whale as no harbors or bays are superior whether regard be had to number or commodiousness add to this their variety of excellent roots and plants particularly those of marine growth every one of them serving for food or physic their pastures are so kindly that they might live on milk alone with that inconceivable quantity of eggs they yearly gather off the desert rocks and islets bread is plentiful enough the ground is generally allowed to be much richer than on the scottish continent some parts whereof are not seldom supplied hence with corn  jews is very fruitful and though barley oats and rye be the only grain sown there at present yet the ground both in that and most of the other islands is fit to bear wheat and consequently legumes of all sorts it is truly amazing they have any crop at all considering how unskilful they are in agriculture how destitute of the properest instruments to till the ground and that they scarce use any other manure but seawreck or tangles from the ignorance of the inhabitants in these respects as also in planting enclosing and draining many fruitful spots lie uncultivated but they are abundantly supplied with choice eatables and the most nourishing shellfish  in bernera near harries the produce of barley is many times from  0 to  0 fold in harries and southvist one barleygrain sometimes produces from   to    ears as in northvist from  0 to  0 fold in a plentiful year at corchattan in sky the increase amounted once to    if the ground be laid down for some time it gives a good crop without dunging some fields not having been dungd in  0 years a small tract of ground at skerrybreek in the said isle of sky had yielded  00 fold with regard to their pastures nothing is more common than for an ewe to have two lambs at a time besides the ordinary rent a tenant paid it was a custom in the islands if any of his cows or sheep brought two young ones at a time one of them was to go to the landlord who on his part was obliged if any of his tenants wives bore twins to take one of them into his own family even the wild goats on the mountains for such there are in harries are observed to bring forth their young twice a year from hence it is evident that those islands are capable of great improvement as they abound likewise in many curiosities especially in subjects of philosophical observation nor is it less plain by the many ancient monuments remaining among them and the marks of the plough reaching to the very tops of the mountains which the artless inhabitants think incapable of culture that in remote ages they were in a far more flourishing condition than at present the ruins of spacious houses and the numerous obelisks old forts temples altars etc undeniably prove this besides that the country was formerly full of woods as appears by the great oak and firrtrees daily dug out of the ground and by many other tokens there being several woods and coppices still remaining in sky mull and other places the inhabitants are not to be mended in the proportion of their persons no preposterous bandages distorting them in the cradle nor hindering nature from duly forming their limbs which is the reason that bodily imperfections of any sort are very rare among them neither does any overofficiously preventive physic in their infancy spoil their original constitution whence they have so strong a habit of body that one of them requires treble the dose as will purge any man in the south of scotland but what contributes above all things to their health and longevity is constant temperance and exercise their food is commonly fresh and their meals two a day water being the ordinary drink of the vulgar they cure all disorders of the body by simples of their own growth and by proper diet or labor hence they are stout and active dextrous in all their exercises as they are withal remarkably sagacious choleric but easily appeased sociable goodnatured everchearful and having a strong inclination to music they are hospitable beyond expression entertaining all strangers of what condition soever gratis the use of money being still in some of those islands unknown and till a few ages past in all of them they have no lawyers or attorneys the men and women plead their own causes and a very speedy decision is made by the proprietor who is perpetual president in their courts or by his bailiff as his substitute  the present says mr toland is the   th lord of barra by uninterrupted lineal descent a thing whereof no prince in the world can boast and he is regarded as no mean potentate by his subjects who know none greater than he when the wife of any of them dies he has immediate recourse to his lord representing first his own loss in the want of a female companion and next that of macneil his lord himself if he should not go on to beget followers for him hereupon macneil finds out a suitable match neither side ever disliking his choice but accepting it as the highest favor and the marriage is celebrated without any courtship portion or dowry but they never fail to make merry on such occasions with a bottle or more of usquebaugh on the other hand when any woman becomes a widow she is upon the like application soon provided with an husband and with as little ceremony macneil also supplies any of his tenants with as many milchcows as he may chance to lose by the severity of the weather or by other misfortunes he takes likewise into his own family and maintains to the day of their death as many old men as through age or infirmity become unfit for labor an house being built hardby on purpose for them  of the northern isles of scotland we come now to the isles of orkney and shetland the orkneys called by the latins orcades have the caledonian ocean on the west the german ocean on the east the sea that divides them from shetland on the north and pentland firth    miles long and    miles broad which divides them from the main land of scotland on the south ancient authors differ about their number pliny reckoned them forty orosius thirtythree but it appears by later discoveries that they are only twentyeight they lie in longitude    degrees    min latitude    degrees   min the longest day is    hours and some odd minutes the winters as in most small islands and indeed always near the sea are generally more subject to rain than snow the frost and snow do not continue long but the wind is very boisterous and it rains sometimes not by drops but by violent spouts of water  stroma lies so near the coast of caithness that it was always possessed by the earls of that county and therefore not reckoned among the orcades this is a small island but not unfruitful authors are not agreed as to the reason of giving the name of pentland firth to that straight in breadth about    miles which lies between the orcades and the main land some say it is a corruption of the word pictland firth which was so called because the picts formerly inhabited those islands and part of the neighboring continent and that many of them perished here when repulsed by the ancient inhabitants of orkney others think pentland firth the proper name and it was so denominated from the highlands or hills in the north of scotland by which it is bounded on one side for the same reason that the high hills which take their rise some miles southwest of edinburgh are called pentland hills this firth is remarkable for its swift violent and contrary tides occasioned by the multitude of the isles and the narrowness of the passage which makes it very dangerous especially to strangers and which is remarkable the whirlpools with which this firth abounds occasioned as is thought by some hiatuss in the earth below are most dangerous in a calm and whirl the boats or ships round till they swallow them up but if there be any wind and the boat under sail they are passed without danger the mariners who use to carry passengers between the main land and the isles if at any time they are driven near those whirlpools by the tide throw a barrel oar bundle of straw or any other bulky thing that comes to hand into the whirlpools which make them smooth enough till the vessel pass over them and what is thus cast in is generally found floating again a mile or two distant the different tides in this firth are reckoned twentyfour and run with such impetuous force that no ship under sail with the fairest wind is able to make way against them yet the natives on both sides who know the proper seasons pass this firth every day safely except when the weather is tempestuous  the first of the orkney islands is south ronalsa six miles long and five broad fruitful in corn and well inhabited it has a safe harbor on the northside but the southeast has the dangerous rocks called pentland skerries it abounds with cattle and has two united parish churches whereof the dean was minister  a little to the southwest lies swinna a small island fruitful in corn capable of maintaining a few husbandmen and their families has a good fishing on its coasts and is noted for a good slate quarry the whirlpools near this island are called the wells of swinna  beyond swinna lie ways and hoy which are but one isle    miles long and full of high mountains that part called ways is fruitful and very well inhabited this island has several good harbors particularly that called north hope one of the best in the world and properest for those who design a fishingtrade that part called hoy from which it is only separated by a springtide has the highest mountains in orkney and the deepest valleys which strike a terror into strangers who have occasion to travel that way on these mountains there are many sheep which run wild and are scarcely to be caught by any art on rorahead a high and rugged promontory in this island an extraordinary fowl which the inhabitants call liar builds its nest it is about the size of a duck and so fat that it seems to be nothing else the inhabitants admire it much and venture their lives to climb for it by ropes etc it is reckoned delicious food eaten with vinegar and pepper on a barren heath in this island lies an oblong stone in a valley between two moderate hills called by way of contraries the dwarfy stone it is    feet long    feet broad and   feet high no other stones are near it it is all hollowed within having a door on the east side two feet square with a stone of the same dimension lying about two feet from it which was intended no doubt to close this entrance within there is cut out at the southend of it the form of a bed and pillow capable of holding two persons as at the northend is another bed both very neatly done above at an equal distance from both is a large round hole which is supposed not only to have been designed for letting in light and air when the door was shut but likewise for letting out smoke from the fire for which there is a place made in the middle between the two beds the marks of the workmans tool appear everywhere and the tradition of the vulgar is that a giant and his wife had this stone for their habitation though the door alone destroys this fancy which is wholly groundless every way besides just by it is a clear and pleasant spring for the use of the inhabitant  from the top of these hills the sun is to be seen all night about the summer solstice on the north part of this island are a church a gentlemans seat and several farmhouses as also diverse lakes which abound with fish especially trouts  three miles from south ronalsay lies burra three miles long and one broad fruitful in corn and pasturage and affords excellent fuel stewart of mains built a noble and sumptuous stone house here this isle abounds with rabbets and has a chapel but belongs to the parish of south ronalsay  west from this lies flotta   miles long and   and a half broad most of it encompassed with high rocks it has a church and a gentlemans seat and abounds with excellent landfowl in its heaths but has little cornground and not many inhabitants  near this lie faira cava and gransey fruitful and pleasant though small islands  we pass by several holms as they call them which are left for pasturage and come to pomona the largest of the orkney islands and for that reason called the mainland it is    miles long in some places nine and in others six miles broad it is very fruitful and well inhabited though there are no trees in all these islands but what grow in the bishops gardens at kirkwall in this island the only town in orkney a royal borough long possessed by the norwegians pleasantly situated upon a bay near the middle of it it is about a mile in length and is the seat of justice where the sheriffs etc keep their courts it consists of one street which is narrow but the houses are well built and most of them covered with slate the crown had formerly a very strong castle here which is now in ruins near the castle stands a stately house formerly the bishops seat and near to that a palace which was begun by patrick stewart earl of orkney in the year      but not finished because of his untimely death several rooms of it have been curiously painted with scripture stories at the northend of the town is a fort built by the english during oliver cromwells administration ditchd about with a breastwerk and other fortifications on which they have some canon planted for the defense of the harbor there is a stately cathedral church here called by the name of st magnus who the natives say was their first apostle it is very magnificent for this part of the world and built of hewn stone excellently polished it has fourteen pillars on each side and a steeple erected on four larger pillars in the middle with fine bells in it there are so many turnings that it is hard for a stranger to find the same way out or in here is a public grammar school they have a charter for two weekly markets and an annual fair which holds three days the town is governed by a provost four bailiffs and a common council this island has nine parishchurches many promontories and bays and several mines of good white and black lead it has also several gentlemens seats and diverse lakes and rivulets which abound with salmon and other fish it has four very good harbors viz one at kirkwall both large and safe another at deersound very large with good anchorage and capable of receiving the greatest fleets the third is at grahams hall and the fourth at kerston which is very commodious and well fenced against all winds in this island are two temples where the natives believe by tradition that the sun and moon were worshipped which belief of theirs is very right since the lesser temple is semicircular the greater is   0 paces diameter there are two green mounts erected at the east and west end of it and round each of the temples a trench or ditch is drawn like that about stonekenge many of the stones are about  0 or    feet in height above the ground about five in breadth and a foot or two in thickness some of them are fallen down and the temples are one on the east and the other on the west side of the lake of stennis where it is shallow and fordable there being a passage over by large stepping stones near the smaller temple which is on the east side of the lake as the greater on the west stand two stones of the same bigness with the rest through the middle of one of which runs a large hole by which criminals and victims were tied  east from the mainland lies coppinsha a small island but fruitful in corn and grass has good fishing and abounds with fowl it is very conspicuous to seamen as is the holm to the northeast of it called the horse of coppinsha  north from the mainland lies shapinsha five or six miles long and three broad it has a very safe harbor and a parish church  to the southeast lies stronsa six miles long and three broad well known because of its good harbors to those who frequent this country and shetland for fishing it is very fruitful and well inhabited and has a rock belonging to it called outkerrie remarkable for its good fishery  a little north of it lies a little pleasant isle called papa stronsa very fruitful and well inhabited  farther north lies sanda about    miles long and eight miles broad well inhabited and has two harbors it abounds with cattle hay and fish but the inhabitants are obliged to bring their fuel from eda which lies east of it it is ten miles long and in some places five miles broad there is good salt made here and it abounds with fish and fowl but not with corn and grass  three miles west from kirkwall lies damsey a small but fruitful island and abounds with fish  to the northwest lies rousa eight miles long and six broad it has many promontories and high hills but on the coast is fruitful and well inhabited it abounds also with fowl fish and rabbets  there are several other islands in the neighborhood which are fruitful enough for their extent  eight miles north from kirkwall lies eglisha three miles long and two broad it has a safe road for ships is very pleasant and fruitful and has a parish church  five miles northeast lies northfara three miles long it is but thinly inhabited but affords the common commodities of the country  southfara which lies near burra is much of the same extent and nature  north from eglisha lies westra eight miles long in some places five and in others three miles broad it is well inhabited abounds with corn cattle fish and rabbets has a strong castle with a convenient harbor  two miles northeast lies papawestra three miles long a mile and a half broad is well inhabited has a good harbor and together with the other westra makes up a parish in this island stand near a lake now called st tredwells loch two obelisks in one of which is a hole used by the heathens for the tying of criminals and victims and behind them lying on the ground a third stone hollowed like a trough  the people of the orcades are generally healthful stout and well proportioned they are more numerous than can reasonably be imagined bleau in his atlas says they mustered  0000 men at once near kirkwall fit to carry arms besides those that were left to cultivate the ground the commodities which they export yearly are butter tallow hides barley malt oatmeal fish salted beef pork rabbetskins otterskins white salt stuffs stockens wool hams quills down feathers etc molucca beans figured stones and peculiar sorts of fish and fowls are found here the claik geese or barnacles which are reckoned to breed in the trunks of trees or in the timber of old ships and have been so frequently seen about these and the neighboring islands have occasioned abundance of wrangling among the learned some of them have denied the matter of fact and boldly asserted there could be no such thing in nature as that birds should proceed from trees others who could not resist the evidence of so many persons of credit who had seen and attested the hanging of birds of that sort to the trunks of trees etc have had recourse to such strange philosophical notions for explaining this phenomenon as still made the thing more ridiculous and incredible but there are two ways to solve this difficulty found out by modern authors both of which seem very probable the first is the concha anatifera mentioned by sir robert sibbald in his natural history of scotland book iii part ii cap    wherein he says that those shells stick to seaware or logs of fir and suck nourishment from them that the animal contained in those shells is a fish but unshapely and sends out such a multitude of feet as resemble hair which the unwary observer takes for feathers and of this animal sir robert has given us a cut in the end of his book dr wallis in his description of orkney has done the like and tells us he has seen some thousands of those conchae sticking to logs of wood driven ashore in that country but the solution given by a late author in his curiosities of nature and art in husbandry and gardening lately printed at london p     seems still to be more plain if the fact be true viz that the barnacles lay their eggs as fish do theirs and leave them at the mercy of the waves and that as they float they stick to what they meet especially rotten wood seaware and other maritime plants upon which we may observe a glutinous substance and that they are hatched there by the heat of the sun  the people of the orcades generally speaking are very civil and industrious hospitable sober and religiously disposed though the air be sharp and cold yet it may be called temperate they are generally longlived the women handsome bearing children sometimes at sixty years they are seldom afflicted with fevers stone or gout but are often liable to the scurvy agues and consumptions they generally speak the english tongue after the scots way but many ancient people of the poorer sort speak the norn or norway or old danish tongue which has been continued from the first planters of these islands they have plenty of black cattle sheep swine rabbets geese and several sorts of fish they export great quantities of oil butter and salt flesh which turn to good account their cornland is everywhere enclosed and without these enclosures their sheep and swine and most of their cattle go loose without an herdsman  they formerly had their own kings after the manner of the picts who were harassed by the romans but by the injury of time or negligence of writers only two are come to the knowledge of posterity viz bladus or balus and ganus who was cotemporary with caractacus the   th king of scotland in the first century  these isles it is likely were under their own princes of the pictish blood till they were subdued by king kenneth macalpin about the year   0 but anno  0   donald bane having assigned them to the king of norway for assisting him in his usurpation the norwegians invaded them and were masters for about     years when magnus king of norway sold all again to alexander king of scotland who gave the property hereof to a nobleman surnamed speire an heiress of whose family brought it to the sinclairs or st clares one of whom carried the title of prince of orkney duke of oldnburgh etc and married a daughter of the king of denmarks but one of his successors having forfeited the title and estate fell to the crown though in truth the scots reaped but little profit by them being often disturbed by the kings of denmark and norway who claimed the sovereignty and in some measure continued possessed of it till the marriage of king james iii with a daughter of denmark when they were first mortgaged for a great sum due then by the contract and thereafter upon her bringing forth a son afterward king james iv the entire right to them was surrendered to king james iii which was farther confirmed to king james vi upon his marrying anne his queen the king of denmarks daughter the earldom of orkney and lordship of zetland continued in the crown till queen mary being to marry james hepburn earl of bothwell by fatal advice of her privy council advanced him to the dignity of duke of orkney after his death king james vi created a natural son of king james v earl which failing in his son it returned to the crown and anno      william dowglass earl of morton having advanced as he said great sums to king charles i procured this country in mortgage for his money but it was redeemed and by act of parliament all reannexed to the crown anno      excepting what belonged to the bishop which act suppressed the office of sheriff and erected one with a different name viz to be called the stewartry of orkney and zetland but the said country by the unionparliament was dissolved from the crown and her late majesty thereupon granted the same to the then earl of morton for payment of the yearly sum of  00 l and appointed him steward and justicier within the bounds thereof under the stewards are some judges of his creation and appointment called bailiffs in every parish and isle there is one their office is to oversee the manners of the inhabitants to hold courts and to determine in civil matters to the value of  0 l scots    s   d english but if the matter be above it is referred to the steward or his deputy under and subservient to those bailiffs are six or seven of the most honest and intelligent persons within the parish called lawrightmen these in their respective bounds have the oversight of the people in manner of constables and inform the bailiff of such enormities as occasionally happen which the latter punishes according to the importance and circumstances of the fault and if it be above his limits or the extent of his power he sends the delinquent to the seat of justice which is held as we hinted at kirkwall by the steward or his deputy these lawrightmen have a privilege inherent to their office by the custom of the country which is not usual elsewhere and this is if there be any suspicion of theft they take some of their neighbors with them during the silence of the night and make search for the theft which is called ransacking from ransaka which is to make inquiry in the ancient danish they search every house they come to and seizing him upon whom the theft is found bring him to the seat of justice  the christian religion was not only preached but planted very early in these isles for we find servanus or st serf was their bishop and preceptor to the famous kentigern whom in a familiar way he called mongah or mungo in his vulgar tongue who founded the bishopric of st asaph in wales about the year   0 and who had been also bishop of glasgow and anno  0   the people of orkney sent one of their clergy to york with letters desiring that archbishop who was then in fact possessed of a jurisdiction over the church of scotland to consecrate him to be their bishop the last popish bishop was adam hepburn who conformed to the reformation and lived many years after it he was an eminent man in his time a lord of council and session he crowned king james vi was father to the lord holyroodhouse where he was abbot and where his tomb remains to this day the brave lieutenant general george hamilton field marshal of great britain lately deceased was earl of orkney  eighty miles farther north lie the isles of shetland betwixt them lies the fair isle which rises up in three high promontories and is seen both in orkney and shetland they lie in    and    degrees of north latitude and have norway on the east which is the nearest part of the continent of europe there are in all fortysix islands forty holms or lesser isles left for pasturage and thirty rocks frequented only by fowl  the first of these islands called the mainland is  0 miles long and in some places    broad it runs into the sea with abundance of promontories it is best inhabited and cultivated on the shore but the inner part is mountainous and full of lakes or bogs which makes traveling there to strangers dangerous the air is cool and piercing yet many of the inhabitants live to a great age about the summer solstice they have so much light all night that they can see to read by it the sun sets between ten and eleven at night and rises between one and two in the morning and on the other hand the day is so much shorter and the night longer in the winter which with the violence of the tides and the tempestuousness of the seas deprives them of all foreign correspondence from october to april during which time they know nothing of what passes in the other parts of the world a known instance of this was that though the revolution happened to begin in november they knew nothing of it till the may following when a fisherman who arrived there told them of it and then they imprisoned him in order to try him for spreading such news  they are much subject to the scurvy by eating too much fish but nature has furnished them with great quantities of scurvygrass for an antidote they have little corn of their own growth and therefore import great quantities from orkney their common drink is whey which they barrel up and keep in cold cellars this makes it very strong so that it quickly turns their heads some of them keep for their drink buttermilk mixed with water and this they call bland the better sort have good beer and ale of which they are very liberal to strangers they have abundance of the fish of all sorts on their coasts for most part of the year those that abound most are cod ling and herring they have also shellfish of all sorts with whales seals seacalves and otters and in the wintertime they burn oil of fish instead of candle they abound with all sorts of fowl except heathcocks and other fowls which frequent heaths will not live there when brought thither though they have abundance of heath they have store of geese and many sorts of ducks they have plenty of little horses which they call schelties very fit for the husbandmans use and pace naturally they make coarse cloth stockens and knit gloves for their own use and also for sale to the norwegians their grain is oats and big but most of the latter they have abundance of black cattle and sheep their ewes are very prolifick and for the most part bring forth two and sometimes three lambs at once their fuel is turf peat and heath their chief trade of export consists in fish by the produce of which they pay their rent and purchase necessaries their native language is old gothic or german as was also that of orkney but they generally now speak english in their customs and habit they much resemble the germans but the better sort imitate the scots lowlanders their religion is protestant and they are generally as well as the orkneymen very devout there were few or no presbyterians in these parts before the year   00 when new missionaries came and ejected the old clergy yet the people did not care to hear them so long as they had any body else they make use of no physicians and if at any time they receive wounds they cure themselves there are two little towns in this island the first and oldest is scalloway on the west side of the island where there is a castle four stories high the inhabitants are about an hundred in number the second and largest is lerwick which by their fishingtrade is increased now to about three hundred families  there are several ancient monuments in these islands and particularly those called picts houses which we have not room to insist upon  the dutch hamburghers etc come hither to fish in june and go away again in august and september and sometimes there are two thousand busses fishing in brassas sound at once  the most remarkable of the other islands here are zeal commonly called yell eighteen miles long and nine broad it has three churches and several chapels and  farther north lies vuist much of the same dimensions plain pleasant to the eye fruitful and well inhabited it is the pleasantest of the shetland isles has three churches and as many harbors the inhabitants say no cats will live in it  tronda lies over against scalloway it is three miles long and two broad  a little northeast lies walsey three miles long and as many broad  on the east of brassas sound lies great rule eight miles long and two broad it has a good harbor  six leagues west from the mainland lies foula three miles in length  more to the east lies brasa five miles long and two broad it has some arable ground and two churches  burray is three miles long has good pasturage abounds with fish on the coast and has a church in it no mice will live here and it is said they forsake the place wherever the earth of it is brought  shetland is divided into twelve parishes but there are many more churches and chapels in it this country like orkney has no wood in it but they have some fish and fowl peculiar to themselves the inhabitants are very bold in venturing to sea at all seasons for fish and in climbing the rocks for fowl  it has been debated among the learned whether these islands the orcades or the northeast coast of scotland was the thule of the ancients but we have not room to give an account of the arguments for the several hypotheses nor to consider which of them are most conclusive though it ought to be observed that sir robert sibbald has in a manner demonstrated that the northeastern parts of scotland were what the ancients called so for thus speaks claudian of theodosius father of the emperor of that name ille caledoniis posuit qui castra pruinis  maduerunt saxone fuso orcades incaluit pictorum sanguine thule scotorum cumulos flevit glacialis ierne in caledonian frosts encamped he stood when orkney isles were died with saxon blood then thule with the pictish gore grew hot icy strathern bemoaned each slaughtered scot   silius italicus takes notice in thule of a custom well known among the ancient britons and caledonians coerulus haud aliter cum dimicat incola thules agmina falcifero circumvenit acta covino so when the azure son of thule wars he circles armies driven in pointed cars   the chief families in orkney and shetland are the bruces sinclairs mouats nivets chyneys stuarts grahams moodies dowglasses honeymans trails bakies southerlands craigies youngs buchanans etc but the most ancient and i may say original are the fletts hackrews richens feas skolas grottes etc  in the mouth of the river forth lie several islands the most considerable of which is the may it was formerly dedicated to st adrian who was martyred there by the danes and afterward a religious place was built in memory of him the monks gave out that barren women who came thither annually to worship at st adrians shrine would thereby be cured of their barrenness and it was frequented upon that account by women in the popish times but whether st adrian or the monks had the most influence in curing their barrenness i determine not yet that fond silly persuasion obtained so much credit that wood of largo who was a noted sea captain had a charter of several lands from king james iv to be in readiness upon call to attend his majesty and the queen while they visited st adrian this island is a mile long from north to south and about a quarter of a mile broad it lies seven miles from the coast of fife has a fresh water spring and a small lake there grows no corn here but in the summer it affords pasturage for an hundred sheep and twenty black cattle the west side is inaccessible because of high rocks but the eastside is plain and has four places where boats may arrive one of them a safe harbor for ships during a strong west wind fish of all sorts are numerous on the coast of this island and it abounds with fowl particularly those called skarts dunters gulls scouts and kittawaax the latter is about the size of a dove and in july is preferred to a partridge the scouts are somewhat less than a duck but their eggs are larger than those of a goose and being boiled hard eat very well with vinegar and parsley this island of may formerly belonged to the priory of pittenweem but was granted in fee by king charles i to cunningham of barns with liberty to build a lighthouse there for the benefit of ships for the maintenance of which they were to allow   d per tun a tower of  0 foot high is built there for that end with a fire every night and the first builder was cast away in returning from thence to his house in fife by a tempest which some poor old women were executed for raising  the bass lies next but i have given an account of it already  higher up in the forth lies inchkeith betwixt fife and lothian a mile and a half long and about half a mile broad the soil is fat and produces good grass and abundance of physical herbs it has four fresh water springs and as many harbors one toward each quarter it rises in the middle and has a strong stone fort raised upon it by queen mary there is a stone quarry here which sends forth a strong sulphurous smell when any pieces are broken off but very fit for building there are great shoals of fish round the coasts of this island and abundance of oysters during the winter this island had its name from the noble family of keith whose founder had this island with the barony of ceithmareschal in lothian and the hereditary dignity of earl marshall of scotland conferred upon him by king malcolm ii in the year  0 0 for his valor in the battle against the danes at bar in angus it came afterward to the crown and was given by king robert ii to john lord lion of glames the chief of that family with the barony of kinghorn upon his marrying that princes daughter it is since in other hands it is observed that horses grow fat here in a little time  higher up within two miles of aberdour lies an island called st colms inch as being dedicated to st columba it had formerly a famous abbey with large endowments but it is now ruined and upon the alienation of abbey lands was given to the lord downs a branch of the family of stuart  higher up lies inchgarvy between two promontories near the queens ferry it was also fortified and the guns of the forts could reach the shore or both sides so that no ships could safely pass it without leave  on the top of an high rocky hill at the westend of the islands of orkney near the village of skeal there is a sort of pavement consisting of stones variously figured some like an heart others like a crown a leg a weavers shuttle etc it takes up above a quarter of a mile in length and from  0 to  0 feet in breadth in removing any of these stones the figure is as neat on the underside as the upper and being as big as the life all of one color or a reddish kind of stone pitched in a reddish earth and the pavemen so very long it cannot be any of the tessellated or checkered works of the romans part of a garden wall is decorated with these stones and many of them are taken away by the neighboring gentry to set them up like dutch tiles in their chimneys so that at this rate in less than a century this pavement will in all likelihood subsist only in books  it has been long observed that the islands of scotland especially the western lie more conveniently for carrying on and bringing the fishingtrade to perfection than any other parts of europe  king charles i began the experiment in conjunction with a company of merchants but that design miscarried by the civil war which unhappily broke out at that time the next attempt was made by king charles ii who also joined with some merchants and this succeeded well for a time mr martin assures us from such as saw the fish that were caught by that company that they were reputed the best in europe of their kind and accordingly bore a greater price but this design was ruined thus the king having occasion for money was advised to withdraw that which was employed in the fishery at which the merchants being displeased and disagreeing likewise among themselves they also withdrew their money and that design has never been renewed since that time  but the revival of this undertaking will in all probability be one of the blessings which this island will reap by the late happy union what cannot english money and scottish industry effect  the settling a fishery in those parts will raise a nursery of stout and able seamen in a very short time to serve the government on all occasions a new colony need not be planted there for the inhabitants of the western isles are reckoned to be about  0000 many of whom have no employment and are generally dextrous at the oar and only want to be furnished with proper materials for the fishingtrade which would encourage the setting up other manufactures the commodiousness and safety of the numerous bays and harbors in those isles seem as if nature had designed them for promoting trade they have such abundance of turf and peat for fuel as would furnish saltpans with fire all the year round the coast of each island affords many thousand loads of seaware which if preserved might be successfully used for making glass and likewise kelp for soap several of the islands afford great quantities of fine clay which if improved might turn to a good account in making earthenware of all sorts cod and ling as well as lesser fish are to be had on the coasts of the lesser as well as the greater islands and what has been said of the western isles may be said likewise of the isles of orkney and shetland  having thus concluded our tour through the whole island we shall in order to render the same more complete subjoin the following articles respecting as well the southern as northern parts thereof and begin first with the following  brief abstract of the
