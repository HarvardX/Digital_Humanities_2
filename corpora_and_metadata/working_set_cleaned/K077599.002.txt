stuart papers for this year are more curious than important the scottish jacobites were resolved to risk every thing to prevent the union and the consequent success of the succession in the protestant line the french had given them some expectations of support but the battles of ramillies and turin disconcerted all their measures the french king declared that he could spare neither men nor money at present but that he would search for a more favorable conjuncture to give them the aid they required the tories in england were more cautious than the jacobites of scotland they wished for the restoration of the excluded family but they were unwilling to agree to any attempt during the life of queen anne they held no direct communication with the court of st germains the agents of that court however had access as usual to marlborough and godolphin who seemed to give private assurances of zeal for the pretender when they particularly the former publicly avowed their attachment to the house of hannover while both promoted the succession in the protestant line it appears that the excluded family had turned their eyes as early as the present year toward the king of sweden who by possessing himself of saxony and dethroning king augustus became in some measure the umpire of the affairs of europe  extracts from lord carylls letters continued lord carylls letters vol v fol scotch college february    this is to let you know that your cousin wisely the king is very well pleased with the care you take to preserve her right in reversion upon her kinswomans queen annes death and she very well approves of the method you propose of consulting with mr goulston godolphin concerning what is best to be done in it considering all present circumstances without doubt that lawyer is better able than any other both to advise and to act effectually in this affair if he were willing to undertake it but of that i must doubt considering his behavior in your cousins former claim of right to her estate in possession however your cousin gives you full commission to act and proceed in the way you shall think best for his interest and when you have consulted the abovenamed lawyer you will be better able to take your measures and to inform your cousin how matters are likely to go  march    what you now write concerning that part of the quitrents which are lately become due to your cousin wisely the king sufficiently shows her undoubted right to them according to law but i fear there will be many difficulties not easy to overcome that will obstruct her getting possession of them through the neglect of her trustee of which we shall know more when you have conferred with mr goulston godolphin about it your cousins title is certainly good in law both against young princess anne and against that other person hannover whose name i forgot who at present as you say puts in a claim i am glad to hear you say that those who have long since so often promised to pay plessingtons the kings debts make steps as if they did design to be honest at last though i do not find that you have had any fresh assurance from mr armsworth marlborough or mr gilburn godolphin who i know are full of other business at present  april   what i hear concerning hanmer hannover and his knight sir rowland gwyne is very extraordinary and i believe will make some division in wanleys the whigs family of which some are for joining immediately in company with the merchant hanmer hannover and others of them with mr brag in the parliament have publicly appeared against it i also believe that those few of kenzys relations tories that stood up for hanmer hannover have done but little good either to hanmer hannover or to themselves it is very probable as you say that the two merchants goulston godolphin and armsworth marlborough have had a great hand in all this but whether with an honest intention of paying their old debts or not time must show you are much in the right not to move in the business of the quitrents lately fallen in whilst mr brag parliament is in town and that will come on better next term in the mean time you may have opportunity of consulting with mr goulston godolphin about it and as you may find him disposed you may make a pretty near guess of the success of that and of other matters  april    i should be very glad to hear of your having had some communication with mr armsworth marlborough about the old debts before his going into the country abroad but if that cannot be i hope at least that something will be said about that matter to captain gourdon colonel sackville of which i suppose you will have an account  june   i find that your kinsman mr wisely the king is very well pleased with the way in which you proceed about the recovery of that part of the quitrents lately fallen in and applying them to the payment of the debts formerly contracted as to the success of this matter much will depend upon the honesty of mr youngs solicitor the princess of denmarks minister goulston godolphin for he has in his hands wherewithal to clear that matter and therefore a seasonable application ought to be made to him  being a person concerned in these debts though i can pretend no great skill in the law yet i should be glad these queries might be made to those that are of wiselys queens council  st whether wisely has not at present a clear title in law as it now stands to those quitrents  dly and if so whether he may not make them over to some trustees for the payment of those debts by a deed that will stand good in law this i mention because i do not see at present how the title is devolved from wisely the king to young queen anne but you that are upon the place can better judge of these matters  june    in your last you gave full satisfaction to the two queries i had put to you in mine of the sixth of june so that nothing otherwise is to be done in the business of the quitrents than according to the plan laid down by you by the advice of counsel upon the place for as you say mr brag parliament is a very angry gentleman naturally and his bitterness ought not to be stirred mr mannings the king of france affairs have gone so much backwards of late that there is little hope of his being able to lay down the sum necessary to redeem the mortgage an army for an invasion so that we must necessarily make the best of the promises given by those other merchants which you know have been such as no honest man could make and not perform when able to do so nor is there at present any question to be made of their ability having almost all the trade in their hands so that if they fail in the performance the shame will be theirs and the loss will be ours  nairnes papers vol viii  t0 no    the earl of middleton to the marquis de torcy  he informs him of his masters abilities and application to business  june      0  the king my master applies to business now with the address of a skillful workman the dispatches for scotland were exactly conformed to what you said to me they are all in his own hand and style as well as eight letters to individuals of the first consequence as this gives myself very great pleasure i believe you will not be displeased to know it  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    an account of the present state of scotland in july   0   indorsed mr scots relation first an account of the standing forces now actually in the kingdom the earl of leven commander in chief and master of the ordnance a notorious whig and hannoverian the earl of lothian major general such as the commander in chief but of less capacity james maitland major general a soldier since he was a man and if his capacity is as good as his experience is long he may be a good officer he is thought to have some good inclinations and it is presumed he may be treated with  the regiment of guards without a colonel since ramsays death consists of    companies each company  0 men including sergeants corporals and drums is   0  the earl of dalhousie first lieutenant colonel a young man with a very small estate no good manager has debts and sometimes forced to take sanctuary in the abbey of holyroodhouse but being of a loyal family and so educated it is presumed he has good inclinations and it may be reasonably expected that the kings presence will draw him and all such to his majestys interest and service the other lieutenant colonel  stewart brother to the earl of galloway is thought to have good inclinations and to my certain knowledge he was for the grand resolve the major and following officers of this regiment are reputed well affected thomas hamilton second major john murray james scott john hamilton william sharp  scott  stewart captains william murray and james ogilvie lieutenants the first two captains and the two lieutenants i know to be so  the troop of horse guards commanded by the earl of argyle consists of  00 gentlemen at least should be so  the lord forbes first lieutenant a bigoted whig little sense little estate and disloyal my lord ballantyne the other lieutenant one of a very ordinary capacity and little or no estate at the revolution and for several years after was esteemed very loyal but having squandered a good estate and falling in with the duke of queensberry he bought him at the price of his post mr john kerr the first cornet such as the captain the other archibald douglas was at and after the revolution thought very loyal and is still reputed well affected but much under the influence of the duke of queensberry i am credibly informed that many of the gentlemen of the troop are well affected  two troops or companies of grenadiers on horseback each consisting of  0 men ranked as guards  0  the earl of crawford colonel a goodnatured man and brave has little or no estate and influenced by the earl of arran the captains of some words illegible lord cumberland oldest son to the earl of balcarras and  chrichton heir male to the late earl of dumfries  the first is a very young gentleman that seems to promise no great things the other is thought to have some good inclinations toward the king  major general maitlands regiment in the garrison of inverlochy consists as i remember of twelve companies each company  0 men including sergeants corporals and drums   0  robert keith first lieutenant colonel i have known him from my infancy he always was before and at the revolution very loyal but i think since that unhappy time he is much corrupted in his principles yet at the same time i judge his old imbibed loyalty is not entirely wore out but that he may be retrieved and if i am commanded or permitted i will use my best endeavors to persuade and engage him to his duty for i know he has a great friendship for me and will not deceive me the other lieutenant colonel of this regiment is mr patrick ogilvie second son to the earl of findlater who will always be such as his brother at least so long as he is chancellor yet he has many times with great asseverations said that he never would do any thing against the kings interest other officers of that regiment i know not but in general i am informed that some of them are well affected and it is presumed many of the common soldiers are so because most of them are highlandmen and of consequence thought loyal  lord strathnavers regiment of foot consists of  0 companies each company  0 men including sergeants corporals and drums is  00  this colonel is a very young man and his father the earl of sutherland being of ill principles it may reasonably be presumed he is so yet i am told by some of his relations that he is much better disposed than his father the earl of glencairn lieutenant colonel i know is loyally inclined and i have it from most unquestionable authors that he has often said he never would do any thing against the king and as i remember he voted the grand resolution and several captains and subalterns in the regiment are reputed well affected  the lord of grant younger his regiment is in companies and number of men the same with strathnavers  00  the colonel before he got the regiment was reputed loyal but since he had it by argyles procurement he is considered as much influenced by that lord bruce of kennith the lieutenant colonel is reputed loyal as are several other officers in that regiment  the earl of lothians regiment of dragoons as i remember consists of six companies each company including sergeants corporal and drum is  0 men   0  the colonels character is already given the lieutenant colonel is son to pollwarth now called earl of marchmont when the late earl of hume listed this lieutenant colonel was thought well affected and very much under the influence of hume but what to say of him now i know not  the major of this regiment john johnston of westraw is reputed to have loyal inclinations being much managed that way by his very loyal lady but he is much under the influence of his chief the earl of annandale whom few of any side must trust  the master of carmichaels regiment of dragoons is in troops and number of men every way the same with lothians   0  this colonel like his father my lord carmichael now called earl hyndford is considered as not well affected to the kings interest and his lieutenant colonel  wishart far less being a bigoted whig the son of a minister of that pernicious tribe but pollock of that ilk the major though he is something whiggishly inclined kilmaronock tells me that he has often with great asseverations said to him that when the king comes he shall have him and his troop and this is all the loyalty i know in this regiment except one lieutenant graham who i know to be well affected  three independent companies for suppressing the highland thieves and robbers each company  00 men  00  the first independent company is commanded by captain campbell of finnab such as his chief argyle  the second independent company commanded by captain william grant generally reputed loyal  the third independent company commanded by major mckenzie reputed loyal  the castle of edinburgh commanded by earl of leven governor the garrison as i remember consists of  00  the governors character is already given  the lieutenant governor colonel james stuart one that was bred in dumbartons regiment and before and at the revolution was esteemed very loyal and is still reputed to have loyal inclinations but is a little influenced by the duke of queensberry  major cout the lieutenant of the company is a most bigoted whig and reputed very disloyal  the castle of stirling is commanded by the earl of mar governor the garrison consists of  00 men  what to say of the governor i know not well he was much reputed to have loyal inclinations and to my certain knowledge very much courted by the earl of arran to be brought entirely in both to the interest of the king and country and arran once thought himself sure of him but last session of parliament when the duke of queensberry came to scotland he no sooner came but he drew mar from the country party with the bait of secretary of state  the lieutenant governor is colonel john erskine one that is supposed will always be for what the court has a mind to so long as he enjoys any tolerable good post but  shaw of saughy lieutenant of the company is reputed to have loyal inclinations  the castle of dumbarton is commanded by master archibald campbell brother to argyle who is the lieutenant i know not but the garrison i think consists of  0 men  the castle of blackness is commanded by the earl of buchan lately made governor and the garrison as i suppose consists of about  0 men but who the lieutenant is i know not  the number of the whole forces in field and garrison    0  this account of the forces is calculated according to the establishment but cannot be reckoned effectually   00 at the highest  second the officers of state are e seafield chancellor there is no lord high

philliphaugh register  the marquis of montrose president of council not properly an officer of state  mr james stuart now called sir james is advocate  mr william carmichael and sir david dalrymple solicitors  third an account of the shires this account is greatly abridged  edinburgh the earl of dalhousie lieutenant colonel of the footguards is sheriff and for the court the family of winton were never stained with disloyalty the present earl is in france and the affairs of that family are under the conduct of mr james seaton a most loyal gentleman and brother german to the lord kingston lord balmerino a very bold loyal man and of good parts is very significant in parliament and always with the country party collington lord of session in the late kings time and lockhart of carnwath two commissioners of parliament for the shire are unquestionably loyal and of the country party of the other two commissioners dundas of arniston and dickson of inveresk the first is a whig a courtier and lord of session and the other has been much with the country party but sometimes varies  scot mentions the following gentlemen in this shire as very loyal seaton of barnes wauchop of niddery and all his sons sinclair of roselin dalmahoy of that ilk sir james baird sir william paterson sir william cuningham sir james dick sir james fleming and in the town of edinburgh though the magistracy is in whig hands the most of the merchants and tradesmen are well affected and here i cannot but remember mr drummond the keeper of the prison who is always kind to loyal prisoners and took no fees from them particularly from myself he would take none  haddington the earls of tweedale roxburgh and haddington all three of a stamp and as is supposed much for hannover yet it is thought enemies to the union what to say of lord belhavens loyalty i know not for he has varied in parliament as he had employment from the court the commissioners of parliament are sir john lawder of fountainhall one that is thought tolerably well affected but peevish and humoursome fletcher of salton though he owns himself of republican principles always opposes the court with vigor speaks boldly and well and has often said to myself that he will oppose union and hannover still as thinking both destructive to the nation nisbet of dirleton well affected cockburn of ormiston younger for the court the generality of the gentry in this shire are esteemed well affected as are many of the commons alexander egar surgeon member for the town of haddington is by many thought loyal but sometimes influenced by tweedale because he has much of his employment from that lord and others of his kidney  berwick the earl of hume heritable sheriff about    years of age has been loyally educated and has a loyal governor and it is not to be doubted but he will follow the example of his most loyal worthy father lately deceased the friends of the earls of roxburgh and haddington in this shire joined with polwarth in a late electon against the earl of hume which seems to be a clear indication of what is to be expected from these three the commissioners of parliament are sir robert sinclair of longformacus sir patrick hume of lumsden both reputed loyal and have always adhered to the country party sir john swinton of that ilk who sometimes trims but for the most part is with the country party the seat of the fourth is vacant in this shire many both of gentry and commons are well affected and generally all are so that are not whigs either here or elsewhere in scotland  roxburgh douglas of cavers is sheriff and one of the commissioners for this shire he is entirely managed by the duke of queensberry the other commissioners are sir william ker of greenhead reputed an honest well affected man but a little influenced by his chief roxburgh eliot of headshaw lord of session who as i am well informed came in by a trick is entirely wrong bennet younger of grubet he was in the country party till tweedale roxburgh and others of that set broke off he is now muster master and a courtier the gentry are well affected and the commons that are not whigs are here and every where inclined to follow their master  selkirk murray of philiphaugh is heritable sheriff the commissioners are mr john murray advocate and mr john pringle staining the first is entirely governed by his brother philiphaugh and the other much so the town of selkirk is represented by robert scot as i remember he trims but the town i know is generally well affected  peebles scot did not remember who is sheriff for this shire the commissioners says he are horseburgh of that ilk and morison of prestongrange the first is reputed loyal and he prefessed so to myself the other is a weak but rich man expecting a patent of honor and entirely managed by queensberry the earl of traquair is a worthy honest man and of most unquestionable loyalty and so is sir david murray of stanhope most of the gentry are loyal the commissioner for the town of peebles robert shiels is for the court  lanerk scot did not remember the sheriff of this county the commissioners for it are bailey of lamington hamilton of aikenhead sinclair of stevenstown younger these three are of the country party and much managed by the earl of arran but bailey of jerviswood has entirely left that party and is every way wrong the commons of this country are generally whiggish and consequently not well affected but i am informed a good many of the gentry are well inclined  dumfries he was uncertain who was sheriff the commissioners are sir john johnston of westerhall led both by employment and the earl of anandale sharp of hodham who professes loyalty but is entirely led by the duke of queensberry so is douglas of dornock but ferguson of isle the fourth commissioner keeps by the country party and is reputed loyal and i heard him lately say he would be against the union and hannover the common people are generally whiggish but a good number of the gentry are well affected the earl of nethsdale is a man of undoubted loyalty much loved and respected  wigton i know not if the earl of wigton be sheriff of this shire but i am persuaded he is and will always prove loyal the commissioners are mr john stuart of sorby brother to the earl of galloway and mr stuart of castle stuart  kirkcudbright sir  agnew is heritable sheriff of the stewartry of kirkcudbright and by many reputed well affected and i have heard him express himself so the commissioners are maxwell of cardines a rank whig and hannoverian mckee of palgowan to my knowledge is loyal and honest and generally known in that country to be so which is an evidence that most of the gentry there are well affected the town of kirkcudbright is represented by andrew hume son to polwarth both father and son hannoverian the viscount kenmure is of most undoubted loyalty having never taken the oaths  air if the earl of eglington is not sheriff of this shire i know not who is but i am sure his lordship professes much loyalty and have often heard him do so the commissioners are breslan younger of bishoptown a loyal honest man and a close adherer to the country party cathcart of carleton sometimes court but for the most part country party mr francis montgomery always with the court many of the gentry are well affected but the commons generally whigs for the town of air john muir an engrained whig is commissioner and the most of the town are said to be like him  dumbarton mr scot did not know the sheriff nor was he well acquainted in the county but he concluded that the gentry were loyal because they have chosen two gentlemen to represent them that are notourly known to be most loyal sir william cochrane of kilmaronock and sir humphry colquhoun of luss constant adherers to the country party the town is represented by a noted courtier mr smollett  bute the stuart of bute now called earl of bute is heritable sheriff reputed well affected and so is stuart of  one of the commissioners but stuart of tillicutry the other commissioner is for the most with the court and much influenced by stair and the president of the session for the town of rothsay mr dougal stuart advocate brother to bute is commissioner he is loyal active and bold speaks well in parliament and though he is sheriff depute of edinburgh he closely adheres to the country party  renfrew scot did not know who was sheriff but he was convinced that the earl of dundonald and the lord semple were loyal and he hoped that the marquis of montrose who had then great interest in renfrew as well as in dunbartonshire whatever mistakes his lordship has committed will in the main prove for the kings interest the gentry in this shire are generally reputed loyal but the commons most partly whiggish mr colin campbell member for the town of renfrew was reputed to have loyal inclinations but thought to be a little overawed and influenced by his chief argyle the commissioners for the shire were sir john houston of that ilk stuart younger of blackhall and pollock of that ilk the first are to my knowledge well affected but pollock is entirely courtier  linlithgow the sheriff uncertain the commissioners are sharp of houston and mr john montgomery both of the country party the gentry are generally well affected and many of the commons are so but the town is represented by a most bigoted whig stuart of purdiven  stirling the earl of linlithgow as i suppose is sheriff of this shire he is to my certain knowledge loyal and was from his infancy educated under the government of a most loyal mother sister to the late marquis of montrose the viscount of kilsyth is loyal so is lord forrester graham of killairn graham of bucklyvie all eminently loyal and constant to the country party the loyal gentry that i know in this shire are mr charles maitland brother to the earl of lauderdale stirling of kier seaton of touch murray of polmeas but i am well informed that most part of the gentry and many of the commons are well affected the town of stirling for the most part is whiggish at least the magistracy is so the commissioner for this town is colonel john erskine brother to the late lord of alloa and is a thoroughpaced courtier  perth  i think the marquis of athol is sheriff and it is hoped his lordship is or will be right and to my certain knowledge many of the kings friends are using their utmost endeavors to bring him entirely into the kings interest the lord drummond is of most unquestionable loyalty as is his brother lord john and all the gentlemen of that name that i know in this shire or elsewhere are very loyal the viscount stormont is of undoubted loyalty the lord nairn is of undoubted loyalty not having taken the oaths to the princess anne and not only as i am certainly informed given good advice to his brother the marquis of athol but advised and assisted the lord stormont and others how to manage the marquis in order to bring him heartily and entirely to the kings interest and service  scot mentions the following gentlemen as loyal in this shire and gives several reasons for his opinion of them drummond of logic and his brother drummond of blair and his sons drummond of  and his brother mr david drummond of  advocate mr james graham advocate a son of the loyal family of inchbrakie murray of abercairny and his brother lindsay of evelyke smith of methven graham of balgowan gray of crechie and mr gray of crechie and his son now master of gray and sir patrick trepland  fife the earl of rothes as i think is sheriff of this shire and it is known to every body that knows any thing of the transactions of scotland that he has very much lost his esteem and interest among the gentry of fife ever since he left the country party the earl of murray is of undoubted loyalty as is his brother and presumptive heir as having never taken the oaths and my lord sinclair is eminently loyal having never taken the oaths and all his children that are men are loyal and sir william bruce colonel balfour of ferny scot of scotstarvit sir john preston carstairs of kinneucher stuart of dunaven and malcom of grange are all very loyal never having taken the oaths the members of parliament were anstruther of that ilk lord of session beaton of balfour balfour of dunbog and douglas of strenry scot was uncertain about the principles of the first and last as their conduct in parliament frequently varied but he was convinced that the second and third were well affected as they adhered closely to the country party  sir john malcom and malcom of bolbodie i know to be loyal and the lord lion is generally so reputed for the earl of balcarras i can say little for him but i know the earl of kelly has loyal inclinations but is frequently kept out of parliament by the influence of his lady and her father balcarras the lord colville is thought well affected and is a close adherer to the country party for the rest of the noblemen in fife i can say nothing for them but the far greatest part of the gentry in this shire are reputed well affected as are all such of the commons as are not under the direction and influence of presbyterian ministers the members of parliament for the towns in fife are watson of aderny for st andrews david christie for dysart sir jo anstruther younger of that ilk for anstruther easter such as his father sir john erskine of alloa for bruntisland james spittell of lenchat influenced by tweedale and yester is for inverkeithen captain ossat a seaman for kirkaldy  of reedie younger for kinghorn much if not entirely under the influence of the earl of leven bruce of  for coupar entirely devoted to rothes sir peter halket for dumferling smith of geblieston for pittenweem moncrief of sachop for creill david dalrymple for culross entirely courtier robert anstruther for anstruther wester beaton of balfour younger for kilrenny all those members for the towns in fife except such as are above distinguished are generally believed to be honest men well affected to the kings interest and i know most of them to be so and all of them are thought adherers to the country party  forfar the earl of strathmore is sheriff and is of undoubted loyalty the earl of airly is loyal as are the most of his name every where the earl of southesk is loyally educated and to my knowledge most zealous that way and it is hoped the earl of northesks inclinations are right though he has sometimes varied in parliament i am sure he was for the grand resolve the lord kinnaird is very loyal  the members of parliament for this shire are lion of achterhouse carnegie of finhaven haliburton of pitcur and graham of fintray all four loyal but the first and last most remarkably so the loyal gentlemen in this county are lindsay of edsdale and his brother forthringham of powrie elder and younger seaton of old bar ramsay of bamff graham of duntroune he that represents dundee lion of cossens lion of carse lion of ongle the town of forfar is represented by mr john lion an honest loyal man brechin is represented by alexander millison so loyal and honest that no act could yet prevail with him to give the court one single vote even though he is very poor hutcheson for the town of aberbrothick is reputed loyal and scot of logie for the town of montrose though he was the first that left the country party upon the temptation of the master of works place he always did and still does pretend much loyalty and has often sworn to myself that he never will do any thing against the kings interest  in short this shire is so entirely loyal that there is scarce any in it of birth breeding or estate but what is so and so are all the commons some few whigs excepted most if not all in the town of dundee but now the magistracy of that town is out of their hands which was chiefly promoted managed and effectuated by fintray and captain yeaman a substantial merchant lately come from the west indies and has the reputation of a loyal honest man  kincardineshire commonly called mearns the earl marshal heritable sheriff of unquestionable loyalty loved and respected has great interest in elections for parliament and on a good occasion will be much followed both by the gentry and commons the viscount of arbuthnot is loyal and has often professed so to myself the family of halkertown were always loyal but this lord is mad the gentry and commons of this shire are exactly so as in angus such of them as i personally know and am particularly acquainted with are sir david ramsay of balmain commissioner for the shire who is loyal and keeps steady with the country party sir thomas burnet of leys the other commissioner though he was very far wrong at the revolution and sometimes varies in parliament he has for these three last sessions been for the most with the country party particularly for the grand resolves and spoke boldly against the hannover succession when proposed by polwarth and told myself a week or two before i came from scotland that he would to the utmost of his power oppose the union  the gentlemen in this shire that i am familiarly acquainted with and know to be loyal are bannerman of elsick falconer of newton falconer of glenfarquar middleton of balbegno burnet of glenbervie scot of brothertown scot of benholm scot of comiestown barclay of johnston barclay of bomakinan and douglas of arthrose son to bishop douglas  aberdeenshire the earl of errol lord high constable of scotland is of most unquestionable loyalty the earl of aberdeen is reputed loyal and my lord haddo lately to myself expressed much loyalty the members of parliament for this shire are udny of that ilk more of stoneywood gordon of pitlurg and seaton of pitmeddan younger all four i am informed were chosen as loyal honest men which is a good evidence of the loyalty of the barons there as it is in many other shires i am well informed by many of the kings friends that most or all the gentry are wellaffected to the kings interest my lord forbes and some of his name excepted who are rank whigs and few of that stamp are any where wellaffected  inverness scot owns he knew little about this shire he was acquainted he says with the commissioners grant elder and younger the first always adhered to the countryparty and to my certain knowledge very warmly opposed the hannover succession when proposed by polwarth his son was last session courtier  nairn scot knew little about this shire but he heard that the generality are wellaffected the members of parliament are rose of kilravock and forbes of culloden the first is reputed loyal and for the most part with the countryparty the other commonly with the court  cromarty scot knew only by common report that in this as in all the northern shires all ranks of people are generally wellaffected to the kings interest the lord tarbat has changed so often and trimmed so much that i do not know what to say of him the members of parliament for this shire are mackenzie of cromarty and macleod of cathbole both much under the influence of tarbat but frequently with the countryparty  argyle for this shire i can say little about

for the town of campbeltown  bamff in this shire all ranks of people are generally believed and reputed to be loyal ogilvie of boyne younger is the commissioner for it and is reputed and very much pretends to be loyal he has sometimes varied in parliament but last session he closely adhered to the countryparty his colleague duff is dead lord salton is loyal and though the lord fraser has a post in the army he is thought to be loyal and the loyal lord duffus is dead and his son is with an english squadron in the west indies  sutherland this shire is of a very small compass and being as i am informed only two or three barons in it the earl of sutherlands vassals are privileged by an express act of parliament to elect commissioners contrary to the general rule of law and standard of the nation so this earl must always rule the election as he thinks fit the present commissioners are gordon of gavity supposed to have inclinations to loyalty but often varies in parliament the other commissioner sutherland of kinnald younger is in prison for debt  caithness this shire as both commissioners of it informed me is entirely loyal sinclair of stempster is one commissioner sir gregory sinclair of clyth the other commissioner died before i came from scotland and none in his place that i know as yet elected but it is not to be doubted but an honest loyal man will be chosen the earl of caithness is very loyal but it is thought will not come to parliament because he has no inclination to take the oaths  elgin i cannot say much about this shire but that it is reputed as the other northern shires are well affected it is represented by brodie of that ilk who is old and infirm and has not been in parliament for the two sessions past the other commissioner is mckenzie of inch couter a loyal honest man and stands firm with the countryparty  orkney the stewartry of orkney is believed and reputed to be very loyal the commissioners for it are sir archibald stuart of burray and douglas younger of eagleshaw both reputed loyal but much influenced by the duke of queensberry yet voted the grand resolves and as i am well informed have often declared they will never do any thing against the kings interest  clackmannan this is very small consisting of three four or five barons has at present only one commissioner stuart of who is reputed loyal and is of the countryparty  ross this shire is like the other northern ones believed and reputed to be loyal the commissioners for it are mckenzie of scatwell and mckenzie of gerloch both reputed loyal but much influenced by the lord tarbat  kinross this is a very little shire containing very little more than the estate of kinross and a little town of that name mr bruce younger of kinross is commissioner for it i know not what to say of his loyalty but i can with confidence say that his father sir william always was and still is a very loyal honest man  i do not pretend to give a plain distinct particular or positive account of the highland clans but in general according to the last information i have had i think they may be capable to raise about eight thousand men i mean such as are well affected for argyle and all his followers are considered as otherwise disposed  the duke of gordon is of so known and undoubted loyalty that i shall not presume to say any thing about his grace only in general as he is one of the most powerful of the clans he has this advantage that having many gentlemen of note of his name and abundance of gentry in the low country his vassals he is capable to bring a good number of horse to the field which few or none of the clans but his grace can do  may it please your majesty thus to the best of my judgment and knowledge in the preceding pages i have given your majesty a true sincere and faithful account of the present state of scotland and i am fully persuaded that the far greatest part of the nation is well affected to your majestys interest and i know none that are ill affected but that pernicious rebellious crew the presbyterian ministers and such as are entirely under their direction and influence which are for the most part the common people for in the western and most whiggish shires a great many of the chief gentry are well affected and as i am informed by the viscount of kenmure those in galloway commonly called cameronians are generally for your majesty and every body knows that all the northern shires nobility gentry and commons are well affected  lord carylls letters vol v fol scotch college extracts from lord carylls letters continued july    i find

your cousin wiseleys the kings debts had yet received no answer but that you intended a visit to mr goulston godolphin to try whether by his means you could procure a good dispatch in either or both

very difficult to be obtained  now i am very glad to find by your last letter of the   th that you have met with mr goulston godolphin and found him in very good humor and that which pleased me most is that he seemed to be affected with the good news of your cousin wiseleys the kings better health which by other rumors had been contradicted as for what passed between you in regard to the quitrents i am glad at heart that he is gone so far in it as to take from you an abstract of the title and an account of the adversaries pretensions to consider what may be done in it i find mr jones middleton is much beholding to him for his kind expressions in his behalf and will be more so when by his means leave is obtained for jones middleton his young kinsman i hope the kindness shown to mr

king whose presence appears to them very necessary for animating the people confounding his enemies and deciding when opinions differ  having received no news from this country since the misfortunes that happened to them they considered themselves in duty bound to assure the king their master that their zeal was not shaken nor their courage damped by them but that they would make all their efforts to reject the union and did not doubt to succeed providing the prevailing party in england did not send money to gain voices in parliament and that even this though it should happen should not break off the project of the enterprise because those who disapprove of the union will be piqued at it and be reduced to the necessity of having recourse to force as the means of preventing the effect of an act of parliament and of delivering themselves from the tyranny with which they see they are threatened but that without the succors they demand they will not be able to do any thing and there will be reason to fear that some through despair will abandon the design in order to protect themselves from the persecutions which they have endured with a constancy that can never be sufficiently

master of england will think himself obliged and even under a necessity to find this advantage of a communication and to employ all sorts of means to establish it and his conscience will be no obstacle to him as he will justly think that he will have as much right to any other country as he has to england  as a bridge of boats is thrown over rivers vessels are employed for the same purpose at sea and in order to employ them to keep up a communication between england and the territories of hannover the duke of hannover must have a maritime province to join his dominions and he will find none but that of bremen  the same reasons which will induce the family of hannover to seize on the country of bremen should alarm the king of denmark for the safety of holstein and oldenburgh without which that family will not be master of the elbe and the weser not to mention the ancient enmity between these two powers which appeared on all occasions and lately at the treaty of travendal any regard he may have had for the present establishment in england should have ceased at the death of the prince his uncle without children and now instead of establishing an enemy it depends entirely upon him to reestablish the king of england his near relation and thereby engage him still more strongly from a principle of gratitude and from ties of blood to be invariably in his interest  the elector of brandenbugh likewise may allow himself to be carried away by the hopes of having for his share pomerania to which he pretends a right of succession as well as convenience and a powerful addition to support his royalty  the elector of saxony will require no other motive for entering into this plan but revenge and an irreconcilable hatred  it is not to be doubted but the king of sweden will be persuaded that these things merit serious reflections and that he will find no other means so effectual for preventing the calamities with which he is threatened as to employ all his force to reestablish the king of england and there is reason to hope that he will make no difficulty of contributing to this when he will see that prudence justice and glory concur in it  the means of

commons notwithstanding the vehement opposition of the tories william cowper a man of heavy and confused parts but who was attached to the same principles was made by their influence keeper of the great seal and in general the whole current of preferment ran through the same channel the tories vexed at the loss of their influence acted a part which exhibited a curious specimen of that glaring inconsistency of conduct into which the spirit of party has too often betrayed mankind to harass their political opponents they endeavored to take possession of their ground and though they were supposed to be enemies to the succession of the house of hannover the lord haversham as the mouth of the party moved in the house of lords for an address to the queen to invite the princess sophia into england the motion was rejected by the whigs who then possessed the whole influence of government there were however brought in two bills which were deemed a great security to the protestant succession the first appointing a regency on the event of the queens death and the second for naturalizing the princess sophia and the issue of her body being protestants  the opposition of the whigs to the invitation to the princess sophia having raised suspicions against their attachment to the house of hannover the party endeavored to take to themselves the whole merit of the securities in savor of the succession which had passed in the present session of parliament the lord halifax one of their number was sent with the acts of regency and naturalization to hannover and he carried along with him letters from all the leaders of the whigs expressive of their sincere attachment to the succession of the electoral family the increase in the correspondence with hannover together with the zeal expressed in the letters form a kind of proof that the succession of the princess sophia and her posterity began then for the first time to acquire a degree of certainty the queen perhaps justly was suspected of having no intentions of that kind and her minister the lord godolphin had been uniformly in the interest of the exiled family though by a happy timidity he at last in a manner ensured success to their rivals he however was so true to his principles that though he aided with all the weight of government the acts of regency and naturalization he never took merit to himself from that circumstance nor entered into any correspondence with the house of hannover the principal events connected with the correspondence of this year are the complimentary embassy of the lord halifax the treaty guaranteeing the protestant succession concluded with the states general the treaty of union then carrying on between the two kingdoms the battle of ramillies the subsequent conquest of

the project which you got approved of at the hague for putting king charles and prince eugene in a condition to act offensively the next campaign it is certain that one cannot imagine any thing more advantageous to the common cause and that the prudence with which you have formed this project joined to the care which yon have taken to bring it to a happy conclusion has added not a little to the great obligations which the public owes you already and to the glory of the queen who continues to give such convincing proofs of her good intentions  with regard to the affair of lubec you are too well informed not to see that it would be as much my interest as the interest of the rest of the allies to see it terminated amicably by an accommodation but if this cannot be soon done in a manner with which the administration may be satisfied i leave you to judge if it will be possible to control the king of sweden and if i can dispense with fulfilling the engagements into which i entered personally concerning the bishopric of lubec and those to which the guarantee of the treaty of travendahl binds me being joined in this guarantee with her majesty and with holland i doubt not but in that case they will concur with me in making the house of gottorp sensible of its good effects in an efficacious manner  you have no doubt been informed already that the troops have been withdrawn by both parties from the city of eutin and from the whole bishopric and that the danes are returned home after having dislodged the troops of the administrator so that the only thing to be done now is to support that prince in the civil possession and in the administration of the bishopric under the guarantee of the same powers who are guarantees of the treaty of travendahl i hope that her majesty will not only contribute to this but also by her influence determine the states general to join her in so salutary an undertaking i beseech you sir to be so good as to give all your attentions to this

expedients which without prejudice to the incontestible rights of that house may terminate amicably the differences now subsisting i shall even employ myself with all possible ardour to reconcile the

necessary for engaging denmark to resolve to give their consent that the administrator may be re established in the possession of the bishopric without which i assure your majesty it will be no ways possible to control the king of sweden i doubt not but your majesty by your great influence at the imperial court will prevail with the emperor to concur with you and with the states in engaging denmark to accept of such a reasonable expedient this in my opinion is the only means of obtaining the end which your majesty has in view mine shall always be to give you proofs of the profound

room to believe that it will have no consequence hurtful to the interests of the common cause  it is very disagreeable that the prince of baden should be silent when he ought to concert with you the operations of a campaign which is already so near it is to be hoped that the imperial court without delay will take in that respect the necessary measures with her majesty and with the states whatever may be the result of this you may assure yourself that i shall give to lieutenant general bulau the orders which you desire and that the troops which i have in the queens pay will join your army

electoral highness to communicate it to you it contains that all that has been done in england this winter for establishing the protestant succession and for testifying respect and attentions to your electoral family is in the opinion of the electress of so little consequence that she considers it at most as a mere compliment and that for that reason it will be more agreeable to her that the acts of parliament may be sent to hannover without any ceremony and that the garter which the queen has given to the electoral prince may be sent merely by a herald  these sentiments concerning what has been done here are altogether different from those which every one in england who has ever shown any zeal for the protestant succession entertains of it it is for this reason i am not able to reflect upon this affair without a great deal of uneasiness the parliament have redressed several very essential defects in the laws which regarded a protestant succession they have provided against all accidents which human prudence could foresee and they have put the government in the time of the successor on the same footing which it is at present during the reign of the queen these things are considered here as affairs of the last importance and as the most real and essential marks that could be given of a true zeal for the protestant succession  with regard to the act of naturalization of the electoral family it has been declared to be absolutely necessary by the unanimous opinion of all the judges who are the best guides in an affair of that nature with regard to the proposal of inviting the electress over to england immediately when it is considered by what fort of men it was made in what manner and at what time there was reason to hope that a proposal of that nature would not be better received by the electress than it has been in england there is no one so capable of judging of all this affair as your electoral highness and you only can set it before the electress in the proper light this is what i beseech you to be pleased to do for the good of england and of the protestant succession i cannot make a better excuse for the liberty i have taken than the true zeal

faithful as those who affected to give him an invitation and intended to make a merit of it after having seen that all their opposition to the succession was useless what gives pain to good men here

sincerest assurances that my heart should ever continue most firmly devoted to the service of your e h and your e h serene house but now since i hope it is allowable for me to express to your e h the very great satisfaction i have with every good englishman received from the effectual securities lately provided by the parliament for the protestant succession to the crown of england i beg leave humbly to present to your e h at the same time his most faithful profession of a most ardent zeal for your e h prosperity and promise never to neglect any thing in my little power that may possibly conduce to it being fully persuaded it is impossible to be in the true interest of england and not to be a fast friend to that succession which the sense of the kingdom has so often declared to be its only defense from the most deplorable condition a people can be reduced to i was one of those who have had the honor for a long time past constantly to have adhered to that opinion for excluding a romish successor even while it was unfashionable and decried by those that were in authority and therefore that the same persons should now continue firm to the same when it is owned by the legislative authority and the general bent of the people can admit i think of no question this i chose to mention as an evidence of my sincerity in what i profess rather than multiply expressions which are in every ones power to make not that i am at all apprehensive of those endeavors which have been used to render your e h and your e h serene house disgusted with those who have the truest concern for your service since it is impossible that so excellent a judgment as that of your e h should ever prefer the surprising starts of a sudden unaccountable zeal contrary to known principles affected merely for popularity and showing itself in one particular only while all other means tending to the same are neglected to a steady uninterrupted and uniform course of acting for the protestant succession and flowing from principles that were owned when most discountenanced but these endeavors in me to give your e h any satisfaction of this kind are perfectly unnecessary since my lord halifax who is so able and thoroughly versed in all the affairs of this kingdom and so acquainted with the inclinations and practices of all men in business here is to be for some time in your e hs court where none can so well disperse all unfair representations of facts and when that is done your e h cannot but make the wisest conclusion and such as next under the blessing of god may best tend to make yet more effectual those prudent provisions which the wisdom of this kingdom has on mature deliberation thought fittest to be made for the interest and honor of your e hs serene house and

lord halifax has encouraged me to the presumption of writing i could not hope for a more favorable opportunity of making this humble tender of my duty than by the hands of one who has so eminently distinguished himself upon all occasions for the settling and establishing the succession of the crown of england in your most serene family and who will be a witness above exception of my conduct in every part of that affair i confess i always depended upon it that my public behavior should be an abundant testimony for me as to my zeal to the protestant succession and for promoting the war in order to reduce the power of france which i take to be the most effectual security to that succession  it is with infinite satisfaction we hear your electoral highness has been pleased to approve the measures taken in our parliament this last winter my lord halifax is able to give so perfect an account of every thing that has been done and of the several means used to bring them all to bear that i shall not pretend to enter further into that matter than by saying i hope it will appear that nothing is now wanting to the establishment of the succession that can be done by the provision of laws and that the administration of the government when the succession shall take place will be upon the same foot that it is now in the queens reign  it might have a strange appearance that they who by a long and steady series of acting had shown themselves beyond a possibility of dispute the assertors of the succession in the person of her electoral highness the princess sophia should in the least hesitate to agree to a proposition that it was necessary to have the next presumptive heir to the crown to reside in england but i beg leave to suggest to your electoral highnesss consideration that if this had been allowed for a rule it might possibly in a little time have pressed very inconvenient upon your electoral highness it was not to be imagined you would leave dominions where you were sovereign to reside in england before you were our king and yet there would have been an inconveniency in rejecting an invitation of that nature when the kingdom had before declared such a residence to be necessary but the manner of making this proposal was above all other things the strongest objection to it the speech with which it was introduced is in print and so cannot be misrepresented the turn of it was to show first that we could go on no farther with the dutch which was in effect to say we must make peace and next to say the queens administration was hardly sufficient to help us in peace at home unless the next heir came over the queen was present at this discourse and no one can judge so well as your e h whether this was a compliment proper to engage her majesty to enter willingly into the invitation and if it had been assented to with reluctance whether it might not have given rise to unkindnesses that might in the end have proved very fatal  they who were afraid of entering into such an invitation especially coming as it did from those who never till then showed any concern for the protestant succession thought it proper to lay hold of that favorable conjuncture to push in for those solid provisions which were evidently wanting and which we hope are brought to effect by the act that is to be farther carried on by the negotiation entered into for engaging the allies to become guaranties of our succession and by the treaty between the commissioners of england and scotland for a union of the two kingdoms which seems to be the way now laid open for obtaining the declaration of the same succession in scotland which is already effected in england i believe there is a good disposition in the commissioners on both sides i can absolutely promise for one the meanest of them that as far as my capacity and application can go nothing shall be wanting to bring this treaty to a happy issue  having already presumed to take so great a liberty i humbly beg permission of your e h to mention another particular the act of naturalization which some have said was at least unnecessary if not a diminution to your most serene family if this be so not only all our present judges but all the lawyers of former ages have been in the wrong there are but two ways of making any persons born out of the allegiance of the crown of england capable of enjoying inheritances honors or offices in this kingdom the one complete and perfect which is a naturalization by act of parliament the other imperfect which is by letters patent of denization that this is so cannot be better proved than by the instance of his highness prince rupert for when k c the first intended to create him d of cumberland to make him capable of that title it was found necessary previously to make him a denizen by the ks grant under the great seal the differences then subsisting between the king and his parliament making it impossible to procure a naturalization but the present act is attended with all possible marks of honor and respect for the queen and nation it extends to all the posterity of her r h the princess sophia born or hereafter to be born and wheresoever they are born which is a privilege that was never yet granted in any case till in this instance it is only from your e hs eminent goodness that i can hope for pardon for this tedious

employed her influence in getting them passed we are also very sensible of the honor which she does to the electoral prince in sending him the order of the garter as you know that i am naturally an

suffer any diminution from the discourses attributed to the electress which she certainly never held with mrs how and which having only come to the ears of that lady at second hand have been

you have already acquired and a fresh obligation to those which the public owe you i am very sorry that the state of my affairs the situation of my country and the just diffidence which i must entertain of several of my neighbors do not leave me the power to agree to send my troops to such a distance and to put them beyond the reach of being of service to me in case of need you know my lord that i expressly reserved it to myself by the treaty the liberty of bringing them back when i should find it requisite for my own defense and that the fear of that want has induced me not to renew the treaty but from year to year and to specify the places where my troops should act i doubt not but before you begin the proposed march to italy you will take care to provide sufficiently for the safety of holland since a check upon that side might occasion irreparable losses to the common cause and your being at such a distance might put it absolutely out of your power to bring timely relief and as it is impossible to provide for the defense of the frontiers of the republic but by leaving in them a powerful army i think the troops which i have in the queens pay may be allowed to serve in such an

stuart papers  either to yourself or at least to some friend at hannover if i did not entirely depend on your great prudence which will easily imagine the good reasons for it after those extraordinary sort of proceedings we have had among us  the truth is i with a great many more as they have owned in conversation have been this long while in a constant expectation of your appointing some person either privately or publicly to convey letters safely and to be conversed with and confided in upon occasion because though i believe no body ever had a thought on this subject of your coming over hither either in the least disrespectful to the queen or even to the government or which could justly be blamed by either of them if discovered yet it would be unmannerly to yourself as well as imprudent to venture letters to so great a person that are so liable to be intercepted as mine are at this time though god knows without my least deserving it and therefore according to this notion it was thought absolutely necessary long ago to acquaint your r h once for all with the necessity of such an agent but since none has come i must conclude the proposal never came to your hands though sent enclosed several ways which was a confirmation of the reasonableness of it which has made me resolve to give your r h this one trouble more now at last in hopes it may have better success though enclosed for once to mr davenant but in a private packet who as devoted as possible to the house of hannover yet is by no means proper to convey a correspondence of this kind which as innocent as it is must needs be exposed every packet to the under clerks of an office  i most here most humbly take my leave of your r h this way because besides the being apprehensive of giving unnecessary troubles i think it better to refer all to that time when you will be pleased to settle this so necessary method i shall now only say that in my conscience i believe and dare affirm myself sure that the persons in both houses who appeared for your coming over and against that bill which passed not to present it but as a security brought in the room of it did it principally for the quiet and safety of the government and more especially of the queens sacred person whom according to their obligations they love and reverence above all things and their next consideration was for fear that illdisposed persons should interpose between the time of such a fatal accident of our losing her and the protestant succession established and might consequently wish for that sad day in order to such their

hesitate to advance toward them placing our confidence in the blessing of heaven and the valor of our troops sunday last we continued our march at three oclock in the morning to gain the opening between the mahain and the great geete we soon understood that the enemy were likewise in march but according to the report of the general officers who were our prisoners their design was not to fight before monday not believing that we would venture to come to them the armies were in fight before noon and all diligence was used on both sides to arrange the troops in order of battle and to form the batteries which began to play at one and toward two oclock we ordered the village of ramillies which covered the right of their infantry where they had their largest battery with a great force to be attacked  the battle became hot and continued long enough with great fury but at last the enemy was obliged to give way we took their cannon and made many prisoners and having continued the fight with the same vigor the infantry as well as the cavalry until between four and five oclock when the enemy began to withdraw we pursued them without intermission fighting them as they retired until the night was far advanced so that god has given us a complete victory we have taken fortythree pieces of cannon the pontons a great part of their baggage and at least four thousand prisoners besides their loss in the battle  we only halted two hours in the night and we began our march before day in order to draw near the dyle of which we had determined to attempt the passage this morning at daylight but the enemy saved us that trouble having retired last night toward brussels so that we entered louvain and all our army passed the river without opposition the french burnt their magazines in the town but the spaniards left theirs entire  your e h may easily judge by this of the loss of the enemy and of the consternation in which they are we propose tomorrow to advance toward brussels to take the advantage of this consternation and to endeavor to attack them again or to oblige them to retire further nothing could excuse us for fatiguing the troops so much after so obstinate an engagement but the necessity of driving them to the last extremity before the marishal de marsin joins them which may happen in four days  your e h will forgive me for so long an account which i am

their point when the marshal de marsin returns to the maese with the detachment which he commands and when the prince of baden having placed himself safely beyond the rhine has assembled there a force sufficient to prevent the passage of the french i see no necessity of sending to him my troops i know if they once should advance on that side the prince will find means of keeping them all the campaign which is as contrary to my intentions as it is to the public service i always reckoned that they were to serve in your army and i dont see that there is any necessity of employing them elsewhere you will therefore oblige me much by sending them your orders without delay they will follow them punctually but i choose to hope that you will approve the strong reasons which i have not to trust them to the prince of baden and that the interest of the common cause does not demand that i should you will find means of employing my troops in places where they may serve more usefully i

act on his side and i slatter myself that the court of vienna will take care that so large a body of troops monsieur de bulau computing them at forty thousand men besides the hessians shall not remain

answers every moment we cannot take the proper measures until we are masters of the first place i flatter myself that all this will have a good effect elsewhere and that if our troops upon the upper

private till they were laid before the parliament by all accounts from thence there is great reason to hope they will be approved there has been little done hitherto but the appearances are promising the jacobites there are so apprehensive that the union will be carried that they are willing to come into the proposition which the opposing party talk of making which is to settle the succession on your royal highness with limitations and a communication of trade they think this the most plausible way of baffling the union but it is so well understood that this offer comes too late now which might willingly have been received some months ago but your royal highness will give me leave to observe that we have managed the opportunities we have had with some skill when things are brought to that pass that the very jacobites are for settling the protestant succession one way to avoid establishing it more effectually another and we have this further to say that if this union is made it

impossible to pay too much attention to them i consider as a great happiness to the allies that france addresses herself to a person whose good intentions are so well known and whose understanding is proof against every artifice  i agree with you my lord that it is necessary to be very much on ones guard and to be diffident of whatever comes from such a suspicious quarter it appears to me that it is to be avoided above all things to take any step which may give umbrage to such of the allies to whom france has made no overture and as the two letters which you communicated to me bear that that crown does not choose to exclude from the negotiation which it proposes any of the powers which are at war with it nothing in my opinion is more natural than to answer that the queen and the states being obliged to act in concert with the emperor and the principal allies in this great affair it is necessary for you to begin by communicating to them what has been addressed to you and to know their sentiments before you can give any positive answer  by this means you will gain all the time necessary for discovering if france acts sincerely or if she wants to lay snares and you will persuade more and more the emperor and the other allies of the rectitude with which the queen and the states act with them this will strengthen the union of the confederated powers which ought never to be closer than when it is proposed to treat of a peace i order the baron de bothmar to be thoroughly instructed as well in this affair as in others which are at present on the carpet entreating you

apprized of this state of affairs in scotland either through want of comprehension in himself or the fortunate ignorance of foreign affairs which always prevailed in the counsels of france declined to send the demanded supplies and thus discouraged a diversion to the arms of the most powerful of the allies which in all likelihood would have procured the peace which was so necessary to his

king and wiselys queen removing from the place where they have so long traded and fixing elsewhere so that i look upon such rumors whether well or ill meant to be but idle speculations i am also of your opinion that a good construction may possibly be made of armsworths marlboroughs intentions in the bargain which is now making between wheatly england and norly scotland because it may bring on a necessity of henlys continuing in his post for it has always been my opinion that armsworth marlborough without the assistance of henly would never be able to pay his old debts but on the other hand i very much question whether at this present that merchant and his partners have such honest thoughts i am very apprehensive that he intends only to support himself in supporting henly and little thinks of his former engagements but these matters must be left to time and to providence  jan     as to what you writ concerning those two merchants goulston godolphin and armsworth marlborough they are so

commissions and instructions as being the shortest way and the most conformable to what the court of france designs which we are not apprized of i have marked the articles in your paper which i send you back lest you have kept no copy of it it is certain that the king can give no declaration but in his own name the other way can only be an instruction to be exacted by the advice of his friends on

further on the subject they think it proper to propose to you these doubts by way of explanations of which you will be the best judge and they refer themselves entirely to you  first if the person who receives instructions from you finds all the dispositions in the country which are favorable to your design would it not be better to set them in motion immediately in order to gain time to take advantage of their first fervor and to prevent the exportation of corn since without that a great part of the summer may pass in performing uncertain expeditions at sea and delays often cause discoveries  secondly if this is agreed to would it not be necessary to send some money not as much as will be necessary to support the war but to be distributed among the leaders of the parties in order to put them in a condition of acting which money might be brought back to you in case things were not circumstanced as one could wish  thirdly but in case that cannot be done would it not be better not to send any warlike stores till the treaty is finished because that might alarm the enemies and give umbrage to the well affected who would fear perhaps that they had nothing further to

the state of things in the different countries and promising to send an exact account by a man of confidence accordingly some months thereafter mr fleming came in their name and presented to you a memorial from them which is now referred to if you find any parts of it which are not sufficiently clear he is here and will wait of you when you order him to give a satisfactory answer to all the questions that shall be proposed to him but you may be assured before hand that you will find nothing in it but what regards men who have good intentions and something about corn meat drink and a certain quantity of swords and guns although it is not sufficient for so extraordinary and important an occasion the queen has likewise observed that the succors that the scots may expect from the king are not specified and therefore that they will agree to nothing upon such a general and ambiguous proposal  the earl of middleton to colonel hook of the same date translation although i hope to have the honor of seeing you on wednesday i did not choose to delay to send you back your instructions and at the same time you will receive a copy of my letter to monsieur de chamillart the queen

satisfaction concerning the affairs of scotland and they find themselves much obliged to you for the good offices you have rendered them on this as on all other occasions on which they will always depend  the french court resolving to send colonel hook to scotland m de chamillart gave him the following instructions which may serve at once for a specimen of the extreme ignorance of the french ministry and their insincerity in the cause of the pretender chamillart it seems had the weakness to suppose that the scottish nobility would rise in arms and maintain a regular war against england he speaks with familiarity of campaigns as if the populace of scotland had already been formed into regular armies and their leaders provided with finances to support a long series of hostilities  nairnes papers vol viii  to no    instructions from m de chamillart to colonel hook translation february   0  to be certain of making a diversion in scotland which will embarrass the english and oblige them to bring back a considerable body of troops to england the scottish nobility must be in a condition to assemble    or  0000 men and to clothe arm equip and maintain them during the campaign i e at least six months to commence at the beginning of may  the favorable dispositions of the nobility leave no room to doubt but they will make their utmost efforts to withdraw themselves from the yoke which the english nation intends to impose upon them before a revolution which should end in the restoration of the lawful sovereign is begun it is necessary to enter into a particular detail of the forces and means which the scotch can employ to accomplish it and of the succors which they may promise themselves from the protection of the king who is no less interested in the success of this enterprise than his britannic majesty it is for these considerations that his majesty has judged it proper before he makes any positive promise to the scots to send over mr hook in order to acquire upon the spot a perfect knowledge of the state of things to form a well digested plan with the nobility to reduce it to writing and to get it signed by the principal men of the country giving them assurances of his majestys sincere desire and his dispositions to send them the succors which may be necessary for them and his majesty recommends in a very particular manner to mr hook not to engage him in expenses which those he is obliged to lay out elsewhere will not allow him to support nor to give them any room to hope for more than he can furnish  the articles which are to be the principal objects of his attention are first to inform himself with certainty of the number of troops of which the army shall be composed and of the generals and other officers who are in the country to command them if they stand in need of some of those which are in france of what rank and how many the particular places where those men who voluntarily engage shall assemble and the place of general rendezvous afterward  to know who will clothe arm and equip them if they have cloth in the country and if they are able to pay for it who will furnish fusees bayonets swords belts bandeliers and powderflasks linen stockings shoes hats and other utensils such as hatchets pickaxes and spades  if they have any artillery of what size and what quantity  if they have stocks and carriages for cannon  if they have officers of artillery cannoniers bombardiers and miners  if they have mortars bullets bombs grenades and in what quantity  if they have powder and ball whether for cannon or for muskets  what they want of these things and what they demand as absolutely necessary for them acquainting them that it is not their interest to demand too much  it will not be sufficient to be informed with certainty that they are able to assemble a considerable army it likewise is necessary to know further the means by which the nobility intend to subsist them while they are in the field and by which they can form magazines and assemble wagons to follow the army wherever the generals think it may be proper to order it to march  the same inquiry must be made about the equipage for the artillery for the use of which it will be necessary to have a certain number of horses in proportion to the train which they think they should bring into the field  they must not persuade themselves that the mere good will of the nobility and the blind obedience of their vassals in doing whatever they choose are sufficient to oblige them to remain too long from home when they are furnished only with bread they must have meat and spirits or at least vegetables with some other drink than water the use of which is not common in that country  it is of importance to be assured of the manner in which the grain and drink shall be furnished of the assessment which shall be made of the contingent which each nobleman shall contribute in grain drink and other provisions of the number of men they will give and if they shall be clothed armed and equipped in short to enter into such an exact detail that nothing will remain to be done but to take a final resolution concerning the project which mr hook shall form in order to secure its success  it is supposed it may be demanded further that the person who shall command the army should explain himself as to the use he intends to make of it there will be several other things to be added which the experience and good sense of mr hook will suggest to him  m de chamillart discovers in these instructions that he was ignorant of the real state of scotland but mr hook adhered strictly to some parts of them it appears from his own account of his negociations that he had address enough to persuade the scots to bring themselves under several engagements while the king of france declined to oblige himself to do any thing  nairnes papers vol viii  t0 no    a declaration of war with instructions to colonel hook feb

you can to deliver to them our letters respectively by which they are to give credit to what you propose to them in our name    you are to expose to them the necessity of laying hold of this opportunity of vindicating our right and their privileges and independency which if neglected may never be retrieved    that as soon as they appear in arms and have declared for us we design to come in person to their assistance with the succors promised us by the most christian king which cannot be obtained till they have given that evidence of their dispositions    you are to explain to them that the declaration of war you carry with you is only a summons to rise in arms reserving to bring along with us an ample declaration for pacifying the minds of our people and the false and malicious suggestions of our enemies of which we desire they would send us a draught in the mean time you may assure them of our unalterable resolution of securing to them their religion laws liberties and independency    if you find that a party is disposed to rise in arms on what pretense whatsoever without directly owning our authority you are to acquaint our friends that we allow and approve of their joining with and assisting them against our common enemy    our commission of general is designed for the earl of arran but in case he declines it our friends are to name another whose name is

though they were inclined to it till the treaty was finished a consideration founded on good sense and good nature therefore the king our master thinks his courir sus would be at this time both useless and inconvenient because the errand is only to treat and his friends might think he has little regard for their safety and apprehend that he might be offended at their disobedience once more i

letters continued what you tell me of your acquaintance mr goulston godolphin that he appears out of humor notwithstanding his plentiful fortune does not much surprise me for i always thought him hypochondrical in his temper which increases with age i am only sorry that this sourness of humor will make him unfit to be applied to in your cousin wiselys the pretenders affair at least at present and as for mr armsworth marlborough i believe he has so much business of his own upon his hands that notwithstanding all former engagements he will hardly have the leisure perhaps not the will to mind old promises  i am very glad to hear what has lately been imparted to you by some of mr kensys the tories relations that they are not now averse from having the concurrence of mr manning the king of france in plessingtons the kings affair for though we cannot expect to bring that cause speedily to a trial yet kensy the tories and his partners ought to be managed and kept in good humor in the mean time i believe he is irreconcilable with our chief adversary wanly the whigs and that you may perhaps make him firm to us and it is upon a like account that we may reckon to have friends in mr norlys scotland family who can never pardon what our adversary brag parliament has done against them but these are seeds which must have time to grow  april   as to our affair about the cause depending between wheatly england and manning france i believe that what mr armsworth marlborough told captain gordon is very true viz that manning france has offered to bring the whole cause to arbitration without any salvo to your cousins the kings interest which being so i hope there will be no mention made of it on either side but that it will be left as now it is  i am glad to find that your friend the captain has so good an opinion of mr gurnys marlboroughs honest intentions to pay the old debt when able as to his ability there are few people that doubt of it but as to his sincerity i find there are many who doubt of it  i perceive there are great animosities between these two merchants kensy tories and wanly whigs which may possibly break out into suits at law nor is there much more peace and quiet in norlys scotland family about stating their accounts now i perceive that if they proceed to a trial at law discoveries may be made very advantageous to your cousins interest as having been formerly joined in commerce with them  i shall be glad to hear what a second conference between our captain and mr armsworth marlborough will produce which you seem to intimate  may   you tell me that the hasty departure of mr rysehoven marlborough out of town disappointed you of speaking to him of which the loss i think is not very great for i think he would have said no more to you than he lately said to captain gordon of paying of the old debt and than what he has formerly so often said upon that subject without any effect but you have no reason from thence to think yourself an unprofitable servant in the concerns of your friends and to take upon yourself the faults and failings of others however it will not be amiss to receive good words as often as we can from that merchant hoping that in time whatever it may be now things may so fall out that he may have a good meaning joined to good words the same thing is to be hoped from mr travers tunstal and his partners kensy tories though these two at present i think have more sincerity than the former in what they say whether it be out of spite on one side or out of friendship on the other what mr travers tunstal has promised you of keeping his hold in his trust for your cousin wisely is a mark of his good intentions and i hope mr goulston godolphin will do the same that justice at last may take place  nairnes

him of the success of his journey  i do not pretend to trouble you with tales of antiquity but to remark what we ourselves see what embarrassment have not the hungarians given to the emperor who would have believed that a few peasants in the cevannes without any succors could have occupied so many regular troops commanded by mareschals of france for three years the king of sweden always favored by fortune during five years in poland has been convinced that he could never finish the war without entering into saxony and his enemy after having obtained a victory has been obliged to renounce his dignity in order to save his own patrimony and the enemies in germany  mr hook has informed us of the good disposition of the scots whose fidelity and capacity are known to you they demand their king who wishes ardently to join them if the affairs of the king are urgent here that pleads strongly for the project in scotland if a small part of the money and of the troops which are employed here would finish the business there it would be wrong to hesitate and what would be formerly prudent and glorious becomes now absolutely necessary  the king of england beseeches you to examine and to weigh deliberately this important affair and to be pleased to represent it to the king it being undoubtedly the most important and most useful that can happen in his reign  lord carylls letters vol v fol scotch college august   extracts from lord carylls letters continued what you write concerning mr travers tunstal does not much surprise me considering his temper and the provocation given him but that to accomplish his revenge against his adversaries he should bring in adamson and consequently plessington the king and in a manner make a sacrifice of them who have done him no injury seems not consistent with that morality of which he has formerly made profession i am confident should travers tunstal gain his point in bringing hanmer hannover to join and cohabit with wheatly england he will not be the man to rule the roast but that wanlys family whigs will be the persons most relied upon who are for him not out of spite but affection however it is not impossible but providence may make use of these wrangles to make right take place  sept    i am glad to hear that mr traverss tunstals designs in concert with an agent of mr hanmers hannovers are prevented which will be ease to our

which may be of the smallest prejudice to the high allies give the queen and the ministers here all the satisfaction which her majesty can wish as she relies entirely upon the attentions and zeal of your electoral highness for the good of the common cause yet i see by my letters from vienna from holland and from other places that they have not the same confidence in that prince but that on the contrary he makes them very uneasy they even insinuate to me that they would be very happy that i should take a tour to saxony before the opening of the campaign in order to renew to the king the assurances of the queens sincere friendship and of the attention which her majesty will at all times pay to his interests from a belief that this may have a good effect but i took care to give no attention to this without being previously informed of your electoral highnesss sentiments concerning it which i humbly beseech you to be pleased to communicate to me as soon as possible if you approve of it i shall undertake the journey with so much the greater pleasure that it will furnish me with an opportunity of throwing myself at your feet  some days ago i begged of monsieur de bulau

against the czar and that if her majesty and the states general proceed to a recognition of king stanislaus and charge themselves with the guarantee of the peace of saxony without exacting any condition or declaration from the king of sweden and that on the other hand an end is put to the affair of the renunciation of prince charles and ministers are sent to hamburgh to regulate there what is still wanting to the entire execution of the treaty of travandahl there will be no apprehensions of any trouble  i doubt not but the journey to the king of sweden which is proposed to you will produce very good effects knowing the great regard which he has for the queen and his very particular esteem for you i shall rejoice at it for my part because this journey will procure me the pleasure of seeing you again you will judge better when you cross the sea if it will be necessary for you to undertake it and if you can do so without any prejudice to the operations of the campaign i believe it is extremely necessary that you should give all your attentions to secure piper and harmelin my opinion is that a pension of  000l sterling may be offered to the first and of  000l to the second of which the first year may be paid to them in advance and that if you do not go to saxony it will in my opinion be very proper to give this commission to mr robinson while he is at hand to execute it for it will be very difficult for him to do so if it is delayed until the king of sweden marches besides that there is a risk of being prevented by the new minister from france who is come to the

as soon as he shall make that report i may take my final resolution with regard to the command which is so unanimously offered to me i can assure you that one of the strongest reasons which can determine me to undertake it is the desire which her majesty the queen shows for it and the persuasion in which i am that you will always contribute by your great influence to the measures which it will be necessary to take in concert for the good of the common cause i have too many proofs of your zeal for the public and of your affection for me to be able to doubt of this it is therefore with an entire confidence that i write to you this letter to inform you that by the lists which the elector of metz and the elector palatine communicated to me of the state of the army and of the

which king augustus offers is not in a condition to serve this campaign and that there are no more cavalry remaining in germany which one can employ i shall be very particularly obliged to you for

comprehended the necessity of being in that case on the defensive in the low countries and as he was of opinion that this proposal may have a bad effect by discouraging the gentlemen here who will believe themselves too much exposed thereby he advised me not to make the proposal at present so that i have not spoke of it to any but to the count de wrattislow and to monsieur de bothmar who are instructed in the particulars of all that passed during my stay at the hague the first is to give an exact account of it to your electoral highness when he will have the honor of saluting you at hannover as mr de bothmar will do by writing  i am sorry however to be obliged to tell you that i do not find the minds of people so well disposed for the augmentation of their troops as in the last journey i made to this place but i continue to do every thing in my power to incline them to it and i flatter myself that when they will reflect maturely upon the great efforts of france and upon the new levies which they propose to make they will return to their former sentiments and take salutary measures according to the necessity of the conjuncture  i have put every thing on board and i wait only for the first fair wind to go over to england from whence i will do myself the honor of writing to your electoral highness beseeching you to accept of my very humble acknowledgments for the

still in a state of uncertainty with regard to an augmentation of the troops and the operations of the next campaign i choose to hope my lord that your presence in england will produce such effects that the parliament will give the example to the other allies by vigorous resolutions and that holland cannot refuse to follow it i wish that the empire may do the same on their side and i shall neglect nothing that depends upon me for disposing to this the minds of men i entreat you to be persuaded of this and of the sincerity with which i am my lord etc  stuart papers  the attempt made toward an invasion of scotland in the beginning of the present year seems to have been in a manner extorted from the french ministry by the repeated and earnest solicitations of the court of st germains ascribing the flattering accounts received from scotland to the zeal of the jacobites in france they were unwilling to hazard either their ships or their troops upon so slender a foundation the discontents in scotland though perhaps not magnified beyond their real bounds were represented as too great to be implicitly believed this caution on the part of france has been upon many occasions highly fortunate for great britain but at no period more fortunate than in the year   0  toward the beginning of february m de chamillart and his brethren in office began to issue orders for an expedition from dunkirk the pretender when he perceived that something serious was intended in his favor resolved to acquaint his friends in scotland of the intentions of the court of france and to give them directions to prepare themselves for an insurrection the person appointed for this service was charles fleming brother to the earl of wigton the following were the instructions given him upon this occasion  nairnes papers vol viii   to no    instructions to  going by our order to scotland given at our court at st germains the   th day of february   0  and in the seventh year of our reign in nairnes hand as soon as you have received these our instructions you are forthwith to repair with what convenient speed you can to our ancient kingdom of scotland and there to address yourself to such of our friends as we have named to you but cannot safely name them here for fear of accidents   st you are to assure them that we are coming with all possible diligence to assert our right and to protect our subjects in their religion liberties and trade conform to their laws and that we bring with us a sufficient force a good sum of money arms ammunition and other provisions as was required in their memoire   dly you are likewise to assure them that upon our being put in possession of the throne by their assistance our dearest brother the most christian king will restore the scots to their ancient privileges in france and will also use his endeavors to have them included in all treaties of peace   dly you are to give our positive orders to a select number of the nobility and gentry to seize suspected persons with their horses arms and other provisions for war and to tell them that we do hereby allow and authorize them to grant warrants to others for the same effect when they judge the proper time to do it without discovering the secret which we recommend to them above all things   thly you are to tell those who are trusted that upon the first appearance of the fleet that brings us or upon the first account they have of our landing we order them to cause to proclaim us king in all the countries where they have any interest and to raise all their fensible men with their best horses and arms and that they hinder all meetings that may be made by those who dare continue in their rebellion and seize as many of them as they can   thly that those of our friends who have had any correspondence in the north of england or in ireland may renew it by sending some trusty persons to persuade our friends in those parts to take arms at the same time which will be of great advantage for many reasons that are obvious   thly you are to give orders from us to our friends to have a gentleman ready on the east coast of the lothians and others on the coasts of fife angus and mearns that upon a signal which shall be agreed on and will be given from the first ship that appears they may be ready to come off with full accounts of the state of the country and may bring along with them some knowing pilots who understand the depth along the coast   thly you are also to tell our friends to give orders that all the public moneys be kept within the shires as also provisions of all kinds unsold and not sent away and that they inquire what provisions may be about edinburgh or leith or in any of the shires above mentioned but with great precaution in regard to the secret   thly those who are trusted may take their own private methods to renew any correspondence they have had within the forts and garrisons and to secure upon the landing any places of strength fit for magazines all which is to be considered with a special regard to the keeping of the secret it being much safer that several things be omitted which might be very useful than that any thing be recommended which may be a means of discovery   th lastly you are to tell our friends that we could not with safety trust to these written instructions the name of the geneal who is to command our forces under us nor the particular places where we intend to land but that as soon as it shall be proper and necessary we will fully satisfy them upon these two heads as well as upon all other matters    nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    instructions to charles farqwharson going by our order to scotland given at our court at st germains the twentyfifth day of april   0  and in the

boyne but the pen is drawn through ogilvies name by nairne and charles farquharson written above the instructions are signed by the pretender and his seal still remains james r  you are to show these instructions to such as we have ordered you and whose names for their security we will not here insert   st you are to assure them of the concern and trouble we are in on their account as well as on our own that this last enterprise has failed occasioned by our sickness the mistake of the pilates and other unforeseen accidents which gave the enemy the opportunity of preventing our landing in the firth while on the other side violent contrary winds the dispersing of the fleet the ignorance we were in of the coasts and want of provision hindered our landing in any other place   dly you are to assure them of the concern and pain we are in for them to know their present condition fearing they may have been brought into trouble after this enterprise has failed   dly you are to assure them that far from being discouraged with what has happened we are resolved to move heaven and earth and to leave no stone unturned to free ourselves and them and to that end we propose to come ourselves into the highlands with money arms and ammunition and to put ourselves at the head of our good subjects if they are in arms for us and if not we do exhort them to rise with all convenient speed upon the expectation of our arrival which we intend shall be as soon as possible after we have had an answer to this by this honest messenger who is entirely trusted by us and since we are so desirous of venturing of our person we hope they will follow our example this being a critical time which ought not to be neglected   thly the most christian king has likewise promised to support this undertaking with a sufficient number of troops as soon as they can be transported with security in the mean time we will stay in the highlands unless we be invited and encouraged by our friends in the lowlands to go to them   thly we desire they would consider this project and with all diligence send back this bearer well informed of their opinion concerning it as also with an account of the state of the nation of what troops are in it of what country and how inclined and what number of men they can bring into the field for us   thly and in case they approve this our project and promise to stand by us we desire that all means may be used to get possession of the fort of inverlochy and that they would inform us of the fittest place in the highlands for our landing and send along with the bearer two or more able pilots who know these places and can conduct us into them   thly and in case they prove instrumental to our restoration by doing what is here proposed to them we promise to give them particular and essential marks of our kindness and of the sense we have of all they have done and suffered on our accounts  j r  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    a memorial concerning the

instructions which was probably intended for the information of the french ministry the name of the person sent to scotland this year was ferguson translation april   0  it is evident that it is the interest of his majesty as well as of the king of england to do every thing that is possible for fomenting a civil war in scotland since the very rumors of the last enterprise had already such an effect in england that from the eagerness of every one to withdraw his money the princess of denmark would have had great difficulty to play the game if the affair had been prolonged for never so short a time at least it is certain that far from sending any succors to the allies she would have been obliged to recall the greatest part of her troops for her own defense  the signatures of the most considerable scotch noblemen are an evident proof of their loyalty and they have given no room to call it in question although the public may think otherwise being ignorant of the orders which his majesty had given them to undertake nothing before the arrival and landing of the king of england and especially to keep the secret preferable to every other consideration  the king of england far from being discouraged by the last enterprise finds himself more animated and determined by it never to spare his person but to leave no means untried for recovering his dominions it is with this design that he prepares immediately to send one to the highlanders of scotland with the following instructions  to assure them in case he finds them in arms that his britannic majesty will come immediately to put himself at their head and to bring them arms ammunition and money if they are not in arms to propose to them to rise with the like assurances that the king of england is ready to go in person to join them in expectation that his most christian majesty may send some troops to follow him which will be done the instant they can be transported with safety lastly to know from them what they can do and what they wish may be done here to assist them  the same person must likewise concert the different places of landing and bring pilots along with him  nairnes papers d n vol ii

attention to the representations of the pretender but a winter uncommonly severe which destroyed the fruits of the earth added the misfortune of famine to the numerous distresses brought on his people by the war he therefore plainly told the pretender that he was so far from being in a condition to invade the territories of his enemies that he was afraid he could not defend his own the discontented scots were strangers to the low state of france and they endeavored as in the following state of the highland clans to induce lewis the fourteenth to send aid by representing their own power nothing in the paper appears to have been exaggerated though its manifest design was to encourage a french invasion  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    an account of the highland clans in scotland with a short narrative of the services they have rendered the crown and the number of armed men they may bring to the field for the kings service the highlanders are used to arms from their infancy and may be reckoned as good as their equal number of the best regular troops in europe and they have on all occasions particularly under the command of the marquis of montrose for king charles the first and the viscount of dundee for king james the seventh in several battles defeated above double their number of old regular troops and it is hardly possible to sustain their charge if they be rightly led on they being superior both in their arms and manner of fighting to any other troops  the clans are here mentioned with five hundred men to a regiment it is true that some of them can bring more men to the field and others fewer but computing them one with another they may be reckoned so  the three great branches of the mcdonalds viz  clanranald  glengarie  sir donald mcdonald of sleat  the captains of clanranalds family have still been loyal and had a good regiment in the fields for king charles i and ii and this present captain at fourteen years of age was with  00 men at the battle of killicranky for king james vii this family has suffered much for their loyalty by the oppressions of the family of argyle who have been rebels for four generations bypast  clanranalds family and their followers are catholics  glengarie his predecessor the late lord mcdonald had still a regiment for the service of king charles i and ii and this present glengarie had the same for king james vii  this family has suffered much also by the family of argyle both he and his followers are catholics  sir donald mcdonald of sleat was with his regiment at the battle of killicranky for king james vii and continues still very loyal  these three branches of the mcdonalds including other lesser branches of that name may bring to the field of very good men   00  the three great branches of mcduss or clanchattan viz  farquharsons  mcintoshes  mcphersons  the farquharsons have still been loyal for findlay farquharson of braemar and inverey was killed carrying the royal banner at the battle of pinkie in the year      against the english his grandchild james farquharson of inverey was at  0 years of age kept two years prisoner at edinburgh for his loyalty and was forced to pay a considerable fine before he was released his son colonel william farquharson of inverey had still a good regiment for the service of king charles i and ii under the command of the marquises of huntley and montrose and the earls of glencairn and middleton and being still without pay and at his own charges mortgaged all his estate for the said service worth about  00 l sterling a year yet his son colonel john farquharson of inverey was among the first who took arms for king james vii and after all the other highlanders had given over coming to the field he raised betwixt eight and nine hundred men and sustained the small party of the kings officers a whole campaign acting offensively as well as defensive for which he had six parishes belonging to him and his relations entirely burnt and destroyed which was procured by the lord forbes and his family one of the most rebellious in scotland and their next neighbors witnesses of their last services and sufferings are colonel rattrey major holmes lieutenant colonel fitzsimons and several others present in france many of the name of farquharson and their followers are catholics  the mcintoshes and mcphersons although they did not rise to arms all of them yet they still sent men to the field both for the services of kings charles i and ii and for king james vii and are all of them at present loyal these three forementioned branches including others lesser about them can bring to the field of very good men   00  the mcleans have still been loyal their chief and  00 of his name being killed at inverkething for king charles ii by cromwell they have been also in the field for king charles i and they had at the battle of killicranky for king james vii five hundred men and will be found very ready when the king shall have use for them they are mightily oppressed by the family of argyle they can bring to the field of very good men  00  the camerons have still been loyal and have still had a good regiment in the fields for kings charles i and ii and for king james vii and continue very loyal and may bring to the field of very good men  00  the stuarts and robertsons of athol have still been loyal and have still taken the field for the kings charles i and ii and for king james vii notwithstanding the present marquis of athol who was superior to the most part of them was then for the prince of orange but it is now the better that he himself is loyal at present they may bring to the field of good men  000  the mcnaughtons and stuarts of appin have still been loyal to the kings charles i and ii and to king james vii and were in the fields for them as was also mcneil of barra who with his men are all catholics they may raise of very good men  00  the drummonds loyalty is not to be doubted since they will certainly follow their chief the duke of perth or his son the earl of drummond they may bring to the field of very good men  00  the mckenzies are neither to be doubted since they will follow their chief the marquis of seaforth they with other little names about them may bring to the field of indifferent good men  000  the frasers are loyally inclined and may bring to the field of very good men  00  the mcleods are loyally inclined and may bring to the field of very good men  00  the sinclairs are esteemed loyal and may bring to the field of indifferent good men  00  the mckays and the highlanders of strathnaver their superiors are not loyal yet their commons can be brought to the field and may do good service being joined with others they may make of very good men  00  the rosses of balnagowan their chief is not loyal yet his clan might be brought to the field and they may make of none of the best men  00  the grants their chief has been very violent against the late king and raised a regiment against him and entertained it three years at his own charges yet his clan must be called to the field and joined to others of unquestioned loyalty they may raise of none of the best of men  00  the campbells of breadalbin their superior the earl of breadalbin is a very cunning man yet still pretends to be very loyal they may bring to the field of indifferent good men  00  the grahams of menteeth and stuarts of down are loyal and may bring to the field of very good men  00  the mcneils of galchyle mclauchlans mckinnons mcaulays mcnabs mcgregors mcgibbons mcechins of dumbarton argyle and stirling shires are loyal and may bring to the field amongst them all of very good men  000  the number of all the men is   000  that which is commonly objected against the highlanders is that they do not keep discipline and that they plunder  to which it may be easily answered that at all the times the highlanders were in the fields they neither had pay nor provisions but what providence sent them from day to day and each soldier being obliged to go and search for himself it was impossible to send an officer with each of them so abuses could not be prevented and were the most regular troops in europe in the same circumstances they might be found as ill if not worse than the highlanders  most part of all lowlanders are their inveterate enemies and seldom or never speak or write favorably of them and that from mere envy because a highland clan is capable to render the king better service than some of their first nobility and as to their lesser a dozen and more of them cannot bring so many men to the field as one clan  the king might likewise expect from the low countries of scotland at least  0000 men for the king has generally all the nation over three for him for one against him but supposing he has but half as certainly he has more the militia of scotland being   000 men that half has but to double their militia which they may easily do will make above  0000 men but the king must carry arms for them  whereas the highlanders are generally well armed of themselves and at most will not want above a fourth part of their arms  the lowlanders will likewise want officers  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no     translation the king of great britain has been very sensibly chagrined that his friends in scotland have been kept so long in suspense concerning a second expedition into that country but it was impossible to come to any certain determination about it sooner although the affair was pressed with all possible earnestness at last his majesty has received within a few days a decisive answer and he commands me to communicate it to you from him  i shall tell you then that the project of a second expedition into scotland has been proposed to his most christian majesty in a very ample memorial in which nothing was omitted to engage him to enter into the scheme and to convince him that the enterprise was as much for his interest as for the interest of his britannic majesty that his most christian majesty has been pleased to enter very cordially into the affair when it was proposed to him and that he has taken time to consider the project and has testified a sincere desire to make every effort for putting it in execution but after having duly weighed all things and considered the present situation of his affairs his last answer has been that in the present conjuncture the thing was not practicable considering that it was absolutely impossible for him at this time to furnish all that was necessary for such an expedition  it is his britannic majestys desire that you communicate this to all the wellaffected in scotland in order that they may take their measures to preserve themselves to a more favorable time the king did not demand of his most christian majesty but  000 men with money arms and ammunition in proportion but that could neither be granted nor transported with safety in the present state of the affairs of france when they are in a better situation i hope the king of great britain will feel the effects of it but whatever may happen he is determined never to discontinue his efforts for the recovery of his dominions and i doubt not but soon or late he will succeed although it is not easy to foresee either the time or the manner in the mean time he recommends to all his loyal subjects to take as much care as they can of their own preservation every one knows the state of his own affairs and what is most suitable for him to do for his own safety in this conjuncture therefore in that respect there are no rules to be prescribed to them but his majesty always depends upon the continuance of their loyalty and he is thoroughly persuaded that he will always find them well disposed to give him proofs of their zeal and affection every time he shall have occasion for their assistance  the states general having informed the courts of vienna and great britain that the president rouille was come to them from france with general offers of peace prince eugene and the duke of marlborough were sent by their respective courts to the hague in the beginning of april   0  to these generals who were buoyed up with the hopes of penetrating into france the next campaign the overtures made on the part of lewis xiv seemed not to be satisfactory and the duke of marlborough came back to london on the   th of april his prosessed design was to acquaint the queen that the french overtures were rejected and that the allies were determined to prosecute the war with the utmost vigor in the meantime rouille dispatched a courier to paris for further instructions and lewis immediately sent the marquis de torcy his secretary for foreign affairs with fresh offers to the hague in all the conferences held to settle the preliminaries of peace it was demanded by the allies and granted by lewis that he should abandon the pretender and dismiss him from his dominions this produced the following letter and memorial to the marquis de torcy about a place of security for the pretender a dowry for his mother and an indemnity for their adherents  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    the earl of middleton to the marquis de torcy a copy in middletons own hand translation st germains april  0   0  i have the honor to send you a memorial concerning the interests of the king my master and i hope you will approve of the method which i have taken of inserting nothing in it but what might serve for an instruction to your negociator in case the king approves it reserving to myself to explain to you here the sentiments of the king of england because that mixture might occasion some confusion  although france is the only country in which his britannic majesty can find any consolation out of his own country yet since the enemy insist upon his leaving it he asks the kings permission to do so as the only means of giving him a testimony of his gratitude the ecclesiastical state is excluded for reasons too evident to be specified and likewise the swiss cantons because there he would be deprived of the society of men and at too great a distance from what he ought never to lose sight of and he would have no neighbors there but goats who could walk out and resist the rigor of the winter the spanish low countries are named only in preference  i acknowledge that sentiments are divided here about the article of the indemnity some say that those who are at home will complain with justice that they are abandoned to the fury of their enemies and that those who are here will exclaim that they are neglected that they might subsist at home if they could return in safety and that this court will be delivered from a number of troublesome people who will die of hunger after our departure others think that a security for the past will render them useless for the future that selflove is a powerful motive for exciting the generality of men to perform their duty that severals may return from thence full of illhumour and in order to be well received will become informers which would produce very bad effects and also that this would weaken the irish regiments in the service many of whom will be seized with the sickness of the swiss it is hoped the king will be pleased to decide upon this diversity of opinions  with regard to the queens dowry her majesty orders me to tell you that after her death and the restoration of the king her son she gives the million in the townhouse to his majesty to refund in part some small share of his bounty but above all his britannic majesty insists most earnestly not to be named in the article which concerns the queen for although there should be no express condition all the world will suppose that his honor will be deeply wounded by it he will be abandoned by all his good subjects and will find himself exposed to the contempt of every one which such a suspicion will insallibly draw upon him  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    a memorial sent with the preceding letter to the marquis de torcy translation all that regards the king of englands interest in the present conjuncture may be reduced to three articles  in case the enemy insist that the king of england leaves france nothing will be more natural and reasonable than to ask them a security for him it is to be wished it may be general if however this meets with difficulties let them grant it at least in a country that suits them for there are countries where he will never put his foot such as the popes territories and the swiss cantons the spanish low countries appear to be the most commodious from their situation and becaufe there will be no occasion for a security but from the dutch and from the sovereign of the country who must oblige himself to allow the king to live at full liberty with a permission of traveling through all his dominions of choosing the place of his residence and of changing it and of leaving his territories and coming back again without being obliged to take passports or to give any explanations of the motives of his journies a prince cannot be too delicate in such a case and they cannot if they act sincerely refuse him the privileges which the law of nations gives to private persons in time of peace  it is proposed likewise that his majesty may be pleased to solicit earnestly for an indemnity to all those who have followed the late king of england and the kings son as well as for those who find themselves exposed to troublesome enquiries at home for having done their duty since the revolution in england if they make the same demand for the hugonots it will be a mere evasion for they are desirous of keeping them designing by a general act of naturalization to draw to them every one who is not a roman catholic  it is not believed that they will make great difficulty about the queens dowry for the future but about her arrears although they cannot deny but they are due for upwards of twenty years if that cannot be obtained we must propose the time of the peace of ryswick when the dowry was granted and when the prince of orange broke his word although he received from his parliament a fund for keeping it he always found pretenses for doing so there is another term which is common to all widows and that is the death of their husbands and the right ceases at the death of the queen but when the worst comes to the worst we must accept it as they will choose to give it it may be likewise proposed that in case they pay the queen all the arrears which amount to a million sterling her majesty will renounce absolutely her dowry the revenue of that sum being precisely  0000 l sterling at five per cent by this means several embarrassments will be avoided her majesty will be assured of her revenue without authorizing any one in england to receive it and without disputing about the form of discharges for they may exact such as she never will grant much less will she seek redress in their courts of justice and to answer the chicane which was used after the peace of ryswick that this money might be employed against them his majesty may oblige himself to place the sum immediately in the townhouse of paris  lord carylls letters vol v fol scotch college extracts from lord carylls letters march    here we talk much of a peace likely to be soon concluded i should be glad to know whether you in england be of the same opinion upon this occasion i must not omit to let you know that i find your friend mr plessington the king in some doubt whether or not in case of a peace it would be best for him to continue his trade in amsterdam paris where there are so many dealers in his way of trading or to remove to some other town where he may find more business i am of opinion that none could advise him better in this matter than his old partners mr armsworth marlborough and mr goulston godolphin so that if you could conveniently meet with these two merchants or with either of them and learn their opinion in this matter you will certainly very much oblige your friend plessington the king  the part of de torcys negotiation which concerned the court of st germains is contained in

of seeing you after the council yesterday but not being able to join you i delayed to write to you until the arrival of a courier which we expected in the course of the day his departure from the hague being delayed as he is not yet arrived here i must inform you sir of the contents of mr de torcys dispatches to the king which were delivered to me the day before yesterday in order that you may give an account of them to the king your master and to the queen he had a long conference with lord churchill and mr townsend about the interests of the king of england after great difficulties which they imagined to find in obtaining payment of the queens dowry which they allege is contrary to the laws of england they confined themselves at last to say that they would desist from their demand of the kings changing his place of abode or if they were obliged to insist upon his leaving france that it would be just in that case his expense should fall upon them and that his majesty might choose his place of abode remain there in all security and change from place to place as would suit his convenience de torcy himself memoirs of the marquis de torcy vol i in a letter to lewis xiv dated from the hague the   th of may gave the following account of his conference with the duke of marlborough on this subject  he the duke of marlborough added that this same lord meaning lord townsend had orders concerning the king of england whom he styled prince of wales he expressed a strong desire of being in a capacity to serve him as the son of a king for whom he told me afterward he would have spilt the last drop of his blood that he believed it was his interest to remove out of france and when i asked him to what country he should retire and in what manner he was to subsist he agreed in respect to the first article that this prince should be at liberty to fix his residence wherever he chose should enjoy perfect security and be his own master to go wherever he judged proper  the article of his subsistence met with greater obstacles i proposed to him the expedient of the queens dowry he said that the laws of england rendered the payment of that sum extremely difficult however he begged of me to insist strenuously on this article when my lord townsend and he came to speak to me about it in the conferences this lord he said is a kind of an inspector over me though he is a very honest man who has been chosen through my means and of the whig party before him i must speak like an obstinate englishman but i wish with all my heart i was able to serve the prince of wales and that your solicitations afforded me an opportunity of doing it    having now complied with my duty in giving you this account i shall finish with assuring you of the profound respect with which i am etc  nairnes papers d n vol iii  to copy of lord middletons answer to the duke de beauvilliers may      0  in nairnes hand translation i have shown to the king my master and to the queen the letter which you did me the honor to write to me today upon which their majestys have commanded me to beg of you to remark three things   st with regard to their saying that they cannot pay the queens dowry as being contrary to the laws of england in that they are not sincere for although they have converted the fund to other purposes there never was any legal decision against her majesty or her pretensions and the parliament after the peace of ryswick acknowledged them so fully that they granted without any difficulty the whole sum which the prince of orange received and detained upon an ill founded chicane   dly their offer to charge themselves with the maintenance of the king my master in case he leaves france is to be suspected and indeed one may easily perceive that the malicious design of it is to make the world believe that he renounced his pretensions on account of this pension and at the same time to have it in their power to reduce him to the last extremity which his majesty will rather endure than expose himself to be suspected of such meanness i had set forth in a memorial all i now say and explained it more fully in a letter i sent to m de torcy the evening before he set out   dly the king of england is highly pleased that a general security is agreed to in case they insist on his changing his place of abode but it ought to be considered whether the word of these two english gentlemen may be depended on for it would be better to have a written deed signed by all the confederates to be inserted by the mediator among the acts of the treaty  i am very unhappy sir to have missed the honor of seeing you every time i have been at versailles and i entreat you to believe me to be sir etc    nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no  0 a minute of what was proposed at st germains in case the congress at the hague was continued june   0  the first step to be made is to endeavor to persuade the king of france to use his interest by his ministers at the treaty to have leave and security for a person to appear there from the king only to give in a memorial in the kings name to the mediator representing his just pretension and protesting against any thing that may be agreed upon in the general peace contrary to the right and title he has to his crown which as it will not hinder the plenipotentiaries to conclude the peace as they shall agree upon it together so it is hoped they have no interest to refuse to an injured prince the satisfaction at least of giving this public testimony to the world of his not renouncing his right or acquiescing to any thing that may be done in this treaty to his prejudice which is all the benefit required to facilitate his demand it may be represented that the king does not require the person he sends should be owned as a plenipotentiary in form from the king of england but only that he should have security to go and return and not be refused access to the mediator to deliver his message and protestation from the king and in the kings name leaving to the mediator the liberty in his answer to give or refuse the title to the king as he shall think sit only that he be obliged to enter the fact in his protocoe that such a message memorial or protestation was delivered to him such a day by such a one in the name of the pretender to the crown of england if he will not directly give the king his title  if this cannot be obtained at least it may be proposed that the protestations be given by one of the french plenipotentiaries and entered as given by him in the name of the king because he could not have leave and security for a minister of his own to go and deliver it  if even that be refused there is no other method left but to send the protestation in blank covers by the post to all the plenipotentiaries and publishing it in gazettes and otherwise and mentioning at the same time that the king asked a passport for a person to go in his name to protest in the formal manner and was refused  as for any thing that may be treated about the queens jointure or other things relating to the security of the kings person in case of his memorial from france if monsieur de torcy pleases he can always obtain a pass for a private agent of the kings to attend mr rouille and be at hand to represent the kings interest to him and answer the objections the english may make to him and furnish him with memorials and arguments according as shall be concerted with the court of france and this person being an englishman and a person of known trust prudence and integrity may be of use as an interpreter with the french minister and may also being under the security of public faith be able to insinuate and disperse fit memorials to move and persuade the english or others that it is neither theirs nor the public interest of europe to exclude the king from his right and prefer hannover  lord carylls letters vol v fol scotch college june    extracts from lord carylls letters continued the account which captain gourdons relation has brought of what passed in a conference between him and mr armsworth marlborough about paying the debt so long due from that merchant shows at least the captains zeal and concern that justice may be done to our friend mr matthew the king and though nothing was concluded upon at that meeting as to the speedy payment of that debt yet there is at least an entrance made toward it and i know the captain will let slip no opportunity of bringing that matter to a fair conclusion  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no  0 a memorial showing the advantage of sending a person in whom confidence may be placed to the hague to take care of the interests of his britannic majesty in nairnes hand translation june     0  the king of england believes that it would be necessary for his service and useful to his most christian majesty to send to the hague in the present conjuncture one of his subjects who is a man of abilities and fidelity who is well instructed in his affairs and capable of carrying on a negotiation who would have a communication with the french plenipotentiaries and act in concert with them in all things for the common interest and in conformity to the instructions with which he shall be entrusted without giving him any character  this man having no public character would not be subjected to ceremonies and might insinuate himself and have access every where as a private man without being suspected to be of any party and understanding the language laws customs and manners of the english he might by frequenting them discover their secret sentiments and inform the french plenipotentiaries of many things very useful in the course of the negotiation it being very much the humor of the greatest part of the english who may be very reserved with the french to open themselves to and place their confidence willingly in a countryman who will appear to enter into their sentiments and have the address by discovering their different tempers to insinuate himself into their favor prudently and reasonably  this secret agent by going early to the hague before the opening of the congress will have time to renew the old acquaintances he formerly had in that country and to form new ones to contract intimacies and manage intrigues and secret cabals with the public ministers and other men of credit of all the different nations who may meet there in the present conjuncture and of whom he may contribute to gain over some to the interest of france and to abate the violent opposition of others by undeceiving them in many wrong impressions with which they are prepossessed he will be able to inform himself thoroughly and at leisure of the different interests of the plenipotentiaries and of their cabals and divisions among themselves that he may take the advantage of them and being of the same nation he will have a more particular facility in discovering the inclinations designs and schemes of the english plenipotentiaries of whatever sect of religion they are whose creatures they are and to what party in england they are attached and thus knowing their strength and their weakness he will be able to give from time to time excellent memorials concerning these things to the french plenipotentiaries  and when the concerns of the king of england are in agitation he will be at hand to give informations to the said plenipotentiaries concerning the intentions and real interests of his britannic majesty and when the english object the difficulties and chicanery of their laws as they have done already without any foundation in the affair of the queens dowry he will be able to tell the french plenipotentiaries with certainty what is true or false in the allegations of the english concerning their laws or the facts which shall be contested and to give them ample explanations on the spot by memorials which will refute the chicanery of the english and hinder them from imposing ambiguous expressions and advancing as truths facts which are notoriously false  the advantage of sending this man early to the hague is evident for in order to negociate with success he must be on the spot before they begin to treat in form in order to acquaint himself thoroughly with the different characters of those with whom he may have to do to study their humors their public and private interests and to tamper with those who have credit with the principal ministers endeavoring in that manner to discover their sentiments and to find means of gaining them or at least of appeasing them on several articles from motives of personal interest joined to all the other reasons of justice and equity which can be suggested to them now all this cannot be done but slowly and by degrees their minds must be previously disposed and their prejudices removed and a number of emissaries must be employed in order to be well instructed in every thing that happens and to be always ready to seize every favorable opportunity he must begin in time and spare nothing to gain over favorites in order that he may have free access to their superiors and find means of insinuating himself into their confidence and of disposing them insensibly for a favorable treaty and if all these intrigues and attentions are not begun and even carried some length before the congress opens it will be very difficult to begin them with any hopes of success during its continuance for then all the plenipotentiaries will be so occupied with receiving and sending of dispatches with attendance on all the public and private conferences with receiving and returning visits and discharging the ceremonial and essential duties of their commission that they will have so little spare time as will render access to them very difficult and as the part they are to act will be determined by that time and all or most of the essential articles agreed upon it will be too late then to hope to carry on a negotiation of any importance for the service of france or for that of his britannic majesty  when the congress broke off at the hague the court of st germains began to think again of an invasion and

the minister the earl of godolphin and the duke of marlborough who divided with his lordship the power of government were not averse from this motion they seem to have secretly wished his removal as

gives it over his former partner mr armsworth marlborough will do so too and yet in one of your letters if i mistake you not you seem to say that there is at present no good understanding between these two merchants the certainty whereof i shall be glad to know in your next i hear it from many hands that there has been of late some wrangle between mr young princess anne and armsworth

can more frankly give my opinion concerning that young merchant mr friar mentioned by you that he wants parts to carry on such a trade as was designed for him for if your information be true in the first place he never had any credit with manly the king who though he was kind to him always looked upon him to be too shallow to be trusted in any business of weight  without a date as to our partners if we believe mr brag the parliament the credit of mr armsworth marlborough upon change is greater than ever it was and much greater i fear than his honesty for if he can shift off his old debts nothing but the force of law and absolute necessity will make him satisfy them the proceedings of his copartner are more close and mysterious and i can hardly bring myself to believe that there has been any real breach between them godolphin and marlborough it being so contrary to each of their interests which those merchants are thought to understand better than any upon change  nairnes

should dictate to him but enjoins him secrecy as he had sent it without the knowledge of the court of france he thinks that the excluding the king of england and so many of his nearest heirs from succeeding to the crown will for a long time continue dissensions and wars in europe which his restoration alone can prevent and to which he thinks the neighboring states and particularly the dutch are in common prudence bound to contribute he asks a passport for a trusty person whom his master might send privately to them to assure them of his attachment and to cultivate a good understanding with them  in the memorial the pretender sets forth that as he will continue his efforts for his own restoration and the deliverance of his people a solid peace can never be established while so many millions of his subjects were well affected to him a strict union with england was necessary for the united provinces his majesty was sincerely disposed to cultivate a good understanding with the states and from their great wisdom and penetration he hoped to meet with corresponding sentiments in them and that they would find acts of friendship toward a prince who suffers unjustly and never was their enemy consistent with their own interest and with the principles of honor and justice england is the only rival of holland in commerce which will often occasion animosities that will often terminate in open wars it is the interest of the states to secure the friendship of the sovereign of that country a catholic king will be less in a condition to carry on a war against them than a protestant and if he is but king of england he can only carry on a war by sea whereas a protestant prince who has considerable territories on the continent and in their neighborhood can attack them by land as well as by sea  he then recommends two points to their consideration he asks their good offices at the ensuing treaty of peace in obtaining a security for the payment of the dowry of the queen his mother and also a security for his own person and for those who will follow him when he leaves france he gives the same reasons for these demands which are contained in the memorials presented to

following letter was one of those interested persons who wished to derive some advantage to themselves from betraying the secrets of the court of st germains to the british government ogilvie however

the  th of may from the north and of the   th from edinburgh wherein all your friends mark their impatience to have some comfortable accounts from this side considering the present situation of affairs both in england and scotland that were never so favorable they assure me that all our friends continue firm and more zealous than ever and wants nothing but an opportunity to show their good inclinations and that there are severals of note that have never yet declared their intentions that would join them if they could hope for the least encouragement or knew any thing from this side of his majestys designs or resolutions  i am informed the earl of errol is very much recovered of his distemper and that the earl marischal who has been in a most dangerous condition is much better so that they begin to have hopes of him  all your lordships friends in angus and perthshire are very well and wish nothing more than to hear from this side being a little surprised that they are advertised of nothing of what may be resolved in the present favorable conjuncture from those they trust in  i thought it my duty to give your lordship this account which if your lordship thinks fit may be made known to the queen and if her majesty has any commands for me either as to what i am to answer to these letters or any thing else i hope your lordship will do me the honor to acquaint me

yesterday he had more to say to me than was in his paper which you have this more was no great matter though much more than i believe he pretends to have seen lord athol braidalbin etc and that they say that if the king of france cannot be brought to help them they will do my business themselves provided i come to them but then he brings no other security of what he says but his own word and an ample credential from lord drummond whom he affirms to be sent by the rest how improbable all this is you may easily see however not to seem to suspect the man i was very civil to him and took all he said as argent comptant for fear he should think to be discovered and disappear before the queens answer comes which i shall expect before i do any more in the matter in the mean time he says lord drummond will not stir from gand where he now is till he receives my farther orders this man is certainly employed by the government to betray my friends so that when he comes to you for i suppose the queen will think that necessary one cannot have too great an eye over him till one can at least hear from scotland what ground there is for what he affirms but i refer to the queen to do in this matter what she thinks fit she has yourself and a few others to consult and i am here alone which is far from easy to me upon many accounts but necessity has no law and that alone could have made me not carry you along with me though at present i really begin to believe i shall not be long from you for the enemies immobility looks very like a truce i am sure we want it for we have no money bread but hardly though hitherto exactly enough and our list not above half complete i shall say nothing of my health for you know from the queen how that goes with me but am now at ease that i am well enough to go to the army if there be appearance of action my sister is charmed with your complaisance in being her conductor in all her sorties and by what i can find she is as well pleased to be at

named several persons of known probity but without proofs except my lord drummond the eldest son of the duke of perth a man of strict honor but he is not the first who has allowed himself to be

sacheverell having destroyed the influence of the whigministry with the people the earl of sunderland the soninlaw of marlborough was dismissed from the office of secretary of state in june a total change in the servants of the crown was no longer a matter of doubt with the nation though the persons who composed the administration used all their art to intimidate the queen that they themselves might retain their power the monied interest in the city in particular the governor and directors of the bank represented the danger of turning out the lordtreasurer and such persons as he could trust the duke of marlborough had influence sufficient with the allies to induce them to interfere in the cause of his party the comte de galas ambassador for the emperor and king charles the third together with vrybergen the dutch ambassador represented to the queen the danger of making any change among her servants she however though she answered them politely seemed determined not to comply with their demands except in the article of the duke of marlboroughs continuing in the command of the army the duke himself with his usual address and coolness affected to acquiesce in the queens pleasure but he seems to have entered privately into a scheme of revenge by his renewing with more warmth his correspondence with the court of st germains the following letter from the earl of middleton will throw a complete light upon this subject  nairnes papers vol viii  to no    the earl of middleton to the marquis de torcy enclosing a letter from the queen to the duke of marlborough translation sir  th july    0 my lord churchill having begun to make some advances to serve the king of england in his letter to the marshall de berwick to which no answer has been made and although he is not a man to be depended upon yet it was always your opinion that it was necessary to treat him with attention and his present situation induces us to do so now more than ever because being obliged to form new engagements for his own safety there is reason to fear that if we neglect him he will attach himself to the family of hannover which would be such a fatal blow that we must employ all possible means to parry it these several considerations have induced the queen to write him a letter of which i enclose to you a translation and her majesty begs of you sir to write to the marshall de villars to put under his cover the letter which the chevalier de st george will give him and to send it to his adversary by the first trumpet in order to avoid the difficulty of sending it contrary to orders a m sir etc  the copy of this letter among mr nairnes papers is indorsed to mr de torcy with the translation of a letter to gurney marlborough immediately after it there is a paper entitled heads of a letter to gurney  it appears to be the first draught of the english original of which middleton sent the following translation to de torcy  nairnes papers vol viii  to no   a letter from the queen to gurney marlborough july    0 translation what you wrote to your nephew on the   th of the last month is of so great importance to mr matthews the king and yourself that i think myself obliged for your interest and his to write to you my opinion of it with my own hand your nephew who set out from this place suddenly being now at too great a distance  i shall tell you in the first place that as i was glad to find you still continue in your good resolutions toward mr matthews the king i was surprised on the other hand to see that you had a design of quitting every thing as soon as the peace was concluded for i find that to be the only means of rendering you useless to your friends and your retreat may prove dangerous likewise to yourself you are too large a mark and too much exposed for malice to miss and your enemies will never believe themselves in safety until they have ruined you they will reduce the army and the troops that are allowed to stand will be all composed of their own creatures all the civil offices and military employments will be filled by men who are of their party they will change the officers of the revenue and the credit of these new officers with the influence which the preachers of their party have over the people will not fail to produce a new parliament of a very different temper from the present thus your enemies will have all the power to hurt you and you know well they will not want the inclination  i beseech you therefore to reflect well before you deprive yourself of the means you have in your hands to support yourself and to assist your friends  but as you are lost if you quit your employments i see likewise on the other hand that it will be very difficult for you to keep yourself in office as things are now situated fo that your interest itself declares now for your honor you cannot be in safety without doing justice nor preserve your greatness without discharging your duty and the time is precious to you as well as for us  the advice you give us in sending us to the new favorite lady is very obliging but what can we hope from a stranger who has no obligation to us whereas we have all the reasons in the world to depend upon you since we have now but the same interest to manage and you have the power to put mr matthews the king in a condition to protect you lay aside then i beseech you your resolutions of retiring take courage and without losing more time send us a person in whom you have an entire confidence or if you have not such a man with you allow us to send you one whom we may trust in order to concert measures for our common interest which can never be properly done by letters we shall know by your speedy and positive answer to this letter what judgment we can form of our affairs  i must not finish my letter without thanking you for promising to assist me in my suit at the treaty of peace my cause is so just that i have all reason to hope i shall gain it at least i flatter myself that mr matthewss sister princess of denmark is of too good a disposition to oppose it  marlboroughs letter to which the preceding is an answer is referred to in the following to the earl of middleton it

peronne waiting for a convoy to come hither by opportunity the more i hear of captain gray the worse i like him i am sure i dont believe one word he says but since there is nothing to be done out of hand there is yet no harm done though i confess i am still of opinion that if it were possible he should be kept in france for fear of the worst in the meantime what you propose of writing to mordecai is absolutely necessary and the sooner the better when i receive the queens packet i shall i suppose know the end of the business and till then can say no more of it  i shall not write to the queen today having nothing to say to her more than what is above present my duty to her i am sorry my sisters bleeding succeeded so ill but i hope now she is well she will not want it i have at last quite done with physic and i hope with my ague and that with only ten doses of quinquina but shall still keep possession of my gate house till the army removes which must be soon our hector villars does talk of fighting in his chariot but i dont believe him especially now that the conferences of peace are certainly renewed m de vauban who came from bethune on wednesday was told so by some of the enemys generals letters from tournay speak of it and now even the gazettes themselves i cannot but hope now they will break off no more i am sure mrs betty himself heartily wishes it that she may quit mr williamss country france of which she is quite weary on all accounts you will have seen before this gurneys marlboroughs letter to daniel there is very little about marlboroughs correspondence with the duke of berwick in mr nairnes papers but it appears by a letter from the marquis de torcy to lewis xiv dated from the hague the   th of may   0  that letters on some interesting subjects passed between them  memoirs of the marquis de torcy vol i p  0  english translation after he the duke of marlborough had consulted the pensionary and made a number of excuses and compliments for the liberty he took in appointing me an hour and not paying the first visit i went to him after dinner were i to relate all the protestations he made of his profound respect and attachment to your majesty and of the desire he has one day of meriting your protection i should fill my letter with things less essential than those i am going to mention his speeches are florid i observed in what he said to me a great deal of art in naming the duke of berwick and the marquis of allegre i availed myself sir of this circumstance to make him sensible in the course of our conversation that i was not ignorant of the particulars of their correspondence with him and that your sentiments were not changed he blushed and proceeded to the proposals of peace duke of berwick and another to hector villars in which folletts the queens children are spoke of i find hector very willing to do any thing in his power for them if you have any thing to propose i will speak to him that he may do it by the next opportunity i shall go to the kings quarters he means the quarters of the maison du roi today where by contrarys i shall know more concerning peace i was last night at m de rohans who gave a great feste there was play music a very great and good supper and then dancing and masks i left them at    oclock with the resolution of sitting up till day light there were there about a dozen generals who if it were not for a feste now and then would be very much ennuie in this place where they have but one day in three weeks to be employed in the army you need not send me the duke of berwicks fuillet for he sends it me en droiture in eight days if he is not here in ten days i shall reckon the peace sure adieu my compliments to lady middleton  i am in amaze that prattler does employ such people as

marshall de villars forwarded the queens letter to the duke of marlborough  camp of fornu august      0 you know very well it was far from my inclination not to carry you along with me to the camp but at the same time the reasons which hindered me from doing it have not hindered me often from regretting the want of your company since i am here i said something of it in my letters to the queen and i find by what she said you understood i ordered you to come down which was a mistake as she will have told you before this for as much as i desire your company and to have at least one wise man with me yet i think you will be more necessary where you are than here and therefore i must prefer my interest to my private satisfaction especially now that i am half seas over i thought to have gone out this evening but the weather is so hot that i shall take this days rest after the two last days work booth tells you our news so i shall only add that we begin now to hope we shall end the campaign on the banks of the canihe our general does all he can to end his with the enemy and i left him just now in hopes of at last compassing that work but i said too much on that article yesterday and am resolved to say no more of it but mere matter of fact but i own it is hard not to lose patience when other people lose their reason i was surprised to find by my sisters letter of the  0th that the queen had been ill at marli but am mighty glad it is so well over present her my duty  i gave the marshall this day the queens packet which i reckon gone by this time though follette has said nothing of her children yet hector has again writ about them i could not put off his writing about them till i heard from you because he had now no other pretense as i thought he had pray send me back gourneys marlboroughs letter to him for he wants the name of the colonel that is in it i suppose my journey in querpo is out of doors and i hope the man that proposed it is in prison he probably means ogilvie and the expedition to scotland proposed by him  if it is to be we shall at least not want cowards  after this letter there is a paper in the earl of middletons hand it alludes to the disturbances occasioned in england by sacheverels trial it mentions an advice which marlborough gave the court of st germains and a proposal to be made to the court of france  the paper is as follows  nairnes papers d n vol iii   0 no   since it has pleased god to spread the spirit of confusion amongst the kings enemies whereby they both concur for his miraculous restoration the church by proving the monarchy to be hereditary the conventicle that on that principle which they cannot confute the revolution was a rebellion and the princess anne has no title but a violent usurpation there is no presumption to rely on providence rather than to embark in a desperate affair which may serve only to reconcile your enemies and verify what gurney marlborough says  the great is not to be hoped for from hence and the little ought not to be accepted without all his own subjects he means all the irish troops in the french service which were computed to amount to between three and four thousand men  therefore his majesty may order this to be told to mons de torcy if it is refused the case is too plain to need an explanation the court of st germains had long doubted the sincerity of france in their cause   the demand referred to here is made in the following letter and memorial which are both in nairnes hand  ibid vol ii fol no    the earl of middleton to the marquis de torcy sends him a memorial  the reason why  the subject  and its importance  translation sir chaillot august       0 you would have received the enclosed memorial sooner if it had not been necessary to send it first to the king my master in order to have his approbation and receive his orders concerning it although we were unwilling to repeat over again former memorials it was however judged necessary to put you in mind of some principal points you will find in it again the word capital for if you begin with this project you will find every thing that is necessary to make it so but if in preference you mean to execute every other design and to put off this as superfluous i own before hand you will find nothing in it  all that is new in this memorial is the state of england and the demand made of the irish troops as to what regards england it is a matter of indifference to you whether the parliament be dissolved or not or whether the high or the low church prevail you will always find they are your enemies and i am very sorry sir to tell you that even our friends will do nothing for you while you do nothing for them they dont believe you are disposed to do any thing and there is nothing but an actual landing which can cure them of their credulity that will contribute to conceal the design in that country but it will be more difficult to conceal it here because all conversations at the thuilleries and in coffee houses run upon this project and the voice of the people desire it as the only remedy to their calamities  with regard to the demand of the irish troops i consider it as granted because it cannot be conjectured from what motive it can be refused since besides the convincing reasons of the memorial the irish making but half the number of troops which was proposed the armies will be less diminished by it and they will be transported with less difficulty and at less expense and it is essential to the service to do every thing which humanly may secure its success since thereby we shall gain our cause  if the bad news from spain are confirmed they should forward this project because he will be more pressed on all sides and you will have no favorable prospect from any other quarter in short it is necessary to determine upon something even though this project should be difficult a peace is impossible therefore there is no choice i am sir etc  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    a memorial to the marquis de torcy dated at chaillot the   th august    0 and sent with the preceding letter a recapitulation of former memorials  the present disposition of the scotch and of the irish  the present state of england  and the opinions of the opposite parties  the king offers to make a descent in scotland with the irish troops  the place of embarkation  translation in the several memorials which have been formerly presented to the court of france from his britannic majesty concerning his reestablishment it has been shown that a wellconcerted enterprise against scotland would be the most certain means to accomplish it and that that enterprise would at the same time be the most efficacious not to say the sole means to break the confederacy of the enemy and to reestablish france in its former superiority that all the other means tried till then whether by force of arms or by negociations had produced no effect that the enterprise against scotland had been tried only once that it was evident to all the world it would have succeeded if several obstacles had not occurred and that both friends and enemies acknowledged that if his britannic majesty had landed then all scotland would have declared for him the bank of england would have been shut up and consequently the government of england overturned and the league dissolved  it has been shown in these memorials that the changes which happened in scotland since that time were all advantageous to the king that the people were irritated more than ever against the present government on account of the bad treatment they had received from it that at the same time no one had deserted the kings party even after the bad success of that enterprise that no secret had been ever kept like this one since of so great a number both of the nobility and of the principal persons among the commoners there was not one who would acknowledge any thing or accuse any of those who had been apprehended notwithstanding all the threatenings and all the promises of the government and that witnesses could never be found to condemn any one of those who have been apprehended whatever efforts were made by the servants of the government for that purpose so that there can be no doubt of the good disposition of the scots  with regard to the irish it has been likewise shown in these memorials that their disposition has been always the same with regard to their lawful sovereign founded upon interest liberty and religion and it may be added that the catholics who are at least six to one protestant are reduced to such despair by the last persecution of the english government and are more disposed than ever to hazard all and to undertake every thing in order to free themselves from the oppression they suffer  it is very true that in the memorials which have been hitherto presented the same assurances could not be given of the disposition of england all that could be said of it with certainty was that an insurrection in scotland in the kings favor would have thrown the affairs of england into confusion but now it is very evident that the surprising changes which have for some time appeared in the affections of the people of england and which are seen to increase every day leave not the smallest room to doubt of their being well disposed toward their lawful sovereign  two parties animated to an extreme against one another evidently establish the right of that prince in their public writings the high church maintain as a principle of their religion that it is never allowable to resist their king for any cause whatsoever and that the hereditary succession is a law so fundamental that the parliament itself cannot change it the low church to show the high to be enemies to the present government maintain that the consequence of the first of these principles is that the government since the revolution has been but a continued usurpation and that the princes who have occupied the throne have been but usurpers and that the consequence of the second principle is that the pretender must be acknowledged as lawful king the people attentive spectators of this dispute have no difficulty in concluding that both the one and the other are in the right and the princess who is in possession by taking the high church into her considence and giving them the best employments seems to declare intelligibly enough what are her inclinations toward her brother this far the invisible hand of providence has already conducted this affair employing even its greatest enemies to advance it without their perceiving it  it is therefore very evident that the present situation of his britannic majestys affairs is more favorable than ever and that according to all appearances he need only have patience for a little time as several of his majestys friends in that country advice him and leave providence to act in order to enter into the possession of his right by the means of his own subjects alone  but however well founded these hopes of his britannic majesty from his own subjects may be he is not the less sensibly affected with the bad state of the affairs of france and this is what induces him to offer now again to expose his person in a second attempt in scotland in order to procure to france a peace of which she has so much need providing the irish troops are given to him to attend him in the enterprise this he judges so absolutely necessary for the interest of france as well as his own that without it he believes it is needless to think of such a project  his britannic majesty would wish that he had no occasion for any troops for this expedition but however well assured he may be of the good will of the greatest part of scotland yet as all the fortresses as well as the regular troops of the country are in the hands of the government and ready to act by their orders it is absolutely necessary for the security of his majestys person as well as for the success of the enterprise that he should have a sufficient number of troops with him at landing to oppose the enemy until his faithful subjects have time to assemble and to join him the prince of orange although he was sure before hand of all the most considerable men in england and even of the chief officers in the army of the late king of england as appeared sufficiently by the event judged however that it was improper to undertake the enterprise without being attended with fourteen thousand regular troops  in the former memorials the king of england could never demand less than six thousand men his subjects having always asked eight thousand men to secure the success of the expedition it is true in lord drummonds last memorial three thousand men only are mentioned but it is likewise true that that nobleman does not deny but he has concerted his projects with the highlanders alone without the knowledge of the chief men in the low country who compose the greatest part of the nation yet his britannic majesty considering how difficult it would be to transport a greater number has limited his demand to the irish troops his own subjects who at the end of the campaign will be scarce three thousand effective men what absolutely determines his majesty to ask the irish is that they speak the same language and are accustomed to the hardy manner of living of the country and that of each irish regiment two or three may be formed by incorporating with them the new levies of the country besides that it will be impossible to keep the irish in france after they know that the king is landed in scotland  but there is likewise a reason which his majesty thinks he should not pass over in silence and which appears to him to be very essential namely that the allies will no sooner see the landing succeed than dreading the consequences with which it must be infallibly attended to their disadvantage they will make fraudulent proposals of peace to france in order to ward off the blow one of these proposals will be to desire the most christian king to withdraw the troops who may have followed that prince and as his most christian majesty will not choose to do so he will have a very justisiable excuse in saying that they are not his subjects but the subjects of the king of england which he could not say if they were native frenchmen  with regard to the transport of troops and other necessaries in which the greatest difficulty consists those who have experience in maritime affairs are the best or rather the only judges of that affair what is very certain and necessary to be remarked here is that unless this enterprise is considered as a capital object to the state difficulties will occur on all hands to discourage and imaginary dangers which will become real when things are done by halves so that to attempt it in any other view will be useless to france and hurtful to the king of england but if his most christian majesty will find this expedition of importance enough to consider it as a capital object in that case money arms and ammunition as well as ships and troops will be found without any difficulty and he will likewise find seaofficers who will undertake it and who with gods assistance will accomplish it  the port of dunkirk has its advantages for the embarkation on account of the neighborhood of the troops and the shortness of the passage but the secret can never be kept for every thing that is done there is known the next day at ostend and when once the english and the dutch have discovered the design they will be always in a condition to thwart it  it appears then that breast would be more suitable because the enemy could not easily hinder the vessels from sailing from that port as was seen by experience during the war in ireland in case the preference is given to that port the irish troops should be put into winter quarters in the neighboring provinces  it might be likewise examined whether portpassage near fontarabia was sit for embarkation in that case the irish regiments might be sent to that quarter as if they were to go to serve in spain and his britannic majesty might repair thither under the same pretext and his removing at a distance from his kingdoms would conceal the design  in the case the troops embark at breast or at portpassage they may land anywhere on the west coast of scotland from kirkcudbright to the mouth of the river clyde it is true there is no fortified harbor there nor in any other part of scotland which would render the landing more easy but at the same time the ships could not remain there afterward in safety in case they were pursued by a superior force  with regard to pilots they might be had from that country though not without giving some suspicion of the design but as ships from glasgow air and kirkcudbright come ordinarily toward the month of november to nantz and bourdeaux sailors to serve as pilots might be taken out of them on different pretenses besides that some might be found among the french privateers who cruize frequently on that coast as five or six of these privateers not long ago made a descent in scotland near air from whence they carried away some cattle and alarmed the country it may be known from them where they got their pilots and their method may be followed  the squadron sailing from breast or from portpassage may steer their course through st georges channel or round the west of ireland the first is the shortest course but is esteemed the most dangerous yet the english merchantships daily pass through that channel at all seasons in failing along the coast of ireland some irish officers may be landed with arms etc in order to put the inhabitants in a condition to rise  but without entering into a more ample detail of the measures which should be taken to secure the success of the expedition and referring for that purpose to former memorials we shall only repeat in concluding that the success will entirely depend on the manner in which the enterprise is considered as of greater or less importance to france it is the business of his most christian majesty to judge of this by his consummate prudence and to determine according to the interest of his own affairs  the following anecdote deserves credit from collateral proofs there is no doubt but marlborough and godolphin had talked about a scheme of restoring the pretender some time or other without the assistance of france godolphin was probably sincere so would marlborough have been should the thing itself happen to suit his interest  cartes memorandumbook marked vol xi   0 p    lord godolphin had certainly the best head and capacity for a minister of state of any man in england and was a man that no country in the world might be ashamed of he had not the least tincture of avarice and was the uncorruptest man in his time in the management of the treasury and discharge of his offices he was lord chamberlain to king jamess queen who had always as mr dillon told me april   d      a very great opinion of him and mr dillon believes he really intended to serve the king he has sent many of his letters to that queen and the letters are still in being  one reason perhaps why he did not execute what he projected was his cowardice nobody could have more of that temper of mind and he was so susceptible of fear that the whigs could bully and frighten him into any thing  this has made me remember what the e of a who was very intimate with him told me in      viz that lord godolphin was the truest and sincerest friend to the king that he ever had and that after his disgrace on dr sacheverels trial about a month after he was turned out making him a visit lord godolphin expressed his concern at his being turned out before he had restored the king that he had been in unhappy circumstances and distressed by the tories that all his ministry had been spent in a struggle with the junto whose hands

and mr hamilton to send one or two to lord churchills master of the horse because i was in commerce of letters with him they seemed not to like it but left it to me conditionally it might not appear the king knew of it i told the king those i had already sent were so ordered that they could not suspect he had any knowledge of it so i had carte blanch one of nugents trumpets going to their army three days ago i had occasion to write to mr pitts and as a postscript i told him i had given the trumpet some new coin that he would see none such in the contribution money if he were curious he might see it and keep it if he liked it if not send it back by the trumpet after he had read my letter the trumpet as i had ordered him was going away to see if pitts would call for them what says he mr booth writes you have something for me so the trumpet gave them to him the trumpet being an irishman pitts did not speak one word to him but in the morning he called a trumpet of the guarddecorps into his chamber and showed the medals to him and bid him tell me he would give the medals back when he saw me but never before the french trumpet came to me before the irishman came home and asked me what those medals were for that above thirty english officers spoke to him to bring them medals the fellow told them what was true he did not know what they meant when you come back go to the

him i wonder they that fight for the gospel should not make that coin current in as much as it is taken out of the gospel that he and i know a man may make it current if he pleases i told the enemys trumpets it was money i sent to an irish prisoner and that the letter to lieutenant general lomney would tell him how to dispose of it i put a paper on every medal and directed it one to lieutenant general lomney one to lord george one to lieutenant general wood and one to lieutenant general withers others to inferior officers all sealed up in a purse and a note to them all in these terms i take

the months of october november and december    0 but they are all allegorical and without a key one can only understand from them in general that proposals were to be made to the new ministry that abram had a paper given him the year before written all by john jollys the kings own hand with a discretionary power to produce it when he thought necessary which on the receipt of a letter from lamb he had orders now to do and that lord middleton invited lamb i e mr lesley to go over to france and expected great satisfaction from his informations lord duplins marriage to the earl of oxfords daughter is probably referred to in the following passage in one of his lordships letters to abram i was surprised to hear that miss honyton had married a myrmidon  ply the soninlaw with the most

with inconstancy weakness or ingratitude for removing and disgracing men who had served her long and faithfully doctor swift insinuates that the marlborough family had lost all favor with her majesty upon her accession to the throne though she possessed the art of disguising her passions so perfectly as to have been able to conceal for a long time the aversion she had conceived for them it is not probable that her aversion began so early and though it is not easy to guess when she began to be sensible of the haughty and imperious behavior of the party which governed her and the nation it is certain that nothing contributed more to alienate her affections totally from them than their conduct and speeches in the course of doctor sacheverels trial godolphin began the prosecution more from private resentment than state necessity and imprudently furnished his enemies with an opportunity of ruining him and his friends when he unwarily gave importance to a man and a cause which he should have treated with neglect and contempt  the queen was present at the trial and listened with great attention to the debates in which a spirit of opposition betrayed both parties to advance principles which probably neither of them would follow to their utmost extent the tories openly maintained the doctrine of hereditary right and nonresistance and the whigs in justifying the revolution asserted a nations right to depose and dethrone their sovereign and laid down maxims of government more favorable to the privileges of parliament and the liberties of the people than monarchs choose to adopt  the tories had not strength to prevent sacheverel from being found guilty of all the articles for which he was impeached by the commons but they had influence afterward to procure addresses to the queen from all parts of the nation avowing the very principles for which he was condemned these addresses asserted the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance and acknowledged the absolute power of the crown they condemned as antimonarchical and republican all doctrines which allowed subjects to resist their sovereigns in any instance and declared the defenders of these doctrines to be advocates of blasphemy and impiety they affirmed that the queen acceded to the throne by a hereditary and not by a precarious parliamentary right or election they entreated a dissolution of the present parliament and contained assurances that none should be chosen in a new election but such as should be loyal to the sovereign and zealous for the church  these addresses could not fail to be more agreeable to anne a woman and a sovereign than those presented by the whigs in a different though dutiful and respectful strain in consequence of the first she determined to emancipate herself and to change her ministry notwithstanding the success with which they had served her and an interposition in their favor by the ministers of the emperor and of the statesgeneral who were directed to represent to her majesty what bad influence a change might have on affairs abroad  this change furnishes a new set of correspondents in the course of this year when the following persons came into office the duke of shrewsbury was made lord chamberlain on the   th of april in the room of the marquis of kent who was gratified with a dukedom dartmouth was made secretary of state in the room of the earl of sunderland who was turned out the   th of june the earl of godolphin was dismissed the  th of august and in his room earl powlet robert harley henry paget sir thomas mansel and robert benson were appointed commissioners of the treasury though powlet was the first commissioner in form it was well known that harley who was made chancellor and undertreasurer of the exchequer had the chief management of the treasury and presided in every thing behind the curtain  mr james cresset who had been formerly envoy extraordinary at the courts of zell and hannover was chosen by the new ministry to carry assurances of their attachment to the presumptive heirs of the crown and upon his death which happened soon after his nomination the earl of rivers was sent to hannover in the month of august with the same commission he was authorized to assure the princess sophia and her son the elector that the late changes for which the queen had sufficient reasons were rather favorable to them and a further security for their succession to the crown  on the   st of september the queen issued a proclamation to dissolve the parliament the earl of rochester was made lord president of the council in the room of lord summers the lord chamberlains staff was taken from the duke of devonshire and given to the duke of buckingham mr boil was dismissed from the post of secretary of state and the seals were given to mr henry st john the great seal upon the resignation of the lord chancellor cowper was given to sir simon harcourt and the lord lieutenancy of ireland to the duke of ormond upon the resignation of the earl of wharton the earl of portmore was appointed commander in chief of her majestys forces in portugal and the duke of hamilton lord lieutenant of the county palatine of lancaster  harley did not make such an entire change as the tories expected but the numbers who were turned out of office now and on another occasion soon after sufficiently prove that the whigs had as carefully excluded the tories from all places of honor and profit as the tories would have now excluded the whigs in their turn the military operations mentioned in the correspondence of this year

for putting things on that side in the state which the good of the common cause required i even proposed effectual means for obliging all those to furnish their contingent who had neglected it but far from succeeding that measure has only served to draw on me their hatred besides some circles do not choose to permit their troops to be commanded but by their own generals it was not in my power to dispose of the command so that seeing all subordination ruined and the disorder carried to such a height that it was absolutely without a remedy i thought i could not continue to command an army so ill provided in every thing without exposing my reputation and i declared this early lest i should occasion any disappointment  i entreat your majesty to be persuaded that this will not hinder me from showing always the same zeal as well in exhorting the different members of the empire to do what they ought for their defense as in giving them the example i hope that your majesty will approve of my conduct and that you will do me the justice to believe that your approbation is the principal end which i proposed to myself and that i am with great respect madam your majestys etc  robethons draught

upon my representations that that does not happen in the empire but they have been hitherto so ineffectual that i dare not promise myself a better success for the future this obliged me to divest myself of the command of the army on the rhine as i did myself the honor of notifying to your majesty by my former letter i would imagine that i encroached upon your time if i repeated the reasons which it contains i flatter myself that your majesty will honor them with your approbation and that you will acknowledge that nothing but an absolute necessiry could induce me to adopt such a measure

majesty begins to reign and that the oligarchy which tyrannized and threatened so long the queen and the british nations begins to vanish in this kingdom where a little cabal made obedience the duty of the sovereign and dominion the prerogative of two or three subjects for some years he then tells him that her majesty has placed herself on the throne and at the head of her treasury that she has sent bills of exchange to holland for paying her troops in flanders and portugal and she has made sufficient provision for their payment for the next six months notwithstanding the tricks and chicane of the lord godolphin and his party  the nation in general adores her majesty and commends extremely the conduct of the new ministry who had the courage and loyalty so seasonably to preserve the queen and the monarchy it is very certain that four years ago the queen thought of dismissing her treasurer and her general but the corruption of the two last parliaments always prevented her by mr harleys good offices he says the queen received the duke of shrewsbury into her confidence as well as mr harley himself who was always very loyal and active and religiously devoted to the interests of her majesty and the protestant succession in the illustrious family of your electoral highness  the queen cannot avoid suspecting all those who have a familiar correspondence with her general who had already set himself up as a protector and his creatures had the insolence as well as the impudence during all the last winter to drink to his health under that sine title he tells him that the general and treasurer afraid of contributing to the advantage of his electoral highness and of restoring to the queen the liberty of which she had been so long deprived were induced to intrigue with their party in the house of commons to take notice of some imprudent expressions of the speaker and by that means to embarrass her majestys affairs and prevent their own fall when shrewsbury he says was put in possession of his office without the knowledge of the treasurer or the general his duchess with her usual insolence began to quarrel with her majesty but her majesty wearied of hearing so much abuse from such a peevish woman forbad her to appear in her presence since which time her majesty has been allowed to transact business in peace  at length the earl of rivers is gone to fulfill the office which mr cresset mr cresset had been sent in capacity of envoy from her majesty to his electoral highness had to execute an individual should never pretend to know what the commissions of his sovereign contain with regard to affairs of state of which it is certain the public is entirely ignorant the cabal and the public ministers of the foreign potentates who were always closely connected with lord godolphin and who were almost all seduced or rather charmed and bewitched by him for very strong reasons no doubt give out in their public walks and conversation that lord rivers is sent by her majesty to offer the command of the army to your electoral highness at least to come over to this country and pay a visit to her majesty etc what say they will a great sovereign prince as the

account if it can be called suffering to receive the honor of being excluded from the counsels of your enemies and from a ministry so little favoring your illustrious family but in what manner i become for your sake the mark of their malice so as to be rendered incapable either of serving the queen or of holding any longer correspondence with her royal highness your mother by letters that

that he had no such thoughts himself that they ought to distinguish between resistance and revolution for vacancy or abdication was the thing they went upon and therefore resistance was to be forgot for had it not succeeded it had certainly been rebellion since he knew of no other but hereditary right  the duke of leeds told me says one who appears to have been a man of judgment and intelligence

me to see him sometimes the letter which you gave him to me was still in the bottom of his trunk  yesterday i received a visit on your account monsieur de hervart whom i do not visit because i am afraid of new acquaintances and drop the old came to see me at first he spoke to me of you and of the esteem he had for you this ended in telling me that as the whigs gave you some private advantages you might hope for the same thing from the new party in which he is deeply engaged i answered that i did not believe the whigs gave you any such advantages that if it had been so i would have perceived something of it and that you had a master who was alone capable of rewarding your services i beg of you says i explain to me a little what you mean that i may understand you the better he said to me what is expected from monsieur de robethon is that he should act in concert with the new party in favor of the family of hannover this appeared to me to have been suggested to him by mr st john the new secretary of state with whom i find he is so much connected that i have little doubt but he will be sent back to switzerland i replied that you would always do your best to support the interest of the elector and to show that the new party was well thought of at your court i went to my closet for your ostensible letter which i read to him all from the beginning without giving him a copy of it this made an impression and i doubt not but mr st john was regaled that very evening with what he had retained of it this is the substance of our conversation perhaps monsieur de hervart informed you of all this in the letter which he wrote you he told me that he had likewise seen your cousin they do not choose to disoblige you as you see he assured me that my lord rivers was very

of the greatest part of artois will be of very great importance to us for the operations of the next campaign it is very much to be regretted that the season does not permit to make another effort before the army separates to endeavor to bring the enemy to reason but it is high time to give some ease to the troops after the fatigues which they have endured during four sieges suffiiciently obstinate and to think of the means of putting them in a condition to act as soon as possible next year to which i am persuaded your electoral highness will contribute on your side with your usual

republic nor for rendering the crown elective as they consider it hereditary in the protestant line and belonging to the nearest in that line but it is not possible for the whigs to abandon the revolution they advanced the late king to the throne and they are obliged to defend his title now they advanced him then in preference to the queen who now reigns although she was nearer and a protestant as this could not be done but by the authority of the parliament it is natural for the whigs to defend that authority and the parliamentary right to the crown for otherwise they would declare themselves traitors and rebels and as the establishment of the hannoverian succession is a consequence of the revolution and a work of the late king your court should take it well of the whigs that they defend the revolution and should excuse some expressions in their last writings which appear to carry too far the authority of the parliament in the affair of the succession and the more so that the maxims of the tories tending directly to prepare the way for the prince of wales and to secure his title from being called in question it is natural for the friends of the hannoverian

weary you by the repetition of things which mr bothmar will not fail to represent to you verbally much better than i can write them i said so to my lord rivers and i must add now that they hope here

may employ whoever he pleases in his service without regarding the opinion of others but with this reserve that if they act ill that he will leave them always to be judged by the laws of the land and such a declaration would be the best means to suppress insolence and parties  but now as to the highchurch  there are   00 parishes in england and consequently so many parsons but their number may be at least  000 more to supply cures and who seek preferment  ten or fifteen of this number have made it their business to preach that the church is in danger though the church enjoys all the privileges that the law does allow them but the clergymen in england would have the same power over the people that the church of rome had in the time of its dominion over us  the queen and parliament have now declared that they will maintain the church as established by law so that they will not gain any thing by their noise only this ministry have blown them up to recommend them and their party to govern the helm which point they have gained and the poor ambitious priests will be left in the lurch  the priests handle edged tools which any prince may cut them with when he pleases for the laws are so severe against their encroachments that they are in danger of treason or praemunire upon the least fault and the civil government has been so jealous of their impertinence that the convocation of the clergy cannot do any thing but by commission from the king or queen and they cannot debate upon or resolve any point but such as are permitted in their commission and which resolved they are not valid

same rope  as to the letters we can say nothing till we see draughts the three persons proposed to deliver them are very proper if they will undertake it which i doubt much as for musgrave supposed to be the duke of bucks he is by no means fit for if conrad would accept them from any of the other three yet he would not trust him if honyton harley would receive his own well he would not refuse to give the other and it must land there at last but if he does not accept his own then why should not you try mrs settle mrs masham who you said had offered herself for such a purpose but this will not come to bear till you are possessed of the original  nairnes papers vol ix  t0 p      in the months of october november and december    0 and in the months of january february and march this year the earl of middleton and mr nairne wrote several letters to knox abram and lamb these letters are mostly allegorical and cannot be explained in almost all of them they express the greatest impatience to see lamb and on the  th of april ibid p    nairne wrote to abram to tell him that lamb was at length arrived the real name of lamb was lesley the wellknown nonjuror clergyman upon his arrival in france he gave his opinion of things in general in the following memorial to the court of st germains  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no     a copy in nairnes hand circumstances are now favorable for an invasion the english being disgusted at the change of the ministry and the scots at the protection the parliament gave to greenshields  the credit of the bank was endangered by a threatened and will be ruined by a real invasion  the queen will prefer her brother to the family of hannover  his friends will declare for him  the advantages he must derive from a treaty with the nation  objections against him on account of his religion  advices about it  an alliance proposed with sweden  translation april      since the revolution there has not been so great a confusion of counsels and of measures in england as there has been since the last change in the ministry and the affair of greenshields a minister of the church of england whom the parliament has lately protected against the presbyterians of scotland has irritated the latter to such a degree that they would concur in whatever might deliver them from the union with england which is universally detested in scotland where they are all persuaded that nothing can deliver them from it but the return of their sovereign  there is at present a concurrence of circumstances more favorable for an enterprise than there has been since his majesty came out of england but all this will change in time and for the future they will attend only to the means of supporting as easily as they can the chains from which they see no further hopes of being delivered  there is not a man in great britain who is not convinced that if the king of england had landed the last time in scotland he would have infallibly succeeded and the conjuncture appears at present still more favorable than it was then the inclination of the scots toward their king appears visible in their sending as members to parliament the same men who had been brought prisoners to london on account of the invasion and i can assure that these men have not changed their sentiments the presbyterians in scotland opposed the elections as much as they could and their ministers preached against them but in vain for these members were chosen in spite of them by a great majority of voices  at the time of the last expedition to scotland men ran in crowds and with so great eagerness to withdraw their stock out of the bank that the commons were obliged to pass a law declaring all those to be enemies to the government and to the nation who should demand their money from the bank at that time but instead of curing the evil thereby they increased the discontent every one exclaiming that it was cruel to treat as enemies to the state those who called for their money when they had occasion for it and if news had not come that the king of england had returned to france with the fleet in twelve hours later the bank would have been shut up this is well known to all those who were then in london and is known throughout all england insomuch that since that time the credit of the bank is greatly diminished not long ago the news of the failing of    or    privateers from dunkirk gave the alarm in england that the pretender was coming upon which severals with some of whom i am acquainted ran immediately to the bank to demand their money and there is no doubt but the same thing will happen universally whenever there is a real invasion all the funds will fail no tax will be paid but what is raised by force no one will chooe to advance money upon the security of the funds and without it it will be impossible to make new preparations for opposing the invasion  if the bank of england fails i believe there is no doubt that the confederates will not be able to support the war and then his most christian majesty will have a safe game to play without running any risk troops are daily draughted to be sent out of the kingdom so that few will be left to make opposition and there are severals in the army who have discovered their dispositions of returning to their duty toward their king if they found the opportunity  they are preparing fleets to be sent to the mediterranean and elsewhere so that the few ships which will remain to guard the channel cannot hinder the passage from breast to kirkcudbright especially if an alarm is given from dunkirk and other ports all the fleet of england can never hinder a squadron to pass from breast to ireland and scotland is only a little more distant in the same line  severals in england wish the king well who would not hazard their estates for him but these very people would not willingly hazard any thing against him if they saw the smallest risk on the side of the government it seems therefore that the greatest number want only an opportunity of declaring themselves that is to say the return of his britannic majesty with a force sufficient to protect those who would choose to join him on his arrival if he came with  0000 men it is thought there would not be a sword drawn against him but if he cannot have that number  000 men would render the success probable but not so certain  it is generally thought that the princess of denmark is favorably inclined toward the king her brother and that she would choose rather to have him for her successor than the prince of hannover but she is timid and does not know to whom she can give her confidence the duke of leeds told me that he had endeavored to sound her as much as he could upon this subject and he is in her confidence and has free access to her but though she never chose to explain herself upon this point she says nothing against him it is thought that if the king of england was in scotland a treaty with him would be immediately proposed and then the members of parliament would be at liberty to declare their sentiments whereas they are now restrained by an act of parliament which declares all those guilty of high treason who shall oppose the hannoverian succession by word or by writing but the king of england being in scotland and all the kingdom acknowledging him which could not fail to happen soon after his arrival in that country then the present nccessity and the common good of the nation would authorize the liberty which each might take of proposing whatever could prevent the fatal effects of a civil war i am well assured that some members of parliament would speak boldly in that case and i have also reason to believe that there are several others who only want a similar conjuncture for declaring themselves and who would do it cordially and there is scarcely any doubt but the greatest number would be for a treaty those who would oppose it would not render themselves popular and might be considered as the enemies of the peace and settlement of the nation and the very rumor of the treaty would make the people consider the king as already in possession and as the rising sun i believe there is no example in our history that the lawful heir has been admitted to a treaty when his right was not acknowledged as in the case of stephen and henry ii of richard duke of york and of henry vi etc and the princess of denmark having no children would render the affair still more easy both with regard to herself and with regard to the people  the archduke had none of these motives to encourage his enterprise and was not assured of having one miquilite for him when he undertook to make that diversion in spain which has continued for so many years and is not yet finished the diversion of the malcontents in hungary has been of considerable advantage to france and it was by marching into saxony that the king of sweden obliged king augustus to submit  the smallest advantage which an expedition of the king of england into scotland could produce would be a civil war which might be supported from time to time by france even though none of his majestys subjects should join him but that is not to be supposed for in the divisions of parties there are now malcontents enough in great britain who would rejoice at that opportunity of joining him besides so many others in distressed circumstances or on bad terms with the government whom fear resentment or hope would influence and there are men of that character in every country but no where so many as there are at present in great britain but it is certain that the greatest number of the scots are disposed to join their king from inclination and from a principle of loyalty this is evident from all that they have suffered with so much constancy for above two and twenty years and that there is a considerable number of them appears from the apprehensions the government entertain of them and the measures they take to apprehend the leaders on every alarm but there are besides a set of men welldisposed who have taken the oaths to the government only by form and from interest and whom general stanhope in sacheverels trial calls the nonjurorswearers these are very numerous in the two kingdoms there is not a highchurch man in england that is not suspected by the government this is the case with all those who have presented addresses for maintaining hereditary right and the maxim of the church of england that a prince is never to be resisted and these comprehend almost the whole nation excepting such as are whigs or presbyterians by profession who however are become the contempt and aversion of the people  malicious and injurious expressions against the king are no longer used even by the whigs who dare not now express themselves as they did formerly they acknowledged his birth in sacheverels trial in order to destroy hereditary right by that means and to convince the princess of denmark that she has no other title to the crown but the settlement which has been made for the succession since the revolution and the generality speak with esteem and respect of the kings person  i do not intend to conceal any thing the only objection against the king is his religion but that is not imputed to him as a fault but as his misfortune and ours and the people would endure him much more willingly if they did not believe him a bigot to his religion and this is the idea his enemies endeavor to give of him as much as they can  to obviate this objection the following means are judged useful by his majestys friends who persuade themselves that he will be ready to do on his part all that is lawful for him to bring about his restoration and god forbid that more should be demanded of him to gain even all the kingdoms of the earth   st the king of england therefore must not either by word or by insinuation give any reason to believe that he is capable of dissembling his religion every one would have a worse opinion of him on that account and less credit would be given to all that he could say  but to remove the objection of bigotry and blind zeal it is proposed he should acquaint his subjects that when it shall please god to restore him to his kingdoms and to give him a proper opportunity he will not refuse to hear whatever can be said to him with respect and submission in favor of the religion of his dominions but whatever may be the issue of this with regard to his majestys religion that will not diminish our loyalty and our entire submission to him as our lawful sovereign  it is not understood by this that there is to be a public dispute which is a sort of combat of gladiators for victory and which ends generally in increasing the differences and exasperating the animosities upon both sides the pride of man having a natural aversion to appear to be convinced accordingly when reasons fail pride summons all the passions to its aid and then the combat is carried on with bitterness and with personal reflections which produce a hatred that excludes all means of reconciliation  no this is not pretended it is proposed only that his britannic majesty should not refuse to hear a reasonable man who will explain to him with all the deference and respect that is due to him the principles of the church of england and that afterward he should determine as god and his conscience will dictate to him but at the same time he should preserve to the church of england all legal securities for its establishment and support   dly it is proposed in order to remove all suspicion and prejudice against his majesty that when he comes over he should bring no more priests along with him than he has occasion for it is the interest of the king of england especially on his arrival to give the people advantageous impressions of him afterward things will be more easy when he is on the throne and the people find that their religion their liberty and their fortunes arc safe he may then have as many priests with him as he pleases without being found fault with so that it is only proposed to deprive himself of some of them for a little time the pen is drawn through the last paragraph in the copy probably to prevent giving offense to the bigotry of lewis xiv for whose perusal the translation of the memorial was intended    dly if his most christian majesty would only connive at allowing the protestant domestics of the king of england to assemble themselves from time to time at st germains in order to worship god in the most secret manner that possibly could be that would do more service than  0000 men for in england that would appear as a sort of toleration with regard to his attendants and being obtained by his britanni majesty every one would consider it as a mark of his inclination to favor his protestant subjects and as a pledge of what they might expect from him when he was restored to his throne besides that it would entirely remove the objection of bigotry if it could be said in england that the king has procured for the protestant servants who attend him the liberty which is here proposed for them that would be half the way to his restoration i only repeat here the very words which i have heard from sensible men in london   thly when the king of england comes it will be proper to have in his company some minister of the church of england who is of an approved character in order to preach to the people as soon as he lands without trusting to chance and employing the first whom he finds on the place and who may be either disaffected or incapable   thly it is necessary to bring along with him all the irish troops who will be very agreeable to the highlanders because they speak the same language but above all to bring the duke of berwick along with him for he is feared and loved and his presence will prevent all the disputes which may arise among the nobility of scotland for the command of the army for they will all submit to him and they all desire that he may come  time presses and appears short for according to all appearances the next winter will produce a peace and then the king of england must be reduced to begin every thing anew for bringing about his restoration and to seek new and uncertain measures to accomplish it  if the princess of denmark who is very infirm dies and if the prince of hannover is once in possession he will bring along with him his german troops who in virtue of the last act of parliament will be naturalized the moment they arrive and he will humble and ruin all the king of englands friends and render by these means his cause desperate  the pen is drawn through what follows  if his most christian majesty is not in a condition now to furnish troops and other succors necessary to the king of england for an expedition into scotland may not some proposals be made to the king of sweden will not that prince be very well pleased to have such an ally to assist him to obtain satisfaction from the king of denmark and to defend his coasts against the muscovites and in case of a double marriage which might be proposed to him he would have a chance of succeeding to the crown of england as the king of england would have to that of sweden their religion cannot be objected against the swedes for the prince of hannover is a lutheran  if his most christian majesty chooses rather to land   or  0000 men to the assistance of the king of sweden than to risk his troops and his ships on an expedition to scotland the king of sweden might send an equal number of troops to scotland much more easily because the passage is much shorter and considering that that prince is engaged in sitting out considerable armaments both by sea and by land against the danes and against the muscovites the real designs of his preparations will never be suspected he may be the more easily reconciled to this that the government of england is not very favorably disposed toward him of which his swedish majesty appears by his last declaration to be very sensible declaring war against them in some measure and considering them as the aggressors because they engaged to maintain a neutrality in the north of germany and nothing appears more natural and more conform to the genius of that prince than to enter into an alliance with the king of england who may write to him by the means of the swedish resident who is here until he can send a minister to treat with him besides that prince is guarantee of the peace of riswick and has a right to interest himself in the present war and by an alliance with the king of england he might once more have the balance of europe in his hands and give a general peace upon reasonable terms and these two princes thus allied would be in a condition to maintain the peace against all those who would incline to disturb it and to prevent any rebellion that might arise in their respective dominions  the dismission of the whig ministry last year was followed by a dissolution of the parliament doctor sacheverels trial and his pompous procession to the country when he went to his living in north wales inflamed the passions of the people and influenced the elections in favor of the tories the expectations from a tory ministry and the proceedings of the new parliament reanimated the hopes of the jacobites as appears from their own correspondence with their friends abroad and from the pretenders recommending to his adherents to support the measures of the present administration  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    a letter to a friend with a state of affairs in england      a copy in nairnes hand with corrections interlined in lord middletons violence of both whigs and tories  the whigs are attached to the family of hannover  to prevent a civil war the king should come over and the laws settling the succession be repealed  the pretender recommended to his friends to support the measures of the court and the present ministry  sir since you desire my opinion upon the present state of affairs of our country and that you assure me i may with all safety conside my private thoughts to you i shall tell you here very plainly what i think most advisable in the present conjuncture  i need not go about to prove that the house of hannover and the states of holland are united with the whigs and discontented party of england against the queen her present ministry and the church of england  their late proceedings have sufficiently shown their inclinations that way and nothing is more obvious than that the church and court party can expect no quarter from these three united powers if ever they come to have the superiority they think they have been very ill used and after resenting their pretended injuries so publicly as they have done it is not to be expected they will ever hardly pardon it is pretty plain they are in a sort of confederacy together and that they are resolved to stand and fall by one another the duke of hannover has in conjunction with the states declared himself so openly for the whig party in opposition to the queen herself as well as her ministry that it is visible he is inseparably united to that party and will always be influenced by it and that if ever he comes to have the power in his hands the church and present ministry must fall a sacrifice to the whigs revenge the breach being too wide to expect they can ever be thoroughly reconciled  i am of opinion therefore that as matters stand now there remains only one expedient that can possibly secure at once both the church and state against any attempt that may be made to their prejudice either during the queens life or after her death by a powerful absolute prince supported by a jealous interested nation abroad and animated by an exasperated factious party at home and that is to call home the queens brother whose just right gains ground daily in the hearts of his subjects in order to which i think it not only advisable but absolutely necessary to send to treat with him without loss of time for all depends upon taking timely measures it being of the last importance to the court and country interest as well as his to be beforehand with their common adversaries accidents may happen we are all mortal and if things be not prepared and secured before a vacancy it will be very hard after that to avoid a civil war for we all know that according to the laws now in being hannover in that case must of course be proclaimed king it will be too late then to repeal those laws which make it high treason to oppose him and it is not to be doubted but he will quickly come over here and bring with him if it be necessary all the force the hollanders and he can draw together on the other hand it is certain the king will not be wanting on his side to transport himself at any rate into some part of his dominions to join with his friends in order to assert his right and venture all rather than have the shame and grief to see a foreign u  r take peaceable possession of his lawful inheritance this must unavoidably produce a civil war which is perhaps what the hollanders wish for the fatal consequences of which may last and extend nobody knows how far  the only remedy i see to prevent these misfortunes and save our nation from ruin and bloodshed is the proposal above mentioned of sending immediately upon the conclusion of the peace to treat with her majestys brother the king and call him home privately upon the first recess of parliament  this is absolutely the quickest safest and easiest way for all other flow dilatory methods of preparing things by degrees managing the opposite party waiting for new favorable opportunities and keeping in the mean time this prince at a distance are exposed to too many dangers and difficulties besides that unanswerable one of a sudden mortality which as it may very possibly happen to our great grief and misfortune when we expect it least so it is the height of imprudence not to prepare against it  it would require a great deal of more time than we can in prudence promise to ourselves to go about to repeal the act of the settlement of the crown in a parliamentary way before he be called over so i think that tedious method nowise advisable besides that the undertaking itself might meet with such opposition in his absence as would expose it to the danger of a miscarriage whereas he being once upon the place invited thither and countenanced by her majesty which is no hard matter to contrive so as to make it very practicable in the recess of parliament without the least danger of disturbance those very persons who would have opposed him in parliament and every where else in his absence will be the first to come and kiss his hand when he is here and comply with whatever the queen shall think fit to do in his favor  it is so visibly the queens and the present ministrys true interest to call her only brother home in this conjuncture that he and they may be a mutual support and security to one another that i am morally assured he will not make the least difficulty to trust himself entirely into their hands whenever they please to call him and that he will be willing even to come over with a page only to accompany him upon the queen his sisters letter if it be thought fit and necessary for his and their common interest so to do and when he is once here i am sure nobody will dare to find fault with the queens receiving him kindly she may safely present him to her council own him there for her brother and declare her good intentions toward him and what she has thought fit with the advice of her ministers to treat and concert with him for the future good and peace of her kingdoms after which step it will be infinitely more easy and less hazardous by any other method whatsoever to get the present settlement of the succession altered in the next meeting of the parliament and every thing regulated there to their mutual satisfaction and all the rights and privileges of church and state crown parliament and people settled again upon the solid foundation of the ancient laws and constitution of the kingdom  but to assure the success of this great work i think it absolutely best when he is invited over that he be allowed to come straight to london where his sudden and unexpected appearance will surprise and confound all his unprepared enemies break all their measures and make every thing go so quick and easy on the queens side and his that they will soon by the wise conduct of the present ministry put it out of the power of either hannover or the discontented whigs to disturb the new settlement that shall be agreed upon between the brother and his now only sister but in case things be not thought ripe enough or sufficiently disposed to bring him straight to london the next best will be to bring him to scotland which would be better by far than sending him a traveling into foreign countries only one thing is to be observed as to scotland that the government of the church there being presbyterian and the generality of that nation being discontented with the union which we in england think our interest to maintain he may perhaps have some hard proposals made to him upon that head by a prevalent party in that kingdom which will make him very uneasy by putting a disagreeable necessity upon him of refusing what he cannot grant to them without disobliging the english which i have good reason to be believe he is resolved not to do it being contrary to his inclination as well as his interest to do any thing in favor of one nation that may be a just ground of grievance to another his intention as i am credibly informed being to leave all those matters of state as well as of religion to be entirely decided and settled in a british parliament  thus sir i have in compliance to your desire opened my mind freely to you upon a very nice point i hope from your friendship for me and your known discretion in matters of this importance that you will not communicate this paper but where you are sure it will be safe and where you have reason to hope it may be of some use i shall conclude with assuring you that you are the only person to whom it is sent and that neither the person by whose conveyance it comes nor any other person whatever on your side knows any thing of the contents of it any thing that tends toward jacobitism as i own this letter does sounds ill in the ears of those who are always used to tack popery slavery and arbitrary government together and have no other notion of a popish king but that of a bigot tyrant but i who know from unquestionable hands that the pretender as we call him here besides his other great and good qualities is too wise and too just a prince to think of persecuting any body for his religion that on the contrary all those of our church that are about him at present have distinguished marks of his bounty shown to them with assurances that it shall not be his fault if they have not the full exercise of their religion whenever they go with him i who know also that he has sent particular directions to his friends here to join themselves unanimously to vote for and support the measures of the court and present ministry with all the interest they have am not only fully persuaded of his true affection for his sister and love for his country but am also convinced in my conscience that our established religion as well as our liberties estates and employments and every thing else that is dear to us will be infinitely more secure under his government than under a lutheran foreign prince influenced by german and whig counsels and therefore to you i am not afraid nor ashamed to own myself so far a jacobite as to wish a good understanding between our gracious queen and her brother which i look upon to be the only means to make her majesty happy easy and safe as long as she lives our present ministry out of danger of being ever oppressed by their enemies our church safe and our country happy to be a jacobite at this rate in my opinion is to be a true patriot and a faithful subject and i hope you do me the justice to have no other opinion of sir etc  whatever might have been the disposition of her ministry there is reason to think that the queen herself was now inclined to secure the succession to her brother in the following rough draught of a letter to her in english of which there is also a draught of a french translation among nairnes papers and both in nairnes hand the chevalier puts her in mind of a promise she had made to their father and proposes to her that she should send over to him a trusty person with whom he might enter into a treaty it is evidently the pretenders own diction  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    may a letter to queen anne from her brother this is supposed to be one of the letters in lord middletons letter to abram of the   th of march  madam may      the violence and ambition of the enemies of our family and of the monarchy have too long kept at distance those who by all the obligations of nature and duty ought to be more firmly united and have hindered us from the proper means and endeavors of a better understanding between us which could not fail to produce the most happy effects to ourselves to our family and to our bleeding country  but whatever the success may be i have resolved now to break through all reserve and to be the first in an endeavor so just and necessary the natural affection i bear you and that the king our father had for you till his last breath the consideration of our mutual interest honor and safety and the duty i owe to god and my country are the true motives that persuade me to write to you and to do all that is possible for me to come to a perfect union with you  and you may be assured madam that though i can never abandon but with my life my own just right which you know is unalterably settled by the most fundamental laws of the land yet i am most desirous rather to owe to you than to any living the recovery of it it is for yourself that a work so just and glorious is reserved the voice of god and nature calls you to it the promises you made to the king our father enjoin it the preservation of our family the preventing of unnatural wars require it and the public good and welfare of our country recommend it to you to rescue it from present and future evils which must to the latest posterity involve the nation in blood and confusion till the succession be again settled in the right line  i am satisfied  in the meantime i assure you madam and am ready to give all the security that can be desired that it is my unalterable resolution to make the law of the land the rule of my government to preserve every mans right liberty and property equally with the rights of the crown and to secure and maintain those of the church of england in all their just rights and privileges as by law established and to grant such a toleration to dissenters as the parliament shall think fit  your own good nature madam and your natural affection to a brother from whom you never received any injury cannot but incline your heart to do him justice and as it is in your power i cannot doubt of your good inclinations and i do here assure you that in that case no reasonable terms of accommodation which you can desire for yourself shall be refused by me but as affairs of this moment cannot be so well transacted by letters i must conjure you to send one over to me fully instructed and empowered by you or to give security for such a one from me for by that way only things can be adjusted to our mutual satisfaction which shall be managed on our side with the utmost secrecy  i have made this first step toward our mutual happiness with a true brotherly affection with the plainness and sincerity that becomes both our rank and relation and in the most prudent manner i could at present contrive and will be directed by you in the prosecution of it relying entirely on your knowledge and experience as to the means and instruments  and now madam as you tender your own honor and happiness the preservation and reestablishment of our ancient royal family the safety and welfare of a brave people who are almost sinking under present weights and have reason to fear greater who have no reason to complain of me and whom i must still and do love as my own i conjure you to meet me in this friendly way of composing our difference by which only we can hope for those good effects which will make us both happy yourself more glorious than all the other parts of your life and your memory dear to all posterity  the following is the composition of

assurances i gave them in my instructions bearing date the  d march   0  which you have seen and i am resolved to make good i know my grandfather and my father too had always a good opinion of the principles of the church of england relating to monarchy and experience sufficiently shows that the crown was never struck at but she also felt the blow and though some of her chief professors have failed in their duty we must not measure the principles of a church by the actions of some particulars  plain dealing is best in all things especially in matters of religion and as i am resolved never to dissemble in religion so i shall never tempt others to do it and as well as i am satisfied of the truth of my own religion yet i shall never look worse upon any persons because in this they chance to differ with me nor shall i refuse in due time and place to hear what they have to say upon this subject but they must not take it ill if i use the same liberty i allow to others to adhere to the religion which i in my conscience think the best and i may reasonably expect that liberty of conscience for myself which i deny to none  nairnes papers vol ix  t0 p    mrs watson a name which will

without the approbation of the directors of the company on which this advice was given to him  your good will is commendable your capacity respectable but your zeal indiscreet your business is to watch what passes to give just informations to make well digested proposals but not finish any thing without the directions of your employers for there is nothing more dangerous for yourself nor destructive to trade if you are in the dark it should make you more cautious qui ambulat in tenebris nescit quo vadit is gospel if you have no directions you should presume there are good reasons for it you should not be so uncharitable as to think we would be wanting to ourselves and though you only mention matters as from yourself yet it makes those you deal with insist on higher terms  this is what was writ by jonathan youngs order i e probably by the kings to abram  ibid p    mutato nomine de te fabula narratur nairne to abram to answer his two letters of the   th and   th september

concerning him  the correspondence and intrigues of marlborough  lord carylls letters vol v fol scotch college tunstal to the earl of middleton honored sir november   i have been away these two months since i writ my last to you and my journey home being much about the same time your lawyer churchill was in motion made him a little concerned for fear he should not have had an opportunity of speaking to me before he left these parts for good and all this he showed in a more open manner than usual for he asked particularly after of me of after one that had gone from our town to wait upon him and commissioned him at his return to inquire whether i was come back or no and if so to tell me he had a mind to see me but at this gentlemans return i not being arrived he neglected to send any more to our house and i had like to have lost the news of this intimation as soon as i knew it in the uncertainty i was in to find mr james churchill your lawyer i writ to one of his household to know more in particular his desires and where i might wait upon him who immediately answered me as from his master and fixed me the place where he was to stay some days whereupon the time pressing of both sides i took post and had two long conferences with him about mr bernards the queens lawsuit and mr kellys the kings affairs as to both which he shows a good will and gives in appearance sincere wishes but how far he will be able to work effectually in the matter i leave you to judge first as to mr bernards the queens deed he says it must be insisted upon in time for he looks upon it certain that an accommodation peace will be made  as to mr antonys the kings business it must be managed with a great deal of dexterity he was not a little startled at the news of his going to mr price the pope it would not have been well at all he says when they begin to work at povey peace perchance mr edward king of france and his fredlingers ministers who will be willing to consecrate any thing to their own ends will be consenting to mr athonys the kings going to live some where with mr price the pope or some where in that country and he fancies that something of that kind may be insisted upon by others in evans england by that means to persuade the tenants that they are altogether for excluding the thomists catholics and all for gregory hannover but he declares as much as he can judge of things that mr athonys the kings going thither must never be granted to and this he looks upon as a point of the last importance for he declares he thinks it absolutely contrary to mr athonys interest and therefore though mr edward king of france should consent to it and people in evans england push for it it must not be done and he desired me in particular to assure you of this and he swore it by the living god that he thought that if mr benjamin the queen ever consented to this that twas no better than ruining and quite murdering this sons the grots kings cause if it be necessary or judged advantageous to quit forster france let him go to his uncle david germany or rather have recourse to some free seat but i asked him what security for his person there being such a writ out against him he answered he really did not think he wanted any security for nobody would touch him as for his part he had seen such visible changes for the better of late on all sides that he thought the gaining of his cause could not but follow and when he gets his estate he hopes he will make his tenants easy and not thinking of annulling any regulations made for the cutting down woods and altering other farms for these many years for that will bring dangerous consequences the interest of so many persons being engaged who otherwise would come in to him  when mrs bettys deed the queens jointure is insisted upon if it was to be put to philip cook the parliament you will find many he is persuaded even willing to help it on and glad of an occasion of making their compliments a bon grace and giving some testimony of their goodwill if she thinks that he shall be in any capacity of serving her in this point she needs only to signify to him what she expects from him and he will be very glad of the occasion of showing himself her humble servant he insinuated a desire you should be sensible that what he has done for these many years and seem to affirm the same of others has not been out of any spleen or ill will against you but only to put down foster france which he always judged the true interest of mrs edwards england whose cause alone he pleaded for he thinks certainly there will be an accommodation for when he was last winter at mrs evans england he saw so much of the disposition of the people that if all were to be polled nine in ten would absolutely vote for povey peace being spent on all sides by so long a lawsuit  a great many he says have taken strange methods of late which contrary to the intentions of those that made use of them will prove very much to the advantage of mr andrews the kings cause and god who rules above seems visibly to dispose all things for the best neither your cousin temple the tories nor wilson the whigs are much to be relied on quatenus such but all that they have or seem to be a doing will insensibly reduce both of them more and more to the necessity of doing mr athonys the kings business and even calling for him  to signify these things to you was the reason of his calling for me and he desired i would tike an occasion of waiting upon you for this intent but i hope the writing this will suffice if not you know where to command after my compliments to him i told him as to myself i was much more afraid of the issue of his suits in this following season than in the former he owned he had been treated unworthily upon several accounts but that was nothing for his part god had blessed him with a great deal of temper and he had taken the resolution of being quiet for the present but he would expect his time and if mr matthew harley or others pushed things to greater extremities they should give him perchance only better hold and they should find what metal he was made of  he desired that his compliments might be made in a particular manner to mr barker berwick and mr wall e midd and bade me tell the latter that he hoped mr wall e midd would live to see better times and more according to his satisfaction he was pleased to ask me many questions about mr walters e midds conversion and said he had heard at the beginning as if he had had a mind of retiring from business for good and all as for his conversion i told him it was beyond all doubt truly solid and certainly upon motives altogether christian and for the rumor of his having a mind to retire perchance his retiring to our little seminary at onksi paris might give occasion of that rumor but this was only to do his work he had undertaken more efficaciously and first cleanse the garden of so many weeds that had overrun it and secondly plant the same with necessary adornments i think he answered it is what we must all come to but i did not understand him perfectly  as for the working at povey peace he thought they had taken all their measures to do the business without him and as for his part he desired nothing more than to be at quiet some business to settle matters abroad would detain him yet a little while at mr harrisons holland but when that was done he would hasten home where he would maintain himself against them all and if mr mathews harley or others pushed matters any farther against him perchance so much the better  but after he had used a great many compliments etc toward you i thought it would not be amiss civilly to urge him to something more positive and endeavor to see if there were any more solid assurances to be had from him above what one might call a compliment and for the purpose i objected this to him that some might say he being a lawyer of such interest why would not he stickle more in mr anthony the king and barnards the queens suits he answered he did not know what he could do directly in the matter but only by managing people so on occasions as to make them enter into the aforesaid interests and they might assure themselves nothing should be wanting on his side as occasions should present he owned indeed that he had acted with a great deal of animosity against foster france and he always thought it the interest of his country so to do but not against them and really seemed to show a great desire of all things prospering with you and said that god almighty had disposed things so that he solemnly swore again that he thought mr anthonys the kings business could not fail of going forward and that his rode religion would not be any hinderance to it for all the protestations evans england had made to the contrary he says he knows your cousin harry princess of denmark perfectly well that he is a very honest person but easily won and wrought upon but at the bottom he certainly has no aversion from his brother alexander the king but he princess anne is one that must not be frightened and the lawyer churchill says he thinks any extern force used will rather do more harm than good both in regard of harry princess anne and others whereas if one will but let things go on their own train alexander the kings business will go on of itself and he does not doubt but will come to a happy conclusion  i wish it was in my power in any manner to conduce to it it shall always lay close to my heart and be the subject of my best prayers with all the assurances of my most humble duty

to france in the month of july and came back with mr mesnager and the abbe gaultier in the month of august preliminary articles were signed in london about the latter end of september and notwithstanding the remonstrances of the emperor and of the states and a spirited and vehement memorial from the elector of hannover it was determined to open a general congress at utrecht in the beginning of the ensuing year the court of st germains seem to have had such confidence in the attachment of queen anne and her ministry to their cause that they were not so uneasy now at the news of a general peace as at the time of the treaty at ryswick the dauphin paid them a visit and congratulated them on their prospect they did not however neglect the measures which prudence suggested on the occasian  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    a memorial given to the marquis de torcy from which he may form instructions to the plenipotentiaries of his most christian majesty at utrecht concerning the succession to the crown of england this memorial which is but a copy in nairnes hand begins with setting forth the disadvantages of which a disputed title to the crown had been formerly and will always continue to be to england and then proceeds as follows  december      it would be proper to show the english that the monarchy and the hierarchy having such a close connection and so much dependence the one upon the other the one cannot possibly subsist without the other as might be easily shown by arguments and examples a king must entirely neglect his own interests when he does not protect and maintain the church of england  and in order to remove all their uneasiness on the article of religion it may be shown to them that in the year   0  the king having been informed by men of rank of the church of england that in order to render their religion perfectly secure under a catholic king they wished that his majesty would grant them certain privileges even beyond what the acts of parliament and common law of the kingdom allow them his majesty having examined their demands granted them immediately although they could not deny themselves but by granting them he derogated from the rights and prerogatives of the crown   then follows a copy of the declaration  it appears plainly then to any one who will reflect that it is the interest of the english nation to finish as soon as possible all disputes about the succession of the crown by reestablishing it in the right line and it appears likewise that the catholic religion which is the only thing that can be objected to the king is of no prejudice to them but on the contrary an advantage as his majesty yields to the church of england what no protestant king would yield to them therefore the members of that church will find their account and have their privileges more enlarged and their securities better established under the king being a catholic than if he was a protestant  after proposing in the very words of the sieur lamb that is doctor leslie that the act of settlement should be repealed that every one might be at liberty to declare his sentiments the memorialist proceeds  after the act which exchanged the succession shall be repealed it would be necessary to send over the king to england that he might learn what is necessary for him to know in order to govern his people by instructing himself in the laws and customs of the country and likewise that he might be beforehand with the dutch who might otherwise upon the first news of the death of the reigning princess transport thither the prince of hannover which would infallibly produce a civil war with which they would be very well pleased because they would find their account in it moreover they know that the prince of hannover who has not the best title on his side will stand in need of a foreign support to maintain him and as he cannot find it any where but with them they will by that dependence reassume the direction of all the affairs of england as they did during the government of the prince of orange which will nowise suit either the humors or the interests of the english nation  when the king would be transported to england the best means of securing to him the succession would be to treat him as a sovereign in which it does not appear there would be any inconveniency to the reigning princess who for associating her brother to the royal title will not the less peaceably enjoy all her authority during her own life as it has been seen lately that the kingdom was governed peaceably under the names of william and mary although the first had all the administration and as it was seen formerly that the same kingdom was governed as peaceably under the names of philip and mary although the last alone had the whole administration  nairnes papers d n vol ii fol no    a memorial concerning the dowry of the queen of england and the indemnity of the king of englands subjects given to the marquis de torcy in december      this memorial recites that the late king had made a settlement of  0000 l sterling upon the queen by letters patent under the great seal which was afterward confirmed by acts of parliament which have never been repealed that according to the prerogatives of the queens of england she had appointed her own officers and disposed of her revenues from the date of the settlement that therefore she has an undoubted right to what is due since she left england and that if she could claim it according to the usual forms there is not a court of justice in england but what would decide it in her favor  the memorial mentions in the next place that her pretensions were sustained by the english themselves at the treaty of ryswick and recites the particulars which may be seen in the preceding volume among the papers of that period  a promise so solemn reiterated and confirmed in a manner so positive and so precise and without any condition should not have met with any difficulty in the execution and the more so that the parliament of england made no difficulty of testifying in a very effectual manner their approbation of that promise by furnishing the prince with the means of performing it for in the first session after the peace the commons assembled in parliament granted him a new fund of a hundred thousand pounds sterling of an additional revenue of which they appropriated the half to supply the funds on which the appanage had been assigned and which had been otherwise employed and to show further that it was their intention that the sum should be paid honestly to the queen according to the promise publicly and positively made in the name of the nation without exacting any condition from her majesty they added a clause by which it was declared that those who should be employed to remit the money to the queen in france should not be subject to the penalties of the law which forbade all correspondence with the court of st germains this evidently shows that the pretended condition which was afterward alleged to elude the payment was illfounded and that the parliament never thought of exacting such conditions  the memorial next proposes that at the ensuing treaty of peace the sum of  0000 l should be secured to the queen for life and that all the arrears due since the revolution at least since the treaty of ryswick should be paid it specifies the manner in which this should be done particularly that the queen should be at liberty to nominate any person she chose to receive her money and to grant valid discharges to the government of england without her being obliged to sign any other deed engagement or acknowledgment but a procuration to them to act in her name  this memorial is followed by another demanding a general indemnity for all the english scots and irish who went over to france since the revolution  hannover papers        marlborough endeavoring to overcome his enemies in the cabinet by the splendor of his actions in the field made various but unsuccessful efforts to force the marshall de villars to a battle he however by a sudden exertion surprised the famous lines with which the french had joined the

london in his company mons menager and the famous abbe du bois an intimate correspondence was established between the british and french ministers and preliminary articles to the satisfaction of both were signed on the twentyseventh of september the queen sent the earl of rivers to hannover to assure the elector that the succession of his family to the crown of great britain should be secured in the treaty the earl of oxford and his associates made the same assurances in vain the jealousy of his electoral highness having been raised by the emissaries of the whigs  the lord raby who had been appointed in the preceding march ambassador extraordinary to the states general was created earl of strafford in the beginning of september and in the end of that month was sent back to holland to press the opening of a general congress the privy seal upon the death of the duke of newcastle was delivered into the custody of dr robinson bishop of bristol who was intended to be joined as plenipotentiary to the earl of strafford on the expected congress doctor swift gives the character of both very justly in a few words they were practiced in business but possessed no parts strafford has some life and spirit but is infinitely proud and wholly illiterate his lordships letters indeed furnish no proof of his learning and robinson was a heavy though decent man  an incident in scotland employed the attention of the court of hannover in the present year the duchess of gordon a roman catholic presuming on the temper of the times sent a medal of the pretender to mr robert bennet dean of the faculty of advocates at edinburgh this piece of silver had a legend upon it importing that the kingdom should be restored to the right owner at a meeting of the faculty thanks were voted to her grace and mr robert dundas of arniston returned them in terms sufficiently seditious and bold he thanked her for presenting them with a medal of their sovereign lord the king he hoped that her grace would soon have an opportunity of presenting to the faculty of advocates a second medal struck upon the restoration of the king and royal family and the finishing of rebellion usurpation tyranny and

that it has been resolved to take all possible measures for being in the field early next year for this purpose all the troops must be complete on the   th of march and magazines of forage will be formed on the frontiers but the principal subject of consideration was how to carry on the war in spain with the greatest vigor her majesty on her side makes her utmost efforts she takes  000 more of imperial cavalry into her pay and furnishes   00 recruits for the imperial infantry at the rate of  0 crowns each she is at the expense of transporting them all to catalonia besides an equal number of recruits for the english infantry and five battalions of an augmentation it is expected that these have failed already this is intended as an example to excite the court of vienna and the states general to exert themselves likewise on their side prince eugene at parting gave reason to hope that the emperor would send four battalions to spain if the states would do as much the province of holland has taken a favorable resolution in consequence of this and it is hoped the other provinces will soon follow the example especially as count zinzendorff has since declared his imperial majestys consent to this augmentation these troops will be a powerful succor if they arrive in time and the greatest care will be taken that they shall but the bad news we have lately received from

thanked we have happily overcome them and yesterday morning our batteries began to play i have even every reason to hope for success in so much that in order to profit by it it is proper for us to think early of winter quarters and of the opening of the next campaign it is with this view that i have drawn up a project which i have conveyed in confidence to the ministers in england and holland without having communicated it however to any of our generals here i do myself the honor to send a copy of it to your electoral highness and i humbly entreat you after having well examined it to acquaint me with your sentiments and if you find any thing to be added to it i acknowledge to your electoral highness that i see no other means of procuring a good peace but by pushing the enemy with vigor on this side which cannot be effectuated but by being before them in the field i am with a most respectful attachment etc  robethons original draught ibid no     the elector to the duke of marlborough demands some of his regiments of dragoons and cavalry during the winter  translation my lord sept  th      as it appears that the kings of denmark and of poland cannot possess themselves of any place of strength in pomerania the season being too far advanced it is to be presumed that the troops after having ravaged the enemys country will return to take up their winter quarters in mecklenburg and in other places in the circle of the lower saxony and that his danish majesty will choose to place troops in the country of bremen it is easy to conceive that by that means the slames of war may extend themselves farther into the empire to the great prejudice of the allies and you know besides sir that the situation of my dominions is such that they cannot be safe if the flames of war communicate themselves to the country of bremen  robethons original draught hannover papers vol marked princes no     the elector to the earl of oxford the same subject continued  translation my

season does not permit the princes who are consederated against sweden to possess themselves of any place of strength in pomerania it appears certain that their troops after having committed some ravages will return to take up their winter quarters in different places in the circle of the lower saxony and particularly in mecklenburg and that his danish majesty will choose to place some troops in the country of bremen it is easy to conceive that this may be the means of carrying the war to this side of the elbe from whence it may extend itself farther into the empire to the great prejudice of the allies besides the situation of my dominions is such that they cannot be in safety if the war should communicate itself to the country of bremen  i shall employ all my attentions to divert the court of denmark from forming this project but my lord you are too penetrating not to see that having but very few infantry without any cavalry in my dominions i cannot exert myself with efficacy for the security of this neighborhood and of my own territories and that it is very necessary in order to give weight to the negociations which i design to set on foot with the enemies of sweden and to the proposals which i may make to them that i should have some cavalry and dragoons here next winter as the design i have in view is the common interest of all the allies and as i shall act in perfect concert with the queen i hope her majesty will permit some of the regiments of cavalry and dragoons which i have in her pay to return to my dominions as the regiment of hahn returned last winter and upon the same footing i will owe you my lord a very particular obligation if you will be pleased to employ your influence with the queen in obtaining this favor from her by representing to her that these regiments may be absent from the low countries during the winter without any prejudice to the public and that i can send them back at the opening of the next campaign whereas by neglecting this precaution some events may happen next winter in my neighborhood which will oblige me to recall all the troops which i have in the service of the queen and of the states i wrote on this very subject to the duke of marlborough it is of such importance that i cannot doubt but you will interest yourself in its success i entreat you my lord to be persuaded that i shall retain a grateful sense of this and to allow me for the future to testify on all occasions which may offer the perfect confidence i have in you and the distinguished esteem i have for your merit i am very sincerely etc  original the

had the honor to communicate your electoral highness letter yesterday to the queen at windsor and i wish i were capable of expressing the obliging manner wherewith her majesty spoke of your electoral highness and her readiness to comply with your desires in that way which would most demonstrate her majestys concern for you and your most serene house being well assured that your electoral highness will desire nothing that is inconsistent with the good of the common cause you are pleased to mention in your letter that your highness had wrote to the duke of marlborough upon this subject and the queen thinks it will be best to leave it to be adjusted between your electoral highnesss minister and the duke of marlborough as well for keeping the secret that others may not ask the same as also he being at the head of the army is best able to speak with your electoral highnesss minister upon every thing which relates to this affair to this purpose mr secretary st john has directions to write by this ordinary to my lord marlborough  i should have given your electoral highness frequent troble by my letters but that i was afraid of interrupting your greater affairs and i flatter myself with the

myself the honor of writing to your electoral highness we have been employed in the siege of bouchain in order to secure a post on the other side of the scheld it will be imagined perhaps considering the vigor of the attacks that the siege has continued too long indeed the enemy take every method to hinder us from finishing it and the neighborhood not to say the presence of a superior army always employed in distressing us encouraged the besieged to be obstinate but at length we have found means of surmounting all obstacles and of obliging the garrison to surrender themselves prisoners of war i entreat your electoral highness to accept of my humble felicitations on the success of this enterprise which deserves to be considered as an effect of the blessing of heaven upon the just cause of the high allies since neither the number nor the courage of the enemy was able to frustrate our design we shall be obliged to remain for some time yet in this camp in order to repair the works of the town and put it out of a condition of being insulted but the enemy have taken all the precautions they could in order to deprive us of subsistence having for some days burnt all the forage in the

respects and i consider it with you as the surest means of reducing france to the necessity of concurring in a reasonable peace but i imagine you will allow that secrecy is the life of this project and that it is necessary to avoid with all possible attention to give the enemy any room to perceive it since in that case they will not fail to take the necessary measures for preventing a blow which may be so fatal to them and for forming magazines on their side whatever expense they may cost them i leave you then sir to reflect if by stationing the cavalry on the frontiers you will not discover too clearly to the french what is so necessary to conceal from them it appears to me likewise that my troops though sent to more distant places may by speedy marches arrive time enough at the place where you will judge proper to assemble the army as to the rest i hope that the measures which you will take for the execution of your project will be no obstacle to the return of the few regiments of cavalry and dragoons which the necessity arising from the state of affairs obliges me to demand of the queen for some months it is about the end of autumn or beginning of winter that i shall have principally occasion for them and i reckon that i shall send them back to you in time i refer myself to my preceding letter concerning the reasons which make me desirous of having them soon in my

success as i have not yet received any reply to the answer i gave to the resolution of the counsel of state at the hague relating to the project for the winter quarters whereof i sent you a copy the

a journey to the hague to represent the great advantages that must accrue to the public by the measures we propose besides the papers whereof you have already copies i have furnished his lordship with the like to be enclosed by which you will see the arguments enforced and how inconsiderable the expense of fforage will be with respect to the great advantages we may hope to reap from it i could not enter into the other articles of the expense because they are very uncertain besides that it may reasonably be expectd the great towns who will be eased should contribute toward it as soon as his lordship returns i shall let you know the success of his journey in the mean time i hope lord stair will be with us that there may be no delay on our side enclosed i send you a letter mr bulau has

conjuncture forces me i shall not lose sight of the interests of the common cause you have labored for them in a manner as glorious as useful by the conquest of the important place which you have lately reduced in the face of the enemy it may be affirmed that this siege and the forcing of the lines which opened the way to it have discovered all the qualities of a great general in you in the

you as to the utility of the project which you have formed for taking the field early next year but it appears to me that it will be sufficient for the execution of it to station the english and dutch cavalry in the places on the frontiers where being under the direction of their own generals they may be easily recruited this must have the less difficulty with regard to the english cavalry that they have always had their winter quarters in places in flanders which are not far from those now in question it will be otherwise with my troops which in such quarters will be no longer under the inspection of my generals and will be too distant to receive their recruits with facility whereas when my troops are placed in their usual quarters i shall take particular care that their recruits shall be sent to them early and that the whole corpse shall be in condition to march to the rendezvous as soon as you shall judge proper to assemble the army i hope likewise i shall send back time

to france notwithstanding the great need we have of peace and that the nation is exhausted yet the queen would not act without the concurrence of her allies and therefore your highness will observe that all steps taken here are but provisional though it would have been no difficult matter to have adjusted the interests of the several allys but that the queen was resolved to give none of them any cause of jealousy and to leave each state to make their own demands at the general treaty which the queen proposes to be opned immediately  i did myself the honor to acquaint your electoral highness

the war and in the mean time this nation was exhausted its burdens daily increasing and the ability to bear them decreasing yet in these circumstances your royal highness will see that the queen would not give any ear to a treaty for peace without this preliminary provision that your electoral highness and your familys right to the succession to the crown should be established my lord rivers will give your royal highness an account at large of all that has passed upon the subject from him your electoral highness will know other particulars which will prove her majestys tender care for your interest for when some factious person in scotland had revived the memory of a medal which had been stamped about two years since the queen ordered the persons concerned to be prosecuted and because the lord advocate to whose care it did belong was not very forward in putting the laws in execution upon this occasion the queen has thought fit to remove him and to place sir james stuart in his room

a jealous regard to all things relating to that matter i can with all assurance give your electoral highness the satisfaction of my being a witness that no part of these overtures was so much at the

england i had a discourse with some very great people of this present ministry and who are extreme good servants of your royal highness upon a matter ought to have been thought on before and which i believe will make you easy and show you how false all those malicious stories and inventions made to raise jealousies are grown for you may certainly depend upon it this present ministry are more friends to you to the protestant succession than the last were for these desire that you should succeed to the crown and royalty whereas if the others had been  not forced to divest themselves of the regency they had well nigh calculated to keep in their own hand your succession was to depend so much upon them that the name and title of queen or king might have descended to you or your family but

me and of assuring you of the respect with which i am etc  robethons original draught ibid no     the elector to kreyenberg his resident at london gohre nov  0      we have seen by one of your private letters of the   th of october that the lord treasurer told you that you ought to send to england a procuration for subscribing in the funds of the south sea company the      l sterling which are due to us by a warrant of the late king william and which have been acknowledged as a national debt in the last session of parliament as it does not become us to make this subscription we shall not resolve upon it but in case of necessity preferring in all respects to be paid this debt in cash our intention therefore is that you should make representations to the lord treasurer to obtain this payment assuring him that we shall be very particularly obliged to the queen if her majesty would be pleased to take upon her own account stocks of the south sea company for the sum which is due to us and pay to us that sum as it is very just we should receive it complete after having waited for it so long  if this expedient is not practicable it will be necessary to subscribe to the company and you will find enclosed the procuration which is necessary to authorize you to do so on our account but you are not to use it but a few days before the   th of december the day on which the books are closed since it is likely that before that day the baron de bothmar our plenipotentiary may arrive in london he having orders to go over with the earl of rivers and we wish the baron de bothmar may have time again to make representations to the lord treasurer for obtaining payment of this money you are to prepare the treasurer for this and to ask him if the stocks being only at  0 and it being unjust to give us but  0 l sterling to pay us for  00 they could not give us stock for the  0 per cent remaining which upon the whole sum would be an augmentation of   00 l sterling  we leave the names blank in the procuration in order that if the baron de bothmar judges it more proper to fill it up with his own he may do it if not it must be filled up with ours  robethons draught hannover papers vol marked strafford the princess sophia to the earl of strafford this in an answer to his letter of the   th of october  she disapproves of a peace upon the terms proposed  translation gohre nov         i consider as a continuation of the friendship which you always testified for me that you have been pleased to communicate to me the commission which the queen gave you to treat of a peace in concurrence with the states general it is true that the earl of rivers likewise has had orders to communicate to the elector my son and to me her majestys laudable intentions but he did not enlarge upon the subject as you have been at the trouble to do he has also brought a present to the queens goddaughter as an honorable mark of her favors which are infinitely esteemed i would not however give my parchment for it since it will be an everlasting monument in the archives of hannover and the present of the little princess will go when she is grown up into another family as for the rest i will not combat all the reasons which you produce to make me acquainted with those which the queen has to be dissatisfied with her allies but as her majesty entered into this war for the good of her crown and to hinder france from becoming too powerful and as her majestys arms have been always victorious as my lord rivers last year spoke of nothing but war which the queen was determined to continue with the utmost vigor and as all those things of which you speak were then already past you must not be surprised if so sudden a change creates astonishment especially if a peace is to be concluded upon such terms as are printed in the english gazettes if you had been willing to accept peace on those terms a great deal of blood and a great deal of the money of england and holland might have been saved and no one is ignorant of the state of the emperors finances which indeed england has generously and bountifully supplied as her majesty finds now the burden of this too heavy for her people it is not surprising that she looks out for a remedy which i heartily wish may contibute to her glory and to the good of her kingdoms and of her allies but hitherto it was always believed that the too great power of france would be prejudicial to them all and especially to england but you know this undoubtedly better than i who do not pretend to understand affairs of state with regard to those which are private they will always incline me to be with great esteem for you etc  stuart papers        it is difficult to say whether mrs white was a real or fictitious character mr watson is known

order to prove his zeal as soon as the quarrel is made up with mr jacob smith the king of france and miss dibby jons the princess anne he will send his relation to your cousin sandy hannover to

intend to have any more of the same dealings with them and that a peace is certain the portugal minister said at somerset house in public that the parliament had called his master rogue and rascal but that he was abused in good company meaning the emperor and the dutch the whigs crowd after prince eugene and cabal with him hourly but it can come to nothing the parliament is to go on the barrier treaty that will lay a great scene open the duke of marlborough did not sign it but there is a letter of his that proves that he ordered my lord townsend to sign it they say the two scored articles are that the dutch should have all the conquered towns from cambray to the other side for themselves and that they are to furnish england with  0000 men and  0 ships for the loyalists of england to secure them the parliament will be judges of that design the queen declares they did not let her read it but said it was approved of by the council so she signed it the article relating to portugal is very dishonorable for england they agreeing to have our fleet to attend them on all occasions they thought proper for them this makes a great noise has exposed the whigs more than all their other management and left them without excuse the birthday of the queen the duke of marlborough was in a chair in st jamess park with the curtains drawn the mob that believed it to be the prince eugene huzzad the chair but the duke modestly drew back the curtains and put himself out and with a sign showed his dislike to the salutation the mob finding their mistake and that it was he cried out stop thief which was a thorough mortification to him his daughters that day to show their contempt of the court were in wrappinggowns at a window in st jamess to see the company pass two of them and the other two drove through the pall mall four times in the worst mobdress they could put themselves the duke was in a black suit that day and his soninlaw the duke of montague was at court in a plain coarse red coat with a long shoulderknot in ridicule of the day but the queen had the satisfaction to see the most splendid court that ever was and crowded more than ever by all the church nobility and gentry there was a short uproar my lord marlborough finds his levees much thinner than they were and daily less and less the people are disgusted at him in a little time he will be odious to them how they huzza the duke of ormond who loves popularity too well prince eugene wears the sword the queen gave him ever since the birthday it is worth  000 l he has had his answer from the third day he was here the court wish him gone but my lord oxford does not apprehend any thing from him the whigs since they missed sending him to the tower by their impeachment cannot reach him since the additional lords they say there will be fix more made the whigs cry out at the number that was made to serve a turn and say it destroys one of the three parts of our constitution and made the queen and lords one which ought to be two parts and the commons the third though it is in the power of the crown the trust is betrayed when used to destroy the power of parliaments it cannot be imagined how the votes that reflected on the allies have discouraged the whigs for it has ended all their hopes of having the war continued this news of brasette has been an unlucky stroke for the allies the scottish peers will sit no more they have absented themselves these five days declare the union broke and this of liberty for the churchclergy is directly against the agreement the scots will prove themselves the bribery and to whom the money was given to get it signed there is nobody made master of the horse it is in commission they say till my lord straffords return the duke of somerset is not yet out of the bedchamber the lady catharine hyde is bedchamber lady my lord nottingham continues to work to draw some over to the flying party which he designed to ruin the lord treasurer with but it will not do the dissenters are highly dissatisfied with the statewhigs for betraying them as they call it my lord treasurer declares to them he would have prevented it if he could for certainly he is

discovered and prevented at the time prince eugene came and the duke of marlborough was turned out of all his employments the whigish faction being disappointed in the execution of all their black designs since their being turned out industriously made use of the emperors and hannoverian ministers who were well prepared to break off the treaty to procure the aversion of the vulgar against a peace  the first step made toward it was that the emperors ministers having acquainted baron bothmar and the whigish faction that he was well assured the tory ministry intended to procure a match to be made and a marriage solemnized between the pretenders sister and the king of sweden and that restoring the pretender would be the consequence of such a match and that he is in the bottom of the present negotiation for a peace  this was calculated for a bait to bring over the ignorant part of the commonalty on their side as doctor sacheverels sermon was serviceable for the tories upon which ensued the late change of the ministry and accordingly bothmar was prevailed upon to present the late memorial to the queen who surreptitiously got it printed and published against the sitting of the parliament  but finding it had not the desired effect they were resolved to leave no stone unturned and accordingly pressed prince eugenes coming for england to lay before the queen and parliament his masters mighty proposals viz that england should have all the west indies and a free trade throughout all spain and that  0000 men at his imperial majestys proper charges should be employed wherever the queen should appoint  these high proposals put them in mighty hopes of prevailing with the queen having the house of lords already prepared the majority being whigs but on the contrary the queen and ministry were so averse to it that to balance the lords she made twelve new peers all of a start whereby she has established a majority of the lords as well as of the commons of her side for the peace  but her majesty finding the faction so earnest for the princes coming upon these occasions dispatched a messenger to holland to prevent his coming over who missing him by reason of his having embarked before the messengers arrival and his being detained by contrary winds for several days it was thought necessary in order to weaken his pretensions and discountenance the faction to remove the duke of marlborough from all places of trust which sudden and unexpected change quite broke all their measures  the prince at his landing finding things in this dismal posture and foreseeing his fruitless errand would expose him to a public ridicule concerted with his party to form another plausible scheme of laying before the queen and both houses viz  that his master had formed a new alliance with holland prussia denmark poland the czar of muscovy hannover and the other princes of the empire and all the hans towns for securing the protestant succession and if possible to bring his swedish majesty into the alliance but the ministry look upon all this to be only a design to get the management again into their own hands rather than a sincere intention of performing any better than the last treaty has been executed on the late emperors part and accordingly rejected it  then little eugene thought of another project viz to have the duke of hannovers son brought into england wherein he is like to fail as well as in all the rest  but i must not omit how the party have premeditated and concerted the manner of the reception of this little emissary  first to render him the more popular and his errand the more plausible he was to be met by several thousands on horseback at his landing and conducted with great acclamations and huzzas through the city where great illuminations and ringing of bells was to be made and the mob to cry out no peace no peace and then great and splendid entertainments were to be made by subscription for him all which fine doings were timely prevented by the vigilance of the ministry who were truly apprized of it  prince eugenes nephew is dead of the small pox  here is a flemish that has given articles to the queen my lord keeper lord treasurer and lord president of the council against my lord marlborough what will be proved is not yet known the last paragraph is in the same hand which wrote mrs whites letter the rest of the paper is a copy in an unknown hand   the following curious petition of the generality of ghent is probably meant by the writer in the last paragraph of the preceding paper  a copy communicated to the editor to her majesty the queen of great britain the deputation of the city of ghent in flanders representing the generality of that province cast themselves at your majestys feet and with all respect and submission set forth that the glorious battle of ramillies which was fought by the troops of her high allies against the french had given us hopes of being freed from their tyranny whereas general cadogan whom your majesty was pleased to appoint in the room of mr stepney for the general government and my lord duke persons who tread under foot the glory of your majesty and of all the english nation in that in the year   0  at the taking of the city of ghent they immediately made an agreement with the members of that province promising them their protection and continuance of it notwithstanding they had served the enemy the french which they performed and thereby reaped the benefit of the sweat and blood of the poor provinces of flanders my lord duke having got six thousand pistoles and general cadogan one thousand in specie  after a regulation was forthwith framed for the better direction of the said province signed by the said lord duke and the deputies of the states of holland the  th october   0  but the same being to the prejudice of those persons who were in offices and whose perquisites were thereby somewhat restrained they entreated the said lord duke and cadogan to inhibit the same which was likewise granted them whereby cadogan got for himself  0000 gilders out of the said poor and exhausted province which has been for so many years the feat of war and supplied with bad directors who have made themselves rich as croesus and entirely impoverished the province  the consequence which befell the high allies by those infamous and contributionthirsty thieves the lord duke and cadogan in their causing the aforesaid persons to be continued in their employments namely in the magistracy was that in the year   0  they contrived and accomplished the betraying the towns of ghent and bruges the army of the high allies being thereby brought in the greatest danger of perishing all at once my lord duke and cadogan whether they had a hand in it or not agreed anew with the said persons in offices to procure for them a general pardon which my lord duke promised to obtain by your majesty as it also happened notwithstanding that the said lord duke and cadogan were fully informed and knew themselves the secret correspondence of our governors with the generals and ministers of the enemy as also the persons who contributed thereto and for the said general pardon the first got two hundred thousand gilders and the latter ten thousand pistoles all out of the remainder of the revenues of the said ruined province of flanders  the aforesaid members or governors of the said province have not long since given to the said cadogan the sum of five thousand pistoles upon his promise that they should be continued in their employments which sum he has received at brussels in the house of the sieur vandergote one of the council of state his great friend besides other gentlemen of the said council who are enemies of the high allies and protectors of their enemies and that was done at the time that our convoy was beaten between ghent and courtray in the parish of st eloyvive when instead of furthering the service of the war he preferred his own interest  over and above the several sums which he and my lord duke have otherwise exacted from our poor province we shall allege no other for shortness sake this serving only to observe that they have continued such members in the magistracy of ghent and bruges notwithstanding they had served the french before and had contrived and accomplished the betraying of the said towns only thereby to continue to feed their avarice by extortions from the poor province that those persons might not discover to your majesty and parliament their thieveries  the matter is come to that pitch that her majesty having no opinion of the conduct of those two moneythirsty persons the duke and cadogan they are capable to induce the aforesaid members to give attestations of their good behavior in having reaped no profits from this province but it is hoped that your majesty and the parliament will have no regard to them it being certain that one thief will not willingly discover another that is to say that the said lord duke and cadogan who have procured to the said directors of our province the amnesty concerning the said treachery will easily be induced to excuse those that protected them and to discover the truth of what is above mentioned that her majesty will please to cause an inquiry to be made into the conduct and roguery of those two persons during the war in the netherlands by such members of the new parliament as have been employed under them as officers in her majestys service  we prostrate ourselves at your majestys feet with all humility that your majesty will be pleased to reflect on the premises and consider the miserable condition in which our aforesaid province is involved by this long war and to deliver and free us of the said lord duke and cadogan two professed thieves to our province and the reputation of your majesty and the whole english nation who are pleased to pay their troops and officers so largely with their own money and never permitted that any of their chief officers as these two should enrich themselves so unreasonably with the money of our poor country much less to protect such persons as showed their affection entirely for the french and still correspond with them there is so much of this that all the favors they have showed to the enemy would be sufficient to fill a book the sending of money to sustain the war against us being one of their least favors  we further pray your majesty to send another plenipotentiary to our government with express orders to turn out all such persons in the magistracy who have served the enemy and to put in their room such persons who are fit to serve your majesty and to ease our poor province as for secretary laws like masters like men of whom no good testimony can likewise be given wherefore we pray likewise your majesty to appoint another in his room and in so doing your majesty will find plainly more prosperity in your arms restore the reputation of the nation and further have the blessing of god almighty for having punished the bad for which all superiors are ordained and in case your majesty is not pleased to appoint other ministers in the room of cadogan and laws as also my lord duke who will better promote the glory of your majesty and the reputation of the parliament and english nations who must immediately change the respective magistrates as is usual every year according to the customs and privileges of the country we shall still be governed by and remain under traitors to your majesty and the high allies who were serviceable to the enemy and were put into those employments and have now continued in them for four years together which if not remedied we should be happier to be governed by turks than by that british thief cadogan relying on the protection of your majesty and hoping for the same we remain with the utmost respect etc etc  nairnes papers vol ix  to p    letters from nairne to abram and berry from the   th to the   st february      nairne

latitude to our plenipotentiaries to act on the most advantageous terms they can notwithstanding that treaty the death of the dauphin has put the whigs in fresh hopes that prince eugene has prevailed to get it insisted on that spain and the indies shall be the emperors he cabals daily with the whigs in a very indecent manner the great project is to have the prince of hannover here to nose the queen at least but their aims are further the dutch hannover and emperors ministers here are laying a scheme for it and have carried it so far that the command of the army this summer is not offered to the prince of hannover as was intended the duke of ormond commands in flanders and is fitting up his equipage the vote of the lords which they got by surprise the house being thin and the scotch lords retiring to make themselves considerable the whigs carried it and addressed with a detestation to the articles from france though they did not come judiciously before them it was only to encourage the dutch and emperor and portugal to insist on great demands but had no weight here the house of commons being zealous for the good of the kingdom outbalances all their tricks and the ministry treat sure and gain ground daily the scheme is only to expose and discourage and undeceive the kingdom their punishment will be left till the peace is finished it is my lord of oxfords politics to smooth and check and would not have removed the duke of marlborough if it had not been absolutely necessary the hannover minister is highly displeased at an accident that has happened his letters he sent by a servant betwixt    and    to the general post house at  he was robbed of his letters and what little he had about him the  will have it our minister laid the design to come by his letters it was not amiss to find what he and prince eugene have been contriving with the whigs he has had his answer from the first of his coming and has been told by a side wind that the court is not satisfied with his stay since he is so close in cabals with the dissatisfied lords he told him that said this to him that he knew that but he should do what was convenient to his interest if he stays much longer he will be sent away contrary to the queens first resolution his nephew is taken ill of the small pox so that gives a fresh pretense the whigs have so contrived it that it will be moved at the congress to remove the prince that is in france by the instigation of the whigs this is moved here by prince eugene in the emperors name and that all the allies shall be guarantees for the succession of hannover but it is believed our plenipotentiaries have instructions not to have any such guarantees which would limit the people of england for hereafter in case of necessity they must ask all the allies leave to choose a king and my lord chief justice has declared it treason in those that signed the barrier treaty on that account all the people in the country have got the book which i hope you have called the conduct of the late ministry and the allies and another the obligations that the dutch have to us they are two books worth reading they have set us in a right light and have so exasperated all the counties of england against the late ministry and our allies that they are in some counties ready to address the queen to punish those that acted in all their vile practices and now the barrier treaty itself with remarks on it is published written by the same hand which is a very good one they are approved and directed by my lord oxford the whigs answer them but in that railing evading manner that has no force  my lord marlborough is very humble visits every creature that has any credit to general webb he sent to know when he would be at home he would visit him he sent him word he never would be at home to him that he had done him all the injustice he could when he was in power and that now he would do him all the justice he could which he thought he deserved and my lord wharton told my lord treasurer that he played well at whist what he could not make by tricks he made up by knaves the treasurer answered him that they believed the game up before he took the cards and had made tricks out of all the knaves let who would hold them but he observed their game and should be sorry to be thought a bungler the house of commons are resolved to throw walpole out of the house again he was chosen again but now they have lodged a petition against him the hannover resident took the liberty to threaten some of the leading members with his masters resentment if they pretended to meddle with the barrier treaty but did not deter them but as a jest it is said the same members caused his servant to be robbed of his letters to see what he had writ of them all here believe the peace certain we have strange stories sent from france of the duke of orleans being taken in the very act of incest with his daughter the duchess of berry when he had made her and the lady the duke de berry had a design of drunk whilst one debauched her the other abused his own daughter and that the dauphin was poisoned these stories are common they were first told by madam malous the niece of the late lord feversham who lives at somerset house where prince eugene is every night at least three times a week she pretends to have letters of it from france there all the foreign ministers are two or three times a week baron bothmar the hannover envoy daily shows his dislike to my lord of oxford and does his master great prejudice by it and has turned the court

the truth of the following anecdotes is in some degree ascertained by collateral proofs the marquis de torcy in his memoirs mentions them with corroborating circumstances and he was not a writer that advanced facts upon mere surmises being a man of integrity intelligence and abilities the stuart papers of the present year are full of anecdotes of the same kind and the ministry by the precautions they took seemed to have been convinced that dangerous conspiracies were formed there can scarce a doubt be entertained that marlborough prince eugene and the baron de bothmar talked concerning violent measures though perhaps the circumstances are exaggerated the ruffians called the mohocks  cartes memorandum book  vo anecdotes concerning the duke of marlborough the peace and the designs of

debates about the peace in opposition to it m de torcy acquainted lord oxford that after the duke of marlborough had hindered the peace of   0  when it should have been made he had treated with the french court to make them one and was to have two millions of crowns for it this would have been done but for m chamillard a weak minister who during the siege of lisle came to valenciennes sent the duke of marlborough word that he expected he would raise the siege of lisle as a proof of his sincerity in the peace they had treated and settled the duke of marlborough was angry and wrote to the duke of berwick that there was an end of the affair and he would have nothing more to do with the treaty  when m de torcy discovered this the king of france allowed lord oxford to make use of it to send the duke of marlborough abroad but insisted that his life should not be touched and so it was they had a meeting at thomas harleys house in james street westminster oxford coming to the street door in his coach the duke of marlborough in a chair to the garden door opening into the park it was then resolved that the duke of marlborough should go abroad prince eugene and lord wharton both said on the occasion that the duke of marlborough had not a clear conscience or he would not have submitted to that step  several measures were proposed to oppose the peace and several schemes sent to vienna some for seizing the queen others for seizing the ministry and one for assassinating oxford and bolingbroke in their chairs prince eugene wrote about this last to count zinzendorff then at the hague who wrote in answer that such measures were extremely hazardous and scarce to be undertaken but if this was resolved on he advised prince eugene to come over to holland before it was executed  among other schemes one was for the duke of marlborough by his power as general to assemble   or  000 men at an hour in different squares of westminster and to seize st jamess this was discovered and lord oxford sent to mr lewis to come immediately to the office that morning his presence being necessary by ten oclock when he came he found the lord chancellor and all the lords of council there the business was to supersede the duke of marlboroughs commission as general under the broad seal there had been before an order under the privy seal sent him not to act more as general but his commission being under the great seal could not be superseded but by a revocation under the great seal when this was done the duke of marlborough would not act so against law as to rendezvous the men he was not made for hazards  he said the duke of marlboroughs quitting the opposition to the peace had ruined his credit at hannover and at the hague king george was resolved to make no alteration in ministry but  0000 l given to bothmar at the hope caused the duke of marlboroughs apology to to be accepted and all queen annes ministers to be turned out erasinus lewis was under secretary to the earl of oxford he is often mentioned by doctor swift in his letters swift charges prince eugene with the designs mentioned in the two last articles history of the four last years of queen anne p    of vol xvi  but bishop burnet history of his own times vol iv and the whig writers speak of him in a very different manner  the marquis de torcy relates in his memoirs that he had his masters orders to offer four millions of livres to the duke of marlborough at the hague in   0  if he employed his interest in contributing to a peace vol i p      his majestys words are i dont in the least question but you avail yourself of the opportunities you have of seeing the duke of marlborough to let him know that i have been informed of the steps he has taken to hinder the progress of the conferences of peace and even to break them off entirely that i had been the more surprised thereat as i had reason to believe from the assurances he had already given that he was willing to contribute to this end that i should be glad his conduct was such as to deserve the reward i have promised him and in order that you may be able to come to a clearer explication i am willing you should give him a positive assurance that i will  in short i am willing you should offer the duke of marlborough four millions should he enable me to keep naples and sicily for the king my grandson and to preserve dunkirk with its fortifications and harbor and strasburg and landau in the manner above explained or even the same sum were sicily to be excepted out of this last article ibid p       de torcy does not tell what answer the duke of marlborough made to these offers  at the same time news came that the duchess of marlborough first lady of the bedchamber to the queen of england was disgraced the duke of marlborough himself gave notice of it to his nephew the duke of berwick ibid vol ii p         a letter signed charles johnson and addressed to charles adams but indorsed by sir william ellis mr ken

matters the occasionalbill whatever misery might be intended by it has not yet raised any stir nor gives the least appearance of doing so prince eugene besides his feasting from house to house has proposed very little business and if he thinks fit to stay a month longer in the same way will be as little mentioned as any ensign in his army our court keeps still its disposition for peace in which it is backed by the house of commons but the tory majority in the lords house is but small and by the absence of some of them they are now and then trapped in an odd vote in a little time we shall see

sanderson by him till further orders  mr menzies so often exhibited under the feigned name of abram is the scotch gentleman mentioned by monsieur menager in the account of his secret negociations in england  menager having signed the preliminary articles of a separate treaty between france and britain employed the time he staid afterward in london in attempting according to his instructions to render some service to the court of st germains and introduced the subject in a conversation with mr st john they foresaw that the king of france would be obliged in the ensuing treaty not so much to abandon the chevalier as to acknowledge the succession of the crown in the house of hannover as it was mentioned in the second preliminary minute of monsicur menagers negotiation   menager proposed that a secret article should be made by the queen to disengage the king from all the obligations of such agreements upon such subsequent occasions as might happen and a declaration from her majesty that all the engagements the king should enter into in the treaty of peace should be so understood by the queen st john was afraid the queen would not sign such a declaration but he thought she would declare by word of mouth that she would be satisfied to understand the treaty in such a manner and that whenever she disengaged the king from it the obligation on him as to the recognition of the succession should cease bolingbroke mentioned this proposal to the queen and with her consent introduced menager to mrs masham that he might learn her majestys intentions from that lady as he himself did not choose to meddle further in the affair  two points were agreed upon between menager and mrs masham first that for the satisfaction of the people at home and the allies abroad the king should be required in the queens name to abandon her brother and his interest on pretense of adhering to the succession as it was now established   d that nevertheless this seeming to abandon the said interest was to be so understood that the king should not be obliged in case of her majestys decease not to use his endeavors for the placing the said prince on his fathers throne to which he had an undoubted right ibid p       mrs masham told him that it was the present unhappiness of the queen to possess the throne of her brother which she had no other claim to than what the political measures of the state had made legal and in a sort necessary which however she believed gave her majesty oftentimes secret uneasiness that this was not all the misfortune but that by the same necessity of state she was obliged not only against her disposition but even against her principles to further and promote the continuance of the usurpation not only beyond her own life but for ever that i might be sure under such circumstances it would be an inexpressible satisfaction to her majesty to see herself delivered from the fatal necessity of doing so much wrong and if it could be possible with safety to the religion and liberties of her subjects to have her brother restored to his right at least after her decease if it could not be done before  that it was true the queen did not see through this and it seemed next to impossible the rage and irreconcilable aversion of the greatest part of the common people to her brother being grown to such a height nay she said the queen found it would be impossible to enter upon any treaty of peace or so much as to let the people hear of putting an end to the war without entering into the strongest engagements possible for the confirming the succession in the house of hannover a thing that i am sure says she is all our aversions and we have no retreat but to his most christian majesty in hopes of his ordering things so at this treaty that he may be at liberty to support and assist in the work whenever an opportunity should present itself that to this end the plenipotentiaries from hence though there was no communicating any thing to them by way of confidence should be instructed not to insist upon things more than necessity obliged and some reserves sure says she may be made to leave room for justice to take place in time to come minute of monsieur menagers negotiation p       menager upon his arrival at utrecht where he acted as one of the plenipotentiaries from france found that the british ministers had not received the private instructions which lady masham gave him reason to expect would be sent to them and he afterward discovered that the agents of the court of st germains had made the concerns of the chevalier the subject of a private negotiation with the ministry in england these agents were obliged at last to write to the king of france in plain terms that the ministry in england were men of no honor that they had held them in suspense for a long time and that now they not only did not come to the point with them but declined any conversation on the subject only said in general that a certain person would be sent over to utrecht who should discourse by word of mouth freely and should settle that affair so as should be agreeable to all parties minute of monsieur menagers negotiation p  0    lady masham in a letter to menager dated st jamess march        says i take it for granted that they the court of st germains are fallen into the hands of my lord treasurer he loves a secret and is famous for making intricacies where there is a sterility of intrigues and no less renowned for causing every thing of such a nature to miscarry if their assurances are from him i doubt not he values himself upon having deceived them and if the person to be sent to utrecht comes from him i dare promise you that when he comes there he wants his instructions ibid p   0   menager who hated all the agents of the court of st germains and was equally hated by them says that all this was owing to the impatience and jealousy of the court of st germains who though the king had agents of his own in london who perhaps did their utmost yet they at st germains being uneasy could not refrain sending a secret embassy themselves this it seems was a scotchman who pretended great interest with a scotch lord who was an officer of state in england but either the messenger failed in the interest he pretended to have or the scotch nobleman failed in what he promised to do for him seeing the sum of his negotiation was briefly this that after a long stay he performed only there two notable exploits viz first that he spent a great deal of their money and secondly that he ruined and exposed the business which he was entrusted with and at last came away with nothing but an empty promise from the said scotch lord that a person should be sent over to negociate that matter with the french and british ministers together ibid p       menager had strong prejudices against the earl of middleton he gives the postscript of a letter he wrote to lady masham a scotchman from st germains and a scotchman in your court have been the agents to deceive one another and to abuse their masters as to the inquiring who the secret has remained with they confess now at st germains that it has really remained with no body for so ill a choice did they make of their agent that he has not only exposed his errand but his employer and our people in london are very free to send word hither how ill he has acquitted himself though by the way i must observe that this was not done till after they had been amused with the persuasions of this person to believe things were in a good train when they were indeed in hands who intended nothing less than to perform what was proposed minute of monsieur menagers negotiation p       menagers account of this negotiation appeared so extraordinary that it has hitherto met with little credit from the public but it will be found to coincide with what relates to menzies under the borrowed name of abram in nairnes letters and with the account which the well known john plunket gives of his own intrigues he acknowledges that he allowed himself to be amused with promises by the earl of oxford  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no        april      a good friend

you see demanded by england will not be insisted on by the parliament in relation to his leaving that country if the king of france is firm in desiring the kings stay for although harley is as i have always told you a whig and an enemy to the king the parliament would be friends if they could find a way to show it but he cramps all and makes each man afraid to appear inclined to the interest their inclinations would lead them to all wellinclined are enraged at harleys proceedings and that part of the commons they call the october club of forty he screens i mean mr harley that not any of the first nobility can get an audience but with the utmost difficulty so that he will govern this affair i mean the peace and certainly intends to make up with hannover although at present they differ but after all hannovers attempts have failed he will be glad to make up with harley but the best part of the gentry and half the nobility are resolved to have the king the parliament would do it in a year

her or rather a pension equivalent to it her design is to make use of your assistance in the receiving of it but that matter not being yet settled she is not willing to have it publicly spoke of or to say any thing further relating to it than to consult about a form for a letter of attorney or power to authorize you thereunto  the difficulty consists in this how to avoid owning the government in what she signs herself and yet not to offend it so that to compass these two points and yet make the instrument valid is the matter you are desired to advise with some judicious council about  should the queen style herself queen mother she supposes that will not be allowed should she style herself queendowager that would be a lessening of herself and a prejudice to the king her son which she will never do  the question is therefore whether the instrument may not be good without any title at all only the word we for in as much as it will be signed maria r and sealed with her seal one would think the person would be sufficiently denoted but if that be not sufficient then whether any other expression can be invented to the intent mentioned  our council here think she might style herself

this to be the greatest secret you will guess at the reason of it  the king of france is sure in the wrong not to grant us every reasonable thing since it is resolved to make a separate peace the whigs sure must have used art to bring them to refuse us good terms which would justify our leaving the others to treat for themselves  all the practices i have sent you word of will be laid before

you so could my letters get to you which i hope they have long before this and that mr massy lord middleton has had mine in answer to his last i wish you all happiness in your new employment though the occasion of it was dismal to all and you cannot imagine how generally she is lamented even by those that have ever been enemies to her family i and mine have shared so in your loss that we thought our sorrows could have no addition when we heard your chevalier was recovered but now we find our mistake for since we had yours to my daughter jeany it is said at court he is despaired of and on the exchange that he is dead that he eat too much meat and got a cold with going out too soon if this be true all honest people will think no more of this world for sure never was mortals so unfortunate as we you may guess at our condition which by the worst of natures would be pitied your doctor gave us hopes last night there was no good grounds for such reports but whom to believe or what to think our concern is too great to know but every moment we are either going or sending to inquire for comfort but find none yet pray heaven this day gives us some for the wind is fairer for it i beg you will make my condoling compliment for to write it myself to your only mistress is tormenting her now but pray assure her i grieve for her loss and the sense i am sure she has of it to a degree not to be expressed but felt with true affection and duty and to yourself and partner all love and faithful service from bob and me who begs he may be remembered when you make my compliments for he is more concerned than ever i saw him  this is to acknowledge the receipt of two of your letters i would have writ last post for my mother but she was so well she would write herself i do not question but you must guess at the concern my sisters etc were in when we received the news of your loss upon my word i was stupefied with it and cannot still help being anxious about the brothers health notwithstanding your assurances of his recovery for we have so many cruel reports about him that it is enough to make one distracted pray assure his afflicted mother of my most humble duty god in heaven send her comfort for she wants it nothing but her goodness could resist such a stroke we are all well and entirely yours my sister desires you would make her compliments as she is entirely

hectical disposition we hope he will remove for some time into a milder air and warmer climate you will excuse this osficious impertinence but i do not say this as the opinion of only one physician the whole college mr lilly downs etc are most heartily yours and think themselves infinitely obliged to you for your constant remembrance of them and your frequent accounts of late which honest mr rye edwards has not failed to communicate to us in concerns which touch us so very sensibly that public affairs have lost their taste nor indeed if i was so disposed is there much to say a peace is no ways doubted to be well advanced but whether the negociations at utrecht contribute much to it is more than i can say the house of commons is summoned with great solemnity to meet the first of may our style and it is the general expectation to have a sketch of the peace then laid before them  i know not but it may be my lot to go to holland in a little time and if so i am sure it will be my

takes true pains for it and this is doing him justice all your friends and correspondents may do that piece of right to own it is he of all the scots has the best interest with q anne and e oxford and also he is believed by the english as a good and great lawyer and a man of much goodness and honor if he was not my kinsman and dear friend i would say much more but that i can justify his being a

safest way to bring you to your own and that you are not to stay long in any settled place till then only tour about till your debts are near paid and the parting word between e m and me when he went

william elliss it is indorsed by him not dated but supposed to be written before he left london negociations for the pretenders service at the peace of utrecht  sir one mr rogers plunket being desirous of an accommodation between mr jenkins the king and his sister in hopes to reconcile them so far as that she might let him enjoy his pretensions descended to him by birthright labored to compass to good a work and in order thereunto he provided as follows  first by founding mr simson and his associates for several months together not perceiving in them a real disposition for an agreement with mr maine king of france with an inclination to do justice to mr jenkins the king with safety to themselves but the current running too strong against them for such an attempt at that time they resolved to take a year or twos time to stem it though they knew it would redound to the prejudice of the sister and all her tenants the said rogers plunket conceiving they wanted but a plausible handle to justify such proceedings resolved to procure them one if possible  accordingly being intimate as well with mr goodman as with all those that were entrusted by him he became master of all their secrets and of the methods that were taken to prevent the sister from entering into any accommodation with mr maine king of france in order to do mr jenkins the king justice and produced the vouchers from time to time to mr simson whereof he got as many as were sufficient to justify the sisters p anne making a separate agreement with mr maine king of france upon which she took courage and made a firm resolution to treat with him at all hazards whereupon rogers plunket was pitched upon as an indifferent man to deliver a message to mr maine the king of france to that purpose but upon second thoughts he being found more useful and capable of rendering further service here mr simson sent another that was a creature of his own but in the meantime mr maine the king of france sent hither one mr ciprian in order to try the sister princess anne and mr simsons pulses which mr rogers plunket communicated to mr simson wherewith he seemed to be wellpleased whereby a true understanding was settled between them which has been the foundation of the present agreement between them  mr williamss master prince eugenes having a dark notion of the matters and conceiving them to be much to his detriment came hither by the instigation of the wylens whigs in order to frustate and render all abortive cost what it would wherein he was so desperate as to form a design of laying violent hands on the sister rather than he should be disappointed of his ends but mr rogers plunket being vigilant upon this occasion found means to discover all his intrigues and accordingly communicated the same from time to time to mr simson and his associates which put the sister princess anne upon a resolution of closing immediately with mr maine the king of france and keeping a good correspondence with him for the future in order to do mr jenkins the king justice upon occasion whereby it is in mr maines king of frances power to give the rest of his adversaries what terms he pleases about which we shall not dispute much with him  mr rogers plunket desires you would be pleased to meet him at rotterdam where mrs white directs her letters for he has orders from mr harris

happiness to impart to you something that might be useful for mr jenkins the king to know at present a post or two before i left london i sent you the general heads of them that you might judge whether your coming hither might be requisite or not  if mr jenkins the king or mr jacob the king of france thinks well of it i will consign the papers and vouchers to one of those gentlemen at utrecht but i must have a letter or some token or other to introduce me to them i shall call for an answer at mr hackets house and forbear going to utrecht till then being in the meantime with due

am now come hither to render him still further service i have papers which will be of great advantage to you when you have them in your hands it is in your masters power to give laws to his enemies it is of the utmost consequence to you to send here a man of abilities i shall put into his hands the papers which i have along with me and communicate to him my thoughts concerning them i am come to

introduce me to your friends at utrecht and i shall communicate to them my sentiments and my papers the affair is too delicate and of too much consequence to lose more time embrace the opportunity and

affair i am come hither to do him service his immediate reestablishment depends much on my good success here and when mr jacob the king of france knows the sentiments of those gentlemen that sent me he will think himself in a condition to give what terms he thinks fit to his antagonists and establish his affairs for the future but as those things cannot be so well done by writing as by word of mouth it is fitting mr jacob the king of france should send one along with you to meet me at rotterdam at your friend mr hackets or if that should not be found the best way let me have a letter to those gentlemen at utrecht and i will discourse them at large especially of mr williams prince eugenes negociations at london that letter i sent you this post is his he sent it hither the   th of february last it had great influence on mr simson and the rest of his companions and will make them firm to mr jacobs the king of france interest for the future  i am heartily sorry for the death of mr jenkinss the kings sister the loss of her at this time of day is inconceivable however if mr jenkinss the kings affairs is rightly managed he stands fair to be restored to his right it is not proper i should go in person to mr jenkins the king or jacobs the king of france because i am under direction and my presence here is much more useful to them as they shall be made sensible in due time  young mr sheridan is arrived here lately from london i gave him last winter some papers to keep he has them still i suppose in his custody pray lay an injunction upon him to keep them safe for they will be of great use to mr jenkins the king and mr jacobs the king of france hereafter having no more to add but that i am with due respect  your humble servant and true friend rogers plunket i am extremely glad to hear mr jenkins the king is in a fair way of recovery    nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no   mrs white to mr watson this letter is decyphered by sir william ellis the measures taken to restore the pretender  sir may         your last letter has given me a great deal of concern because i do believe it had been of great consequence to the cause in chancery that you should have settled the accounts with mr rogers he could have told you what the best counselors had said to him upon his laying the merits of the cause before them mr tom west lord mulgrave who is a friend to mr jenkins the king told mr roger plunket that what he had informed him of would do mrs bess smith england the greatest service that had been done her ever since the suit began which has been these twenty odd years and mrs bess smith england has very nobly rewarded him for that service for it has discovered covered mr sandyss hannovers practices and laid them open which would have ruined mrs dibby princess anne who abhors him now mr rogers plunket did believe that young man mr sheridan was sent by mr peregrine ferguson to mr jenkins the king because mr peregrine ferguson did acquaint mr tom west l mul of mr rogerss business unknown to mr rogers for he had taken measures to have it laid before the friends in mr medlicots family the parliament and the pleading first council cab coun both at a time when he found mr hans harley concealed all from them but when mr peregrine ferguson had taken that way rogers was satisfied though he was not privy to the doing it for it had the end he wished and in a little time it will be laid before mr medlicote himself the parliament though he is very tender in openly exposing mr sandys hannover because of the tenants love to him yet but all the others that are injointly with him will be openly exposed which will justify mrs bess smith england acting apart from them a greater service could not be done to mr st john the king than this has been mr tom west lord m has been informed that mr wealy of the country of mr peregrine the scots whigs has sent to mr sandys hannover to assist him against mr carres church of england and desired him to come to them therefore now mr carres has no better way than by mr jenkins the king to do himself justice and that is what he is resolved on but the many difficulties he must go through is what they are laboring under because of the jointure mrs dian johns princess anne has upon the estate and after her death it will be too late because of the entail that will then take place mr peregrine would have had mr rogers to have let him have managed it to have a friend of his to have come to him to settle the accounts and said mr james staff mr stafford would he believed come himself to settle the accounts with mr rogers plunket but he having given mrs white direction to write to you he would not alter that so that he will be disappointed extremely because for many reasons he cannot do it by writing at a distance besides you may guess how impossible it is to direct you by writing all the particulars of what he would let you understand for he knows a great deal of the affairs of the entailed estate he said he did not acquaint the young man mr sheridan of any thing not believing him a proper person but mr peregrine having done that to mr tom west lord mulgrave he believed by the young mans going of a sudden then away he had sent him but mr rogers has no patron cut paper and cannot get the work done any other way effectually so you will not have the work i fear he is what i told you expecting mr sam hamey sir william ellis he will write to him mrs white gave him a direction how to write he poor man is in danger in that ill air considering his weakly constitution so he will stay as little a time as he can but he has much to do being fully apprized of his business from the first hands i believe there could be nothing of greater use in the cause than your sending this account with him but since that you say cannot be done pray write to him and let him know the reason and tell him how you think it ought to be done direct for mr rogers as you send mrs whites to be delivered to him by mr hacket so you and he must do it the best way you can the term is now and it will be a great damage to those you value most not to know how to instruct the counsel your friend mr matthews tells me that he has writ to you he is now in mr medlecots family scotch parliament and that more than half of those children wish us well as he does the prosperity of your cousin st john the king but they were deceived in this last affair in relation to mr jenkins the king by mr hans mr harley and hate him heartily for it but you know they must take no notice of it but are resolved to make what reparation they can and as soon as they can do it mr peregrine is ordered to receive  00 l for laying the business of mr rogers before the lawyers cabinet council mr tom west duke of buckingham has got it done on that account by mrs debbys princess annes directions i have not seen him a great while he and i being long sick  nairnes papers vol ix  to p     letters from nairne to

seeing armsworth marlborough that he take measures to avoid giving jealousy to baker harley and young princess anne that we were endeavoring to profit of his advice as to the quit rents the queens jointure though it was feared wisely the queen must be content to take what the creditors will give and in their own way and that maning having measures to keep would not press too much on that point for fear of displeasing that goodall the king and wisely the queen were well that nothing was said as yet to goodall as to his journey when or where  nairne to berry  may     i told him the king was perfectly recovered and was riding out daily about ogles unwillingness to meddle that the case of the additional quit rents was fairly laid before maning that the place and time of the kings departure was not fixed yet that maning was close and reserved with him upon all his transactions with young princess anne desired him to communicate what he could learn of these matters that plessingtons the kings too great distance might prove very prejudicial to him in case young princess anne should die in that interval because hannover would in that case be certainly before him and that it was bakers harleys true interest to prevent this and to manage matters so that he might not be sent too far off that lorraine would be more convenient and more liked than switzerland  nairne to abram  may     to answer his to my lord of the  d of may concerning paterson sir hugh paterson of bannockburn he is desired to represent to paterson how dangerous it would be for the king to be removed too far off because being at a distance it would be out of his power to prevent hannover upon any sudden accident in which case hanover getting the start of him with the help of holland and the whigs it would be morally impossible for the kings friends to do any thing for him after that that it was harleys interest to look to this that he might assure paterson of the kings discretion and secrecy in any thing he told him in confidence that it would be dangerous speaking to calliford about the queens jointure which must be left to harley to secure in his way the jacobites to be advised to go along with him

expect from london every post that comes in which you shall have as they come to hand but i am afraid they will not give you that light into the matters as i could give you by word of mouth as for the gentlemen at utrecht i shall not trouble my head much about them if mr jacob the king of france and his substitutes dont think it worth while to be fully apprised of the services that have been done for him this year and three quarters past i dont know why he should be courted to it he may thank mr jenkins the king or he should not have found matters go so well to his mind as they do for i can tell you from the very mouth of the greatest one at the helm in england that they would not dare close with mr jacobs king of france without those papers nor could mr jenkinss sister princess anne be brought to any thing if she had not them laid before her and have we been daily keeping up their sinking courage and drooping and wavering spirits and told me that they had nothing else that could bear water but the papers which i have been procuring for them all this while with the hazard not only of my own but other gentlemens lives besides other expenses i have been at it is true at present and especially here i am handsomely allowed in the last letters i had from london that i gave them greater light into affairs than they have had yet and were pleased to return me hearty thanks for it but i cannot do that service i would or should for mr jenkins the king or jacob the king of france if i have not the assistance of some body to communicate from time to time what passes between me and those of the opposite party  i am courted much to go to vienna in order to lay before the emperor what i know of affairs relating to his interest but as my instructions confines me to this country i gave a plausible excuse which will i hope satisfy those that made me the proposal being in haste i remain your affectionate friend and servant  rogers  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to the blotted scroll of a letter from prince eugene probably to count zinzendorff mentioned in the preceding to mr watson he gives an account of his intrigues in england  translation london february   th      i dont imagine i shall be able to leave london as soon as i proposed the whigs continue always to sow the feeds of division by forming new projects for destroying entirely if possible the party now in power and they flatter themselves much to accomplish this the more easily that the treasurer who is at the head of it is universally hated that is to say by both parties consequently no one will regret him it is for this reason they urge me to stay for some time longer in order to see what their projects will come to i showed them again that they would have the same success with the former and that my stay would be of no advantage to them as my presence serves only to four the minds of the ministry and in order to disengage myself the more from them i communicated to them the sentiments of the grand pensionary upon the clause which i sent to you in my dispatches of the   th and   th of january they answered me abruptly and among the rest the duke of marlborough that the grand pensionary had changed his sentiments very soon since he began to be apprehensive of disobliging a handful of factious members in the house of commons and to be afraid of a ministry who are pensioners of france and consequently enemies to the common cause and will continue so as long as they subsist it seems to me that the states have already forgot that they formerly resisted france and england at once and if i am not mistaken they will find themselves soon in the same necessity yes says baron bothmar of sending thither the prince of hannover as they sent the prince of orange to deliver the nation and to prevent the ruin of the common cause  they urged me instantly to send you the following particulars to be added to those which i sent you in my dispatches of    and    of january and to make up a memorial of them to be printed there first as it might then be printed here without any suspicion  the queen of england upon her accession to the crown declared the following particulars  that trade being the support of the nation and she having religion so much at heart had made no difficulty of engaging in this war though the nation was then in debt being well convinced that she could not be secure upon the throne while spain was in the possession of the house of bourbon and she had engaged herself deeper in this war than she had at first proposed to the great detriment of her kingdoms  but the measures of the present ministry sufficiently show that they were not hearty in the cause from the beginning and that the most discerning see very well that every thing tends to a separate peace and to pave the way more easily for her brother i told them that appeared very probable but that the pensionary would start the same objections as baron bothmar did not think proper to undertake such a delicate affair without communicating it to his master and that it is now too late to produce any great effect as the people in england were already biassed by the resolutions of the house of commons but the junto made the following answer by this method of proceeding we shall never succeed for you made the same objection to the loans which we had proposed from the bank and from rich merchants by engaging the revenue of the kingdom of hungary and other hereditary dominions and by that means the emperor would find himself in a condition jointly with the states general of besieging a town and at the same time taking the field by which of consequence he would put an end to the cessation of arms and infallibly break up the conferences at utrecht and dispose the people to believe all the projects that might be formed i imagine we have still time enough to insert this in the memorial  i answered them that we were foolishly employed in building the tower of babel for there are not three among you or us of the same sentiment sometimes you would choose to have the prince of hannover and sometimes you would not and i see that the greatest number of you are for an aristocracy and what vexes me most is that you have obliged the emperor to make demands from the greatest part of which he will be obliged to desist  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no     the original is in

desired not to stir from hence till orders from mr han harley and if i can send over the fellow and not to appear in that matter myself for weighty reasons which i shall know hereafter the english of this i take to be that they are for having that man over in order to stop his mouth or lay him aside so that he can do no service to mr jenkins the king by the last letter i am desired to tell my friend the resident for the emperor that the english court is willing to make up the breaches and keep a good correspondence for the future provided they come into the present ministrys measures this i communicated to the said resident this morning who seemed well pleased with it how far this will be conducive to mr jenkins the kings interest or mr jacobs king of frances affairs i leave you to judge we shall now think of the properest method to bring this thing to bear if mr jacobs the king of frances manager thinks this accommodation will affect his masters interest let him speak to me in time i believe it will do good to mr jenkins the king seeing die emperor seems satisfied as things stand now he should have his own but if he thinks this accommodation will in the least prejudice him it shall go no further i had no more papers come i sent again this post for them i am etc  i shall not send the fellow to london but rather dispose him to come into our interest and by this means keep harris harley in awe and make him more pliable for he knows none can do him more harm at present than i these two points ought to be reserved for hands of higher reach than mine therefore i should

assure him of secrecy and that the king would have no dealing with mildmay but would trust to christopher princess anne and honiton harley i told freemans son would not only go with the king but also be put in his fathers place and that throp probably some protestant clergyman would also go and have the kings leave to exercise his calling and that not one of cowleys family protestants would be left behind  nairne to berry  june    i repeated the danger of the kings being at too great a distance in case of accident bid him send a fair draught of the power of attorney with all the amendments proposed by his lawyer and himself with a sheet or two of stamped paper told him he should have directions how to write when the king parted  nairne to abram  june     to enclose a letter from my lord

sheet  the earl of middleton to mrs watson  june    this is to tell you that i writ by the last post and that the enclosed is for the doctor with a new key that the old one may not be discovered persuade him to take it if he thinks it may be useful it is all written in a hand he has seen before that he be sure nobody else knows any thing of it and that he may assure his friends but especially honyton harley that it is no pennypost letter from williamson the whigs if he thinks it useless or dangerous to meddle with it i have nothing to say but shall still have the satisfaction of doing my duty for my well discerning friends   nairne to hacket  june     i writ to hacket to recommend the letter to abram in which was my lords for mrs watson with the little cipher hereunder and the following paper and i sent him at the same time the name of waterson being an address for bishop giff  s letters to dr singleton which i bid him forward to me  cipher or key of the following paper richard is the king thomas is princess anne lawyers is the ministry troops is the parliament tartars is the whigs janisaries is tories crassus is hannover croesus is marlborough pedlars is hollanders letter of attorney is treaty sir roger is london jones is canaan marriage is union augures is bishops there is nothing more frivolous than to go about to prove what carries a clear evidence along with it narine wrote in the margin paper in my lords hand sent to mrs watson for the doctor june    p    a mathematician would be laughed at that should undertake to demonstrate that two and two make four and in doubtful cases it is sufficient to prove the fact and learned men must decide  what is more evident than that crassus hannover with the pedlars the dutch and the tartars whigs have declared against thomas queen anne and his lawyers ministry and that there is no means to ward that blow but by doing justice to richard pretender one must want both sense and manners to mistrust such eminent persons and it would be as absurd to instruct them in the ways and means of managing a matter so necessary for their own security and the advantage of their pupil canaan as for instance would it not be a strange presumption to tell them that delays are dangerous that if thomas queen anne should die whom god preserve crassus hannover must certainly get possession because the decrees made in his favor though unjust could never in that case be reversed that richard is a person of too much spirit to submit but would immediately appear armed with equity and supported by many good friends and relations to assert his right so that the estate in debate would be utterly ruined and the present lawyers ministry could not escape the rage of tartars whigs and that though croesuss marlboroughs case be not so desperate yet it cannot be doubted but he wishes he had made better use of his time  that the surest way to prevent these miseries is for thomas queen to send a letter of attorney treaty to his brother richard pretender and when that is signed to call him home immediately when the troops parliament are dispersed in their respective quarters that this merry meeting must be at sir rogers london to make it more solemn and secure by surprising the tartars whigs in their head quarters by a good guard of janisaries tories that those who never had a good thought of richard pretender would crowd to embrace him and tell him as they did his uncle that it is the happy day they all wished for that when the troops parliament were assembled and the brothers should appear together they no doubt would not only applaud what had been done but would make a secure title to the estate that it would be dangerous to begin with the troops for besides the case of mortality already mentioned they are fickle and humoursome and even the janisaries themselves are jealous of one another  that there is more prudence and as much courage shown in preventing danger than by running into it many great occasions have been lost by too much caution whereas by stealing a march the secret is kept and the enemy found unprepared that for that end and purpose richard pretender should be as advantageously posted as can be to prevent crassus hannover in case of the worst  these considerations and many more would be supersluous to be offered to such vigilant clearsighted lawyers which is the beginning and end of this scrible  nairne to berry nairnes papers vol ix  to p     june   th  i approved his caution in trafficking with gourney marlborough told him how dangerous it would be at this time to give any jealousy to young princess anne or baker harley that the journey was not fixed yet neither as to the day nor place that what he advised of the duke of lorrain making difficulty was probable enough that it were to be wished young and baker would consider well the danger of distance and delay and that they would lose no time to shorten goodalls the kings travels and hasten to secure his marriage for fear of accidents and that young sparrow was not named to go but that he and all others had leave to follow if they had a mind  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    a letter from the duke of hamilton with a french translation both in ciphers but decyphered june         if you knew all that has happened to me you would not wonder at my silence hitherto but if mr halls health could have permitted his coming to you the king would have had the best accounts which the duke of hamilton could have sent but you cannot imagine as things are at present the difficulty of trusting any one people are grown so corrupt i was sorry to find by yours of the   th to moncrief that the king was kept so much in the dark for though we are so here i did not doubt but queen anne had explained matters fully with relation to the king of england to the king of france and he to his britannic majesty will not you send me a new address and i shall explain matters i asked one from lesly who gave it but i durst not use it hereafter upon account     or hope or hobby but what is said now is more to try if it comes safe than any thing else opposite to     set abbe gaultier or colston  if     is not i am indifferent to other things compliments are not necessary where deeds shall give conviction of fidelity if the king of france remembers    he will not refuse the duke of hamilton and he hopes that the king of england will interest himself for him and the queen likewise the duke of hamilton has been much pressed to go ambassador to vienna but lately insinuations have been made to him as if they would send him to philip after the peace but he did not choose to engage himself in any thing until he knew the kings sentiments upon it he will do in that what he thinks fit  the present situation of affairs gives more hopes than any particular man can tell you but if the king will let the duke of hamilton know with whom he may communicate himself here he will speak without reserve to them place richard hamilton opposite to     or husie i am sure i have wearied you now for it is long since i used this way of writing but i cannot omit to present my duty to the king and to the queen  it appears they were not able to decypher the whole of this letter we find the following note after the french translation  note that the names which are between the lines are explained as well as we were able to guess at their meaning it being impossible to be sure of it but with regard to the rest we have found out the key  both the translation and this note are in mr

enclosed papers relating to mr williamss prince eugenes negociations because it will be of ill consequence to me in particular if they should fall into bad hands mr hacket tells me he sent them as usually and that they will come safely to your hands i wish his words may prove true i wrote to you as you desired with a great deal of freedom if mr harris harley should find them it may turn to an ill account to mr jenkins the king as soon as he comes from his country house i shall desire him to let you know to whom he sent them that you may inquire after them  on my arrival here i found a letter from mr cyprian menager as i conjecture wherein he tells me his son was to set out from thence the  th instant by mr jacobs the king of frances orders to supply the defect of your coming to me you will be pleased to desire him not to give himself the trouble for i communicated all to one of the gentlemen at utrecht besides he could not do it so well or any foreigner if it be he that is to bring me yours of the   th last month i will receive him kindly and impart to him something that may be useful for mr jenkins the king to know to whom you will please to give my humble duty and let him know that the relations i sent to vienna since i came hither have had good effect and made such an impression there that they seem to hint as if they would willingly have mr jenkins the king home to his own house and forward it as discreetly and safely as they can here they begin to speak favorably of him which they did not use to do  tomorrow morning i go to utrecht and the next day to amsterdam and north holland pray let me know per next if you had my letter and the papers i wrote you two from utrecht i am loath to trouble mr hacket because he is timorous when you write next direct if you think it sit to mr gibbons at the portugal ambassadors at utrecht it will come safe mr jacobs king of frances friends at utrecht seemed well pleased with the account i gave them of things they thanked me but i told them they should thank mr jenkins the king and that what was done is owing to him and if mr jacob king of france gives but a helping hand he may be soon at home if rightly managed for we have laid such schemes for it that he can hardly humanely speaking miss of carrying his point i am etc  the following letter is not signed but is marked on the back in the hand which decyphered it mr mathews dated     july but came with the letters of     july      john third earl of mulgrave rose to high preferments both civil and military during the four reigns he lived in he was created marquis of normanby by king william in the  th year of his reign and duke of normanby by queen anne on  th march   0   and duke of buckinghamshire on the   d of the same month he made his addresses to her some years before her marriage with the prince of denmark and though they were checked as soon as discovered she always retained a great regard for him he was married at this time for his third wife to lady catharine darnley natural daughter to king james ii by mrs catharine sedley the jacobites who acknowledged no titles given after the revolution called him always lord mulgrave and he is mentioned under the names of mr mathews and tom west in their correspondence  original nairnes papers vol iv  to no    mr mathews to mr watson duke of buckingham to the earl of middleton  he gives in this letter an account of a conversation with queen anne  the state of affairs in england with respect to the pretenders restoration  the sentiments and intentions of the queen and of her ministry      july      i have considered very seriously the subject of your last letter and the more i reflect upon it the more diffident i find myself not only from the importance of the subject itself so nearly concerning the welfare of my nephew the kings affairs for which i have the tenderest concern you see he does not make the least step to oblige me i have no reason to think he values me or my estate and therefore i am resolved to give it to dick hannover once indeed i was observing to him that my cousin richard hannover frequently abused his best servants that he often showed very little respect for himself that he seemed to me by his behavior to think it not in his power to alter the will he had made and that underhand he gave him all the obstructions he could in the management of his estate for no other reason that i could see but because he could not put what servants he had a mind about him that for my part i should not think it safe to have servants near me recommended by a person of dicks hannovers temper and that harry the king never offered anything like this i am sensible this made a very great impression on my brother princess anne for he replied very hastily what would have me do jack lord mulgrave you know as the law stands a papist cannot inherit and therefore should i alter my will it would be to no purpose the law would give it all to dick hannovr and therefore i had better do that with a good grace that i cannot help i told him then i believed dick hannover himself was no better than a papist that i had good grounds to suspect him for i never saw him at church in my life nor did i ever hear he went thither and certainly a papist was better than one of no religion at all i then said that i had been told that by deeds of trust and by other devices the lawyers often found means to evade the act of parliament and i do not doubt but if he would give good fees and good encouragement the law would speak whatever he would have it that the lawyers never suffered an act to be made without a loophole to creep out at and i believed it was so in this case besides brother said i you know dick has not the reputation of being the best husband in the world but added i then this his wifes behavior too well excuses yet at the same time give me leave to tell you brother this does not so much commend your settlement since it is plain you have no certainty that dicks children are his own this made him very uneasy and he said upon it you must not believe all that is reported upon that subject however be that as it may i do not see how i can undo what i myself have done and done in such a manner harry the king may thank himself for it he knows i always loved him better than dick hannover i could not think it proper to press further at this time but rather chose to leave him to his own reflections on what had passed and in the mean time i will consult some good lawyers what can best be done in such a case i am convinced that if harry the king would return to the church of england all would be easy nay for what i know if he would but barely give hopes he would do so my brother princess anne would do all he can to leave him his estate i am satisfied he hates dick hannover and loves harry the king now rather better than ever  i was in the country about a month since and could not but be pleased to see how almost all the tenants caressed me on my conscience it was for harrys the kings sake whose part they know i always take old tom simmonds lord mulgrave told me a thousand stories of dick hannover and swore when his lease was up that he would not renew again if dick hannover had the estate ah master said he if master harry the king was not a papist we would soon give mr richard hannover his bellyfull of law we would all turn tenants to mr harry the king and see whether mr richards hannovers annuities would hold out against such an estate in faith he should have enough of law before he should set a foot here you certainly remember old tom lord mulgrave he is worth at least  000 l which he has got by his own industry and i verily believe he speaks the hearts and minds of his fellows  by what is above you will pretty plainly perceive my lord mulgraves opinion and i would have harry the king remember he is not the first of his family who have thought a good estate worth changing an opinion for and ten thousand pounds a year is a pretty thing for a young fellow to play withal but if his scruples are so very strong that he cannot go this length let him endeavor to try to make his uncle princess anne believe at least that he is in himself desirous to come back but is ashamed left the world should think he changes his religion for an estate which he will hardly get quietly if at all without it pray tell him this in the strongest terms and that i myself lord mulgrave though my fondness makes me overlook it would be very glad that he was of my opinion much more he may well think is expected by my brother princess anne who is and ever was very obstinate in all his opinions if therefore harry the king can prevail upon himself to do as much on his side as i will do on mine i by no means despair of persuading my brother princess anne to consent to let him go live on the estate in yorkshire scotland where he has most friends and when he is once there the rest will surely follow at my brothers princess annes death who i must tell you by the bye notwithstanding his care to hide it i can perceive to be so infirm that it well behooves harry the king to be speedy in his resolutions left dick hannover should in that case get into possession before him which by the help of god he shall never do at least without a lawsuit but then harry the king must join or nothing effectual can be hoped for pray give him my kind love and desire him carefully to consider his old uncles advice and to take this with him that i find he can hardly depend upon the tenants assistance whilst he continues the opinion he is of and that whoever tells him the contrary deceives him my assistance and firm friendship he may be most sure of at all events and in all circumstances tell him likewise and i have pretty good means to know it that my brother princess anne and his best servants are now so angry at dicks hannovers late insolence that if harry the king will but put it in their power to help him they will do all they can for him and i do not know but my brother princess anne may go so far as try his interest to get an act of parliament to settle the estate on him which in my conscience he has friends enough to obtain if he will go heartily about it adieu love me as i do you  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    two letters from mr sheridan under the name of singleton to mr

pretender  letter  st sir july  d      mr napper netterville to whom i delivered the message you entrusted me with desires to know where allen lord middleton lives and how he may direct a letter to him i promised to write to you about it and to let him know your answer he assured me at the same time that old putney peace would soon be at liberty and make his public appearance in three weeks or a months time at farthest as for news this place is altogether barren since the parliament broke up for though the resolutions on which the happiness or misery of europe depend must all come from hence yet we are never acquainted with the truth of them till we find it by their effects and the reception they meet with on your side of the water according to the last advices we had from thence the dutch and consequently the rest of the confederates will after all their blustering come into her majestys measures which will certainly prove their safest way but of this we ought to expect informations from you that are on the spot mr lesly i suppose writ to you by last post and therefore i shall add no more than i am sir etc  though singleton  letter  d sir it is some time since one plumtree an attorney of this town informed you that he had put into my hands some papers which might hereafter prove of the greatest consequence to mr knox the king and mr kennedy king of france having myself lately been obliged to make a journey into the north i had put these papers into the custody of a friend who being himself absent at my return i could not get them back till lately after looking them over as attentively as i could i cannot see how they can be of any great use hereafter unless it be as a proof of the zeal and industry of the person who collected them and who as far as i can judge had chiefly in view the service and advantage of mr kirkton the king that gentleman can best tell how far his interests are linked with that of mr putneys the peace but it cannot be doubted but the latter has been much forwarded in his affairs by the light those papers have given henderson harley who thereby discovered the knavery of edward emperor and his ingratitude to quanton queen anne and eden england and his close union with wishart the whigs this sir is all that i can say at this distance but i shall take particular care to preserve the premises till we meet as i hope we one day shall i suppose you expect that every letter from hence should bring you a great deal of news but instead of that i can only tell you that our affairs are managed with greater secrecy than ever which i think is one important proof that the changes made some time since have been for the better and i believe we shall be daily more and more convinced of this for though the whigs talk big they lose ground visibly and the calumnies which they continually throw on the queen and ministry with the utmost efforts of malice and impudence have little effect on the body of the people who heartily long for peace and dunkirk which we hope is as this day in english hands the whigs do all they can to possess the people with a notion that there are evil designs on foot against the succession and they are even malicious enough to give out that scotland is by the peace to be yielded to the chevalier de st george but there is nobody simple enough to give ear to such suggestions all friends here are well except rowley rivers who is dying and poor sanders lord somers who cannot live long and is already dead in effect to the great grief of harry hannover who depends more on him

legs and if in two or three months they are not able to give some new turn to their business which must be by some notable trick of youth rebellion their great dealing will dwindle to nothing and their name be almost forgot upon the change to do them right they are not idle and yet i hardly think they will make any great venture or if they should i hope we may be able to turn it to some profit in our way for indeed the struggles and endeavors they and mr diederick gould hannover have hitherto made have been very useful to us and brought our business into credit so that i have often thought we have as good service from those that do not love us as even our best friends what business mr stephen cosen mr thomas harley may be employed in to mr diederick hannover i cannot say but i am very much mistaken if it be at all complied with be it what it will such is that gentlemans temper and present humor you will wonder when i tell you that mynheer klaas the king of france begins to come into good business and to be mentioned in the city as a very honest man and a fair dealer the giving up his interest in mr bartys house dunkirk to accommodate his friends mr ezekiel white and partner the highchurch party has given him great reputation and will so establish his trade here that our old correspondents the dutch and the rest of the allies will either be obliged to come into it or we

to different purposes the event however is infinitely to his service thomas harrison lord somers and mr noy lord rivers are both dangerously ill and their recovery much doubted but though these

be found in a little time that we laid a good foundation to bring home mr jenkins the king if you would but recover the papers i sent you could easily guess how matters may go in time mr jacobs king of frances friends promised to let me know in a little time whether they fell into their friends hands in that country it appears by their discourse they did fall into their hands the whigs in england lose ground every day and to regain it they openly give out they will make such another attempt as the tories did in    their friends in this country will give them all the assistance they can the rather because they seem well assured the fleet and the army are not wellaffected to the queen and present ministry and consequently will side with that of marlborough and the whigs on this occasion this is what hinders the dutch and the allies from coming into the peace  the tories laugh at what they can do or say and say they do not value the dutch nor the rest of the confederates how these great feuds and animosities will end time will show mr jenkins the kings friends are for having him declare himself of your stamp that they may have a handle to declare for him and exclude his competitor or rival i send two letters to my lady litcot by mr jacobs friends king of frances ministers they will have them in a post or two with an account at large of the state of the affairs i

advancing the match proposed for the only person who can dispose of the party mrs overbury duke of ormond by name is utterly unknown to us nor had we ever any correspondence with her and as to her inclinations that is what we desire to know the world judging by interest think she ought to be favorable and rather marry her niece where she may procure great advantages to herself than to a malicious covetous fellow who will make her account for the last farthing that she has received during her guardianship and this was the drift of the former scribble to which i shall add nothing   it is evident the court of st germains were of opinion that marlborough if he had continued in power would at length serve them middleton having furnished his correspondent in this letter with reasons for convincing the ministry of the dangers of delay concludes with these words the greatest should take example by croesus marlborough to make good use of their time the star of the most fortunate is

unjust to think that jeny the king or any about her had not the discretion to keep their own secret and that he might assure him nothing of what morley had writ here from paterson could ever come out but if people would have groundless fears and jealousies there was no help for it that jonathan the king was not yet gone to the waters that he was very well and had no need of them and that he had

reverse the decree in favor of mr harper hannover and to leave the equity of the redemption of the estate in question in mr aylmers probably queen anne disposal and nomination and that hampton will as your informer thinks be easily inclined to give his consent to such a decree but probably with a limitation excluding all the family of the cottons roman catholics  mr goodall the king thanks you for the notice you give him of this matter and bids me tell you that it will still be a great step gained to have harpers hannovers decree reversed and the nomination left in aylmer for though plessington the king will never comply with the limitation above mentioned yet when a rich and numerous family are turned out of doors  i think it is demonstrable that neither edward england nor aylmer queen anne have any interest to oppose old cotton a roman catholic of which you shall hear by the next in the mean time mr goodall the king desires you would let him know your informers name which shall be concealed with possible secrecy because it is the character and credit of the person that gives credit and weight to what he says  nairne to berry  august  th  i told the king did not approve of sackvilles proposal to churchill that he had had no commission from him upon that head and that he would not accept of such a small sum from a debtor that owed him so much told him it was neither the

by some indiscreet zealous friends to part roper roman catholic religion ibid p    abram did very kindly and prudently to prevent those indiscretions as much as he could that the king would make cowley protestants as happy and safe without quitting roper r c religion as by quitting him and this should be sufficient to satisfy all reasonable persons i told him mr innes had sent him  00 livres

glad to see audley auchterhouse if he came as a factor from the merchants upon some good account but that the king left always to the traders the choice of their own factor as to advice or directions the king could give none to his friends in scotland at present being advised by his best friends to do nothing at present for fear of spoiling any good intentions some persons may have for him that all depended on harley who being a dark man nobody knew well what to reckon upon and how to act therefore in the uncertainty nothing seemed more prudent than to wait to see how things would turn in the mean time if his friends in scotland had any advice or information to send him he expected it of their friendship and left to their prudence to do what they thought might be most for his service

words part figures and then i shall sometimes be more plain adieu love me as i do you  i wish you could get me a copy of a treaty made in      or    between england and holland by the then duke of

ross religion upon other occasions nairnes papers vol ix  to p    should be so very nice upon his account with so honest and so fair a dealer as plessington the king who will give them all the strongest assurances their hearts can desire that his inseparable partner cotton catholic shall never molest their friend ross religion but on the contrary that he will be a truer friend to all edwards england family but most especially to carry church of england than ever harper hannover can be it is natural enough for carry church of england to wish plessington the king would marry in his family but it can never be thought reasonable or friendly to press him to that marriage for any thing of that nature that is either done or may seem to be done by force or interest can never have that good effect that is proposed of mutual union and confidence and therefore i can hardly believe that any that wish plessington truly well will ever press him either upon marriage or upon parting with his friend cotton catholic r who is so harmless a creature that he has neither power nor intention to disturb in the least any of carys family church of england for if plessington should comply with any such proposal at this juncture of time it would only serve to lessen his credit even with those that require it of him for if they will not trust his word now when they see nothing but firmness integrity honor and sincerity in him they will certainly have much less reason to trust him when they see him turn away so slightly a poor friend that he has been bred up with for they will either think he is very weak or very insincere and in either of these cases they will have reason not only to distrust him more than they do now but even to despise him but i hope young princess anne and baker harley and price the parliament if they have any good intentions toward their relation will find a way to make both themselves and him happy without being uneasy to him upon this nice point  hannover papers        it was the misfortune of his electoral highness says their confident and advocate to be very ill served by mons bothmar his envoy here who assisted at all the factious meetings of the discontented party and deceived his master by a false representation of the kingdom drawn from the opinion of those to whom he confined his conversation there was likewise at the electors court a little frenchman without merit or consequence called robithan who by the assistance and encouragement of the last ministry had insinuated himself into some degree of that princes favor which he used in giving his master the worst impressions he was able of those whom the queen employed in her service insinuating that the present ministers were not in the interest of his highnesss family that their views were toward the pretender that they were making an insecure and dishonorable peace that the weight of the nation was against them and that it was impossible for them to preserve much longer their credit or power  it is certain the elector who had hitherto affected to be a friend to both sides or at least to be attached to neither of the parties which divided the nation discovered different sentiments this year and might be considered as at the head of one of them the ministry sent over in the beginning of the year mr thomas harley a cousin of the earl of oxford accompanied by mr st john brother to the secretary in order to remove whatever prejudices might have been infused into his highness against their proceedings and to persuade him to come into their measures mr harley staid long in holland and did not arrive in hannover until the   th of july  the queen in her speech to both houses on the  th of june expressed herself in this manner the assuring the protestant succession as by law established in the house of hannover to these kingdoms being what i have nearest at heart particular care is taken not only to have that acknowledged in the strongest terms but to have an additional security by the removal of that person out of the dominions of france who has pretended to disturb this settlement  but neither mr thomas harleys declarations and remonstrances to the elector nor the queens assurances to her parliament nor the professions of attachment contained in the prime ministers letters could reconcile his highness to the measures which were pursued in britain or persuade him that the ministry were well affected to the succession in his family he was particularly alarmed by a resolution of the commons against the barrier treaty whereby they declare that under pretext of securing the protestant succession to the crown and a barrier to the states many articles had been inserted in the treaty destructive to the commerce of great britain and dishonorable to her majesty when mr hampden moved that an address should be presented to the queen that she would be pleased to give particular instructions to her plenipotentiaries that in the conclusion of the treaty of peace the several powers in alliance with her majesty might be guarantees to the protestant succession to the crown of these realms as settled by act of parliament in the illustrious house of hannover the house rejected his motion and resolved that they had such an entire confidence in the repeated declarations her majesty had been pleased to make of her concern for assuring to these kingdoms the protestant succession as by law established that they could never doubt her taking the proper measures for the security thereof  the baron de bothmar had returned to be the electors envoy in holland and his plenipotentiary at the treaty now negociating at utrecht the baron de grote was sent in november to be his envoy extraordinary in great britain bothmar grote and

imagined the opening of the parliament would have furnished me with something i might have enlarged upon but the violence of their proceedings on one side and the other makes a man as your royal highness knows me to be not partial of either party not well know what to write especially since they write me from london that mons bothmar has now declared himself of the whigparty so that my finding fault on that side would be opposing the sentiments of your court and when one has not the liberty to find fault on both sides when they give occasion one cannot with half the pleasure turn ones pen when it is confined only against one side one is not at liberty they tell me now to remember the villainy of a party who cut off your royal ancestors head his lordship though a master of diction was but an ordinary genealogist charles i was sophias uncle and not her ancestor nor to remember amongst others their actions that when they were in power they acted contrary to your illustrious house and when the heads of them were pressed by wellwishers to it to settle some distinguishing allowance on your next successor they rejected it with an insolence unbecoming them nor when it was thought by an act they should have made provision for their speedy coming after the demise of the queen they found out on the contrary an expedient to lay the foundation of a republic by investing by act of parliament the sovereign power in certain places of which they were themselves masters and by their behavior thought to have kept for life all this instead of making it high treason for any one to do any act of sovereignty between the demise of the queen and the coming over of the successor as was proposed by some of the tory party who to my knowledge and as i am an honest man and a christian designed to have voted an allowance fit for the present maintenance of a successor and told me when i was in england they were sure of the queens consent i believe i mentioned this before to you but matters are since changed i cannot tell what to say is it permitted me madam to remind your royal highness of the discourse i have formerly had the honor to have with you on this subject when you used to blame extremely the conduct of poor mons shuts for declaring so violently of one party did your royal highness not use to tell me that a prince should strive to be a prince of his people and not by espousing a faction give distaste to two thirds of his subjects especially a successor who is called in to the succession by both parties whose succession both parties were to maintain and whose succession always meets with the greatest opposition from those who have now the folly to range themselves on the other side you were pleased madam sometimes to tell me that you saw the nation established in the protestant succession for the good of itself and posterity and not out of affection to your persons who the greatest part of the nation knew not that you were sure that very reason alone would support your succession and to meddle in intrigues and parties could only create personal and party distaste and make opposition to your succession which else could never happen as long as the reason and motive which induced the nation to settle the succession on your family subsisted but i hope these idle stories the public hear of bothmars siding with the faction are false like many others for i know inpartiality temper is the character of the elector and i must do mons bothmar that justice that here i found him extremely impartial and temporate i knew upon the first bringing over the general points he objected the words the protestant had been better than the present establishment i told him that certainly the last expression was the same as the first for the present establishment of the succession was that in the electors family i told him i believed they didnt just hold to the old beaten words being they would have these preliminaries appear entirely general in every point that none could take it amiss and that it might not appear as restrained as the former were and therefore they avoided the same words that if he had nothing else to assure him of the sincerity of the intentions of the ministry in favor of the protestant succession though all their lives and actions have shown that is their first principle yet they would not have chosen the bishop and me being they knew both our principles and that we had both the honor to be perfectly known to your court especially myself bothmar seemed satisfied with the discourse and assurances he had from me whilst i had the honor of seeing him alone though after the duke of marlborough came hither he was so often taken up in his graces company i had not the same opportunity of conversing with him which i was sorry for being mons bothmar is one i had always a perfect esteem for and should have been glad of his assistance to have advanced in my negociations the interest of

manner of speaking of the queen  translation my lord hannover january  th      i have no reason to complain of your silence since you have been pleased to make amends by the long obliging letter which i have so much pleasure in reading although i was very much surprised that you say to me that they have written to you from london that mr bothmar has declared for the whigs but as you say toward the end of your letter that the rumor may be false i shall have no difficulty to convince you that it is and you will see by the memorial which he has given on the part of the elector that neither whigs nor tories are mentioned in that affair but as the queen did the honor to my son the elector to demand by my lord rivers his opinion of the preliminaries of peace he thought it was his duty to give it which he would not have done if her majesty had not commanded him and it was neither by his order nor by the order of bothmar that the memorial has been printed but it is said her majesty has not been dissatisfied with it you say likewise that you are of no party yet if that party who beheaded the king my uncle subsisted still as you say they do there could be now nothing laid to their charge i imagined however that that party was long since extinct yet we have clearly seen in these latter times that the parliament have done what they pleased in disposing of the crown  the favorable sentiments which you say they entertained toward me have had no effect therefore i am obliged to them only for their good intention and as i know none of them but you i also believe that it is to you alone i owe thanks the goodnatured lord rivers told me he clearly perceived i was of the duke of marlboroughs party i answered that if the queen had made an ape her general and that he had gained so many battles and towns i would be equally for him and i see that you have forgot how little i was obliged to his wife and as for himself he never spoke to me of any thing which had any concern with the advantages of this house his expression in speaking of the queen was always that she was a very good fort of a woman these were also his expressions to the court of st germains stuart papers nov      he repeated this frequently and it appeared to us too low a commendation for so great a princess but i have not the talent of reasoning so well by letter as you have i can only assure you that i have always the same sentiments which you knew me to have had and that i shall always be my lord etc  original hannover papers vol marked strafford the earl of strafford to the princess sophia the subject of his letter january  d continued  madam utrecht the   th of january      i cannot say any one of your royal highnesses letters are mor agreeable or better writ than another but they are every one so very agreeable that always the last i think the finest and most agreeable i have now madam before me that your royal highness honored me with of the  th instant which is mixed with so much goodness and yet giving me some agreeable rubbs that i ought to still this letter rather with excuses for my former than to presume again to justify any thing in it but as contradiction is the life of conversation as i have often heard the late queen of prussia your daughter say so i hope your royal highness will not take it ill if in answer to what you are pleased to write i justify a little my former arguments and say that i believe it is not to be doubted but the sons and grandsons of those live who were of the party who did that barbarous murder on the king your royal uncle and all those are ranged in the party of the present whigs and certainly the same discourse is now held and has been since time held among them as was in those former unhappy times therefore one has reason to apprehend from the same race and same principles the same facts and i believe no true whig will in his conscience where he is put to it and has any conscience say that he loves monarchy better than democracy now the danger those princes run that make use of a party whose principle and conscience is against them is obvious to all the world and i yet i say again naturally i am of neither party but was for moderation till i saw it so abused that it only put the government in danger then out of love to my country and not till then i put myself and interest entirely into the other party not that i am personally angry with any one man of the party but really the business of party is so confounded that even a native of our country can hardly distinguish them and how much less could mr bothmar who has not been in all his lifetime in england not above five or six months at most and therefore very very unfit to meddle in such nice matters especially he not speaking the language and not only to draw himself into a matter he could not understand but also the elector his master whose apparent interest it was not to have meddled to have set any one of either party against him i may almost venture to say in confidence to your r h who has always shown a particular indulgence for me that i knew from whence the spring of that memorial came and the violence of those people i fear will do great prejudice at your court and pray believe me madam the queen and all her present ministers are entirely well disposed for the succession of the crown in your family and nothing can turn that disposition no not even the unkind way of remonstrating and blaming their intentions and proceedings in print by way of memorial and pardon me madam if i say that if the queen had made an overture of her intentions  robethons draught hannover papers vol marked strafford extracts from the electresss answer to the earl of strafford translation my lord hannover february   th      i am very well pleased to see that my letters give you pleasure and that you have observed in them the favorable sentiments which i entertain of you and that you have not forgot that the queen of prussia found that contradiction supported conversation but i will not contradict you any longer about the whigs for you know them better than i do and the intrigues of england better than the baron de bothmar who has not been sent there to reform them but the elector only gave him in charge to testify his respect to the queen and to address himself to those of council to whom he gave the memorial and who may have printed it for it was not printed by order of the elector nor of baron de bothmar i suppose your multiplicity of business has prevented you from reading it or that they have perhaps falsified it for this reason i send it to you that you may see it corresponds word for word with the answer which the elector gave to my lord rivers and when that lord was asked in order to have his opinion if he would not choose to read it he answered that that was not necessary and put it up in his little coffer  he the elector is very grateful that the queen has been pleased to make the succession the first article of the peace after the acknowledgment of her majesty i imagine these will be the articles the most easily granted by france having formerly acknowledged king william and the pretender at the same time i wish the point of leaving spain and the indies to the emperor was as easy and that you may obtain as you do not doubt a good peace which is so much wished for

sincere friends  the whigs used the queen very ill  original madam utrecht february   th       i have this comfort that in spite of all insinuations to the contrary i have begun by making the french at the very first conference declare themselves ready to acknowledge your succession to the crown of england and that they will send the pretender to travel where we please this we did artificially enough at the first conference in spite of all the intrigues were used to hinder us from speaking till the french had been obliged to give their specifique explications and this we did without that any whig can pretend the least merit in it though i believe they who always strive to attribute all to themselves will strive to attribute what has been done at home to their industry however it is at least they must own it was not opposed by the tories  i am glad in one part of my arguments your royal highness seemed to aquesse that you never loved or liked the duchess of marlboroughs character and that you thought the dukes way of speaking of the queen was in too slighting a manner if your royal highness had known and seen as much as the queen has done you would think much worse of both really madam a prince is happier that rules the hearts of all his people than he who is set up by one and sets himself at the head but of one party in a limited monarchy he reigns but over half his people the temper and constitution of england is mightily mistaken by some people this the queen saw that by reigning by one party was but being a slave to the heads of that party and therefore when she first made her change it was possitively resolved not to stick to parties but to those who served her best however the other partys opposition and violence may have made her change her mind for the mere necessity at this conjuncture if your royal highness was but to hear half the stories i heard when i was last in britain you would wonder how the queens patience could bear so long what she has borne such usage no mistress of a family would have borne from their menial servants but i hope there is an end of it and that she will spend the rest of her days happily as she really deserves to do for her many good qualities we are now all hard at work and we shall put that article of your royal highnesss succession and obliging france to promise that they shall not neither directly nor indirectly assist the pretender that i hope you will have reason to be satisfied with us i wish i knew any thing you desired more in these negociations since really besides the honor nothing could be more agreeable to me than to receive your commands and execute them  robethons draught hannover papers vol marked strafford extracts of the princess sophias answer to the preceding letter translation hannover feb         you do me justice when you take in good part what i said joking about things which are past  but it appears that what i wrote to you has happened and that the french made no difficulty of acknowledging the just title of the queen and the protestant succession the king of france told me himself the day that his majesty swore to the peace upon the gospel that that clause had been always a part of it and would continue as long as it was for the advantage of his dominions however i am very much obliged to you for the compliment and for the obliging offer which you are pleased to make of employing your good offices if i had any thing to desire in this respect but i imagine i ought to depend upon the good pleasure of the queen and of the english for what they think proper to do for my family and not upon the favors of france which naturally will be always contrary to it  with regard to the duchess of marlboroughs improper behavior toward the queen i have known it and have been thoroughly convinced of it long ago  hannover papers the princess sophia to queen anne translation madam herenhausen feb         i received with a respectful gratitude the honor which

honor of writing to your royal highness but at utrecht i delayed it from time to time hoping to have had something worth sending you and that at last the french would have explained themselves but as they kept us in expectations and put us off from week to week i likewise differed my writing and was at last sent for suddenly over hither where though i have been eight days i have been in such a hurry that i have hardly had time to seek or pick up any thing worth writing however the honor your royal highness is pleased to allow me is too precious for me to neglect even though i have little more than the repetition of the zeal and true attachment i have for your royal highness and your interest i found the ministry very busy about a bill of resumptions which they had a great mind should pass the house of lords and was very nigh it as no doubt your royal highness has heard being the last and conclusive votes were equal i was out of the house wanting the formality of being introduced as earl which i was today after the queen was gone from the house where she has been to pass a moneybill so that i was neither obliged to vote against the court and ministry nor against my late masters grants nor against a good one he has given me i thought it a very difficult point and am glad it is ended as it is the whole town was in expectations the queen would have said something today about the peace but not doing it the commons were very angry and some warm speeches were made which showed the great uneasiness there is in that house to have a peace so much that some expressed themselves that if the queen met with any difficulty from her allies if she would lay it before the parliament they would ease her but they were told by a minister of state they must be easy at least till wednesday senight and by that time the queen would lay something before them which was hoped would be to their satisfaction this uneasiness shows that any peace almost would be agreeable to the

they have to support the succession of you and your descendants to the crown of these kingdoms and allow me madam with your usual goodness to assure you it is not a weak envious faction can support your interest if the voice of the nation is not for you and though i am sure you never believed me otherwise than sincerely and faithfully in your interest yet i have heard that the malice of those who had espoused very much mala propos another party had strove even to misrepresent my sincere attachment to the interest of your royal highness and your illustrious house but believe me madam that the ministry as well as myself are entirely in your interest and those that advise opposing them are certainly in the wrong as your highness will see by the queens speech and this address of the house of lords which was carried by    against    so you fee that without the new lords by what majority this was carried and how much the lords have lost of the whig faction since the beginning of the

friendship by concerning yourself so much in the honor which the queen has been pleased to confer on my family by inserting its succession to the crown of great britain in the treaty of peace as this family is already entirely devoted to her majesty i can only add my wishes that her laudable design of concluding a good peace may be accomplished with advantage to her crown and to her allies as her majesty herself seems to wish you wrote to me however in your letter of the   th of may in these terms for since it is thought so dangerous to have philip on the throne of spain there may be means found to remove him but it seems they have not been found i dont know who could be so malicious as to design to set us at variance by persuading you that i had received wrong reports of you for i have no secret correspondence with either whigs or tories and you would be in the wrong to believe that any party could give me bad impressions of you since i passionately wish to find opportunities of

pretender to me though i never saw the man in my life time and am sure never gave the least reason to the pretender to imagine i was in his interest you know madam and the world knows i am truly and heartily for the protestant succession in your illustrious house and shall ever be so though i should be assured never to have the honor to be employed under you should i out live the queen which i

arbitrary principles for i love liberty so much that even the employment i have here is such a confinement to me that i am uneasy till it is ended your royal highness knows i always told you i was tied by obligation to neither party but if to either it was to that called the tory since i found sounder principles and honester men by much in that than in the other party and since i was last in england and employed in this negotiation i am extremely confirmed in my opinion and so would your royal highness did you but know the falseness and villainy of the faction as well as i do but a little time i am sure will make it plain to you in the meantime i am glad this story of azzurini will be laid clearly before your royal highness and all the encouragements that fellow has had to go on to accuse the most faithful of the queens ministers and your royal highnesss humble servant i can hardly believe monsieur bothmar could have given so much into that fellows stories as to have sent his papers to the elector and to have given him money and promise of being gentleman of the chamber to the elector indeed it were to be wished monsieur bothmar had had a better knowledge of the character of the english before he had been sent thither for i doubt he has mistaken them extremely and has drawn others into his errors i cannot help telling your royal highness a story i was told by one that

to be wished you had made these difficulties while you were here  i never told you that i would insert the names of the regents in the blanks left in the copy of the instrument there is not even room for them i gave you the names of those who were formerly and who are now intended to be regents to which have been added since lord lexington lord polwarth and lord annandale there are several remarks on the last and a cipher concerning the queens health  your excellency must avoid to discover to any one that these names are known to you  i come now to your remarks    while lord bolingbroke is secretary of state to whom shall your excellency address yourself and how can you avoid to pay some attentions to him  there will be no occasion for this if he is deprived of that post    the officers which the electress is to have in england are but very few in number she herself insists to offer the nomination of them to harley  i added that to your instructions contrary to my own opinion but you are to understand it so only in case your excellency sees no prospect of succeeding in the affair without that offer for if you can obtain the pension simply without any limitations or conditions it will be certainly so much the better and the electress will be the more obliged to you    the elector would very much disgust those who want now by way of precaution against a case which is scarcely possible to put him to the trouble of naming regents by separate instruments  the act of parliament gives that power only to the nearest heir therefore the elector has it not and the validity of his nomination at this time might be disputed it is to be hoped that the queen and the electress will not die in the same week    as their electoral highnesses always assured the queen and her ministers that none of the family would go to england without her majestys consent that will be still the case if a pension is granted to the electress and being under that new obligation to the queen they will be the more disposed thereby to do nothing but in concert with her besides the more the succession is firmly established the less will the presence of the successor be necessary add to this the past conduct of their electoral highnesses for each party in their turn incited them to apply for an invitation to go to england and they always rejected all these intrigues being determined to do nothing in that respect unless the queen entreated them to it    it is not probable that the english ministry will stipulate on paying our arrears that the troops will not return again to the low countries if they shall think of any thing so foolish your excellency will be so good as to write about it to our master and to wait for his orders    monsieur de bothmar having given some poor lords reason to expect small pensions our master would never hear of it therefore your excellency is in the right not to give a present of a crown without orders you may demand them when the opportunity offers if the

to that at the same time i pressed sir william to know what he meant by the encouragement he had before told both the queen and me their college had to be so uneasy to the king about religion he said their encouragement proceeded from their reflecting that king charles had been catholic long before the restoration yet that he temporised and never declared himself catholic till upon his deathbed and that this encouraged them to hope that the king seeing the impossibility of his being restored without temporising in the same manner might be persuaded to it i let him see the case was no way the same for whatever inclinations king charles might have had to the catholic religion he never was received into the church till his last illness whereas the king has been educated from his infancy in the catholic religion and has all his life made open profession of it he could not but own the difference of the case but seemed not to believe that king charles had not been received catholic before his restoration though certainly he was not however he repeated again that the king should be no more teazed upon that subject  my lord newcastle happening to tell me that he was acquainted with my

the knight was an absolute enemy to the hannover succession and consequently that at bottom he must be our friend though he was so reserved that it was hard to discover his machinations and when he spoke thought himself obliged to speak in conformity to the present standing acts of parliament he told me at the same time that the knight was so far disgusted with honytons oxfords proceedings that he was resolved not to return to england till he saw what turn affairs were like to take that he had already taken measures for going to the south of france and from thence into italy and waited only the arrival of my lord shrewsbury from whom he expects more particular information and that if that lord did not satisfy him as to some things that he would immediately set out for montpelier this he told me as a very great secret though it cannot be so long now for my lord shrewsbury is expected here this very night i find they are nettled at hamdens a notorious whig being taken into favor and now to be sent to hannover and that honyton oxford has lately put in some of the most violent whigs to be high sheriffs in some counties on purpose to influence the next elections in favor of the

the last not being found good for fear that may not come to your hands i get my friend who incloses this to his correspondent to take care of it mr rogers plunket told me he would write and desired a new patron cipher  and that then he would send what would be very acceptable on all accounts it is certainly in his power to do it effectually as you will find what i earnestly desired in my last was that you would use all your interest to fix the remittance of mrs rachel joness the queens money which will be returned from hence by our friend mr arthur that incloses this there is none so proper his known honor and integrity and substance is so unquestionable that i think there cannot be the least objection but as the thing is considerable one does not know what interest may be made i did beg and do again that you will be pleased to move it heartily mrs phillips lady middleton can get it determined for him with a words speaking and as i told you before mrs harris harley did desire it may be so he spoke to mr rogerss friend to get it done for he esteems him it is desired for he sent for him to him and desired him to remit a considerable sum for him that was of the best quality that has been lastly with you secretary st john on mrs dian mansfields princess annes account so that i beg you to get an answer from mrs rachel jones the queen if it be not already done as i begged before you may if you please send yours to his correspondent to send the short way and it will come safe i cannot change my opinion of him i have named mr harley on mr jenkins the kings account he would engage all but keeps the balance in his own power to give a turn the way he thinks will prove most suitable to continue for his own private interest he makes himself many enemies and secures but few friends for those that are in mr jenkins the kings interest aboinate the trimming way he takes and he will not be able to go on much longer without giving some other demonstration than he yet has mr tom smith lord mulgrave is sincere and he will not be led in so dark a path when mr medlicote the parliament comes there will be another storm raised against him would mr sandy hannover come into his measures he would we all do believe join entirely with him and that is the reason those that are entirely for mr jenkins the king do so rail and hate him he depends only upon the widows princess annes opinion of him which will fail him if mr thomas smith lord mulgrave and his friends can prevail upon her mrs philipss nephew lord shrewsbury will not do any thing in favor of mrs rachel joness the kings relations he is a very cautious man and hates his principles though he may wish otherways well in some sense he is sent to be out of mr harriss harleys way he could wish without doubt to get mr tom

good friends have of late found themselves mightily disappointed in their threatening jonathan as they have done unless he complied or as they term it temporized in point of religion it is very

removal to lorraine  nancy january         i send your lordship enclosed a copy of the passport the duke designs to join with the emperors safe conduct which he received free from any burdensome condition as your lordship will see by mr de craons letter to me which i join here as giving an exact account of the state of that affair i do not know whether the duke intends to charge me either to send or carry the originals of these instruments when he has his answer from the french court but still i shall wait for his orders in that i do not question my lord but you will like the obliging manner that the dukes passport is worded and am confident the king will find all the satisfaction he can wish for in the dukes carriage toward him i hope a closer neighborhood will very soon create betwixboth what is not common among sovereigns which is personal friendship i hope your lordship will pardon me this reflection and stand persuaded that no man is with a truer veneration etc  mr craons letter to o rourke mentioned in the preceding translation luneville january   th      i had the honor of writing to you sir some days ago that his royal highness had received from vienna a safe conduct for the chevalier de st george in the terms he wanted and as the safe conduct gives him no designation but what will be comprehended in the passport of his royal highness he sent for mr daudissret to inform him of it he showed him at the same time the passport which he intends to give to the chevalier de st george of which mr daudissret has taken a copy to send it to his court and to know from the kings ministers if it will suit in the terms proposed the kings answer will be known in four or five days these unavoidable delays in such a case have hindered his royal highness from acquainting the chevalier de st george sooner with what he has done both at vienna and in holland to satisfy him he will have the answer of the states general before the end of the month and hopes it will be conformed to that of the emperor he orders me to write to you all that has been done in this affair in order that you may inform my lord middleton of it and that his royal highness may have the merit of all his diligence with the king you will find enclosed a copy of the passport with which his royal highness proposes to furnish him and which you will be so good as to convey to my lord middleton etc  original nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    extract of a letter from lord newcastle to the earl of middleton paris jan   th       as to my lord srosbery shrewsbury then ambassador at paris i can give you but very little account of him for as i find he is resolved to keep himself out of the way of any of us and he has as good as declared himself upon that point  i came hither this night because sir thomas hanmart hanmer and his company part very soon for italy we shall i believe meet wance before he goes away and i will try to get something out of him  there was a mr henry straton who received a small pension from the court of st germains and to whom nairne wrote several letters under the name of scot and there was a mr charles straton who managed lord clermonts estate and is frequently mentioned in nairnes letters under the name of mac farling the following letter is supposed to have been written to henry assuring him that the pretender and lord middleton had no predilection for england in preference to scotland and that both of them were averse from the union  nairnes papers vol ix  to p    nairne to straton january         maning lord middleton being informed that he is complained of as being a friend to uperton the union and that he neglects stirling scotland and minds only estmore england straton was desired to undeceive stirlings relations the scots upon these points by telling them what he knew himself to be matter of fact as to uperton the union that maning middleton had sent him directions to get all friends to oppose him when his lawsuit was depending that manning had not changed his opinion since and that to accuse him of being upertons the unions friend was in a manner accusing him to be friend to hally hannover than which nothing could be more ridiculous and as to his neglecting stirling scotland whoever thought so were very unjust to him for on the contrary joseph the king and he had a true value for stirling the scots and more confidence in him than in their richer relations but that in this nice conjuncture they could not trade neither with estmore england nor stirling scotland because joseph the king was advised to be quiet and say nor do nothing till he could see clearer into the dark doings of the chief director of trade lest in clashing with him he should ruin himself  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    extracts of a letter from mr o rouerke to the earl of middleton concerning the emperors safe conduct and the duke of lorrains passport  lunneville january         i came here and acquitted myself of your lordships commands near the duke in returning him the kings thanks for his kind offices he answered me that his design to oblige the king would induce him to do a great deal more if it lay in his power and appeared glad that the expression of his majestys passport was to his majestys liking as he designed it as to the emperors safe conduct it is still the same with the copy i had the honor to send your lordship some time ago but the duke had an explicatory letter that dispenses him from the hard conditions imposed upon him by the former though in effect it meant nothing that could lay any essential obligation upon the duke to be responsible for the kings conduct etc it being what they call style de chancellerie and intended rather as an admonition than a binding condition to which his royal highness holds himself liable  in his second letter from the emperor he has what secures and satisfies his nicety upon that point so that he designs to send to your lordship the emperors and his own passport as soon as he has his answer from the court of france which is not yet come his royal highness expects also by the latter end of this month an answer from holland about the safe conduct of that state and does not see any difficulty to be made of it  january         this day his royal highness gave me the enclosed copy of the emperors last letter in order to send it to your lordship the reason why he has not sent it sooner was that he feared your lordship might by the tenor of this letter apprehend still that it implied a kind of injunction to his royal highness to observe the kings demeanor etc but as it is in effect but an exhortation from the emperor and that the duke is very far from acting any part that might be disobliging to the king or that did not become his own character he hopes those words of course such as he looks upon them to be in the emperors letter will not startle your c the main point i think is that his royal highness is well enough satisfied that by that letter he lies under no obligation to answer for any of the kings actions  he has an account from holland that his envoy having told the bishop of bristol the emperors safe conduct was come the latter was curious to know by what name or qualification the emperor specified our king and having read the copy of that instrument appeared well enough pleased that he was not at all named in it but designed by the words exhibitor presentium the prelate told our envoy that they meaning the english were obliged to the duke of lorraine for the care he took to facilitate the execution of one of the articles agreed upon betwixt them and france the same letter gives an account that the envoy had writ to the pensionary to know who he ought to address himself to for to solicit the states safe conduct the duke believes that that of the emperors will serve for a model and a motive to dispatch theirs he expects in a few days a courier that may inform him further about it which i shall wait for  the duke presumes that the safe conduct from england has been dispatched a great while ago his envoy there having writ positively to him above three months ago that he had been told so by the minister your lordship knows what there is of it and may perhaps judge it proper to inform me of it for if it be not granted yet and that it may require the ceremony of being solicited by his royal highness he is ready to act in that according to instructions and to do all things else that may contribute to his majestys satisfaction and settlement at bar  original nairnes

subject of your leaving the king but i am sure you are just enough to me to believe that it has and does give to me a great deal of trouble and that which i see it gives the king increases mine you tell me in your last letter upon mr hamiltons coming away that if your opinion had been followed you had gone first but i am sure if mine were you should never go first nor last but alas i am grown so insignificant and so useless to my friends that all i can do is to pray for them and god knows my poor prayers are worth but little i own to you that as weary as i am of the world i am not yet so dead to it as not to feel the usage the king and i meet with his troubles are more sensible to me than my own and if all fell only upon me and his affairs went well and he were easy i think i could be so too but we must take what god sends and as he sends it and submit entirely to his will which i hope in his mercy he will give us grace to do and then in spite of the world all will turn to our good  you told me in one of your former letters that you were charmed with the kings being a good son what do you think then i must be that am the poor old doting mother of him i do assure you his kindness to me is all my support under god and i am confirmed of late more than ever in my old observation that the better you are with him the kinder he is to me but i am also charmed with him for being a good master and a true friend to those that deserve it from him though i am sorry from my heart that you have so much cause of late to make the experience of it  m r i say nothing to you of any business nor of mr hamilton for i write all i know to the king and it is to no purpose to make repetitions i expect with some impatience and a great deal of fear humphreys decision as to francis

earl of oxford  st germains jan         i told him mr philips that i would fain know before he parted what he thought of my master and whether he had friends in england that he could depend upon he answered as to the first question that he was charmed with the character he had and so were a great many peopel in england but that they were loath to show themselves or venture any thing whilst he had so ill advisers i asked who those were he answered that he meant a counselle that was there who made it their bussinesse to give the king ill impressions of the protestants and to make them odious to him though they were the people from whom he was to expect most service  as i know my lord middleton must have been meant as wan of this counselle i asked him what was thought of him in england and that i was sure that no body that knew him cod look upon him as a bigot he answered that he was in very good esteem and thought very capable of bussinesse but that since he changed his religion they had not so good an opinion of him  after all this i told him there cod be nothing more glorious for him nor so advantageous as to be the means and instrument of bringinge the knight his friend into the kings interest and that if he was so honest a man as he often told me he was it ought not to be difficult to which he answered that if there was an honest man in england he was wan which was answer enuffe as he said to my question but that he like others wod be cautious till they were shure of the peopel about the king but that for his own particular he wod dey to serve the king and he made noe mystery but that the other was in his interest as much if twere not for the aforesaid raisons  i then asked him whether the great man harle he believed ever thought of doing the king any good he told me that question was very difficult to be answered that when wan examined nearly several things that he does a body might believe he had no good intentions but that he was so cuning and close a man that wan shod not despair of him though he dos things that seem very oposite to our masters interest and that his friend the knight knew no more of that particular then what he told me  i told him that since their queen cod not live for ever that my thoghts mr harle wod do very prudently to strike up with the king to have all confirmed upon him and continued to him by the king after the death of their queen he answered that if the king were master of his three kingdoms tomorrow he wod not be able to do for mr de harle what the elector of hannovre has done already  in the remaining part of the letter he gives a very improbable account of harleys receiving money from the elector and assures lord middleton that sir thomas hanmer and mr philips were sincerely in their masters

much ashamed that they will disown their ever having meant a removal as the college has disowned their having pressed mr franklin upon the point of religion  yesterday morning i delivered to mr phe mr philips mr franklins picture which he received with great protestations of respect and gratitude and said he hoped to show it where it would do good service he told me his knight sir thomas hanmer and he were to part for england the   th and did not disown but his knight was like to be secretary and himself to be employed about him if that should happen he said he could not promise to write himself but assured me when he met with any thing which was for mr franklins service he would communicate it to lilly or abram being particularly acquainted with both and spoke very kindly and with great esteem of the last meantime he said there was one thing he thought himself obliged to mention as being of great importance for mr franklin which was that he should show kindness to protestants and have as many of them about him as his present condition could allow after that he fell on honyton harley and sharply enough blaming his conduct and insinuating very intelligibly that he was not like to support himself long in the dark trimming methods he took having few or no true friends at bottom and disobliging both parties more and more  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    mrs white to mr

a cut paper anecdotes of the earl of oxford  he has promised his interest to the elector of hannover who does not trust him  the king of france by oxfords means must guarantee the succession  mr harley has assured the d of hannover by all that is sacred that he intends his faithful service and showed that what he has done was to stem a tide and that had he acted otherwise it would have ruined all and that by being in with some jacobites he is come to the knowledge of all their designs and knows their weakness and strength and by his son inlaw he is come to a better intelligence with hannover and that son was and is a great favorite at hannover but the whigs so possessed hannover of the trickish temper of harley that yet he does not entirely rely on him but demands for a proof of what he protests that he will give him this proof that he will get all the sheriffs of each county in that are low church and a motly ministry and the king of france to be guarantee for the succession for him and his son and grandson to do the same this and all other terms which he demanded harley has promised to do all in his power to perform and on his side harley demands that it shall not be insisted on to have lord wharton nor any of those that were in the ministry who are his personal enemies but such as are for moderate ways he would prove that that set were against hannover and aimed at doing for themselves but he is content to have the late chancellor cowper and some of that stamp in and this is to reconcile him to the body of the whigs and promises all assurances to him and his this is now upon the anvil and you may assure my lord middleton of it for i was told it by mr cowper brother to the late lord chancellor cowper as the greatest secret and i am sure it is most true his brother told it to him  the last two pages of this letter are decyphered in the original  the person i have named is a very cunning false man and has several of mr jenkinss the kings friends frequently with him only to draw all he can to do him the more essential wrong my council hates him harley and uses to repeat all his unfair practices yet at this time owns that he has so warded against a storm that few besides himself could have done and added that it was the opinion of all of his sort that if he gave the proofs which he had promised and orders it so to have the family of medlecot parliament to be such as they had been some years past he will be in esteem with those that now hate him here is no public news we that are called whigs are in great hopes things will go better for all that can be done yet to procure a parliament of low church men is done the sheriffs of each county where there are any of that sort of men pricked they are chosen though the counties are as averse as ever or more and it is said there will be admitted into the council several of the same sort the french ambassador has enraged the people in bringing over so vast a quantity of wine and suffering his servants to sell it from his own house by retail at six and seven shillings a bottle i know severals that have bought it so and drank it in his cellar and paid down their money there

harriss harleys measures they will have their congee given them and turned away and now there is a way in the family to give their opinion that the choice before them is writ to make it stand so

than a security for you but i flatter myself that it will prove the one as well as the other for when things of that kind begin to cool and that every body sees that the king does not cool toward you i think there is good reason to hope that they will push him no more about it and i believe it so much that i have already made my compliments of congratulation to the king upon it and desired him to make them to you from me not being able these two posts to write to you after having writ very long letters to himself i am sure you cannot doubt of the sincerity of my compliments on this occasion in which the king and i are at least as much concerned as yourself and i do assure you that had i thought your going from the king for his service i would have told you so and advised him to let you go but as i think quite the contrary i was bound to say it as i did from the first moment i heard of this strange proposal and as i shall continue to do till i see cause to change my mind which if ever i do though very unlikely you shall be the first man that shall know it but as to the troublesome hero of this disagreeable scene i shall say nothing of him here having already said all i know or think of him to the king whom i find is now very sensible how much he was mistaken in his man for lord edward i never heard a word of him but good till i saw the kings letter to mr innes i am very glad the

of january to sir joseph the king in answer to which he has ordered me to tell you that he is very sensible of cowlys church of england friendship and truly concerned for the right succession of that worthy family that the power he sent some years ago by mr lamb to constitute new overseers bishops where they were thought necessary subsists still and impowers cowlys relations the high church party to act according to the tenor thereof as occasion offers without need of renewing the same but since they are now desirous of knowing sir josephs opinion and to receive his further directions before they proceed to the choice of any new overseer you are desired in the first place to thank them for the regard and deference they have to sir joseph in this matter and in the next place to let them know that he is of opinion this is no proper time either for himself or cowly to be making any new steps of that nature  first because he is advised by his best friends and wisest lawyers to make as few plain acts belonging to his character as possible in his present circumstances  secondly because of the difficulty of secrecy in performing the thing and the bad consequences the knowledge thereof might produce in this juncture of time  thirdly because the overseers of cowleys family who are now in possession being by far the greater number ought not in prudence to be provoked at this time  for these and other reasons sir joseph thinks it will be much better both for his own service and for the good of cowleys family to sit quiet at present and defer till a better opportunity especially since the thing has been delayed so long already this you will be pleased to impart to mr heartily and mr lamb and the other trustees of the family in answer to the commission they charged you with and assure them at the same time of the continuation of sir josephs friendship and esteem for them  you are also desired to tell them to recommend to all their friends to associate with hickman harley and company the ministry and go along with them in all their measures according to the directions given last year to morley and particularly to caution his relations in probys family the parliament to move nothing of lady jeans concerns in that company unless it be in conjunction with how princess anne and his factors her ministry who will be sure to obstruct any thing of that kind that comes not

either he or downs ought to be there i answered nothing as to downs but as to lesly that his health did not allow him to make such a journey and that his presence was thought more necessary in england

in sir william elliss hand and was probably sent by him to the earl of middleton almost every circumstance is authenticated by the hannover papers of the same month about the succession to the crown after the death of queen anne and the intrigues for securing it for her brother  that what he had said in a former letter viz that mr harley and his brethren would call home the king he had it from and has since had it confirmed to him by mr netterville which is he says as much as if he had had it from mr harleys own mouth and that he has had the same thing confirmed to him at several times by mr pen the quaker  that lord mulgrave and the rest of his opinion would be glad to have the king home as soon as possible if they knew how to do it without running any hazard and that princess anne is of the same mind but timorous this he says comes from lady fretchwel  the reasons he gives for not making use of a cipher formerly sent to mr netterville in order to his corresponding with my lord middleton are that the french ministers had given him a disadvantageous character of my lord middleton that his lordship and lord melfort do not agree and betray one another that mr netterville was desired from thence that is from st germains or from paris not to correspond with any there for he would have been betrayed but that mr netterville tells him that my lord middleton and sir william ellis are honest moderate and understand the affairs of england the best of any he knows consequently the fittest to be entrusted and employed he gives another reason for not using the cipher sent to netterville viz lest mr harley should know he corresponds with any about the king and gives measures different from mr harleys and such as may hinder the king from coming to the terms which he says perhaps may be expected from his majesty that mr harley would have the king kept in the dark believe nothing but what comes from him or think of a restoration but by his means and that the king must abandon rome if he desires to come home mr netterville asked him why he did not send some body to the king to know his mind he replied the king of france would know it and would raise disturbances in england which he harley would prevent all he can which mr rogers says he believes he will do as long as princess anne lives and advises not to believe the contrary or rely on a civil war as messrs harley and netterville say they are sure we are made believe by sheridan mrs fox mr minnis mr ferguson and these mr rogers says he calls propaganda stories these he desires may not be believed because the writers are strangers to the affairs on the anvil  he says he is surprised that sir william ellis had not the papers he sent him from rotterdam and says he directed one of them to sir richard cantillon  that d hamilton proposed to obtain of the king of france four or five regiments to have gone with the king to scotland and then princess anne and the parliament would have ventured to treat with his majesty which they will not hazard to do otherwise till after the peace and till they have turned out all the low church men which being done will send to treat with his majesty and with the king of france who must give as a security for the kings performance  that mr harley manages the low church and hannover till he can get the peace settled believes him hearty to the kings interest and has several instances of it though few of the jacobites believe him to be so  the cabinetcouncil are for the king for their own interest and fear but will hazard nothing that mr harley has so watchful an eye over him rogers that he cannot go to lord mulgrave nor b  but lord yarmouth goes between them that mr netterville knows every thing and mr harley consults him in every thing and yet he meaning as it is supposed netterville would have the king restored at any rate  that they mr rogers and mr netterville would fain make duke daumont subservient to the kings interest but rogers thinks he and those about him are more capable of spoiling than doing business for he duke daumont thinks he knows more than he does will not be advised and pretends to know england of which he knows nothing at all but however thinks he may be made some use of such as to fetch and carry he desires this may be read to none but to the king  that the cabinetcouncil intend to purge the army and the guards and make a thorough regulation in the kingdom that he rogers will give a full account of all circumstances when he comes that he is told he shall after a little time be sent to bar to let the king know his true friends in scotland and england but whether he is sent or no he will endeavor to come because it will be of use to his majestys affairs though he knows mons torcy and mr harley do not desire he should go at present but he says he will find a good color when there is occasion  that a great many of the whigs have subscribed a paper and sent it to princess sophia setting forth their own strength and advising that young hannover may be sent to england whither he may lawfully come being naturalized a peer that he rogers could have got said paper secured but thought it best to let it be sent in order to let hannover further expose himself to no purpose which will turn to the kings advantage by way of postscript to this letter which is of the      february he says he had just then had a letter from holland advising that lord churchill and his friends are taking measures to send over young hannover as being the only resort he and his party have but mr rogers thinks as before the sooner he attempts it the better in his letters of the  0 february  march he gives an account of the measures lord churchill and the dutch are taking and particulars of the paper which the whigs subscribed and sent to the princess sophia viz  that princess anne could not live longer than march  that she princess sophia should order matters so as to be ready to come at twentyfour hours warning  that they will get the heads of the clergy to give princess anne a memorial setting forth that the king is coming to england and bringing with him the roman catholic religion this they believe will make the country declare for the succession of hannover and give a handle to the parliament to send for princess sophia and her grandson as the only pledges she princess anne and the kingdom can have at present for the security of the protestant religion in and out of england for the future  that they will urge in their said memorial to have the whigs share equally with the tories in the government  that they will get the d of hannovers minister in england to second this memorial which mr rogers says he hopes he hannovers minister will do but believes the cabinetcouncil will prevent the giving of any such memorial that mr harley laughed at it but looks on it to be well concerted  that summers halifax and c  r are pressing netterville daily to use his interest with mr harley to bring them and their friends into business that the person who manages this affair with netterville is his mr rogerss acquaintance and tells him also that cowper the late chancellor if he could get off handsomely from the whigs would join with princess anne in all her measures  that he rogers knows mr harley is for dividing the employments betwixt the high and low church and for having the choosing of them himself hoping by that means to be master whoever gets the crown but that the octoberclub will never suffer this and mr harley stands in awe of that club which is jealous of him already and if he should share the places as aforesaid he would soon be discarded  that mr harley has spies among the whigs that discover all their designs and he lets them play with their plot till he sees his time to break it and then they begin another this mr rogers says he knows to be true as having been employed in these matters from the beginning  that if the papers he rogers has given to the cabinetcouncil were published he doubts not they would reconcile all the kingdom to the kings interest but that mr harley believing this would lessen his credit with the king and give his majesty occasion to think what service he harley might do was more out of necessity than duty and affection has opposed and prevailed with princess anne to oppose the publishing of said papers which lord mulgrave and his majestys true friends were for having done that there are two parliament men who would fain have him rogers give them some of those papers that they would improve them to advantage but he says he thinks it too nice a thing to venture upon without advice so desires sir william elliss opinion by the next ordinary and believes the octoberclub would make a good business of it  that there is an old acquaintance of his rogers there at london who sends intelligence to princess sophia of what the whigs are doing that the said person shows him rogers all she sends that she is a great confident of princess sophias and by this means he rogers shall have a further occasion he says of serving the king  that we he says meaning as seems himself and the kings friends there must strain a point to get the king soon restored for lord mulgrave is old and lord shrewsbury is right but timorous these two he supposes govern the cabinetcouncil and keep mr harley in awe and that if mulgrave dies mr harley will send lord shrewsbury to ireland and then govern the cabinetcouncil to give the crown to whom he pleases and that this makes him harley delay and go so slow in reforming the government  that to prevent mr harleys management as aforefaid he rogers had thought fit to acquaint lord mulgrave with some late advices he had had from holland viz that heinsius is of opinion holland cannot be safe whilst the government of england is in the hands of the tories and that it should be the business of the dutch and whigs whether there be war or peace to blow up the tories or at least make them uneasy that since this advice has been communicated as aforesaid he rogers finds mr harley is uneasy and is afraid that the cabinetcouncil will join with the whigs this session of parliament to send him to the tower and to obviate it he is for making five or six peers more and to publish the peace at least with france and spain which he thinks will so far please the two houses in regard of the advantages england has by it that they will be soon reconciled to him  that on    feb  march a man of note had advice from ireland that the whigs there are ready to declare for hannover and that the west of scotland will join with them that netterville acquainted mr harley with this and advised him to proceed forthwith to a thorough reformation in the three kingdoms that otherwise princess anne could not be safe that mr harley answered no danger that the parliament will be so well pleased with his conduct and management that the whigs and their adherents will be soon laid on their backs that all the country gentlemen are for princess anne and her ministers and will not be for hannover that the whigs may make a noise this session and invite hannover to come to nose princess anne yet all will not do and they will get no point by it for the parliament will declare neither way their business will be to secure the protestant religion and order matters so now that it will not be in the kings power ever to hurt it mr rogers adds that by this means he harley will weather the point and that you he says may depend upon it if there is truth in man and i he says understand any thing the way is a paving for the king but as they are resolved to run no risque for a restoration they will take their own time and the safest way to do it and the king of france is in the secret and you will find all this to be true in the end  i he says dont think the king safe at barleduc and that the allies will stand at nothing to ruin him  that he rogers had since his last which was of the    february  march introduced netterville to d daumont who discoursed with them two hours and a half that they showed him how easy it would be for his master and him to procure the kings restoration if they would follow the measures that should be given them that the said duke answered their desire should be strictly complied with and that the king or none of his house should know any thing till the business is done he the duke told them he would rely on what intelligence they will give him and will give what money is necessary for carrying on his masters business which they had showed him was to restore the king with regard to his own safety and welfare of which he seemed to be sensible desired their friendship and assistance and said they should find their account in it  it is believed lord nottingham will at the meeting of the parliament insist on hannovers being sent for  that there is come for england one widam of camb as he pretends himself from the king of france that he told mr netterville that the king is not much concerned for the crown is nothing at all addicted to the roman catholic religion is in the hands of lord middleton and sir william ellis both deists and believes they will make him one and are not at all liked or looked on in the court of france and that lord melfort is the man he mr netterville should correspond withal this and much more such fulsome stuff it is said widam told netterville in order to his acquainting mr harley with it but mr netterville would not knowing it would do the king harm and if said man stays long he will do hurt what is or has been doing for the kings interest hitherto may be spoiled by such foolish management the man means well but mr netterville is not pleased with his actings nor any that hears him  mr netterville proposed lately to mr harley to have a bill brought in to break the triennial act and to have the army put into trusty hands mr harley answered the breaking the triennial act would seem too violent and there is reason to hope the next parliament will be as good as this the kingdom will be so well pleased with the peace that the present ministers will be better settled than hitherto and the late ministers more blasted this session than they were the last that the country gentlemen will never be reconciled to the whigs  mr rogers says that most of the country gentlemen are for having the king but will hazard nothing  that he finds after a little while the duke of berwick may have a passport to come for england that he and lord middleton and sir william ellis are not hated but lord melfort is mr netterville tells mr harley they are men of moderation which is well looked on among them in england  that it is desired the king of france or any of his may not know that mr rogers writes to sir william ellis and what he writes he desires the king only may know it  nairnes papers vol ix   to p  0 the earl of middleton to berry march  th your friend mr plessington the king read your letter to me of the  0th ult with a great deal of satisfaction finding you persist still in your former opinion that it is bakers harleys real interest and consequently his inclination to have harpers hannovers decree reversed it is certain that if aylmer the princess anne should break die before the cause be reheard that baker harley is in as much danger of suffering in proportion as manly the king and therefore it is reasonable to hope he should use all his endeavors to bring this matter to a speedy issue as soon as possible he can since delays are equally dangerous for both  i wish the late alarm he has had of aylmer the princess anne breaking may quicken him a little for what was like to happen when even berry himself in some of his last letters had no apprehension of aylmers the princess annes affairs being in any real danger may happen hereafter in effect when least feared or expected and in such a case no wise merchant who has his all at stake ought to lose a moment to ensure his effects and make himself and his partners easy  i reckon baker harley is sure of philips the peace by this time and young princess anne and he may reckon upon kemps kings friendship wanly the whigs is low at present and they have it in their power to make him them yet lower wheatly the english has but one objection against manly the king which arnot and all carys true relations the church of england know to be unreasonable since all the reasonable security carry himself can desire to remove all fears of danger from cottons partnership the roman catholic religion manly the king is willing to grant  this old dying man price the parliament is tractable baker harley has an ascendant over him and he cannot be sure of having the same credit with his successor nor that young princess anne himself will be then in being and in a condition to support him edwards englands best relations speak well of manly the king at present and the generality of wheatlys family the english are dissatisfied with harpers hannovers late behavior but these gentlemen being changeable their hearts may cool all this considered i confess i cannot see any prudent reason for bakers harleys dilatory proceedings but he being the chiefest lawyer and his own interest so much concerned manly the king must be governed by him and comply with what he cannot help and in the mean time have patience and hope the best  there follows here a paragraph in which names occur for which there is no key in the whole correspondence  plessington the king is god be thanked in very good health

ordered me to tell her so that she might take her measures for that purpose and to set out with all convenient speed the shortest way  pray speak to your friend mr lilly to indorse the bills in his custody and lodge them with a trusty person for the use they were destined in the mean time there is nothing to be said of our present affairs for all directions must be suspended till we have hannahs

charless breaking princess annes death and that  00 livres would be ordered to be paid to himself for his journey  there is some room to conclude from these two letters that lamb i e mr lesley is the

lilly lesley  is called away from you and from his delightful bower i am persuaded the parting will be mixed with grief and joy but that the latter will be in a much greater proportion and prevail for reasons which your good sense will supply you with and therefore i need mention none what i hope and wish is that he may bring with him such proof of the unity affection firmness and zeal of james and partners church of england and particularly of those of your house for the common interest of the manufactory as may be satisfactory to the principal friend mr kreely the king the chief undertaker and who as such cannot but suffer chiefly as his interest is much the most considerable by the contrary and therefore whatever misunderstandings there may have been and on what grounds soever it is certainly best for all to forget and forgive and to go enjointly to pursue the main point for truth and justice will have the better on it at last which is the great comfort and support of all that mean well and uprightly as i am fully persuaded and know assuredly all of you do and consequently will not only act conformably in your several capacities but also will give such frequent accounts of your so doing from time to time as may let mr kreely the king see your cheerful and hearty concurrence with all his measures and inclinations which if i am capable of judging right only and solely aim at the common good joint interest and welfare of all concerned this i believe is enough to say to you and those that are with you  i have not heard one word from mr nigh ned neds original letters are

sensible of your care of his and of wiselys the queens concerns and the latter gives you his kind service and is very glad you received his letter i am glad to find you still so hearty in the hopes you have of the recovery of the mortgage but i find you have no hopes that old price the parliament will move any thing in the matter so we must trust to his next heir i pray god he may prove as honest a man as you expect he will and that no breaking queens death happens between this and the hearing of the decree  there is no doubt that common interest is the best security between merchants and therefore your argument is good but interest as well as inclinations change with time and other accidents besides that many of the wisest men mistake their true interest every day but however we must be contented in these uncertain times with what certainty we can have and so young princess anne keep up his credit i hope as you do that soon or late all will go well  but i am sorry you find carry church of england so animated against poor cotton roman catholic religion who desires only to live in peace and quiet at home and to give security that he never will meddle with or disturb carry in the least i hope when carry who is a reasonable just man is truly convinced that this is both manlys the kings and cottons catholics character and their sincere intention he will not be so irreconcilable as he appears to be now that they are at a distance as for waters i do not wonder at his ill nature for he is naturally hotheaded and very much piqued at this time but i hope counselor baker harley with the help of mr philips the peace will bring him to temper i do assure you mr peacocks relations the protestants receive all marks of friendship and esteem from plessington the king that he can show them in the limited state he is in and will continue to do so not only because it is his inclination as well as his interest but because he is naturally just and impartial to all his deserving friends without distinction of families  in short he loves old edwards england so well that he will do any thing to please him that an honest man can do and i am glad to find arnot gives it as the general opinion both of friends and enemies upon change that his parting with his old friends and especially at this time would lessen his character and lose his reputation and credit with all sides he is certainly too honest a man to dissemble or deceive any body and too wise on the other hand not to comply with any thing that is innocent in itself in order to please and oblige his old

of the french kings sincerity  they desire the chevalier to perform his quarantine patiently and to declare himself a protestant  sir april  th      i told you in my last the tanners tories would carry their point in every thing and so put the gold government in the three keepers kingdoms on such a basis that it shall be in their power to give the copyhold the crown to whom they please and on what terms they please for they find out more and more the blind side of knox king of france and his mates ministers and that he is afraid to meddle or make with mr kens the kings affairs or put himself to any manner of stress to do him service  i spoke to some honest men among the partners parliament this day and find by them they have but a mean opinion of knoxs king of frances integrity and ability nothing will make him espouse mr kens the kings cause but his own safety for the future and that of his grandchildren which cannot be if hall hannover comes hither they told that it would be of vast service to mr ken the king if he did but declare himself a polet protestant the sooner the better especially if he does it spontaneously and perform his quarantine and in the mean time his friends will be disposing things to receive him for at present the temper of the menworthy the mob is not for him and it will be work of time to bring them to it for they have been served with venom this long time and must have time to vomit it by degrees  king noble netterville says if he were the patron pope he would oblige mr ken the king to declare himself a polet protestant being the safest way to secure the copyhold crown and establish the physicianresolution roman catholic religion in evelins house england and when he compleats the work appear with safety in his true shape and not be beholding to any body as for those that knox the king of france has here he looks on them to be worthless fellows they converse with none but sycophants and men that can give them no true idea of the affairs here and therefore will have nothing more to do with them for they are in the way of ruin and will do nothing that is for their own good or others so that we must stand on our own bottom and do as if there were no such man as knox king of france in the world  his agent ambassador said to me the other day his master would not interfere with mr kens the kings business before he knows what number is for him in chomily the country and their places of abode and he is assured of churchill the court and the rest of the tanners tories promise from their own mouths or under their hands noble netterville says he never will have that they will be his friends but will not trust him nor his master so that we shall be quit of him and have little or nothing to say to him i dare say he will do little good here nor carry any right notions with him from hence  i shall continue to send some things to amuse you in your country retirement at least once a week and know the different sentiments of the several partners parliamentmen it is not only my notion but it is the notion of the sensiblest part of mankind here the present mates ministers or gold government cannot be safe if hall hannover comes here and of course must have mr ken the king but on their own terms it is therefore thought they will be the harder on him that he may declare himself and i believe they may obliquely at least order him to go from where he is further off if he dont do in convenient time the longer he delays it the worse says noble netterville this is the sentiment of overton harley and the rest of his brethren  pray enclose to me from time to time to the effect i told you in my last twill be of use to mr ken the king it shall be improved to advantage so adieu  j tomson  nairnes papers d n vol iv

to his friends to support the ministry  april  th      i find you and mr noble netterville are very industrious and diligent and omit nothing you judge may any way promote and advance the interest of your old friend mr kennedy the king who i assure you is very sensible of it and takes it very kindly but as for a b abbe butler who pretends to know much of his mind he totally disowns him and what he gives out and assures me he neither has nor ever had any dealing with him directly or indirectly and was so far from giving him any commissions and instructions that neither he nor his partner quarington so much as spoke to him or saw him when he parted and that what he the said a b abbe butler gives out to be mr kennedys the kings intentions is the farthest from his thoughts of any thing in the world and which would be the last thing in the world he would do the judgment you say mr netterville made of it viz that it would do hurt if not true was very just and certainly it would do so and therefore since it is not true nor ever likely to be so it will be best not to press it or mention it any more but as to all other matters which might tend to the ease happiness and convenience of his friend mr keepers the kingdoms he would most readily concur in all that could be proposed this i know to be his mind and as for the good will and friendship the tanners tories testify toward him he is much pleased with it and wishes they may act in concert with mr churchill the court and mates ministry whom he would be very tender of disobliging on any account but on the contrary would be glad if by any means he could gain their esteem and good will  mr jenkins the king is in perfect good health and much your friend and i am with much esteem sir  your affectionate and most obedient

0th      yesterday dear sir the queen made a speech to both houses the house of commons unanimously except my lord william pawlet voted an address of thanks the house of lords carried it by    against    the duke of beaufort was the first that moved to thank her majesty he was seconded by the duke of kent my lord halifax stood up and said it was fit to know for what for they ought to have had the peace laid affore them first and how the succession is secured by the peace for the pretender is but a days journey further off is still within call that the queen when she was last in the house said she would make peace sword in hand upon which there was six millions given and soon after the sword was taken out of a successful generals hand and a peace made when they might conquer france he was seconded by my lords townsend cowper sunderland montague who all spoke with a deal of warmth and peevishness which is flying in the face of the queen and ministry and questioning her sincerity and not believing what she said  my lord peterborough stood up and answered seconded by my lord treasurer probably and a great many more of the tory lords that it was time the sword was taken out of the generals hands or else he would have been general for life and continued the war and the nation been obliged to give many millions that hannover had three acts of parliament for him and the guarantee abroad and more laws might be made to secure it more if they think fit and if they be not satisfied with the management of the ministry they might appoint a committee to examine matters and due satisfaction should be given them this my lord treasurer said  the whigs say the speech is artfully drawn and made popular for some sinister ends notwithstanding they will be as troublesome as they can and say they will make my lord treasurer uneasy but he laughs at them and values not what they can do the next parliament will be as good if not better than this the queen relies entirely on the loyalty of her subjects which is as much as to say that hannover must do the same if he comes here and be and lead by the ministry and parliament  both are wording the addresses there will be warm

friendship to hall hannover that the waggs whigs will abandon him and renounce his interest and consequently espouse mr kens the kings mr noble netterville told him yesterday that the speech was too condescending and so much in favor of hall hannover that it will be work of time to make the menworthy mob to forget him overton harley answered that he must fight the waggs whigs with their own weapons and silence them all at once and make the jewellers jacobites more modest hall hannover and ken the king more pliable and let them say and do what they will against ken the king if the menworthy mob and the tanners tories be for him he will have the copyhold the crown and it is prudence to run with the tide i e with the inclination of mr keepers the kingdom noble told him it is a mistaken policy to condescend too much to hall hannover or the waggs whigs who will not think the better of him for it i know he hopes by this means to make hall hannover abandon the waggs whigs and believes now he will if he does the waggs whigs will renounce and declare against him time will show ab b abbe butler was with noble netterville and tells him mr kemp the king is a quietest and tells

spirit him to be uneasy to overton harley and quaint princess anne they say they will move to have mrs strange princess sophia here but i am told by some sensible men among the partners parliament they will get no point by it for they had enough of strangers they talk kindly of mr jenkins the king at least to me and begin to hate hall hannover more and more because the waggs whigs stand up for him he has his seven brass candlesticks in hungals house house of commons which opens lightly in his favor one of them said the other day that it was fitting quaint princess anne should have no map money before the portion peace was laid before them if the stature large great seal be put to it she should not be ashamed of letting them see it but got no point by the brazen impudence the next thing they will do is to object against every point of the portion peace to make the mates ministers odious and egletons the emperors standing out as he does will give them a further handle to cavil i must tell you by the by if egleton the emperor would but close with knox king of france the duncans dutch will be forced to vomit up what they are to get by this pardon general peace and of course will be glad to give a helping hand to mr kennedy the king he would do well to make a proposal of this kind to him by his nephew there i knew full well the waggs whigs make him and hall hannover believe quaint princess anne will not live long and of course he must come here and then renew the weatherhot war again  i have given convincing arguments to egletons mates emperors ministers that he must not believe the waggs whigs any more i foretold him every thing that happened him hitherto he now finds it to be true to his cost i know overton harley and his brethren would be glad on it for it would give them a good handle to call mr kennedy the king home and run no risque or hazard of life or fortune it is true the mates ministers have enough under their thumb to justify their conduct in this point but they are coverts cowards so you see we must drive that nail as far as it goes you may depend on it they will keep the same conduct with mr kennedy the king as they did in making the portion peace and carry things on with the same caution which you will say will be tedious but they think it more sure overton harley is a go cart that must be pricked as he goes along  it is therefore rogers put a precept paper into his hand the other day that moulsworth lord churchill caresses hall hannover mightily and is putting him on coming to evelins house england with a good allen

sir april         i had the honor of yours of the  0th instant and can tell you rogers designs to wait on you as soon as practicable which will hardly be before the  st of june or midsummer there is a lady from hannover that has some pretentions in the french court where she will be recommended from hence and from princess sophia he will put himself into her retinue and may be useful to her in france princess sophia will take it kindly of any body that will do this lady any service rogers conceives he may be by her means being under so great a princesss protection more useful to mr evans sir william ellis and his master the king because he can appear barefacedly he must therefore wait her time  i must dear sir be under your direction whether i should see peyton polignac or tradenham monsieur de torcy before i see you i conceive i must stay some time at putney paris before i go to your parts and if i should see any body else before i see tradenham monsieur de torcy or peyton polignac it will not be taken well if it could be ordered so that i could see mr bensongs duke of berwick as i arrive at putney paris it would be of use he is i know a favorite at knox house king of france i am resolved to talk to none but him and mrs quarnington the queen i expect by your next to know your mind and will as to this point  i was last night with the gentleman mr sheridan i suppose he has the writings i spoke to you of before he tells me they are ready for the press they will see whether egleton the emperor comes to by the time prefixed if he does what relates to him will be struck out for they dont think sit to expose him about the close of the summer session they will publish them in order to sower the chammismen country gentlemen against the waggs whigs and to keep up their spirits till the new partners parliament are chosen i find he gutted the precepts papers for should they print them in haec verba the men worthy mob would tear the waggs whigs in pieces overton harley says there is a medium between scylla and carybdis and will keep it as much as he can the partners parliament will carry on their business smoothly and roundly with little or no noise but with caution and manage that of the sape succession as they did the portion peace and take their own time to do it and it will be left entirely to them this i know to be overtons harleys mind and his scheme which will be put in execution when things are ripe for it which cannot be before the next new partners parliament meets this you will find to be true i find mr yates lord yarmouth will be provided for and a great many of mr kennedys the kings friends advanced after a little time which is a good sign  as for news we have little or none the parliament took off two shillings in the pound which will make itself a high church parliament the whigs are mad at this and will be more especially if the parliament gives the broken officers their whole subsistence because it will screen the ministry and them and what they can do today or tomorrow it will be known what will be done in it so that the whigs will have nothing left to scare the vulgar with but popery and the pretender especially if they cannot get hannoversent for  they got the higher house of convocation not to join the lower in an address of thanks to her majesty for the peace there are ten bishops against the address and six pro so that it is believed the body of the clergy must address alone they got the bank and the e i c in their hands which make them more insolent  it is believed my lord peterborough will be made duke of monmouth or at least marquis  just how the house voted halfpay to the land and sea officers the whigs opposed the latter this will make the ministry more popular notwithstanding the usage egleton the emperor met with here yet he will trust and cringe to quaint princess anne and mates ministry sooner than to knox king of france for he sent one to her pray she may moderate matters between them he does it because the waggs whigs desire him and make him believe quaint princess anne cannot live long and hall hannover will come here and things will go to his mind in a year or two this i know to be true i am dear sir yours or not  j tomson  nairnes papers vol ix   to p    letters from nairne to scot and berry the pretender is attached to the scots and has great

another i writ to you of the  0th of december should not have come to your hands i shall only repeat here the substance of these two letters you was and are still desired to assure mr knowless the kings relations that he is very sensible of stuarts scotlands kindness and of the particular marks he has given him thereof all along that he could send no directions to him of late about his affairs because he is in the dark himself and has been advised by his best friends to lie quiet and not to say or do any thing till he sees clearer what dunbar princess anne and gooldings successor harley intended to do so he hopes stuart will not attribute all this necessary prudence of knowles the king to any neglect or want of friendship and confidence in him for i am authorized to assure you that he has a true and just value for stuart scotland and all his honest relations and i hope in time he will be able to give them solid proofs of it and that he is incapable of ever having any unjust partiality for estmore england in prejudice of stuart  i told you also that his friend manning lord middleton has the same sentiments and is as hearty a wellwisher of mr stirling scotland as himself could wish and i begged you to do him justice on that head and to assure all your acquaintances in that family that they themselves cannot be more heartily against uperton the union than he is and always was which scot himself can witness since he had directions from him from the beginning to desire all his friends to oppose him with their utmost might when his lawsuit was depending and indeed to think otherwise of manning would be as unjust and ridiculous as to think him a friend of hally hannover  nairne wrote long letters to berry and to abram of this date in the same strain with this

dunbar breaks princess anne dies and that nothing be done by him to secure knowlss the kings debt he is resolved to have immediate recourse to mr stuart scotland and trust his law suit entirely into his hands but that he can bring no effects with him of any kind i mean neither wine nor brandy for he deals no more in these commodities nor can his factors aiselby and masterson probably sir william ellis and lord middleton come with him for they are both sick so he will only bring a few servants with him he would be glad therefore to know whether he can be welcome in that condition to stuarts scotlands relations since his present circumstances will not allow him to make a better figure  your uncle desires you also to advise with the wisest and most substantial persons of the family who among themselves are the fittest to be the chief advocate and council in that law suit that he may comply with their unanimous advice in that essential point and lastly he desires you to inform him of the condition of adamsons affairs in your parts what quantity of effects he has where and in whose hands they are and whether any of his goods might be reckoned upon and disposed of to knowles account

emperor to carry on the weather war hot the waggs whigs making him believe quaint q anne cannot live long and knox king of france being taken up and kept in play with egleton the emperor he will not have an opportunity to send mr ken the king here with an allen army as he may in time of portion peace  we are paying and discarding the allen army every day it is observable those that were of

they cannot bear it and come up here at vast expenses to see their country ruined they speak freely and warmly in the house but we dont value what they say or can do for the kirk broke up and refused to address the queen on the peace so did our bishops hall hannover falls into the measures mr ken the king and his friends here would have him knox king of france is much reflected upon for abandoning mr jenkins the king it is mean in him to own the sape succession of hall hannover in so ample a manner this is the language of people since the pardon peace has been made public  one of hungats house house of commons asked me yesterday if i could give him a true account how mr ken the king does so the waggs whigs banter the tanners tories telling them that he cannot live long he is consumptive dispirited melancholy and very infirm so that they must not rely on his coming home this is the language of the waggs whigs now daily in the house and that one came from billingford barleduc who saw him and gives this out a purpose i told the man it was a waggish whiggish story and not to be credited he told me he was glad to hear it and that mr ken the king will have a struggle for him and is more and more in their eyes  pray let me know if mine comes regularly to your hands the post comes regularly in and i dont receive yours your last was dated the  th instant i am dear sir yours whilst

point of conscience or love but only as he knows that he has no other way of serving himself  our addresses all make mention of the succession in the house of hannover except one or two scotch ones but this i look upon to be no more than matter of form mixed with a little politics  the kings pictures i brought over i have given away and i wish i had brought over more since i found them so very acceptable here and so little trouble in getting them over i gave one to the earl of winchelsea who took it very kindly and said which i am sure he wishes very heartily he hoped to see the original

be troublesome they seem resolved to break off with us unless they are put on a better footing they all join with the waggs whigs to make overton harley so uneasy that he will be glad to resign in time some of mr kens the kings friends help them behind the curtain to pin him to the wall for they find it is the best way to make him do honest and fair things  i have no news worth your notice only the scots make a noise their representatives in both houses met in a tavern where they were not long when the d of argyle and my lord mar went from the lords lockhart and coulcairn from the commons to wait on the queen to tell her they could not see their country ruined and asked her leave to bring in a bill to dissolve the union she desired them to consider of it first upon which they returned and met several times since my lord seafield moved yesterday in the house of lords to go upon the state of both nations the motion was adjourned till monday the whigs are indefatigably busy to open as they say the eyes of the people and give out they will let the world know that day how the nation has been imposed upon and grieved and give out they will send my lord treasurer to the tower but you will find all these heats will end in fumes and vapors though the scots say they will lay a foundation for a gangernie  arbuthnot lord argyle is night and day with the waggs whigs who will ply overton

think the day will be their own they wrote to him lately that the mates ministers and quaint princess anne are on a tottering foundation and will break overtons harleys neck of which i gave him an account two days ago and that strange p sophia will never side with the tanners tories nor abandon the waggs whigs this i hinted as well to beaumont lord mulgrave who seemed well pleased with it this animates him much and his brethren against overton harley and the waggs whigs so that on the whole things seem to have a good effect  knoxs agent king of frances ambassador wonders i dont see him and oblige him and his master as i promised when he came here i sent him word by his sarper secretary i was afraid he would be scandalized to see me that is a known jeweller jacobite at his apartment being his master disowns mr jenkins the king so solemnly and that i believed he didnt want any aid or assistance in any thing since he has come into all quaints q annes measures and that their interests are the same he sent me word by a party of my name i shouldnt mistake him and that i and my master should find him and knox king of france honest in the end and he would give his two fingers to serve him and therefore desired my friendship and that i should bring mr noble netterville to him again  i am to see him tomorrow i shall let you know in my next what he says till then i am yours

relations that are knowles the kings friends are desired also to concur and comply with cant in choosing successors to mr porters present employment  nairne wrote a long letter to abram the   d of this month but he used cant names which occur in no other part of the correspondence and the letter is unintelligible except in the following passages  he blames the coalition of some with such a knave as williamson the whigs referring very probably to the opposition of the scots at this time to ministry with a view of dissolving the union and advises them to take care in this critical juncture not to countenance or foment any rash undertaking which may exasperate to no purpose charles princess anne hickman harley cowley and partners the high church probably with whom measures ought to be kept it being as you know widow jeans the kings positive directions reiterated to juxon to join his interest with hickmans company ministry upon all occasions in opposition to williamson whigs

told me at paris that the king was prevailed with to send positive orders to his friends in england to be for the peace without whose concurrence the ministry durst not have made it that his friend duke hamilton remonstrated to the king against it as the most destructive thing in nature to his interest which would certainly be most promoted by the war which involved the nation in greater difficulties and kept up a friend marlborough in readiness to assist him in case of the queens demise and that the duke was very pressing with the king not to interpose but to leave his friends to manage the party for him and expressed himself with great vehemence and discontent when the king repeated and insisted on his orders which brought the duke and the rest of the jacobites into the peace which saved france from ruin as the french themselves have often acknowledged to mr symmer when he had urged it to them and represented their ingratitude to the king and his friends  nairnes papers d

write to you the last post because of my sore eyes but i told mrs finton fox what to write to whom i refer you for all particulars i suppose you know mr overton harley is in convulsion fits since the bargain bill was rejected and if he dont compromise the matter with harrison sir thomas hanmer and the rest of the orphans octoberclub  several of hung commons and holt house of lords tell me those of southhouse of the french have nothing in them that is brave or wise neither do they take them to be cordially in mr kens the kings interest i answered they neednt suspect knoxs king of frances integrity to him and that they should exert themselves the more they suspect him they replied his agent ambassador here should give them some marks of his sincerity which he has not done as yet eating and drinking is not enough here he ought to court the partners house of commons especially i rejoined he is only come to make a parade but the next that comes will do his duty this i did to keep them in heart and up to mr kens the kings interest i know the agent ambassador acts by direction and is afraid to be seen to countenance any thing that seems to tend to mr kens the kings interest at present for he thinks there is no truth in an evelinsman englishman which shows the weakness of his master and his mate minister  rogers however continues still to blow the coals and as he laid the foundation of this late storm he may lay one for another that may prove to mr kens the kings advantage in the end for overton harley must be spurred on or else he will ruin all by his delays and false measures on mistaken policy his heart is divided betwixt hall hannover and quaint princess anne and consequently of an unsteady principle which gives room to most men to say he is an ambidexter the truth on it is he thinks if the gold government is lodged in the hands of the tanners tories only he is not long lived in it and therefore he aimed at a mixture but now finds to his cost twont do  no news here but the bill relating to the  th and  th articles was thrown out of the house of commons the whigs and tories joined in the matter it is but what i told you some time ago the whigs neednt brag for they will get no ground by it they made bonfires in the city but got no mob by it they give out the lord t  r harley will not stand his ground long but they will find themselves mistaken i hope they say they will move for the house of lords to address the queen to lay before the house who advised her to make this treaty of commerce so prejudicial to the nation or at least they will censure it but they have not strength enough to carry their point unless the tories join with them in    or  0 days we shall be able to make a true judgment of things at present none can be made of any thing i am dear sir with due respect yours to command  j tomson five or six of tanner parties the tories declare against the treasurer and tell him he must be no longer on the reserve but must be

th articles of our late treaty was thrown out as i told you in my last by a majority of   this was not done by any interest of the whigs but though it is of a very great loss to trade in general it is of consequence to the throwing a great affront upon the crown and upon the treasurer in particular to that degree that all of them who voted so who are lovers of the church and crown do own it was to make the treasurer shake at root the truth is he acts as if he was absolute and as if he thought that every body ought to be content and highly pleased with all his actings  the loyal party have complained many times of his not altering the greatest part of the whig lieutenancy and almost all the justices of the peace in the kingdom and all the employments officers and collectors of the customs excise etc these he has promised  0 times to remove but never has done any thing in it so now they say in general they will force him to act like an honest man though there is not a word to be trusted to what he ever said so that if there is not a clean house of all the whigs before next parliament it will go hard with him i am etc  mr lilly dont set out till the  d of july  cartes

prince never had a private man such honors paid him  there he put the last hand to the treaty of commerce which very treaty he afterward when speaker used his interest to throw out  when that treaty was to come before the house and several debates had been held on it just as the last debate for the final determination of the affair came on the earl of oxford wrote a letter as l l told me april   d      to mr bromley telling him that he would by no means be an occasion of a breach among friends that he would willingly let all the blame lie upon himself and the treaty be given up rather than make a division nor would there have been a division in the house that day had not sir richard vyvian got up and said that he had studied the point of commerce that he found the treaty admirably calculated for the advantage of england and he had grounded his notion on the best informations and that he could not bear to see a matter given up out of a compliment to any bodys notions when his country was to receive a prejudice by it and he laid the foundation of a debate which lasted till   in the morning being carried on purely on a countryfoot and the treaty rejected by only about   votes lord l dined that day with lord oxford who was surprised to hear that the house was sitting at nine oclock and could not imagine how it happened nor did then take a step to carry the point whereas as lord l told me had he but sent a note to his brother ned or cousin tom harley the court interest which was neuter would have fallen in with the country and the treaty would have certainly been ratified so that this point was left to the infinite prejudice of england only out of a compliment of the earl of oxford to sir thomas hanmer  a o told me sir t hanmer and the b of r were the two

me this side the water  overton harley is ill of his eyes and the eyes of his understanding are worse he is resolved not to be wise to himself or just to his friends or concur with churchill the court to modelize thoroughly the gold government before the next partners parliament so that things are at a stand and the mates ministers divided among themselves but i believe will agree at last to ruin overton harley if he is obstinate it is become a common saying now great will be his fall  mr yates lord yarmouth would fain be treasurer to mrs quarington the queen when her jointure is settled he tells mr overton harley approves of him if this does as he has been hitherto subservient to her interest he hopes she will enable him to be more so for the time to come others i believe will apply themselves to her for the same end but i believe the best way is to be neuter in the matter at least till i have the honor to wait upon her and let her know how things stand and the inconveniences and conveniences of naming a physician roman catholic or policion protestant at present overton harley says he will leave it to her  i find there is little or no regard for mrs strange princess sophia for the lady g spoke to you of lady anne bellamont desired to be recommended to southhouse france overton harley and his friends received her but coldly and recommended her but slightly so that she and the waggs whigs took great umbrage at it for they say mrs strange princess sophia loses ground here every day  i have no public news to send you it is not as yet known when the parliament will be dissolved my lord treasurer has got a defluxion in his eyes the queen is well god be praised  i believe you have and will for the future a great many visitors for mr kens the kings friends i find

i design to improve it to mr kennedys the kings advantage  i find he french ambassador is not well pleased with overton harley because he defers to make the changes he promised so often the rest of the mates ministers are out of patience with him especially the sharper bolingbroke secretary of state i suppose st john but i believe he will make but very few till the new change is over nor i believe then till egleton the emperor makes his peace with knox king of france neither will he think of mr jenkins the kings business till the blounce is secured abroad as well as at home he thinks to have good partners a parliament that will dance to his tune  the news here is that the parliament will be dissolved in three or four days august the whigs spare no money to join a good share in the

 sir 0 july 0 august      since i received yours of the  0th july i have made it my business to find out from what ground that aspersion sprung relating to your friend mr philips my lord middleton and at last have found what i must conjure our friend to be very circumspect in taking notes from whence he has the account for mrs white has engaged her honor in it to him that told it her that it shall never come to be named he speaks himself with respect of mr philips lord middleton but told her of what i shall tell you on the other side of this and the young gentleman that came with mr jacobs king of frances first agent here has been no friend to mr philips lord middleton but on the contrary has insinuated things to the agent whose secretary he is injurious to our friend altogether they have spread such a suspicious character that does and will be of a very bad consequence to him whose honor and truth can stand the test of all their suspicions but it deters and frights the great traders from engaging their stocks i cannot say it is by the instigation of mr ford lord melfort or his brother but i find the person that told mrs white was intimate with both for in discourse he told her that mr ford lord melfort had several times wept in relating the story of the unfortunate letter that he says was the cause of so much trouble to him that letter that came here and was sent back to your house and mr jacobs france so that she found by that they were intimate how this person came to speak to mr jacobs king of frances chief factor mr philips lord middleton knows and what he proposed for mr jenkins the kings advantage he corresponds with my sister brown i wish i could persuade her to take you advice but i fear she will marry and so ruin her children  the two next pages of this letter are explained and abridged in sir william elliss hand  nairnes papers d n vol iv   to no    a copy of the  d and  d pages of mrs whites letter of  0 july 0 august which are written on a cut paper he corresponds with mr inese that is with you and he is intimate with mr mennis he has given him fifty pounds on the kings account it is my lord fingale that told me that monsieur pontchartrain told him if my lord middleton was faithful to the king he was false to the king of france and he that is here i mean d daumont is of the same opinion as he says or words to that effect but it was not lord fingale that told me that the duke of powis told me he did not speak or trust himself to my lord middletons sons and repeated only at large that there were strange reports of my lord middleton when mr rogers comes he will tell you more but be sure not to take notice you have heard any thing from me  all will go well for the king when the parliament meets again she princess anne has a rupture in her belly and is dangerously ill but goes about her chamber  the proposal of this person to the king to come incognito is dangerous and foolish the parliament will do it if she lives long enough to let it sit but the terms will be cruel and unfit to take but if once in possession the power of altering in time will of course follow  the thing the late addresses that passed the parliament has no consequence my lord fingale spoke to the lorrain envoy he said he was sent to princess anne not to the parliament so should take no notice unless she spoke to him all the rest of the ministers see it was a trick of the whigs to get an advantage in the elections and the tories would not have let it pass but with a sneer and a laugh passed it  mr harley is provoked to the last degree against hannover and much against his inclination will be forced to be honest  the remaining part of the letter follows with the key interlined in sir william elliss hand  assure mr philips lord middleton of my zealous service and let him know i shall manage this affair so as he shall have full power to justify himself but i beg at present he will take no notice of what i write rogers is entrusted by the person i have named that told me what mr jacobs king of frances first man told him and to do that person justice he said he did believe mr philips lord middleton to be a man of honor i cannot find yet if he has told the same to any other person than mrs white rogers has told her several times that he feared an ill character of mr philips lord middleton in regard to mr jenkins the king she assured him it was groundless malice then he repeated that he was the cause of mr hamiltons leaving mr jenkins the king so she concluded it was from that that the malicious report came but now she finds that it came both ways mr rogers is an ill figure of a man and as ill an utterance but what he has fallen into by chance is very extraordinary and i believe that filly appearance has been of great help to him in doing what he has done i believe you will say what he has writ was well done and like a man of a better appearance he will be serviceable when at the great town paris and mr harris harley will see what he sends and supply him in the factory he is honest the traffic will require mr philips lord middletons and your head to manage he has promised me to have to do with no other in this traffic but your friend he means my lord middleton and you mr peregrine ferguson would have him to trade with mr st stafford that is with mrs rachell the queen and the person i have named would have him trade with mr inese who he trades with but he assures me he will attend mrs philips my lady middleton and by her trade with mrs racheil the queen and then buy and sell by mr philips lord middletons and your direction it is odd that peregrine mr fergusion should have under mr jenkinss the kings hand to be one of the factors for present chalk cash one of his circumstances for none here will deal with him in that way he is so indigent and other things alleged i believe very well of him but many others do not what i name of the fifty pounds given must not be named only to know if that person has ever acknowledged to have received that sum of the man i have named for he scorns to name it only to know if it be approved his giving it so because he pretends to have direction to be one of the factors named to receive an account of trade for mr jenkins the king he would have had as much more since this person would have refused a thousand pounds himself or two hundred a year to the fund if there had been a compliance from others of the manufactory what he wants in understanding the trade he makes up in zeal and bravery of spirit for the good of the company what i mean of not knowing he has told any other than mrs white is i cannot prove he has though i dont doubt but he has because of the report being spread though yet i cannot fix it on any particular person that has been told it by him you will judge when you see mr rogers what is fit to let him know since those he will deal with here will acquaint mr harris harley with what he writes for they are at his devotion to all intents and he not at all a friend only will have it in his power at once if he finds it will be so without him to seem to have had always the intention and waited for an opportunity for that is the true character of mr harris harley i find that mr innes i have named is no friend to mr philips my lord middleton and i am sure those of his character do mr jenkins the king great injury by being with him at this time and his not being in their hands as his father was has done him a great service so that his being there is not well i desire mrs philips my lady middleton will receive rogers well and not think worse of him for his figure i wish mr philips lord middleton would write himself a kind letter to mr askine lord aylesbury my friend that was at brussels who is now at paris and ill of an ulcer in his bladder he has long taken it ill he did not answer his letters which is the reason he does not write there though he is still the same mr ford my lord melfort has been once to see my friend lord aylesbury and he returned it but no more friendship will ever be betwixt them i do not know if mr rogers can support himself or if he expects to have a consideration from those concerned who are to reap the benefit i believe mr harris harley will take care underhand for by what i have found out he is at the bottom but i am fully persuaded rogers is truly zealous for the good of the manufactory and indeed every action has proved it and the use that can be made will be of consequence adieu  i assure you you are not mistaken in your friend mr bartheleme mr mathews perhaps the duke of buckingham  he is your real hearty servant and will be what he was again he desires me to assure you he is the same to all intents i am etc  nairnes papers d n vol iv   to no    the same to the same the same subject continued  a copy of the three first pages of mrs whites letter of the     august      which are written in a cut paper this copy is in sir william elliss hand     august      i have spoken to lord fingale he has told me three things alleged against my lord middleton one that when f plowden was sent on the kings business another father of theirs was taken in flanders and when they found it was not plowden they let him go and that my lord middleton was the man that knew of this business the second thing was that young sheridan told my lord that his father was sent to the elector of cologne who promised to assist the king with money but when sheridan came he shuffled him off because he found all designs were discovered to those here the third was that a letter sent by duke hamilton was sent back to the prince of orange and that he showed it him and in a pleasant manner bid him do so no more my lord asked the duke himself if this was true who answered it was false and spoke of my lord middleton with respect and not at all so of my lord melfort that of monsieur pontchartrain i find my lord fingale spoke of to the queen but she told him he pontchartrain was angry with my lord middleton and was a passionate man but he lord fingale did not speak to her the queen in the very bare terms he pontchartrain spoke them to him lord fingale which were as i writ them in my last but now this lord is convinced that all this is occasioned by malice and designs and desires that my lord middleton will be pleased to send him his instructions what the king would have moved in parliament this next session for several of the house that desire to be chosen again desire him to know what the king would have them do and they will do it sir john packington has promised to be the leading man and the rest promise to second it and i know severals that say they will sir william whitlock says he will who is a leading man if the king approves of it they will call for the box where the names of those are whom princess sophia sent to be commissioned to have the government in their hands till she could come after the death of princess anne this was sent when they thought her a dying and then the parliament if the box be produced will declare against the choice as men that are against the constitution and will take the occasion to prove that there are a number of papists in employments in that state and that they have built them a church and then prove all the disrespectful things which that court has done against princess anne and the present ministry and by degrees fall on the succession which if the parliament is as they expect will be as good as the old  the same subject is continued in the remaining part of the letter and the key to it is interlined in the original by sir william ellis  most tenants are disposed pretty well original if mr harris mr harley would once resolve it was to be done nairnes papers d n vol iv   to no    but he will keep in with both those five sunderland summers halifax cowper and russel he met and as i told you in a former letter he is in close counsel with and does many things by their instigation the bookkeeper that was with mr jacob lord bolingbroke he would have out of the office and give him a place of more profit but he will not change because he knows what he means by it if the laws do go for mr jenkins the king and that all the management cannot hinder him then he mr harley will appear as a main witness else he has taken such measures as will justify him and will have those five persons to prove how he concerted all those things for the good of mr sandy hannover though he did not believe him his friend and this is what that person who is hourly with him lord fingale says of him he is so afraid of mr medlecote the parliament he dare not do more for mr sandy hannover openly but he renders all things of no effect that is offered as to his prejudice and still gives a politic reason for it that every one in his club clearly sees what he aims at that princess annes speech at going away of mr medlecote the parliament was so ordered he could not help her saying what she did because he that it belonged to so to order it had contrived to have it so and argued the point to mrs anne smith princess anne as she consented so he could not change it though he attempted it i spoke to you before of mr rogers he is i do truly believe an honest man mr harris mr harley does certainly know of his journey further than the great town paris though it is his confidant that does employ him mr rogers will clear this point to you the parson lord fingall i have named to have told me this in regard of mr philips lord middleton is no man of great parts but most zealously honest to his friend and relation the king his wife who is at the great town paris has sent to him to come and says that mr fords broker lord melfort that was the first about mr st johns the duke of perth desires him to come to him he laughs with me at that and said he thinks it was a great way to go to make him a visit he said he was intimate with his brother lord melfort but never was but three times with him duke of perth he does not say his brother lord melfort did tell him any thing i have writ it was what i could not in manners ask him i find parker was well acquainted with him who he thinks mad all i could say i did to undeceive those that had handed those malicious reports on hearsay to come to a juster opinion  mr laur sir constantine phips that was my council that is not here now i have heard from lately by one that came from him he is sincerely a friend to mr jenkins the king and desires he may know he is so he has gained great reputation where he is  pray with my most faithful service assure mr philips lord middleton that none on earth more truly honors him that i beg he will be pleased by you to direct you to write such a letter as i may show the person i have named lord fingall only thus in answer to my letter he gave me leave to desire him to give me such directions as were approved that he may deliver to those of mr medlecotes family the parliament as i have here named what i have told in relation to mr philips lord middleton himself he has not given me leave yet to tell him but he said after some time he would give me leave to acquaint him for it was unjust that such fort of reports should not be cleared and that he was for what was just and then what was most proper to be done to cultivate all the familys interest together for that was the way to do something effectually for this is the time before the next term for all depends upon it all has been trifling till now it is come to the decision of all if this time be lost there will be but an ill prospect of recovering the estate mr rogers is obliged to be where mrs rachel is at paris for some time before he can see mr st johns the king for there is something to be done there that will regard mr harris harley by whose direction he goes with that lady i formerly named lady anne bellamont i believe i have tired you with this long scroll who am with all truth and esteem sir your most humble servant  n n  nairnes papers vol ix   to letters from nairne to abram and berry august      from the   d of june to the   th of july nairne only marked down in his book of entries that he received the several letters written by abram and berry and answered them on the   th of july he mentioned to them the address about removing the king and represented to them the barbarity of it and the weakness of complying with it he wrote page    on the  d of august to abram about lesly and the protestant chapel and he inserted in his book of entries a long letter he wrote to abram on the  0th but there is no key to it in the whole correspondence and it is unintelligible except in the following passages  mr lorimer the duke of lorrain continues to be very kind to your sister jenny the king she goes to see him in  0 or    days hence and she will give him an account herself of the obliging part his factor resident has acted upon the occasion of probys parliaments late clutter and i do not doubt but he will take notice of it to his factor and encourage him to continue and mrs jenny the king will get thanks sent to him from hence in her name by a good hand  mr lamb lesly is not arrived yet but is upon the road he will be kindly received and so will mr kemp you may depend upon it  nairne to abram dear sir august   th since my last to you of the  0th i have had two from you of the   st and   th in the first you mention cornhill as if he designed to come and see his friends here if he does i can assure you he will be very kindly received for his uncle merediths sake as well as for his own  there is no key to these names the initial letters of the cant names are almost always the same with those of the real  mr lamb lesly arrived here sunday last and i hope he will not complain of his reception for every body here is very kind to him and he has leave and encouragement to follow his trade but as the goods he trades in his religion are no less forbidden here in this country than they are in falmouth france he must trade warily and in private that people may take as little notice of it as possible this is prudent and necessary in a place where we have measures to keep and where we are not masters and the more our landlord is kind to us the less we ought to abuse it  what you say of madam arscot probably avignon in yours of the   th is now out of doors there was some proposal of going to live in that ladys house but now that is quite laid aside for many reasons  we part from hence tomorrow to go to the waters  he added in a postscript that this journey was uncertain  nairnes papers vol ix   to p    nairne to berry sir august   th i could not part for the waters without writing to you though i have little to say only to acknowledge the favor of your last of the   st july the proposal you mention therein of promoting a good work at geneva which might be very acceptable to uncle edwards england would certainly be complied with by kelly the king and morton middleton as far as would be proper for them in case they passed that way but the traveling which you supposed these two gentlemen might be obliged to is i hope now out of doors the good man in whose house they live is so kind to them that he seems in no way inclined to part with them unless it were to travel another way so in all likelihood they will pass the winter where they are and where i hope uncle edwards england will be pleased to hear that his nephew kelly the king is very kind to a caryman a church of england clergyman whom he has sent for of purpose to follow his profession with the peacocks protestants of his family and who is arrived but some days ago  this i hope will answer in some measure the ends of your proposal and ought to have some good effect with all those who will be contented with reasonable things which i am sure kelly the king will never refuse to satisfy his uncle and make the good man easy on the other hand it is but fit the nephew should be made easy too he is a sincere man and he thinks it is neither consistent with his honor nor his interest at this time to be disputing about mr ross religion so the less that gentleman is spoke of the better and he hopes all those that wish him well will comply with him in that point  a postscript to tell him that the journey to waters was uncertain because of the rainy weather  original nairnes papers d n vol iv   to no     plunkets original letter the key is in sir williams hand rogers gives an account of his reception of the marquis de torcys disposition toward the pretender and his sentiments of the english ministry  paris sept         as i arrived here i found yours i could not answer it sooner i was so taken up and besides i thought fit to see tredenham monsieur de torcy first who seems somewhat jealous of my coming here at this time of day so that he will watch my motions as narrowly as he can i had a long discourse with him and find by him there is little or no good to be expected from him or his master at least till his own affairs are well settled he desired my correspondence while i staid on this side of the water if i did not use the measures i often spoke to you of it might be of ill consequence to me which you shall know when i see you there which will be about the latter end of the month i had only one letter from noble mr netterville since i came hither he gives his kind service to you and desires to let you know he hopes to see you soon in england to your satisfaction that he does not doubt but things will go well in time i expect to have orders to go to see you soon i brought the papers i spoke to you of in my former letters tredenham monsieur de torcy desires a copy of them i promised him he should because he will see how much his master is obliged to mr kennedy the king and his friends for what has been done to this time quarington the queen has them now to peruse pray let mr kennedy the king know it and if he dont think fit he should have a copy of them i shall not give it him pray let me hear from you and you will very much oblige dear sir your affectionate friend and servant to command  j rogers p

remember you had directions sent to you by a letter in mr masseys middleton and sometimes the kings own hand of the  0th of may last by which jeremy the king desired you and all your friends of the college to press all their cowley high church acquaintances to use their utmost endeavors both with edgebury england and mark scotland to bring trevor tories into probys family parliament next term and to engage him to be ruled in every thing by charles browns lawyers princess annes ministers hickman harley and his associates  you may also remember that upon occasion of the late hard usage snell scotland had met with in probys family parliament in which it was feared he might be drawn in by williamson the whigs to join him against charless said lawyers i writ to you of the   d of june to put you in mind of jeremys positive directions that juxon should join with hickmans company upon all occasions against williamson and to tell you it was expected will morley would bestir himself as he ought in this matter and stick to his directions  i am now ordered to reiterate the same directions to you particularly in relation to  xgxz hspai elections i mean mr everard whom pray mark down lest you should forget him his business is now in hand and presses mightily you are therefore desired to set all your friends not only those of the college but all others of juxons family whom you can trust that jeremy desires and expects from them that they will spare no pains and lose no time to employ all the influence they can have upon everard the elections either by themselves or by relations and acquaintances to persuade that gentleman to be firm to cowley and to unite with charless queens lawyers and be directed by them in all that matter now in hand that hickman harley may see that juxon pretender is his friend and desires no better than to join stocks with him and trust his interest in his hands  this is what john brown the kings best friends advised as a thing which they hope may turn to his account whatever the event be jeremy the king is resolved to do his part which is the reason he now so earnestly recommends this affair to you for the third time and he expects you will give him account what progress you or your friends have done in it the rest of the letter is not intelligible  nairnes papers xol   to p  0 nairne to berry sir sept         my last to you was of the   th of august this being now the time that preparations are making to set out young price the new parliament i am ordered by manly the king to desire you to use all your endeavors and those of your friends with those who have a hand in making that gentlemans family that they may choose servants for him that may be firm to kinsy tories and agreeable to morgan the queen  this last person being certainly in power to do good offices to your friend mr kelly the king if he has any good intentions that way it is thought fit that jeffrys pretender should render himself as useful and acceptable to him as he can upon all occasions but particularly upon this of young prices forming his family and therefore it were not amiss that some prudent discreet means were found without affectation to let baker harley and young princess anne know by some of those that are in their confidence that manly the king has given such directions to his friends which i hope they cannot but take kindly and be grateful for in due time  i find by your last which i think is of the   th of august that edwards england continues still peevish against poor cotton which is no kind return to the sincere friendship of manly for all carys relations whose interest and security as i have often told he is constantly resolved to support in every thing that is consistent with his honor and conscience i hope arnot will make it his endeavors upon all proper occasions to soften edwards upon that point and to convince him how hard it would be upon manly to require things of him that are neither necessary for carys safety nor his interest for certainly wanly himself the whigs would not use him worse than that if he were to join stocks with them which he hopes carry will never force him to  nairnes papers vol ix  to p  0 nairne to scot i e mr henry straton sir sept         i shall be glad to know if you received mine of the   th and  0th of april  th of june and   th of august in that of the  th of june i told you that francis the king has desired stirling scotland and all his friends to concur and comply with cant church of england in making up of young porters family the new parliament i hope you have in due time communicated this to all the proper persons concerned and engaged them to conform themselves to franciss desire in this essential point it being now the time that this business is in agitation i am ordered to reiterate the same directing to you in which i do not doubt but you will use all your endeavors with carry carry is sometimes the cant name for mr lockhart  king and others of that kidney of your acquaintance that they may by themselves and by all others whom they can any way influence contribute to satisfy mr cant that all josephs kings of stirlings family scotland are in his interest it is hoped that this may turn to both josephs and stirlings account at least as far as we can judge in the darkness we are in therefore i hope you will be active in this matter  nairnes papers vol ix  to p    draught of an answer to mr anderson i e lord mar upon the article of religion sept       not made use of the king thought fitter to say nothing at all upon the subject referring to chapter kinard sir i am sorry to find you lay so much stress upon mr smiths the kings living being or not living being in forbess catholic family as if the issue of his law suit depended upon it when mr anderson e mar himself knows that it would be against all law to cast him upon that account since therefore you have been so plain with me upon this subject confiding in your friendship i will use the same freedom with you in telling you my thoughts of this matter  in the first place if smiths friends require this condition from him they do him no favor for he could compound at that rate with his greatest enemies and with cramond himself the whigs  in the next place living or not living with forbes must be a voluntary act of ones own free choice otherwise it cannot answer the ends for which it is required it would be but cheating and imposing upon one another which is neither smith nor cants church of englands intention  if smith be willing on one side as certainly he is to give cants family all the marks of favor and friendship that can be asked of him for the benefit of the family i think it a little hard on the other side that cant church of england should not allow him the liberty that all freemen have to live where he pleases and to follow his own judgment in a thing that relates only personally to himself and can be of no real prejudice to cant  if he were to trade with a cramond whiggish mob i should not wonder at any hardship of that kind from such people but i hope cants church of englands relations are men of too good principles to refuse the liberty to smith himself which he is willing and ready to secure to all their family in the strongest and most authentic manner that they themselves can desire  they own that the justice of the cause in question is altogether independent of mr talbot religion therefore to deal justly and impartially with smith they should begin by deciding his law suit and after he is in peaceable possession of his estate then he and cant church of england may talk of talbots concerns religion with more honor and freedom and less suspicion of being biassed by views of interest than at present  i must tell you that i know smith to be very nice upon that point for if it were to receive a crown he would not do a thing that might reproach either his honor or his sincerity he desires a union of confidence friendship and interest with cant church of england above all things because he thinks him an honest man and they may be mutually useful to one another for that reason he seeks all occasions to oblige him and to make all those of his relations that are with him easy and it is for their satisfaction that he has brought a person lately into his family who has free liberty to serve them in their own way  he had reason to hope that cant would be satisfied with this testimony of his good will toward him and that in return he would be as easy to him as he has been to his relations but instead of that he has met with more uneasiness upon that subject than he had before what he meant only for the comfort and satisfaction of his friends having been interpreted beyond what he intended which has drawn several unseasonable teazings upon him on one side and occasioned rash judgments on the other he cannot help peoples speaking but it were to be wished at least that his friends had spoke of talbot religion and him with more caution and prudence than they have done for their late reports have done him no good on the contrary they have exposed him to be looked upon as a wavering interested and dissembling spirit which is quite the reverse of his character  i must desire you therefore as you love smiths interest and reputation to use your endeavors to silence their groundless reports wherever you perceive they may do him harm and to prevail all you can with cants church of englands chief relations not to teaze upon forbess catholic account in so unseasonable a conjuncture as this is let them ask for themselves whatever they please he loves them so well that he will refuse them nothing that can tend to make them happy and secure them in their estates this which he has so often promised and resolves still in due time to perform should be sufficient and to ask more especially at this time would neither be friendly nor just  thus sir having told you freely my mind i hope you will make your own prudent use of it and employ your interest when occasion offers with ord princess anne jones harley bambery st john and others of your friends in case any of them have any good will toward smith the king to persuade them to be contented to trade with him upon the foot here mentioned which is certainly the surest for both sides for whatever he promises they may depend upon nor will he leave it even in his own power to deceive them whereas if he should at this suspicious time part with his old friend forbes catholic so easily or be any ways moved thereto by the motives represented to him by mr anderson it would not be prudent in any of his new friends to trust him half so much as they may safely do remaining as he is especially when he offers to give them all the demonstrations of his friendship firmness and sincerity that conscience and honor will allow him  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    extracts of a letter from doctor clinch his opinion of the sentiments of the ministry with regard to the succession  sept  0      as for your affairs here i can send you nothing new you will see now in a session or two whether i shall ever be so happy as to see you here or not i have no hopes any further than this that i persuade myself that it is the interest of those that are to serve you to serve you and that they have no other refuge to fly to now if this be as i imagine yet some think it impracticable because of the difficulty of settling the estate whether it shall be parted or that our friend the king should have it after his relations death etc  i do not concern myself much about these difficulties because i believe that if you are to have any good done you those that design it you will easily find out an expedient to do it by my opinion is that the generality especially those in place here are wholly guided by interest and that setting that aside it is equal to them whether this or that person is put in the possession of the estate and it is for that reason only that you can expect to have yours restored that they may enjoy theirs which otherwise i think they cannot do i have heard that the worthless lord wharton insinuated as much as this by one of his profane jests who pointing to the queen said if in this life only they have hope they are of all men most miserable  i should be extremely well pleased to find any motions made in the senate in your favor the whigs who are ever restless and struggling to no purpose you have heard addressed to have you removed this the tories though they could not refuse to join in it being near the time of electing a new senate only laughed at them for for when the addresses were presented to the queen that of the upper house was attended only by five or six whig lords that of the lower by twenty whig senators this i write that you may know how well people seem to be inclined and that you may make reflections as you think fit  nairnes

from time to time and that in six or eight months things will be ripe and forward to be imparted to him i am at liberty to go thither but must not make any stay for reasons he dont think fit to be told now  bolingbroke and oxford do not set their horses together because he is so dilatory and dozes over things which is the occasion there is so many whigs chosen this parliament though there are four tories to one they think it little but i think if there were more whigs it were better  he tells me the house of commons will let no prime minister govern for the future but manage the main point and make the crown dependent on them they will give money to have a share of it themselves by this he gives to understand that if knox the king of france would but send his agent over soon with a good spell mr kennedy the king might soon go home they are hungry a pound now will go further than ten another time i gave de torcy an account of all this matter but i believe it will be to little or no purpose for it is a maxim with him not to believe mr kennedy the kings friends  i continue to fix mrs strange princess sophia against overton mr harley and he against her i wrote him last night that i saw a letter from her and her son which says he is a worthless hollowfellow she complains the english do not go much near her now of late  noble mr netterville tells me in his letters the parliament will put in the queens power to name her successor and if she lives a little longer hannover will never see england the duke of berwick will be here the next week i am to go to de torcy with him and tell him what is proper and tell him what orders i have from england doubtless he will not be against my going to see you there noble netterville truly tells me that it is but curiosity of both sides therefore is not very fond of my going yet till he sees how matters go the parliament will be very active and stirring the treasurer and ministry look on the german minister residing in england with such disdain and contempt and he on them that they are ready to fly in one another faces when they meet the whigs call themselves the church tories to deceive the people but they get no profit by it queen is now very well but the whigs say she will die next winter and gives the emperor hopes hannover will come over for they tell them the moment the church party goes about to set aside the

well taken by edwards the english you may be sure kelly the king will continue his kindness that way and that he will never refuse to comply with any innocent lawful means to satisfy edwards the english upon rosss account religion but he hopes from all his true friends and well wishers that they will use all their endeavors to hinder his being pressed to explain himself personally upon that gentlemans subject at this time because he is convinced that even a compliance of hearing only at this time would reflect upon his honor and sincerity upon which two points he is nice to the last degree as all honest men are and ought to be and indeed wanly the whigs has sufficiently published beforehand what construction the world would put upon an explanation made in this juncture of time so that as arnot says very well the discretest and most reasonable thing for edwards the english is to leave that matter to time and providence for if wheatlys the english happiness and carys clergymans security be settled this is all that edwards the english is properly concerned in and what he can be infinitely surer of in dealing with a person whose veracity is proof of the greatest worldly temptations than if that person should by a precipitated unseasonable compliance give but too just a handle to suspect him of dissimulation  original nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    trevers

than in the last i had the honor to send to your lordship is that at my return from holland the lawyer marlborough made a solemn protestation that he had rather i think the expression was have his

something conditional he could be made easy as to his own lawsuit he would not stick to use all his interest both privately and publicly for the squires the kings service which he will do heartily and

having gained no point by it they now say it was a report from lorrain and the contrary was wrote from bar they brag they have a faction strong enough if not to bring over hannover to keep out the pretender at least this session in the mean time the queen may die they will get the emperor to hold out another campaign they contrive to advance him money as they have done already they think to put the ministry on some extreme and on a necessity to call france to their assistance and consequently bring home the pretender hoping thereby to get the people of their side as the tories got them by dr

not usual they are resolved now to go through stich with the changes through the three kingdoms tney must now sink or swim with france the whigs know it and will push them on to it in order to ruin the tories but all to no purpose they persuade the german ministers at london the emperor may have the same terms after the next campaign as now if he loses ground the balance is lost therefore the ministry must get him the same terms that was offered at utrecht or else the people will fly in their faces and oblige them to renew the war to secure the balance of power these arguments however

know the consuls sentiments of the matter besides none of these foreigners will trust me unless i be introduced to them by those that has interest with them but we must not lose much time for i find

made them jealous of each other and will spur them on to serve the consul better than they have done hitherto to put them out of their road i shall not pretend to it for it will be impossible they have chosen an uncommon common one and will not be beat out of it but they may be spurred on in it you shall have timely notice what to do in it when matters are ripe i am desired to tell the consul

ministry the king was pleased to make me secretary of the closet in which station i writ only from time to time some letters to england by his majestys immediate orders of which i kept no copy only showed them always to his majesty before i sent them but the roman correspondence being my separate province i kept entries of all my letters to rome in a book apart from that time  extraordinary as the particulars contained in the following paper may appear they are authenticated by a multitude of collateral evidences the marquis de torcy has interspersed his memoirs with many of the anecdotes mentioned by plunket and he was not an author that advanced facts upon slight grounds besides the whole correspondence to the court of st germains in the present year is full of information upon this head  nairnes papers d n vol iv  to no    jack rogers dream i e plunkets account of various and secret intrigues in england rogers having for some years been educated in gerards house germany mr egleton the emperor recommended him to mrs strange princess sophia who recommended him to some of our friends among the waggs whigs and egleton the emperor likewise recommended him to his agent then residing in evelins house england this gave the said rogers an opportunity to contract a friendship and intimacy with the said agent and the men of business among the waggs whigs whereby he had an opportunity of serving mr jenkins the king when quaint princess anne made the late regulation  the said rogers having by his daily conversation with quack mr pen a quaker noble netterville and others that were very intimate with overton mr harley and the rest of his brethren found their pulse beat very low and that they were at a loss to maintain the new regulation and it was therefore they caressed the agents of egleton the emperor and simons house savoy to bring them into their interest in order for a pardon general a general peace with knox the king of france exclusive of duncan the dutch  rogers perceiving this would prejudice the interests of jenkins the king found ways and means to frustrate their design which he brought about in the following manner  he being very intimate with one of the sharpers of egletons agent secretary of the emperors ambassador who was master of all his sophistry secrets got a precept a paper which contained in substance that the tanners tories caressed the said agent minister then more than ever making him great offers in case he would join with them as above but he assured his master egleton the emperor that such great offers of the tanners tories were an infallible sign they were not in a condition to stand their ground long and assuring him the waggs whigs had laid such a foundation as would turn the stream into its former channel and that there was no reason to apprehend the tanners tories would dare to deal separately with knox king of france or run the risque of giving any jealousy to anabaptists the allies or offending the men worthy the mob  rogers after having got this precept paper in his hand did signify to noble quack and overton netterville quaker pen and mr harley that the waggs the whigs in conjunction with the anabaptists the allies were resolved to supplant quaint princess anne and him and also that it was in his power to let him know all their sophistries secrets telling withal that his chief aim in this was purely to serve mr jenkins the king whereupon harris harley answered that he did not dislike his fidelity to his friends assuring him that he should find his account in what service he should do for him and quaint the queen  hereupon rogers gave him the aforesaid precept paper and all the precepts papers that the agent sent to egleton the emperor and duncan the dutch from time to time to the number of about twentyfour containing in substance the schemes they had laid for continuing the weather hot war or cold in order thereunto the agent prepared a memorandum to be given in egletons the emperors name to quaint princess anne setting forth that he could raise treble the allen army he had hitherto nota been that the agent at the same time advised his master to make large promises till he could gain his point in evelins house england and afterward that ways may be found to evade the performance of them with credit  which was to be printed and published in order to gain the men worthy mob and exasperate them against quaint the princess overton harley and his brethren and another precept paper giving an account that simons house savoy would stick no longer to egletons the emperors interest but would look to himself and another precept paper sent from riston the king of portugal to egleton the emperor importing that he would follow quaints the princess annes steps another precept paper proposing a method of removing quaint princess anne out of trust the throne and another precept paper containing a method how to prolong the weather hot war for two years longer these with many other matters too long to mention here being given by rogers to harris harley made such impression on quaint princess anne and overton harley that they immediately resolved upon dealing even separately with knox king of france  rogers perceiving the agent to be dejected upon account of his being slighted on this occasion discoursed with him as usually and made a bye motion to him to reconcile him to kennedys the kings interest but he being so much elated by the repeated assurances of the waggs whigs refused to favor it whereupon rogers attacked him another way and told him there was a project set on foot by lewis old danby overton harley and the rest of the society to marry mr kemps the kings sister to knell the king of sweden and by that means to restore him exclusive of mrs strange the princess sophia  the agent communicated this to his chief confidents among the waggs the whigs who were so alarmed at it that they raised all the devils in hell to prevent it and said that of the two evils they would rather have jenkins the king though a physician a roman catholic than that such a project should take which would knock all their measures down at once and ruin for ever them and their friends the anabaptists the allies  whereupon they sent to hall hannover that he would send his agent immediately to evelins house england to take care of his interest who thereupon gave in a memorandum which served quaint the princess anne cleveland cabinet council and the partners parliament to a great degree never to be forgotten beaumont lord mulgrave segrave lord shrewsbury and the rest of the society except overton harley were of opinion that the agent should be sent away with moulins a messenger but overton harley said it was not seasonable for several reasons first because the pardon general general peace was not so far advanced as to rely upon knox king of france secondly that it would give a great cause of jealousy to the men worthy the mob which may draw them away and thirdly because it would make the jewellers jacobites insolent and give kemp the king greater hopes of establishing his interest than otherwise he could expect upon these reasons that business dropped  the waggs whigs finding that the memorandum had not the effects proposed by it they sent to evers prince eugene to come with all speed to evelins house england in order to lay before quaint princess anne and partners parliament the necessity of continuing the weather hot war and how knox king of france bought the pardon general peace for maps money to retrieve which the waggs whigs were sure to carry the point by the majority they assured themselves in holton house of lords and hungate house of commons by sending two or three of clevland cabinet council to tracy the tower of london  rogers having an indenture intelligence of all this from egletons emperors agent then living at hattons house the hague gave the said indenture to overton harley and the rest of his brethren upon which moulsworth lord churchill was laid aside which mightily surprised evers prince eugene at his arrival upon this moulsworth lord churchill told ivers prince eugene that had he come before the new dozen were made in holton house of lords all would do well and that now more violent measures must be used rather than fail which ivers prince eugene agreed to consult with jonathan the junto and partners whereupon he proposed to gather together a great many of the men worthy mob to be led by some of jonathan the junto and partners to destroy in the nightime after a frolicksome manner overton harley hervy sir simon harcourt and one or two of his principal companions but halls hannovers agent did not approve of this method conceiving it would turn the hearts of the men worthy mob against his master but jonathan the junto and partners being divided in this  ivers prince eugene proposed another way which was to set fire to several houses in little town london and especially near souths house st jamess and by this means raise all the men worthy mob and the waggs whigs being sure of the gapers guards quaint princess anne together with the exchange exchequer and tracy the tower were to be seized and thereupon immediately new partners parliament to be called but horn halifax sands somers and the late collier chancellor did not approve of this  all this rogers communicated to overton harley thinking ivers prince eugene would be sent to pain prison but finding that overton harley showed it to quaint princess anne and not to clevland cabinet council he by yates lord yarmouth sent under hand a detail of the whole matter to beaumont lord mulgrave and the present collier lord keeper who laid it before clevland cabinet council at which overton harley was very much surprised and started but told clevland the cabinet council that he had the same account which he gave to quaint princess anne and another mate minister of state saying that quaint princess anne finding they were divided among themselves thought it more prudent to smother it to which clevland cabinet council replied that it concerned them too near not to sift it to the bottom therefore ordered that rogers should be called immediately before them to give a full account of the whole matter overton harley sent immediately for rogers and spoke to him as follows  rogers you have been betrayed in the sophistry secret and precepts papers you gave me to which rogers replied that he gave it by mr nobles nettervilles advice to farringdon ferguson to lard a precept paper that he had then in hand with the heads of it for quaints princess annes use wherewith overton harley seeming to be satisfied asked him what course was proper to take in the matter rogers knowing what would be acceptable to him proposed to go with him before quaint princess anne or any of the mates ministers and accordingly he ordered rogers to go along with him to quaint princess anne but beamont lord mulgrave having a hint of this from rogers underhand ordered him to come before clevland cabinet council which he accordingly did and was examined upon all the precepts papers which he from time to time during the space of two years before gave overton harley and having also declared the manner of his obtaining them clevland cabinet council was so much satisfied therewith that rogers was desired to reduce his examination which lasted two hours and a half with all the circumstances into writing and at parting returned him thanks with a promise of a settlement during life and gave positive orders that he should be forthwith sent to hassels house holland to bring back his friend from whom he had iverss precept prince eugenes paper and to discover further the proceedings of duncan the dutch and the waggs whigs  it is to be observed that beamont lord mulgrave whispered rogers that he should be full and particular in his journal because it would turn to his own and friends the kings advantage overton harley gave the following reasons against his going to hassels house holland first that if it should be found out that a physician roman catholic should be employed upon such an occasion at that juncture it would give the waggs whigs an occasion to clamor secondly that it would be enough to divide the anabaptists allies and that evelins house england would never be trusted hereafter if they should expose these sophistries secrets before the partners parliament and thirdly that it would give knox king of france an opportunity to make what portion peace he pleased when he found the anabaptists allies jealous of each other and divided among themselves  but notwithstanding all these reasons rogers was ordered to go on his journey who coming to rymers house rotterdam he met his confident and engaged him to come back to evelins house england where he should be provided for during his life he liked the offer but insisted upon having it under the sharpers secretary of states own hand this rogers communicated to overton harley but had no answer it is to be observed that notwithstanding these matters did properly belong to the sharpers secretary of states province yet overton harley took it into his own management in order to conceal it from clevland privy council and communicate it only to quaint princess anne and keep rogers out of the way as long as he could to prevent his being tampered with by clevland cabinet council  rogers was not long in hassels house holland when ciprian arrived from putney paris at hattons house the hague and gave three memorandums one to harpers pensionary heinsius one to halls agent hannover agent and a third to egletons agent the emperors ambassador containing in substance all what he and his father transacted in evelins house england and that he had contracted in knoxs king of frances name with clevland cabinet council and especially with overton harley for a great quantity of maps money in case he should agree to give a separate portion peace and that quaint princess anne desired him to tell mr jenkins the king that she would send for him as soon as possible  this was acceptable to the abovementioned three persons who said it was the only thing they wanted and that they had enough to undo quaint princess anne and destroy clevland the cabinet council and prevent the pardon general the general peace rogers being apprized of all this matter acquainted overton harley therewith as he did likewise doyle peyton and mead marishal duxelles abbe polignac and mr menager assuring them that now they had a good game in hand which if rightly managed would turn to knoxs the king of frances advantage and forward the portion peace to their satisfaction they asked how rogers answered that ciprian was to be sent with good recommendations to mouldsworth lord churchill and to the chief of the waggs whigs dignified with titles of honor and good characters from hall hannover and egleton the emperor and that he the said rogers would go with him to evelins house england and introduce him first to clevland cabinet council to let him see all the precepts papers he had along with him which would be acceptable to clevland cabinet council who would engage him in quaints princess annes interest in order to expose the sophistry secret of the waggs whigs and duncan dutch and lay the same before the partners parliament which would infallibly give them a plausible handle to destroy the shape of hall succession of hannover  mead monsieur menager replied that it was not prudent to hazard the breaking the measures so well concerted wherein rogers had a good share and the said mead monsieur menager well understood that rogers aimed at the immediate restoration of kennedy the king to his trust throne and said knox the king of france would take care of that after finishing the pardon general the general peace rogers answered that now was the proper time and that such a favorable occasion would never offer again and told them that he would send ciprian to stapleton lord strafford who went the day before to hassels house holland upon this the three retiring aside and consulting a while together they told rogers that tradenham monsieur de torcy sent for ciprian in order to give him new instructions to take care of his affairs in evelins house england and by that means he might have a better opportunity of serving both knox king of france and kennedys the kings interests  they finding that poor ciprian did bite at this bait very wisely sent him away to putney paris not doubting his sincerity  but rogers having a watchful eye upon him and discovering his intentions of going directly to the waggs whigs got him by a stratagem to hassels house holland and acquainted stapleton lord strafford with the whole matter who approved of rogers conduct in sending him to clevland cabinet council and offered to send moulins a messenger along with him but ciprian showing harper heinsius the orders which doyle mareschal duxelles and his companions gave for going first to tradenham monsieur de torcy to receive his instructions he approved of it and desired him to go with speed and promising him all the humor honour and pinimo pension he could desire n b ciprian having proposed rogers to vouch the truth of his allegation harper heinsius consulted with the agents of hall and egleton about securing rogers but he being apprized of it avoided the snare  so he accordingly went to tradenham monsieur de torcy and how he was received the reader knows  upon this rogers told doyles mareschal duxelles and his fellows that a good scheme was spoiled if this fellow should be kept in pain prison and that it was sacrificing kennedys the kings interest to theirs at present to which doyles mareschal duxelles replied that quaint princess anne and knox king of france would do his the kings business in due time and said that for his part he would be sure to acquaint knox king of france how active rogers has been in his and kemps the kings affairs both there and in evelins house england and that he acted like a man of honor especially in this particular  rogers finding that all the parleys plots he proposed for a present replication restoration must be laid aside for a time he thought of another which he expected may turn to as good account which is as follows  during his abode in hassels house holland he luckily met with a relation of his own who was conversant with the principal men that governed that house state and found by his friends and his own observation that hassels house holland was governed by waggs whigs and tanners tories as well as evelins house england and that the waggs whigs are the persons now in vogue and that the tanners tories being in obscurity during this long reckoning revolution were meditating a long time to bring about a replication restoration there after the same manner as in evelins house england  rogers being introduced by his friend to the chief of these tanners tories found by discoursing with them that they wanted only a little map money to compass their ends wherein there was no difficulty as in evelins house england he upon this proposed to knoxs king of frances agents among them to supply them and having prevailed with them to send to the said persons who came and made out that they could infallibly do it without noise or stir by bestowing a small matter on such as should be stubborn with this the agents ambassadors seemed well pleased and assured them that knox king of france should be acquainted with their good intention but peyton abbe polignac told rogers that he believed knox king of france would hardly hear of this proposal without first consulting the mates ministers of evelins house england rogers replied that he would send to get clevlands cabinet council consent but he was called away before he could have an answer he acquainted clevland cabinet council therewith which was well approved of but overton harley said that the portion peace was far advanced and it would be better to defer it till after the pardon general general peace because it would weaken the politician protestant interest abroad saying that although duncan the dutch should be humbled yet knox the king of france should not be exalted  rogers seeing that knox the king of france in conjunction with overton harley was intent upon securing their own game did resolve to ply overton harley warmly by setting clevland cabinet council upon his back which he did by communicating to beaumont lord mulgrave by yates lord yarmouth what he wrote to overton harley from time to time during his abode at hassels house holland viz  first that moulsworth lord churchill wrote to harper hensius and evers prince eugene not to let the foreign allen army in quaints princess annes service obey overbury duke of ormond thinking thereby to prevent knox king of france giving up deans house dunkirk to quaint and this would give the waggs whigs a plausible handle to send overton harley and one or two more to tracy the tower and consequently would be a good excuse for knox king of france to abandon quaint  secondly he discovered at hattons house the hague the new plan framed by moulsworth lord churchill horn halifax and sands somers for bringing hall hannover to evelins house england by publishing a model a manifesto containing that kennedy the king was coming from fitches house france with a physician allen a roman catholic army and arrived at sutlers house scotland and that hall hannover was arrived at evelins house england to secure the copyhold crown against kemp the king and that moulsworth lord churchill was to have a good allen army of his own by this means they did not doubt but the unthinking menworthy mob would join them and that quaint princess anne upon this occasion would doubtless escape as mr kemp the late king did at the late reckoning revolution  this plausible project was sent to mrs strange princess sophia not doubting of her approbation and give her consent to young hall hannover going to evelins house england  but the more penetrating heads among the waggs whigs advised her underhand to be wary in so important an affair and avoid all things that would give the tanners tories a good pretense to alter the shape succession  hall hannover sent his agent to know the strength of the waggs whigs and in case he found their interest to be as they represented it he was to be governed by them and accordingly the agent keeps very close to them who are fully resolved to pave the way for hall hannover this summer of partners session of parliament  by this they propose to gain two points first in case the tanners tories oppose it then it is clear they are for kennedy the king which will give umbrage to the menworthy mob and draw them away from the tanners tories secondly they expect to have a majority among the next partners parliament  rogers wrote to overton harley that the person from whom he had all these sophistries secrets should be sent to evelins house england to prove it viva voce but had no answer while he was at hassels house holland which may fall heavy on him hereafter  hannover papers      secretaire des ambassades  baron de grote was his electoral highnesss envoy at the court of london in the beginning of the present year grote died in the month of april and was succeeded by m de schutz whose father had been in england some years before in the same character kreyenberg was ordinary resident and galke secretary to the embassy it does not appear that monsieur lhermitage acted in any public character from the court of hannover he was probably connected with the dutch embassy at least his business obliged him to go sometimes to holland the letters from london said to have been sent by a secret address were usually directed to mr siffen at the hague  the baron de bothmar was the electors envoy extraordinary at the hague and his minister plenipotentiary at the treaty of utrecht klingraff was resident and schrader secretary to the embassy the originals of all bothmars letters to robethon are extant and likewise the originals of most of the letters written to him by schutz kreyenberg and galke but of some of them we have only copies in robethons hand which he decyphered for the use of the elector and his ministers they frequently refer him for further particulars to their letters to bothmar bothmar sent him copies of these letters decyphered in schraders hand and usually marked in his own hand at the top the date of the letter and the name of the writer as these copies are extant we have probably all the letters written by the hannoverian agents from this country from the beginning of april this year to the accession of george i in august       they indeed wrote regularly by every post to the elector himself what they called a narrative une relation  but in their letters to bothmar bernsdorff and robethon they generally repeat in a summary manner what they wrote at greater length to their master as either the originals or authentic copies of all their letters are extant we are probably acquainted with the whole subject of their correspondence during a period in which the protestant succession was thought to be in the utmost danger and designs were actually formed for bringing in the pretender  they sent by every post a very particular account of parliamentary proceedings but it differs in nothing from what is publicly known and therefore has been entirely omitted but every thing that they wrote of the private characters and conduct of the great men who flourished at this period has been carefully extracted and we know at least what the hannoverians thought of them and in what light they were represented by others  de grote was sent to great britain to obtain a pension for the princess sophia and the arrears claimed by the elector as due to his troops which served in flanders and to insist upon the pretenders removal from lorrain the court of hannover ignorant of that princes attachment to the principles imbibed in his youth were alarmed this year with rumors of his conversion and directions were sent to grote to propose some measures which they thought necessary to be taken in such an event  the earl of oxford made a motion in parliament in the following year which at the time greatly surprised the nation but now the true cause of that measure sufficiently appears the whigs had invited the elector of hannover to invade great britain with an army they at the same time endeavored to show that oxford meant only to amuse the people by an affected zeal for the protestant succession to conceal his real designs in favor of the pretender the motion bore that for the further security of the succession it should be made high treason to bring foreign troops into the kingdom a law against bringing troops into great britain to support the cause of the pretender was unnecessary since such troops if foreigners might be treated as enemies and as natives might be punished as rebels therefore the design of the earl of oxford was to allude in his motion to the scheme of the whigs to bring over the elector in a hostile manner  the queen in her speech to the parliament which met on the ninth of april in the present year expressed great zeal for the succession in the house of hannover but the friends of that family considered the speech itself and the consequent address of the two houses as an artful design of the minister to deceive the nation the agents of hannover convinced of this circumstance by the whigs represented to their court the necessity of taking some step to bring the sincerity of these professions to such a proof as would convince the world that neither friendship nor harmony subsisted between the queen and her ministers and the parliamentary heirs of the crown  the following letters were written by m de robethon at hannover to the baron de grote in london in january and february they are in robethons hand in french but decyphered by an unknown hand  hannover papers vol  0 bothmar no    measures to be

duke of argyle and his brother  a pension to be given to the lord fitzwalter etc  translation sir hannover jan  d      i doubt not but this will find your excellency arrived in london some time ago i hinted to monsieur lhermitage to speak to lord halifax of a design which suggested itself to me and which having met since with the approbation of all our ministers i have orders to write to you about it is to sound lord halifax and other friends if they could propose in both houses to bring in a bill excluding the pretender and any other papist who has pretensions to the succession with their posterity even though he should become a protestant  the reasons for such an act are so strong on account of the rumors which circulate about the prince of wales in this respect and of the alarms which these rumors give the nation that i do not see they can venture to make great opposition to such a salutary scheme if the act passes we gain every material point for our succession if the queens ministers oppose it that will unmasque them and contribute more effectually than any tiling else to open the eyes of the nation please write to me what our friends say on the subject  i am likewise to tell your excellency that remarks on the project of a barrier treaty proposed to the dutch by lord strafford are sent this evening to the baron de bothmar we have made seven or eight corrections short indeed but essential to our succession and lent an order to monsieur de bothmar to persuade the grand pensionary to try to prevail with the queens ministers to admit these corrections your excellency will receive a copy of them by the next post not in order to speak of them to the queens ministers for you know that the treaty was not communicated to us by them but in order to make use of them hereafter when the opportunity offers which can scarcely miss and in the mean time you are desired to communicate these corrections to lord halifax and other friends and to write to us their opinion of them i am etc  hannover papers vol x bothmar no   robethon to de grote translation hannover jan  th      lord oxford had mentioned the treaty of guarantee of the succession to kreyenberg and consequently would probably mention it to grote robethon desires grote to propose to his lordship in the politest manner he could to insert the corrections and additions which he had mentioned in his preceding letter and of which he now sends him a copy he complains of it as an omission very offensive to them that there was no mention of the pretender in the treaty and desires to have the person known under the name of the chevalier de st george particularly specified if it is in earnest they have abjured the chevalier if it is in earnest they demand from france to remove him and not to assist him they cannot refuse to mention him in the treaty of guarantee of our succession it is to be hoped the lord treasurer will repair the omission of such an essential clause and pay attention to the just remonstrances of your excellency on the subject  your excellency may be assured that in the act which establishes the succession and in all the acts which have been made since concerning it even at the time when the whigs had all the power in their hands there never was a clause inserted for excluding the pretender in case he turned protestant which however would be very necessary it will be said perhaps that the popish lords likewise who might be converted would be excluded thereby from the house of peers but there is a great difference between the sovereign and an individual the pretender on the slightest appearance of a pretended conversion might ruin all the religion the liberties the privileges of the nation etc this is not the case of a lord and therefore it is not parallel besides when they exclude the pretender in such a case they may if they choose make an exception in favor of the lords who would change your excellency will speak of all this to persons more capable of judging of it than i am  hannover papers vol x bothmar no    january  0th       de grote had given an account of his arrival in london what you say of the violence of the english is very true and the electoral prince to whom i read your letter thinks that your judgment of them is very just  with regard to the passage in cipher all the ministers of his electoral highness think lord halifax a very proper person to make a proposal to harley earl of oxford  who consulted him and to speak to him both about the pension for the electress and about the exclusion of the pretender to be inserted in the treaty of peace your excellency will be so good as to converse on this subject with lord halifax he always paid great attention to harley who cannot take it amiss that he should enter into these affairs besides he may speak of them to him as of himself and not at our desire  monsieur de bothmar writes to me and all our ministers agree with him that it would be proper to exclude from the crown by act of parliament all those who after completing their tenth year continue to profess the popish religion  ibid no    january   th       your excellency is in the right to restrain the excessive forwardness and vivacity of lord sunderland i shall write to you by the next post if the sentiments of lord summers concerning the pension are approved of here i am very anxious about what the lord treasurer will say to you on the subject  they write us from paris that the pretender is getting himself instructed in the religion of the church of england and discovers he finds great satisfaction in it this doubles the necessity of an act to exclude him even in case of his conversion  hannover papers vol x bothmar no  0  january   th       all our ministers order me to tell you it is their opinion that you should conform yourself to the sentiments of lord summers concerning the pension for the electress and that you should by no means offer to lord oxford that the queen and he should dispose of the offices of the household you will recollect that that offer was a thought of the electress alone who insisted to add it to your instructions and did so principally because she had spoke in that strain to that harley who was here with whom she is highly dissatisfied at present that gentleman notwithstanding all his fine protestations not having written even once since his departure from hannover  we have received no intelligence by the means of the duke of marlborough it is very proper to put a stop to the frequent visits of lord sunderland without disobliging him however if the affair of the pension succeeds you will be exalted to the third heavens i hope you shall have your share of it and i therefore prefer it in all respects to the affair of the arrears i would not say so however to   ibid no     january   th       it would be an excellent thing no doubt to oblige france to send the pretender to rome and you must neglect nothing that will induce the british court to demand it  such is the spirit of economy here especially since the speedy return of our troops is looked for that you must not expect the elector will put his hand to his pocket even for a masterstroke of party coup de party such as would be beyond contradiction to gain the duke of argyle and his brother although according to bernsdorff there is not room to hesitate a moment  another proof of this spirit of economy continues robethon is that the president told me that having insisted with our master for some extraordinary allowance for your excellency on account of your journey to london and to enable you to settle there the answer was a flat denial and that he would not give a penny above what the late m de schutz had  hannover papers vol x bothmar no    january   th       i judge of oxfords intentions from the pains which he takes to avoid you you cannot be too diffident of him and you must take care that we are not duped by him we may depend upon it that oxford is too far engaged with france and the queen to dare to be able to withdraw and even though he inclined it it would be impossible for him to bring back the queen to proper measures so that all he would gain would be to meet with the same fate with godolphin and marlborough  on this account and with this precaution the attentions which you propose to show to that minister and the manner in which you intend to behave to the queens ministers in general are greatly approved of here and it gives great satisfaction that you are agreeable to halifax and other friends  with regard to the pension we think here that sunderland and summers reason much better on the subject than halifax for upon the supposition which is but too probable of the lord treasurers intentions the great aim should be to unmask him and the other ministers publicly and to open the eyes of the nation which cannot be done but by the means of some such business as this brought before the parliament whereas whatever the queens ministers may be entreated to obtain from france about the removal of the pretender or to add to the barrier treaty will not strike the people and will be liable to chicane and consequently now when the nation is alarmed on all sides with the pretender is the proper time to bring an affair of this kind before the parliament  i refer myself on this subject to the rescript which you will receive signed by our master and add only that bernsdorf in particular recommends to you strongly what regards argyle and his brother and to see if by the hopes you shall give them both of a pension in case the parliament by their interest shall grant a pension to the electress you can obtain some important service from them this in reality is a capital point  if oxford continues to avoid you as i imagine he will and if bolingbroke does so likewise you need not be afraid of giving offense to the whigs by your familiarity with these ministers i have no hopes of our arrears  you will see by the rescript of our master that lord halifaxs advice concerning the barrier treaty and the sending the pretender into italy has been entirely followed and that it is wished you would propose to our friends to move in parliament for a bill to exclude him in case of his conversion  be so good as to thank lord justice parker for his good advice and how him that it has been regarded what does nottingham do have you seen lhermitage his electoral highness recommends to you in a very particular manner the article which regards the duke of argyle and to make his compliments to his grace  the chevalier de reden told me the other day that the electress said lately more than once at a full table that she had sent you a new regency reproaching herself for having put in so many whigs you see how we are placed judge if mr wind and secretary dalais would neglect to write this to london and is it not possible that the knowledge which the queens ministers have of it may occasion the objections they propose to make to the registration and have suggested these good advices from the whigs  copy of the rescript signed by the elector as mentioned above we understand with pleasure by your private letters that the duke of argyle and his brother appeared disposed to court your acquaintance and to give proofs of their zeal the credit of his grace must naturally be so great in scotland after the death of the queen that you can never pay too much attention to any favorable dispositions which he may discover to you you will assure him of the very particular regard we have for his person and also for his brother if you observe that they act sincerely we believe you may entreat them when the proper time comes to employ their credit to get an act settling a pension on the electress passed in parliament promising in case the affair succeeds to give them from that fund pensions proportioned to the importance of the service they will render her you will easily comprehend that you must make these promises in the name of the electress  i must tell you continues robethon in a postscript to de grote by order of our ministers who have all signed the minute of this rescript that the elector approves very much of the contents but said that it was the electress who should sign it the ministers did not at all choose to speak about it to the electress because the affair would undoubtedly be very soon made public they entreat you however to conform yourself entirely to this rescript being very well persuaded that instead of being disavowed you will be commended by the electress if the affair of the pension succeeds it is in this case clear that argyle and his brother are to be rewarded with pensions  hannover papers vol x bothmar no     january          your delivering our remarks on the barrier treaty with regard to the quarantee of our succession is much approved of here i see the lord treasurer seemed to pay some attention to them we must wait the issue you are desired to insist that the pretender may be mentioned in that treaty and mentioned under the title of the person who usurps the name and dignity of james the third king of great britain and that it may be added that it is principally against him that the queen requires of the states to quarantee the succession established in the house of hannover  all your reflections concerning a design of a bill to exclude the pretender and other papists in case they turn protestants are approved of the ministers make this additional reflection that it would call our right in question by supposing that there were cases in which that right might be doubtful and require explanation which we must never suppose or put in question the pretenders being excluded and abjured after the strongest form in all cases and without restriction or reserve should be sufficient you are therefore desired to drop the design of speaking of it to our friends much less to the queens ministers i imagine halifax will be of this opinion  ibid no     february         i see lord bolingbroke has declared himself sufficiently concerning the guarantee of the succession in the barrier treaty i allow him that an englishman should not consent to tie up the hands of future parliaments by a treaty but that is not the question here he leads you into an error for the point in question now is whether the states l to the examiner but all the ministers are determined to urge him again and hope to succeed they find it very just  but you are to promise nothing  hannover papers vol x bothmar no     february         when the session of parliament approaches you must consider the affair of the pension for the electress it is a good sign that her majestys ministers discover uneasiness on account of these measures it appears thereby that these gentlemen are afraid the nation may see clearly and that they are not in perfect security it is proper therefore to continue to curb them a little  ibid no

sterling to lord fitz walter you may assure his lordship and lord sunderland of this and concert for the future with him the necessary measures in all this affair in order that my lord sunderland may be reimbursed in the  00 l he advanced to his lordship and your excellency will lose no time in communicating to him the resolution of his electoral highness in his favor providing at least he has not already absolutely changed sides which i do not expect the flying post will have  0 l and not  0 l sterling as i was told at first  when you bring the affair of the pension for the electress on the carpet please tell o probably oxford that his relation who was at hannover assured the electress frequenlly that there was nothing more just that the lord treasurer would contribute to it with all his power and he himself also it will be proper to put both the one and the other in mind of this at the proper time  letters from robethon to de grote continued original hannover papers vol marked

the pretender scruples were then raised in the queens mind concerning him and lord jersey endeavored to serve him long before the memorial was presented by the baron de bothmar they have exerted themselves to bring about a peace merely to pave the way for the prince of wales that memorial had at least the effect of making the queens ministers proceed with more caution and if we had done nothing all the consequence would have been that these gentlemen meeting with no obstacles would have accomplished their design much sooner  that lord oxford is devoted irrecoverably to the pretender and to the king of france is what we had no doubts of long ago although his cousin when he was at hannover endeavored to impose in that respect upon the electress and the electoral prince with whom i did not choose to dispute the subject for they would not have failed to reproach me with my partiality for the whigs and i choose rather to wait until your excellency having observed the matter yourself should bear testimony to this incontestible truth  with regard to the project of going over with a body of troops now to england monsieur de bernsdorff would have wished that all that passage had been written in ciphers rather than any other and his excellency orde me to tell you that as that design requires absolutely the concurrence of the states general and their men of war it is impossible to think of it at present since the states general give their whole attention now to hasten the peace and to gain the good graces of the queen and of her ministry imagining they have done enough for us when they signed the treaty guaranteeing the succession we must therefore according to mr de bernsdorff give time to the states general and to the english nation to be sensible of the pernicious consequences of the peace and then we may take juster measures  the question is if the king of france will not in the mean time establish the pretender by force but how can we do otherwise if the queen dies before the pretender arrives all things will be easier and the states will be obliged by their guarantee to assist us but it is the opinion of monsieur de bernstorff that if it was necessary during the queens life time to take such measures against her majesty and her ministers we would meet with terrible difficulties from the party in the nation who love the queen besides it is almost certain the elector in that case will never bring himself to such a resolution this your excellency will very easily conceive but we have every reason to hope that in case of the queens death the elector will do whatever can be expected from him of which your excellency may if you please give assurances to our friends  monsieur de bernstorff judges the scheme of having ships of war from

the sentiments of those two jacobite lords must be attributed to the memorial of monsieur de bothmar and with regard to the proposals of the whigs contained in the end of these dispatches viz the sending over troops to england i must refer myself to what i had the honor of writing to you about them the thing being impracticable without the concurrence of the states general upon which we cannot

elector wishes much that you would acquaint general mac cartneys friends that they should write to him to come by no means to hannover for that would be a very great misfortune and embarassment to the elector at this juncture and might set him at variance irretrievably with the queen this is strongly recommended to you i also write about it by order of his electoral highness to the baron de bothmar and to the duke of marlborough   monsieur de bernstorff orders me to repeat to you that the project of going over with a body of troops now into england is absolutely impracticable because the thing is impossible without the ships of the states general who are very far from being disposed at present to embark in such an affair and indeed it is all they could do if they saw the pretender actually in england they are afraid for themselves as long then as the queen lives and the pretender is out of england and while the queen makes no direct attack upon the rights of her electoral highness it is not to be imagined that the elector will enter into the measures proposed by the whigs who are generally too sanguine  monsieur de bernstorff is very angry to find by monsieur de bothmars letters that the whigs communicated schemes of this kind to general schulenburgh it is probable he will not make a proper use of this confidence and that abbe passionei the popes nuntio at utrecht being his intimate friend is informed of it by this time  the electress and the electoral prince are entirely undeceived in their opinion of lord oxford since his fine discourse to your excellency about the pension of the electress they could have wished here that at the first conversation in which your excellency spoke to lord oxford of the pension you had delivered to him the memorial on the subject because lord oxford not relishing it and the memorial being presented to him however after it was known that he received it unwillingly would say perhaps that we wanted to vex him but to this in my opinion no attention should be paid at all in this affair nor in that of removing the pretender  original hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no    from hannover the  0th of march      from the electors ministers asking the opinion of their friends in england concerning the measures to be taken upon the queens death translation the queens situation obliges us to desire you to ask the answer of lord sunderland lord summers lord halifax and lord townshend to what follows  what are the steps in general which we should take here after we have received the news of the queens death  what procurations patents or orders should we have ready to be sent then wherever it will be necessary  mr bernstorff is of opinion that in case of the queens death as the electress cannot set out immediately nor travel with the necessary dispatch the elector or on his refusal the electoral prince should set out for london without the loss of a moment and that on the first news of the queens death ships should be kept in readiness in holland for the security of his passage  we ask in that case    what kind of procuration should the elector or the electoral prince have from the electress how far should it extend should it authorize him to disolve the parliament and to call another to dispose of all places to imprison suspected persons etc    we ask if the electress after the queens death can establish until she arrives in london a different regency from that which is appointed in the instruments now in england or at least add to it or retrench from it as she chooses    in case the queen dies before your excellency has changed the instruments can you still establish as regents the lords named in the last instruments and make them valid    can the electress after the queens death authorize the elector to dismiss this regency and take the government into his own hands composing his privy council of such persons as he shall think deserving    if it is necessary that the regency should subsist until the electress arrives we ask what share of the government can the elector or the electoral prince have jointly with the regents  at the same time that the electress sets out for london monsieur de bernstorff would have the electoral prince or duke ernest to repair to ghent bruges and dunkirk in order to secure those three towns place good governors in them and administer oaths to the english troops which garrison them    we ask how should the order be drawn out which the electress will give to the prince whom we shall charge with this commission  m de bernstorff wants that mr cadogan should be at hand to go over to england upon the first notice of the queens death furnished with the necessary orders from the electress for taking the oaths of the troops in england breaking the suspected officers filling up their places securing the tower of london etc we would choose to have these orders for mr cadogan with patents of the offices which will be given to him ready in the hands of the baron de bothmar in holland bothmar will speak on this subject to cadogan who goes to holland now from the duke of marlborough  we shall endeavor to know from the duke of marlborough by the means of cadogan what part he would choose to act in case of the queens death if he would go directly to london being one of the regents or go along with the elector robethon has already written that it is desired here that he should stay within reach and that instead of going to live at francfort he should settle at wezel  lastly we ask similar explanations concerning the internal affairs of the kingdom with regard to the great offices which must be disposed of in order that we might have the patents ready and with regard to every thing else which our friends will judge necessary we must have some form of the patents for great offices  we ask if the queen being dead the electress should write to the lord mayor of london and in what strain  a copy of the preceding queries was sent to bothmar hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no    at the hague to be communicated to mr cadogan who was to come to holland on a commission from the duke of marlborough and bothmar in a letter to robethon ibid no     on the   th and in a postscript to it on the   th of march gives him cadogans and marlboroughs answer to these queries  it was the dukes opinion that the elector should go to england immediately upon the queens death with full powers from the electress as her lieutenant general the kings of england he said frequently invested lieutenants to govern the kingdom in their absence with all the authority and power they possessed themselves  cadogan thought that the electoral prince should not go to take the command of the english troops on the continent but that bothmar should provisionally have powers in his hands to authorize the duke of marlborough and himself cadogan to secure these troops and the fortresses they garrison if the electress did not choose to sign a commission of that kind it would be sufficient to have one signed by the elector in her name the troops upon seeing a parchment with the great seal of his electoral highness would readily obey a man so agreeable to them as the duke of marlborough it was not necessary to follow the form used in commissions of that kind in england nor to write one in english the duke of marlboroughs commission and his own were in england and he could not send copies of them but it would be sufficient to say in the new patent that he was now invested with the same powers he had formerly from the queen  when the duke of marlborough was sure of the fidelity of the troops abroad he might follow the elector into england and leave the electoral prince with cadogan to command the troops  cadagon thought it was very necessary that he himself should have the commission of lieutenant general and governor of the tower under the duke of marlborough or the electoral prince bothmar however was not thoroughly convinced of that necessity  cadogan gave bothmar the character of some officers colonel cholomondely who commanded the second battalion of guards which went back to england was attached to the protestant succession and the two battalions officers and men might be depended upon major general sabin who commanded at ghent a timid man but well affected at the bottom and might be managed brigadier sutton who commanded at bruges was entirely dependent on the ministry but to make amends colonel hill who commanded the regiment of royal scots might be depended on the commandant at dunkirk a scotchman and two battalions of that nation were thorough jacobites but the eight english battalions were well affected and would give a very good account of the other two and of their commandant  cadogan concluded with recommending from the duke of marlborough that his electoral highness should have some one with the pretender to send exact and speedy intelligence of every thing that happened the duke offered to find a proper person if the elector would lay out fifty louisdors a month and in the mean time he would endeavor to have some news of what was done openly at the pretenders court  bothmar writes in his postscript that cadogan approved of the commissions sent to marlborough and to himself he gives it as his opinion that cadogan should be employed to command the troops abroad that there might be an opportunity of doing something at home for mr stanhope who was well affected and a man of abilities  mr cadogan says bothmar has named to me the three correspondents who may be employed to procure intelligence of the pretender    one of the magistrates of huy who is a capital enemy of the jesuits and is for that reason called the messenger of the jansenists    an irish officer of the name of carol who professes the popish religion but is a protestant in his heart and who has friends and relations at the pretenders court    a lorrain gentleman who served in the army and whose name was remiremont he had forgot his real name  these correspondents are to address their letters to m sapporin director general of the post office at brusselles who will send them to me to the hague the three together will cost sixty louisdors a month  intelligence concerning the pretender baron de grote fell sick at this time and robethon corresponded with galke the secretary of the embassy in a letter dated the   st of march      he communicated to him the following intelligence he had received from paris concerning the pretender translation original hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no    the affairs of the prince of wales clear up from day to day it appears that abandoning his religion for his interest he is resolved to be of the church of england he left all the roman catholics with the queen his mother at st germains none but protestants are about him at bar except lord middleton who turned roman catholic in france from mere policy he is a man of merit and of all those who followed king james he is the only one whose desertion gave uncasiness to the government at that time the address of the city of perth in scotland has no doubt been sent to you it is the more remarkable that the deputies who brought it to london were presented by lord oxford the duke of shrewsbury must make a very poor figure in all this affair it appears the ministry sent him to france merely to keep him at a distance from business the correspondents of the stuarts say just the same thing  since every thing is transacted by the means of mr prior  there are several letters from robethon to galke about this time but they principally regard the affairs of germany denmark and sweden in a postscript to one of them dated the   th of march he desires him to communicate the enclosed intelligence to m de grote it is in schraders hand and marked on the top in robethons hand communicated by my lord marlborough

he had just received a letter from major general hill governor of dunkirk in which he informs him that the disturbances in england and the credit of the whigs increased to such a degree that there will be a necessity perhaps of asking succors from france and that for that reason dunkirk will not be demolished because it is the most convenient part for embarking these succors  this gentleman from furnes wrote these particulars to a friend at brusselles who showed the letter to father ernest  father ernest wishes his name may be concealed but he will continue to write every thing he can learn concerning this affair  intelligence concerning the pretender translation ibid no    it is marked on the top in robethons hand communicated to m de bothmar by my lord marlborough  the duke of lorrain upon frequent solicitations from the pretender and an order from the court of france has been obliged to write to his imperial majesty for two passports for the pretender one for going to the waters of aix la chapelle in the month of august next and the other for going to reside afterward at liege or cologn the pretender has asked these passports and is to go to liege or cologn by the advice of his friends and of the very ministry in england in case the emperor refuses these passports the pretender will go to reside at the abbacy of st miel on the banks of the maese and frontiers of lorrain he has very weak lungs and will not return to bar where the air is too sharp for him he is now at commercy and has in his suite the earl of middleton lord edward the son of the duke of perth mr strickland mr mac donald mr floyd  they are so very silent about every thing done in england that a gentleman about the pretender having said to one of the court of lorrain that their affairs went very well in london and this discourse having been reported to lord middleton was dismissed and sent back to paris  mr seldon formerly governor to the pretender having quarrelled with lord middleton is likewise sent back to paris five persons lately come from england had secret conferences with the pretender and my lord middleton they concealed their names and the object of their journey so carefully that it was impossible to discover either the one or the other it was remarked however that they were received with distinction and that the passports in question were asked soon after their departure  the affair of the passports was trusted to a very few persons and as this is a fact about which information may be got at the court of vienna the person who gives this intelligence refers to that circumstance as a proof that he is in a situation to be well instructed in the demands and designs of the pretenders friends  hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no      enclosing an answer to the memorial inserted above and forms of commissions  he proposes to the elector to send the electoral prince to england  translation sir london april        i embrace this opportunity of a secret conveyance to send you the answer to the memorial you sent me some time ago this answer was drawn up by lord chief justice parker with the advice of lord summers and lord cowper you will find in it a very clear description of all that the electress may do when the event happens  i send you likewise the form of a commission in latin for constituting the elector or the electoral prince after the queens death custos regni and justiciary of the kingdom in the name of the electress this commission was drawn up by these three persons with great care there are besides two other commissions one in latin for a lord lieutenant of ireland and the other in english for a captain general such as the duke of marlborough has been i shall send you likewise in a few days a commission of high admiral and one of lord treasurer and i hope that will be sufficient to instruct the court of hannover in every thing they can do after the queens death and before the successor arrives here  since it is so difficult for the elector to contribute to the expense of the ensuing elections all friends agree to make another proposal to him which is of greater consequence and which appears to them to be absolutely necessary it is to send over the electoral prince it is true an invitation by a vote of parliament was formerly spoke of but all friends are unanimously of opinion that such an invitation in the present situation of affairs in such a parliament and under the influence of such a ministry is impracticable  they are of opinion that the electoral prince being a peer of the realm and his precedence as a prince of the blood having been regulated by act of parliament has so many just pretexts and reasons for coming that those who should oppose him would thereby do themselves the greatest injury which their greatest enemies could wish them if the elector will consent to this point it will give such support to the friends of the succession that the other affair of the money will not be necessary this is the unanimous opinion of all friends and they have charged me to write it to you  we have a fleet of    ships of the line ready here it is not pretended any longer that it is for the baltic the treasurer said three days ago that it was intended for an expedition of quite different importance  original hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no     the same to the same the same subject continued  april  0th      he had sent the preceding letter with the commissions etc by a gentleman belonging to the deceased baron de grote he promises again in this letter to send the other commissions soon and urges by a repetition of his former arguments the necessity of sending over the electoral prince as a sure and easy and as perhaps the only means of saving the succession this journey must not be delayed in hopes of an invitation which is absolutely impracticable if the prince was once here it is the opinion of all his friends that they would easily obtain any pension they would choose and in a manner suitable to the dignity of the family  with regard to the removing the prince of wales they will not fail to propose it in the strongest manner in parliament if they carry it it will be a great point gained if they lose it it will be so much the worse for those who shall oppose them for they shall be exposed thereby to the indignation of the people in the elections  robethon after his translation of these letters for the electors perusal adds these two letters were written by lord sunderland to mons de bothmar when he sent him the answer to his questions and the patents he asked mr doynhausen brought them all i have made the enclosed translation of the answer to the questions i dont send the forms of the patents to your electoral highness as they are written in latin and with so many abbreviations that it is difficult to read them but copies shall be written of them  besides robethons translation the original of the answers is extant as follows  ibid no     answers to the questions of the memorial inserted above drawn up by the electors friends in england and sent by lord sunderland to the baron de bothmar at the hague the following considerations will possibly furnish a more clear and useful answer to the queries proposed than strictly pursuing the order of the queries and breaking that which will be offered into separate answers to each distinct particular    the instrument for nominating lords justices ought to be sealed up and deposited with the archbishop etc during her majestys life or their validity will be too doubtful to be depended upon for the instruments already sealed up and deposited are effectual appointments of lords justices until revoked or altered and when there is an intention to revoke or alter them the act page     appoints a particular method how that is to be effected by three writings under hand and seal requiring them to be delivered up and till that be done by the express words of the act page     the instruments sealed up and deposited as aforesaid are those which are directed to be brought before the privy council there to be opened and read and afterward to be enrolled in chancery and therefore as often as it shall be thought fit to make any alteration in the three instruments it ought to be kept in mind that the alteration is incomplete and that nothing is in effect done till the old instruments are taken up and the new sealed up and deposited in their place and that during the queens life in robethons hand    in case of the demise of her majesty the regency established by the act of parliament may be entirely abolished by the successor before her or his arrival in great britain the kings and queens of england have by the common law a power to constitute a regency in their absence in such manner as is aforementioned and this regency established by this act was not intended as any diminution of the royal power but is merely provisional to prevent an interregnum before the successor could arrive in person or constitute a regency and when either of those things happen the end designed by it is fully attained accordingly by the express words of the act in the clause page     which makes the seven officers lords justices they are appointed lords justices and empowered to execute all acts of government no longer than until such successor shall arrive or otherwise determine their authority and by the next clause the persons nominated in the three instruments are only to be added to the seven and to act with them as lords justices as fully and in the same manner as if they had been particularly named in the act and consequently their authority will be liable to be determined in the same manner as the authority of the seven who are particularly mentioned  but whether some of the regents may be removed from the regency after they have once entered upon it without abolishing the whole is doubtful the successors arrival of course determines the authority of them all and whether the power of determining their authority otherwise as the words of the act run mean not a like determination of the authority of them all is not clear enough to be depended upon in a matter of this consequence it is yet more doubtful whether those who are lords justices by virtue of the act either the seven officers or those named in the three instruments can act together with any others to be added anew to them by the successor after they shall have entered upon their office  therefore in case it should be thought requisite to remove any of the old or to add any new the safest way will be to determine the whole regency and constitute one or more person or persons lord justice or lords justices with or without restraints and with such directions as shall be thought fit    the successors power to determine the authority of the lords justices appointed by the act before her arrival in great britain supposes the power to appoint a new one or new ones by the common law and in case of the demise of her majesty during the life of the electress it is agreeable to law and seems in itself proper and requisite that she should appoint the elector her son or the electoral prince her grandson lord justice of great britain custos regni et locum tenens with power and directions in case he shall see it fit and convenient to dissolve and determine the privy council and appoint a new one to dissolve the parliament and call a new one to remove all officers and dispose of all offices and employments in the disposal of the crown which will extend to those of the seven regents not for life and to execute and do all other acts of government in the name and stead of the new succeeding queen as if she were present in person that she may do this before her arrival in great britain is plain because it is a proper regal act often done by the kings of england and the clause page     which gives force and effect to such seal as the succeeding queen or king shall make use of to affix to any instrument to execute and do any regal act proves that such succeeding queen or king may do regal acts before her or his arrival in great britain that the privy council may be determined appears page     where it is continued six months unless sooner determined by the next successor  that all officers not for life may be removed and others put in their places appears by the same clause and it is to be noted that in that clause concerning the continuance of officers of the privy council all the officers appointed regents except the archbishop and the chief justice are expressly named therefore it is to be observed they may be removed from their offices though it be doubtful whether they can be removed from the regency while it continues and it seems plain that the removal of them from their offices does not of itself remove them from the regency nor will their successors become lords justices in virtue of their succeeding to those offices for the regency is not annexed to their offices to go along therewith but page     the seven officers afternamed who shall be in possession of their offices at the time of such demise of her majesty are appointed lords justices until the successor shall arrive or otherwise determine their authority where it appears that those who shall succeed to those offices are not within the words to be lords justices because not in possession of those offices at the time of the demise of her majesty and those who were in possession at the time of such demise are continued until the successor arrive or otherwise determine not their offices but their authority i e their authority of lords justices  that the parliament may be dissolved is certain and may be collected from page     where the regents constituted lords justices by the act are restrained from dissolving the parliament without express direction from such succeeding queen or king therefore by such direction those lords justices may dissolve it and much more therefore may another lord justice appointed by the succeeding queen or king not under the restraints laid by the act upon the provisional regency    the prince so appointed lord justice custos regni et locum tenens may by virtue thereof take upon him the whole government and upon his so doing and producing his patent the regency appointed by the act will be determined however it may be proper to have an express clause for determining the regency inserted in the patent to prevent all doubts in that case and nothing more is requisite to the abolishing the regency    the acts done by such lord justice pursuant to his authority will in law be the acts of the sovereign however the privy council the parliament and officers being appointed to continue for some time unless sooner determined dissolved or removed by the next successor to leave no room for doubt it may be proper to insert express powers and directions for the lord justice to dissolve and determine the privy council to dissolve the parliament and to remove officers if he shall see fit    the removing of any officers in the disposition of the crown and appointing new ones is a regal act which may be done abroad taking care to declare of what effect the seal whereby the instrument is sealed shall be and as to offices to be executed in great britain the instrument granting the office or directing the regents to grant the office may be sent over before the next successor or the custos regni can arrive consequently a captain general may be abroad appointed to command the forces abroad and to secure their fidelity etc  the regency will have power sufficient as to the forces in great britain but yet the successor may appoint a captain general for them too if it shall be thought requisite    a particular power to seize and imprison suspected persons will be neither necessary nor useful the ordinary magistrates have sufficient powers for that purpose    it is to be observed once for all that any dormant instrument for any of the purposes aforesaid sealed during her majestys life will be of no force by the laws of great britain  original hannover papers

parliamen affirm that the treasurer could not have given a more fatal blow to their influence in the nation and to the security of the protestant succession than by making the queen declare that a perfect friendship subsisted between the two courts halifax townshend sunderland summers orford cowper and the lord justice parker consulted together for two days but could not contrive any probable means of preventing the consequences of the treasurers designs the two first lords came twice to kreyenberg in the name of the rest to represent that it was necessary the elector should take some step that would undeceive the nation kreyenberg proposed that they themselves should make some motion in parliament which they knew the ministry would reject this would discover the insincerity of their protestations they answered that the ministry would then represent them as seditious in the eyes of the nation who believed implicitly the queens declaration and as designing to create a misunderstanding between the two courts and they gave it as their opinion that the electoral prince should take advantage of the queens declaration and come over to england which would greatly embarrass the ministry  hannover papers vol marked schutz fills   p    letters from m lhermitage the queens speech was artfully designed to mislead the people  the only way to undeceive them is to

disadvantages of it to the tories  it is influence on the elections  the conduct the prince should follow  london   st   th and   th of april      the queens speech which you have already received is very artfully composed to blind the eyes of the people especially the article which insinuates that there subsists a perfect understanding between her majesty and their electoral highnesses as if the queen did nothing without consulting the elector when at the same time she has not even a minister at hannover  eight of your principal friends who dined together on thursday at my lord halifaxs have given me in charge to tell you that there will be no resource unless the electoral prince is sent over soon all these fine compliments to the electoral family which are contained in the queens speech and in the address of the two houses should encourage your court to approve of this journey and they furnish the most natural pretext in the world which is to come in person to acknowledge thankfully such obliging declarations and pretend to consider them as very sincere for it is but just to pay the dissimulation of the queen and of the treasurer in the same coin and his electoral highness cannot but be sensible of the unbecoming manner in which they treat him by publishing from the throne that they do nothing but in concert with him while they neglect to give the least answer to the two memorials presented by the deceased m de grote concerning the removal of the pretender and the pension of the electress and while they sacrifice entirely at utrecht the interests of his electorate and of his office as high treasurer of the empire  at any rate here is the finest opportunity in the world to catch lord oxford in his own snare it would seem that providence presents it to you for gods sake do not neglect it for when you would choose to recur to it hereafter it may be too late  the prince does not require an order to come here either the invitation of the parliament which is not to be expected from a parliament so ill composed as the present or the permission of the queen which most assuredly she will not grant if it is asked he is entirely at liberty to come of his own accord being naturalized and being duke of cambridge and a member in the house of peers and his rank as prince of the blood being settled the queen herself cannot forbid him according to the laws neither to come into the kingdoms nor to take his seat in parliament and her majesty and her ministers after such public and solemn declarations which the queen and the two houses have lately made cannot retract themselves and will be obliged to receive the prince well while every one will turn to him as to the rising sun seeing the queens health is so broken  my lord halifax told me that the friends would by no means propose in parliament that it would be necessary to have some one of the electoral family in this country for that would be questioning a right which your princes have obtained and give a handle to parliament to take in that respect some improper resolution which might render the coming of the prince more difficult neither will they speak of the pension for the electress but i believe they will bring the removal of the pretender upon the carpet  the friends are very desirous that the elector should immediately resolve to send over the prince in order that he may arrive during the present session of parliament which will not continue but two months and may take his seat in the house of peers not in order to vote with the whigs and against the court but in order to take possession of what is due to him and to convince the nation of the falsehood of the rumors they circulated that the elector is indifferent about the crown of england for in other respects our friends agree that the prince should make his court to the queen pay attention to the ministers caress every one without distinction of party and refrain from coming to the house when party questions are debated since he would be obliged if he came on such occasions to vote either against the court or against the friends of the succession  that the nation is for the electoral family and against the pretender is evident now to a demonstration since the court imagines they cannot carry the ensuing elections but by means of her majestys declarations in favor of the family and the members of the house of commons that they may be chosen again for the next parliament cover themselves in their addresses with the same mask of a pretended zeal for the protestant succession an example which will be followed in all the addresses that will be presented on the peace from all parts of the kingdom  the lord treasurer publishes every where in the counties that his electoral highness is in perfect concert with the queen and will be very well pleased that the members recommended by the court should be chosen this artifice succeeds to the treasurers satisfaction in many places and as he has besides money to lay out and is very liberal of it on such occasions the whigs are discouraged thereby from offering themselves to be chosen from the fear of being disappointed so that there is a danger of having a new parliament as devoted to the ministers as the present after which these ministers being absolute masters for three years will easily accomplish their pernicious designs and establish the pretender in this country  the presence of the electoral prince in the kingdom  the sending the electoral prince then is an infallible remedy against present evils and against such as are dreaded hereafter it is easy it is natural it is unexpensive and without any risk in the present conjuncture insomuch that i cannot conceal from you that if our friends who ask it with so much earnestness see they are refused they will believe themselves absolutely abandoned they will hope for no further resource they will lose courage and take their own measures  lord halifax would have the prince to come post with a valet de chamber and two footmen under another name without his order of the garter and without liveries and take his passage in the packet boat with a passport from lord strafford procured under a borrowed name the rest of his servants and baggage would follow in short the only question is to come speedily and secretly and every thing will go well  hannover

that it was absolutely necessary in order to quiet the minds of the people and to succeed in the elections for the ensuing parliament  bothmar had always dissuaded their friends from insisting on this

world and does not deviate an inch from what he has once undertaken and being very clever there is reason to think that the treasurer will not consider him as an indifferent enemy and that his hatred will give him room for serious reflections  this nobleman is offended at the haughty manner in which the treasurer treated him and because he discovered that the treasurer designs to bring over the pretender whom he does not favor though he is deep in all the other schemes of the tories but it is said he has estates in ireland which he would be in danger of losing if the pretender came over  the treasurer has discovered long ago that he is neither loved nor esteemed by any party the affront he lately received when the treaty of commerce was thrown out makes him sensible of the danger to which he is exposed and will hasten the execution of his design of bringing over the pretender to which the queens state of health will be a further inducement the king of france likewise is offended for

with the whigs after their fall they assured him that they would willingly renounce all pretensions to offices and support his measures with all their force if he would humble france and free them from their fears of the pretender but he laughed at their offers and followed a different plan in consequence of which they have constantly opposed him they are determined to do so at the expense of

by the late baron de grote that he will never abandon them and that on the queens death he would do every thing which the nation could expect from him and having renewed these assurances after the death of de grote by his resident kreyenberg in the strongest and most positive manner it would be surprising that they should doubt of these assurances from a prince who is known to be a religious observer of his word  the elector does the greatest service to the wellaffected in england which the state of affairs in europe in general and his own particular situation will allow when he engages the emperor and the empire to continue the war against france and employs   000 of his own troops against that kingdom this puts it out of the king of frances power to send an army with the pretender into england and it is not to be supposed that he will venture to go without a french army since he is proscribed by the laws and has the nation against him if he does will the friends of the succession who are so rich and have so much influence and have the nation and the laws on their side lose courage and submit immediately when their religion their laws their property and their liberties are at stake especially when they are sure of speedy assistance from the elector the nation must exert itself for the elector cannot save them against their will  the elector is at so much expense on the troops he employs on the rhine that he cannot give the money demanded for the elections besides he should fail infallibly as the court would always have the heaviest purse and such a measure could never be kept so secret as not to give great offense to the english ministry  there are several objections against sending the electoral prince there can be no security for a safe passage it will be impossible for him to go secretly the ministry might put obstacles in his way and they might subject him to mortifications after his arrival the elector has been so often amused

lhermitage that they did not know what to do since france will be no sooner delivered from the war of the empire than the pretender will be in england and then it will be impossible to answer for any

the prince of wales the friends of the family here will have strength enough to support their cause until the elector arrives and they are all of opinion that the presence of the elector would be infinitely more useful than that of the electoral prince not only in that case but even at this very time but as they imagine that the elector would not choose to come before the queens death they proposed that the electoral prince should come as he has such a just pretext for this which regards himself alone being a peer of the realm and they propose this not only in view of the queens dying soon for the danger is then by no means so great but in order to have a support and some one to counteract the designs of the ministry who will use the authority of the queen while she lives the administration of affairs which the laws place in their hands for concerting such measures with france that the pretender will be here in an instant and then it will be too late to prevent him  all this is so clear to common sense and must be particularly so to the elector who knows better than any one the engagements of the ministry with france that it is very surprising he should hesitate a moment and from any jealousy he may have of the electoral prince if he will come himself as i had often the honor to tell you all his friends will rejoice at it more than at the coming of the electoral prince but if he will neither come himself nor send the electoral prince i assure you that all friends of all ranks will consider themselves as abandoned perhaps this will not be relished at

employ all sorts of means to engage oxford and his friends in your interests promising to continue them in their offices and to protect them against marlborough and his adherents after the death of

jacob mears advises the elector to employ some men of address in england with powers from him to gain the leaders of the tories by promises and money who might easily be prevailed upon to abandon the

sessions of parliament i shall begin with our courts entering into a stricter and greater union with france than ever notwithstanding the collusive manner with which the french king has evaded

place instance their affectation of writting to such princes not to receive the pretender into whoes countries they are sure he will never come and their making no step in earned toward the removing him out of lorrain notwithstanding the addresses of both houses and that his being there or in france is the same thing by which means the article in the treaty of peace for the security of the protestants succession is eluded to this must be added the giving all employments millitary and civil to notorious jacobits the putting the governments of scotland and ireland into the hands of two persons who are known friends to the pretender the choosing the    lords to serve for scotland of which two were with the pretender last sumer and most of the rest declared jacobits the ministers

prince would go to england there were  0 or  0 great men who would hazard their fortunes and their lives to serve him if the elector himself would go they would furnish him any sums of money that he should judge necessary for the execution of his designs a proof of the possibility of this was that eight or ten persons were able to furnish the emperor with three millions they would furnish money much more readily for the preservation of their own country  they again entreated his electoral highness very earnestly to grant the pensions they ask for some poor lords who want necessary subsistence and if they cannot engage his electoral highness to agree to any thing they propose they will endeavor to provide for themselves as well as they can and yield to the times he told me that

relish the proposal but found the present times too critical to be able to come to a determination adding that he did not believe that it was the interest of the chevalier de st george to determine any thing positively in the present conjuncture and that he was disposed to give the chevalier marks of esteem and regard when the occasions offered this in a few words is the answer that was made to me i remarked however in continuing the conversation with the prince of trauston that far from being averse from this alliance they would desire it much especially if the chevalier de st george was restored to his dominions as it is not doubted will happen in a short time  this minister found that there was a disproportion of age between the chevalier de st george and the youngest of the archdutchesses niece to the reigning emperor and that they would be more inclined to settle the youngest of the archdutchesses his sister the first being only twelve and the last two and twenty years

delay has been that i could not till now find an opportunity of giving information to the chevalier de st george who appeared to me to be very sensible of the marks of regard and esteem which the emperor has shown him and he has given me in charge to write to you about this in order that by my orders you might show that he has a grateful sense of the emperors behavior that he has a mutual esteem for him and will seek every opportunity of cultivating that friendship and regard which the emperor has testified for him he expressed himself in the most obliging terms you will therefore

written to the emperor to show his gratitude but that he did not believe it became him to write for the first time as an incognito i want to know though for no other reason but pure curiosity if the emperor would receive or answer a letter from the chevalier de st george and write to him as king  i forgot to tell you that i had for a long time the curiosity to ask you as particular an account as you could give me of the temper the genius and the education of the four archdutchesses the sisters and the nieces and as i have the pictures of all the emperors i would choose likewise to have those

written above  in various letters to the earl of middleton sir william ellis and others from their correspondents in england it appears that some friends proposed to the chevalier de st george to change his religion at least to have protestant servants and a protestant clergyman with him to satisfy them in this last particular mr lesly the famous nonjuring clergyman so often mentioned in these papers under the feigned name of lamb was sent for to barleduc in the room of mr west who was not so well known mr lesly wrote a letter on the subject addressed to a member of parliament it was openly handed about by the party and at the same time the chevalier himself wrote another on the same subject  nairnes papers d n vol iii  to no    and vol iv no    abstract of a letter written in his

with the same sincerity you write them  i shall therefore begin by putting you in mind of the last conversation i had with you upon that subject to which i have nothing to add but that i neither want counsel nor advice to remain unalterable in my fixed resolution of never dissembling my religion but rather to abandon all than act against my conscience and honor cost what it will these are my sentiments and had i others or should i act contrary to those i have where is the man of honor that would trust me and how could ever my subjects depend upon me or be happy under me if i should make use of such a notorious hypocrisy to get myself amongst them i know their generous character could not but detest both the crime itself and him that should be guilty of it and would they but give themselves time seriously to consider i am persuaded they would not make my religion the only obstacle to my restoration it being itself the greatest security for their liberties properties and religion by putting it out of my power ever to invade them should i intend it which is so far from my thoughts that on the contrary i am most willing and ready to grant all the reasonable security that can be demanded of me in relation to all these points all my desire being to make them a slourishing and happy people  i can have no other interest but theirs whereas how many other rightful heirs are there to the crown after me who being powerful foreigners may have inclinations equal to their power and may very probably never give rest to england till they enslave it in good earnest  will my subjects be always so blinded as to make a monster of what is in effect their greatest security and not perceive and endeavor to prevent the real and just causes they have of fear and apprehension  my present sincerity at a time it may cost me so dear ought to be a sufficient earnest to them of my religious observance of whatever i promise them for i can say with truth that i heartily abhor all dissimulation and double dealing and i love my subjects even now too well not to wish as much for their sakes as my own that they would at least open their eyes to see their true interest and timely provide for their future peace and quiet  i know my grandfather and father too had always a good opinion of the principles of the church of england relating to monarchy and experience sufficiently shows that the crown was never struck at but she also felt the blow and though some of her chief professors have failed in their duty we must not measure the principles of a

he refusing to agree to they came to l l and told him the case and that there was no doing any thing with him and therefore they determined to go the one into oxfordshire and the other into berkshire next morning and as he was to stay in town they begged of him to show himself cool and reserved to him l l said he was sorry for the occasion of their going but he would not quarrel with an old friend without reason they said all that they desired of him was to show himself cool to mr harley which he determined to do after they were gone lord l wrote a letter to mr harley acquainting him with harcourt and bolingbrokes being with him and their resolution and told him very plainly that if he went on at this rate he would lose all his friends and nobody would have any thing to do with him

delivered to mr harley whilst they were with him and they saw the superscription to be lord ls hand bolingbroke asked l l afterward what was in the letter for he said he never saw a man so struck in his life time as harley was after reading it the issue was harcourt and bolingbroke were satisfied and staid in town  harley used often to complain to lord l of the tories having been cut out of business for above twenty years and of their unfitness for it and had therefore a mind to bring over a capable whig or two but the least motion of it put the tories in a slame and he could not do it  harcourt had complained often in very feeling terms to lord l that he knew no more of the measures of the court though he was l c than his footman that lord bolingbroke had not made him a visit of a year and lord oxford did not so much as know him but just before the queen died bolingbroke brought him into his measures and they were entire confidents  oxford and bolingbroke had always been pushing one another from the very time of their power and laboring to supplant each other lord oxford told l l upon asking when he had seen harry st john and l l answering that harry was a man of business and he had not seen him of a long while that bolingbroke was betraying all their counsels to lord marlborough and that he owed the finding out of the secret to little dartmouth and erasmus lewis had made the discovery  it is certain lord marlborough was very fond always of harry st john and on the loss of his son the lord blandford said he had no comfort lest but in harry st john whom he loved and considered as his son and notwithstanding the difference on account of party the duke always had a regard for him  bolingbroke in the midst of his struggle with lord oxford was hated mortally by lady masham and abominated by the queen for his loose life and oxford was in the height of his credit so that he must have fallen if he had not been necessary for the scheme of the peace he being the only man about court that could speak french or transact any thing with mesnager or the other persons sent over by the court of france or to be sent into france  about the same time or a little after the first overtures of peace the quebec expedition was set on foot in which lord oxford refused to gratify mrs masham in an affair relating to it by which she would have got a good sum of money she though his relation resented this highly bolingbroke improved the moment struck in with her and told her he would get it done in spite of lord oxford he did so and she stood by him afterward  lord oxford who was for serving the king this seems to be a mistake  fancied bolingbroke was engaged in that scheme and therefore thought to strike in with the h of h this completed his ruin and he was mistaken in his point for bolingbrokes view was the h of h and the night after lord oxford was out l l came to kensington to get the queen to sign some papers which he deferred upon the duchess of

disturb her he saw there waiting for lord bolingbroke who failed them charles caesar john drummond etc john was to part in a days time for holland to engage lord albemarle to negociate for them with the court of hannover and these and others then in waiting as john drummond himself told l l were all in that scheme the earls death blew up this affair that ministry lasting only three days and the house of hannover not sensible of their obligation to them  lord marlborough landing as it were the moment of the queens death i was apt to fancy he might be in that scheme but l l said he did not believe it and he heard lord bolingbroke in company with himself lord bath and others on the day of the dukes entry into london speak with a violent resentment upon it and say he ought to be sent to the tower for it  december the   th mrs a o told me that lord oxford opposed the duke of ormonds list of new officers for the army because it was composed of bagnals mathews and other irish and because the duke of ormond insisted that the officers turned out should be paid for their regiments and posts which they had purchased with their blood which the new officers proposed were not able to do nor could the exchequer then supply  0000 l which was the least it amounted to that upon lady mashams quarrel with lord oxford about her share in the  0 per cent reserved out of the assiento contract which was intended to be shared between her etc she sent for a o to apply to the duke of ormond who said she could not pretend to have so much credit with the duke though perhaps her mother might that her mother was sent for and she a o went to sir john stapletons where the duke was to sup fetched him away to kensington where lady masham told him how ill the queen was and how uneasy at nothing being done for her brother and that if he would but secure her  0000 l of the ten per cent which amounted to  00000 l she would join with him and he should have the modelling of the army etc as he pleased he was afterward introduced to the queen who was ill this was the year before her death in order to offer his service to serve her brother and have the modelling of the army etc granted him but instead of giving any assurances or making any proposals to the queen who was prepared to grant him every thing he only asked her if she had any commands for him and went away without saying more  the duke of ormond took it ill of lord oxford that when he desired   00 l a year pension might be settled on lady hales lord oxford proposed to make the dukes own pension  000 l instead of  000 a year and offered to get it done and then the duke might give her as much on his own estate but lady hales piqued herself on having a pension from the queen and made the duke refuse the offer and quarrel with lord oxford who would not grant the   00 l a year pension  when lord oxford was turned out bolingbrokes scheme and harcourts was for the house of hannover to make the duke of marlborough general and if the duke of ormond submitted to it to allow him the post of lord lieutenant of ireland if not to turn him out of all and slight him  hannover papers        notwithstanding the votes in parliament the security of laws which had never been infringed and the manifest attachment of a great majority of the nation the family of hannover misled by the ignorance of their agents and the violence of the whigs continued to think that their succession to the throne was in the utmost danger the elector himself harassed and fatigued by the eagerness of his agents and the vehement remonstrances of those who called themselves his friends had become extremely indifferent about a throne so difficult to mount he had during the whole course of the preceding year declined to gratify the whigs in sending over the electoral prince he refused to satisfy either their avarice or their wants with pensions he would not give them money to influence the general elections in their favor he rejected their violent proposal of invading the kingdom with an army having failed to awaken the ambition of his highness they applied themselves to his humanity and his fears they represented that their liberties their fortunes and perhaps their lives were in the utmost danger should the pretender succeed to the throne they insinuated that neither the elector himself nor his family could be safe upon that event in the heart of germany that a prince who considered them as rivals in the succession would never sit down contented till he had reduced them so low as to cease to be an object of terror this last consideration had at length such an effect upon his highness that he permitted his envoy in london to demand a writ of summons to the electoral prince as duke of cambridge a transaction that made a great noise at the time and is fully explained in the following papers  the attention of the people having been gradually raised by this and similar circumstances the queen and her servants found it absolutely necessary to concur at last in appearance with the sentiments of the nation they had hitherto succeeded notwithstanding the arts of the whigs in establishing a general opinion that a perfect harmony subsisted between the courts of great britain and hannover whatever affection the queen might have had for her brother a great part of it was obliterated by his bigoted attachment to a system of religion which she abhorred she however secretly wished that he might succeed her in the throne but her servants would be extremely willing to retain their power by gaining the good graces of the house of hannover a foolish circumstance which rendered ineffectual all endeavors of the late ministry to establish themselves in the good graces of the court of hannover as i shall particularly relate in another work it may suffice to hint at present that a delay in conveying a very inconsiderable sum to a very inconsiderable french vagrant robitban then at hannover out of the service of some german prince it is not known how got into some credit with the elector  gave the opportunity to a more industrious party of corrupting that channel through which all the ideas of the dispositions and designs of the queen the ministers and the whole british nation were conveyed swifts enquiry and she herself sent mr harley this year to hannover to inquire what further securities the elector thought necessary for the succession of his family to the throne she offered to concur in whatever he should demand excepting the sending over a prince of his family to reside in the kingdom this she thought was the same thing as to descend from the throne she and her ministers were much blamed by the whigs for refusing to invite the electoral prince that party had forgot that they themselves had been equally averse from such an invitation when they were in power for my own part i freely told my opinion to the ministers and did afterward offer many reasons for it in a discourse intended for the public but stopped by the queens death that the young grandson whose name i cannot remember should be invited over to be educated in england by which i conceived the queen might be secure from the influence of cabals and factions the zealots who affected to believe the succession in danger could have no pretenses to complain and the nation might one day hope to be governed by a prince of english manners and language swifts enquiry   the lord treasurer while a commoner and speaker of the house voted for all the acts that were passed in different sessions of parliament for settling and securing the succession in the protestant line notwithstanding what has been supposed by the court of hannover and asserted with uniform vehemence by the whigs no decisive proofs can be advanced that he ever favored the pretender during the four years of his administration in the two last years when he found himself declining in the queens favor and felt a consequent diminution of his influence in the cabinet he made all advances to the court of hannover consistent with the aukwardness of his manner the reserve of his temper and that affectation of secrecy and design which he thought absolutely necessary for a minister and which he probably used to conceal his own want of extensive talents a discerning reader will perceive even through the complaints and prejudices of the hannoverian agents that this unfortunate man wished sincerely to secure a retreat for himself behind the succession in the protestant line he paid no court to the jacobites and high tories that was not absolutely necessary for continuing himself in office bolingbroke was the principal adviser of all the violent measures which contributed to increase the terrors of the whigs and to continue the suspicions of the house of hannover  the apprehensions of those who were or pretended to be wellaffected to the succession in the house of hannover were not entirely groundless the jealousy of the electoral family could not altogether have proceeded from the inventions of faction the misrepresentations of party or the ignorance or blind zeal of their agents in london though queen anne was perhaps conveniently free from strong attachments of any kind though she was actually too dilatory and unenterprising in her nature and timid in her disposition to engage in any dangerous undertaking though she was probably as averse from bringing over the pretender during her life as she was from seeing a prince of the electoral family residing in the kingdom yet it can be now no question but toward the end of her reign she was favorably disposed toward her brother and would have been well pleased without any trouble or danger to herself to have secured for him the eventual succession of the throne he himself was no stranger to this circumstance and he formed his expectations accordingly in a declaration published immediately upon her demise he says of her good intentions toward us we could not for some time past well doubt and this was the reason we then sat still expecting the good effects thereof which were unfortunately prevented by her deplorable death  the court of hannover though the suspicions of their agents were greater than the truth could not possibly be strangers to the queens intentions notwithstanding all the kind assurances and protestations of friendship received from anne it was natural for them to suspect her sincerity when they saw that all the avowed friends of the pretender supported all her measures the character and manner of her minister were calculated to increase the suspicions of the electoral family with some abilities he possessed all the weaknesses and even stooped to the meannesses in which the whole art of every shallow politician consists regardless of sincerity in his political conduct he often promised more than he had either power or inclination to perform flying perpetually from the point in his conversation upon business he disgusted mankind in general in proportion to the eagerness which men entertain concerning their own affairs it was only when he meant not to adhere to his word he gave any answer at all and that was even then contrived in a way that rendered it ambiguous there was an air of secrecy in all his manner and visible in every feature of his countenance and an affectation of mystery and deep design even in trifles this defect in his character was so little calculated to gain the confidence of others that it actually exposed himself to suspicions when in reality he might have no bad designs  the repeated charges brought against the earl of oxford in the hannover papers may be justified by the defects of his own manner and mind but his colleagues in office especially the viscount bolingbroke were more sanguine in their temper and determined in their measures an inveteracy arising from mutual injuries had subsisted between them and the whigs for several years it was foreseen that an universal change of men and measures would take place upon the demise of the queen that the electoral family would employ the whigs in the administration of their affairs whenever they mould succeed to the crown that the tories would be humbled and those at present in office be in danger of their lives and fortunes it was therefore natural to suppose that men in such circumstances had entered into secret measures to form a shelter for themselves against the storm which was gathering over their heads their common prudence if not their principles might be supposed to direct their views to the pretender but notwithstanding all these appearances there is reason to believe that had the queen lived for some time longer even bolingbroke would have found means to reconcile himself to the house of hannover having held an uninterrupted communication with the duke of maryborough who was much more attached to the recovery of his own power than to either of the rivals for the british throne  these devils of grubstreet rogues that write the flying post and medley in one paper will not be quiet they are always mauling lord treasurer lord bolingbroke and me we

french army i e  0 or   000 men before any of the family is here in what manner england and france in conjunction will concur in your ruin and in the destruction of a family which they will know they disobliged so much by robbing it of a crown which was destined for it and of which they will not believe themselves to be in peaceable possession while that family remains on a good footing i leave it to you to consider what efforts they will make to ruin it in one way or other  you must be sufficiently convinced ever since the same thing has been so often repeated to you that the ministry of this country make great efforts to weaken our party among the people by making them believe that the oaths which they take as well as the act of succession regard the electoral family merely because they were the nearest protestant successors at the time when these acts were past and that as they were past merely to prevent the danger of seeing the crown of these kingdoms fall into the hands of a roman catholic the principal design was to have a protestant successor that therefore it was sufficient to answer that design and that to find a protestant successor who was nearer of kin than the electoral family would be a thing which was just and to which every true englishman ought to be naturally inclined  these reasonings have their weak side of which i wish the nation was as thoroughly persuaded as i am but the real state of this kingdom at present is that all honest men without distinction of party acknowledge that although of every ten men in the nation nine should be for us it is certain that of fifteen tories there are fourteen who would not oppose the pretender in case he came with a french army but instead of making any resistance to him would be the first to receive and acknowledge him  it is likewise very certain that if some prince of the electoral family came now to this country all those who are at this time in office would hasten to make their court to him and things would be made quite safe and solidly settled in our favor  what answer shall i make to these facts which i know to be certain how can i encourage men whom you do not choose to acknowledge or support either by money or by sending over some one of the family or in short what other measures can i take which will give them courage at a time when they know for certain that the next session of parliament will not end without enfringing the acts of succession and what remedy do you imagine you can then apply which may prevent or disconcert their design is it mr harleys embassy and the manner in which the lord treasurer and he explain themselves to me is it the proofs which they give you of their attachment at utrecht in short what is it  for my share sir i entreat you to employ all these reasons to convince our master without being restrained by any apprehensions of hurting my fortune thereby i had rather lose it by saving men of honor who are in the interests of his electoral highness and by showing him the true state in which his affairs are in this country than fail to inform him of his danger of losing both his succession and perhaps something else  these things must undoubtedly appear disagreeable to you judge then how i must consider them and with what satisfaction i can hear them repeated to me so often by all those who are generally acknowledged to possess abilities and zeal and who have had the constancy till now of remaining attached to our interests although without a miraculous interposition in their favor as well as in ours they must believe themselves to be absolutely lost seeing themselves entirely abandoned by those in whose cause they run every kind of risk  hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no    mons martines to robethon

been ill and upon the first notice of it the jacobites who have been over looked while others were under discouragements and who had provided themselves in arms seemed ready to make a push for their favorite pretender and many of the popish and jacobite nobility and gentry came to town as is suspected with that view whereupon friends i cannot give their names here met and considered what might be proper upon this emergency the safety of this place soon appeared to be of the last consequence to the cause in general in this country both for its being the fate of the government here and so a right place more observable and important for the life and spirit it must give to meaner and remote places and because of the public moneys being for the most part lodged here a good morsel for their stomachs  to secure this place therefore the magistrates who are generally well affected and who have the executive part of the law in their hands were spoke to and desired earnestly to augment their guard and take care it be in right hands to arm the honest people of the town and to have a watchful eye upon all strangers and suspected persons to prevent a surprise and so pary the first shock

succession and for the pretender which he proves by their conduct these two years he thinks it is not by them we should expect to be maintained in our rights to the succession and as they are convinced themselves it would be too late after the queens death to attempt to set the pretender on the throne they will exert themselves to secure it to him during her majestys life  nottingham thought they would do this by the assistance of france or in an attempt to alter the regency bill and expected the elector would at last agree to the only remedy which all his friends judged would be effectual viz to send over the electoral prince your friends will not fall without employing all their efforts to preserve you the crown and as they see that all their representations to you have been in vain that you do not deign to believe them and judge perhaps that it is their own interest which influences them to speak in this manner they will demand of the lord chancellor a writ for the

oxfords view in proposing to alter the act of regency translation from the high dutch london      february      upon the late change of the ministry there was a general rumor that the queen was to send the earl of rivers to hannover to desire the elector to send a prince of his family to reside in england which at that time the treasurer gave out as a thing determined upon and even told the lords summers and halifax as in great confidence that the queen intended to offer the elector the command of the army in flanders and this was told in such a manner that these lords believed it but it was soon found that this story was only to amuse the nation and to re establish credit in some degree and that the treasurer might know the disposition of the house as in the infancy of his ministry he could not know how every individual would allow himself to be managed  the same rumor was spread two years ago at the meeting of the parliament upon which however i will not insist as it appears to have been rather a direct mockery than that the situation of affairs then required it but now things are come to a crisis a new parliament is chosen and the first session which is always a delicate matter has not the desired effect trade is interrupted france is victorious over the empire and behaves with haughtiness to her friends as well as enemies the lord treasurer by his haughtiness and breaches of promise is personally hated by many people a considerable party begin to make an outcry about the succession and other things the bank and consequently the public credit is in a very bad situation the stocks fall the people are discontented and lastly the queen is in so bad a state of health that nobody believes she can live long  in such circumstances it is not to be wondered that the treasurer falls to his old shifts and finding that the report of the duke of kents going to hannover has little effect as every body is persuaded that were the court in earnest one would be sent of some interest in either party he now gives out that the queen has given occasion to an invitation and that secretary bromley was not only to propose it to the lower house but was in person to go to hannover to deliver the queens message  what i have said above of the lord treasurers conduct particularly with regard to lord riverss embassy must necessarily raise doubts as to his sincerity in this  and not to speak of the queens personal inclinations when one considers the lord treasurers behavior at the very time he makes such great promises i do not see the least regard can be had to them i must own that one here on the spot can judge of this better than can be shown by a letter i shall however add one or two remarks  first then i must observe in general that to make so great and sudden a change of measures is very difficult and requires near connexions with another set of people which hitherto has not happened neither is the first minister in such a situation that he can act so cavalierly with france and the jacobites here who are not so contemptible a party as is generally believed without having made up with the other party as has been said   dly the jacobites are more and more encouraged and are daily placed in all the small posts of which no lists are kept and as to the great employments it is certain that lord stairs and the duke of argyle have lost theirs   dly the court is busy at this moment to get out by petitions or otherwise from the house of commons all those who have distinguished themselves for the succession and particularly an inquiry is made in a most scandalous and inquisitionlike manner against mr walpole who has made himself formidable and it is resolved to have him per fas et nefas voted out of the house   thly there is good reason to believe that the report of confirming the act of regency which has been spoken of is not without grounds nay that it appears to be really resolved upon and the success of this matter is the less doubted of at court that it appears very plausible to the tories to whom they set forth that in the sealed act as it now stands most of the lords of the regency are whigs and so they must fall into the hands of their enemies whereas if the next successor is fixed by a new instrument to be registered in chancery decency will require that at least a certain number of tories should be named with them others say that the nomination will be lest to the queen and parliament be that as it will it is certain that if the act of regency undergo this change it is in fact annulled and so the strongest wall in favor of the succession thrown down how all these things agree with the present offers is easy to judge  i have endeavored to flatter myself into a belief that the lord treasurer acts in this matter uprightly but can find no reasons to encourage me to such a belief when one considers that mans humor and way of acting they may think that perhaps the jacobite party grows too strong for him and that supposing the queens health reestablished to keep that party in awe and perhaps to get something from france he will show them he is not in so bad a situation but that he can do without them and for some time continue his game without being obliged to declare for the one or the other party all this might be supposed of this minister if one did not reflect that the present step is of too much importance and that he had not reason to be afraid of the proposals being really brought to a bearing those that think he has been obliged to this step against his will have a better opinion of the lower house than i have unless the state of the queens health is so bad that there is no appearance of her being able to come to london allow me to add that the advantages that the lord treasurer will draw or seeks to draw from the present proposals are these   st in general to amuse the people and to prevent the fall of credit   dly to prevent some tories coming into measures with the whigs and so hinder these last from making some disagreeable overtures in the beginning of the session and   dly to afford to these that pretend to be friends to the succession yet for private interest will not break with the treasurer an excuse for not meddling in any thing in favor of the succession so that the treasurer will by this means gain some weeks during which time he will be able to bring his forces into order and may then laugh at every one for the rest of the session and undertake with safety to change the act of regency  lord cowper having understood that there was a writ made out at the chancellors office for the hereditary prince as duke of cambridge to appear in parliament employed the clerk who gives out the writs to the peers to enquire at the lord chancellor whether he should bring the electoral princes writ to the envoy of the electors court the chancellor received him in a very angry manner enquired who had employed him in that message reprimanded him severely and ordered that the writ should not be delivered out of the office even though enquired for the officers sent by mr stanhope to the boulonnoise and flanders are returned and report that they found no troops in motion there only that nine irish battalions and a regiment of dragoons were advanced from lorrain and in quarters at douay valenciennes and hesdin and that the officers said openly that they had orders to be ready to march upon a minutes warning  after i had ended this letter i have learned from good authority that mr harleys instructions bear to let his electoral highness know that a faction of ill disposed people disturbed her majestys government by raising jealousies and alarms particularly with regard to the succession notwithstanding the act settling the succession was in full force that her majesty would however do all she could with honor to make his highness easy as to that matter but that if to chagrin her an invitation should be proposed to parliament she would look upon it as a personal affront i cannot be sure of the truth of this information but as i had it from good hands i thought it my duty to communicate it  original hannover papers vol marked

not have imagined till i was in england the heats and animosities there is amongst people even of the same principles and believe me madam all the noise made about the pretender is groundless and the tories are full as much in your interest or rather more than the whigs though the latter have of late got up a way of threatening the tories with the protestant succession as if your royal highness or those of your illustrious house who should succeed the queen were not to reign over the tories as well as the whigs i am satisfied that your royal highness knows great britain too well not to know who are honest men and who otherwise without the distinguishing names of whig and tory for i am sure you know what is called tory are those which are for the church of england which is all or almost all the clergy of england a great majority in the parliament and nation and almost all the landed men in the kingdom who should be more desirous than they to secure their religion and liberty to their posterity and you may depend upon it madam they are all heartily in your interest i need no better proofs than that famous book of steels called the crisis which the whigs cry up so much and which i think is demonstration to your royal highness that you have nothing to fear from the tories are they not all sworn to your succession have they not all abjured the pretender and is there one man either in parliament ministry or any place of trust that is not sworn to support your succession and to oppose the pretenders are not our laws made so strong that it is high treason to do any thing against your succession can any one pretend to suppose that all the clergy all the men of the greatest estates in the kingdom would at once venture soul and body and fortune to be in the interest of one who puts their religion and liberties in danger can any honest man pretend to say that all these people would voluntarily engage to be damned to be hanged and to lose at once all their estates and liberty from themselves and posterity all i could wish is that means could be found out to quiet peoples minds and that the protestant succession should not be more the cry of one party than the other that it should be as it is esteemed the good of both parties and of all the kingdom i flatter myself i have some place in your good opinion else i durst not take the liberty i do to assure you that i know all the present ministry is as much or more sincerely in your interest than the last were i had a very good opportunity to know it for when the queen was lately so ill that people began to make reflection if she should have died and being to be by my post as first lord of the admiralty one of the seven regents or lords justices in case of a demise i saw so entire and so strong a resolution

since the peace at utrick it is true indeed the queens health growing so bad as in all probability she can never recover it and the ministers making such open steps in favor of the pretender as to leave no doubt of their intentions to place him on the throne has brought things so near a decision that unless the states design to look on and see us lost and consequently themselves they could no longer remain inactive or delay entering into such vigorous measures as are absolutely necessary to save us both the first and great mark of their present good disposition is their secret resolution to set out as soon as possible a strong squadron of men of war for which they have found a very plausible pretext when their preparations are so far advanced as to oblige them to own it they have

explaining since you have been particularly informed of it by monsieur bothmar i shall only add that they have promised to go on with their seapreparations though her majesty should continue to languish on for some weeks longer for it has been shown them our danger would be greatest in that case for it would give the ministers time to concert every thing with france for bringing in the

measures they should take for the ensuing parliament have at last agreed that their best conduct will be to meddle in nothing and to propose nothing in parliament the reason they commonly and openly allege is to show lord anglesea sir thomas hanmer and men of that character who have credit with the high church party and pretend to be our friends that it is not from a spirit of faction they have acted till now and they can be quiet and do not desire forcibly to assume to themselves the glory of securing the succession but are ready to assign to them the tories all the honor and all the merit of it and to promise to second them at the time and in the manner they themselves shall prescribe  besides they saw as they told kreyenberg that all their efforts would be ineffectual unless the elector took some decisive step on his side and they were not sure but he attributed their conduct more to private than to public views they would wait until they heard what mr harley did at hannover and what answer was given him and they would regulate themselves accordingly this resolution made kreyenberg very uneasy as he was afraid it proceeded from despair and from an apprehension that they were blamed and abandoned by the elector  with regard to my lord anglesea i can venture to say from my own knowledge of him that he is rather for the succession than for the pretender but at the same time we may depend upon it that he will do nothing but in certain circumstances and that he will not break with the court unless the elector or the electoral prince is here and that is the case of sir thomas hanmer and of several others  lord notingham urged anglesea very much to enter into measures for proposing an invitation but he always answered that it was not necessary and that it could not

succession in their family  from thence schutz draws several arguments for the coming of the electoral prince and then proceeds  you have been already told that of ten who are for us nine will accommodate themselves to the times and embrace the interests of him who will be the first on the spot and who will undoubtedly have the best game and all the hopes of success rather than expose themselves by their opposition to a civil war which appears to them a real and an immediate evil whereas they flatter themselves that the government of the pretender whom they look upon as a weak prince will not be such a great evil as a civil war and we want to flatter ourselves when we imagine that those who call themselves our friends are such heroes as that the love of their religion and their attachment to us will animate them sufficiently to expose themselves willingly to the greatest dangers to maintain the rights of a family which is distant from them and which always showed great indifference for the succession to the crown of these kingdoms  in another letter of the same date hannover papers vol marked bothmr x p  0  he expresses great impatience to know what impressions his

whether it proceeds from himself alone the writ is in his office in all the forms with the great seal and in a more authentic manner than the writ of other peers from whence one may judge that the

written four pages about the complaints of the whigs of their being abandoned and their resolutions of doing nothing in parliament and about lord angleseas conduct ambition etc proceeds to give his opinion and advice in the following terms  with regard to the tories in general i am very far from calling them all jacobites but the misfortune is that they suffer themselves to be led and it is certain they will never oppose the pretender at the hazard of the smallest part of their fortune they dont mince the matter in their conversations although they allow that their religion and liberty would be more secure by holding to the present establishment yet they slatter themselves that by good laws both the one and the other may be very well secured they are not the lowest class of people who reason in this manner it is but four or five days ago that lord guilford speaking to lord cowper as intimate private friends about the rumors which are current concerning the pretender told him sincerely he could swear he knows nothing yet of a formed design of bringing in the pretender and does not believe there is any but i frankly acknowledge says he that if matters ever go any length the greatest part of us tories will willingly submit while you whigs will perhaps be fools enough to expose your country to a civil war and to be laid waste by the french on the one hand and by the germans on the other  kreyenberg writes that many of the whigs would act and that some of them argued already in the same manner and maintained that nothing could justify a civil war if they could possibly be safe without it they saw that if the pretender was once come over it would be very easy to hinder holland or denmark from giving any assistance and what is still worse continues kreyenberg the whigs do nothing new partly from the want of power and partly from their chagrin at seeing themselves neglected and abandoned and it will not be long before they will file off after the rest i do not ean that they will all become jacobites but one will retire to the country another leave the kingdom perhaps and so on with the rest  till now the whigs in general allowed themselves to be governed by devonshire sunderland summers halifax townshend cowper oxford and lately by nottingham likewise merely from the opinion they have that these noblemen act in perfect concert with the elector and have great credit with his electoral highness but they begin to perceive that matters do not go on as they imagined and as men seldom find out the true medium in things of this kind they

do with regard to it whatever they pleased that he renounced for ever all the advantages which might result to him in case the succession should take place and that they might take all the merit of it to themselves  he made this declaration only because he saw no other means of opening peoples eyes and he has some design of making it in parliament according to his opinion unless the queen or the pretender dies soon you may look upon the succession as lost the blame he says cannot fall upon him since it is certain that if you had followed even lately his advice and the advice of all your

the ministry with whom some of his friends tell me he is reconciled in short they will not contribute to bring over any of the family although they allow it is the only means of putting the succession

business of which you spoke to me here i shall begin with the proposal of the electoral princes journey to england  the elector having known long ago that the queen was averse from seeing any of his family at her court hesitated always for that reason to send the prince his son however he would have complied at length with the importunities of his friends in england if notice had not been given to him that mr harley was charged by the queen to intimate to him that the sending the prince or any of the electoral family would disoblige her highly and that she would oppose their coming it is likewise easy to perceive that her majestys speech to the parliament referred to that the elector hopes therefore his friends will consider that these circumstances render this journey impracticable unless he has a mind to come to an open rupture with the queen you and other friends may judge sir if that would be seasonable if it would be for the advantage or disadvantage of the succession and if affairs at home and abroad are in a situation to justify such an extremity  since it appears then to be impracticable to bring into the kingdom the successor whom the laws destine to the throne it will be the more necessary to secure the protestant succession by removing the competitor the elector made instances for that purpose to the queen by the late baron de grote who gave a memorial on the subject to the lord treasurer he will continue to do so when mr harley arrives he will give it to him in writing and baron de schutz will have orders to speak in the same style at your court  his electoral highness is of opinion likewise that the regencybill should not be changed from a pretense of amending it he will show mr harley likewise that he is satisfied with it and that he wishes it may be preserved entire which baron de schutz had orders already to tell to the lord treasurer and to the rest of the queens ministers if there is any thing else to be done for the greater security and further establishment of the protestant succession his electoral highness resigns himself to the opinions of his friends who are the most competent judges for deciding concerning the utility or necessity as well as practicability of measures for that purpose  the queens speech gives room to think that the court intends to make things which concern the protestant succession the subject of deliberation it is to be wished that the result may contribute to its firmer establishment and to be hoped that there is no intention of making a law to forbid the protestant successor to come into the kingdom during the life of the queen it would be injurious to him to be put thereby in some measure on the same footing with the pretender  as to the rest sir you will inform our friends of the good disposition of this state in favor of the protestant succession and of what they were prepared to do in case the queen had died and of what the elector himself was resolved to do the queens recovery does not make them lose sight of these things the emperors peace changes a little the state of affairs but he will continue in arms for three months yet at least it being impossible to conclude the peace finally before that time endeavors will be used in the mean time to bring about an agreement between the emperor and the states about the barrier in order that his imperial majesty may have a good number of troops in the low countries he always assures the elector that he has the affair of the succession much at heart yet he listened two months before to a proposal made by the pretender to marry an archdutchess he even in some measure recommended his own sister to that prince  and the king of prussia likewise gives the strongest assurances to the same purpose  hannover

as he has not such a purse for things of that kind as the lord treasurer all the representations which were made to him on the subject could not bring him to a more favorable resolution  my friend writes to me that our friends in england should advance this money without the electors interfering being certain that they shall be reimbursed as soon as he or his mother shall come to the throne or as soon as a pension in the mean time is settled on the successor i imagine one must place something more than confidence in you to make this proposal to you i entreat you sir to give agreeably to your friendship for his electoral highness the best turn you can to this denial i am persuaded that excepting such expenses he will do every thing that can be expected from him  ibid vol marked

remains to be done in favor of the protestant religion monsieur bothmar takes too warmly upon him to justify the emperor and roman catholic princes proceedings for even count sinzendorf himself owned to us that though the emperor had that article in the treaty of riswick imposed upon him yet since it was once received he would not do any thing to get it abolished and it has but a very ill air in the world for a minister of the elector to begin always with an insinuation in public that the queen had not done enough that she had it in her power and that she should have made france declare in

sentiments here and the pains your court is taking toward bringing the emperor and the states to an amicable accommodation in relation to the netherlands together with the hopes you give us of success in that grand affair is a great encouragement to all that wish well to the house of hannover there is one passage in yours where you seem to think it is impossible for the pretender to make any attempt during the queens life in this we are absolutely of another opinion for reasons as we think so very obvious to those who observe with the least attention the present conduct here that there is no need of entering into particulars on this head and this being the settled notion of all your friends here you will easily imagine into how great a degree of despair we were all thrown by that part of your letter where you mention the electors resolution of not sending the electoral prince without a previous invitation for it is but a small comfort to us to see how diligent and careful you are in taking remote precautions abroad whilst we are convinced that the danger is so imminent here that we shall in all probability be totally ruined before any of those supports can possibly come to our relief but now i must congratulate with you upon mons le baron de schutzs last orders for demanding the electoral princes writ of summons this i can assure you is thought by every body both friends as well as enemies to be the first step that your court has made that looks as if you were in earnest about the succession nothing can be more effectual if it be supported by the immediate sending the prince nor more seasonable than it was at this time for the queen had just then given a most unkind answer to give it no worse term to an address for the support of the succession and when the house of lords came to consider of this answer the effect of the electoral princes having demanded his writ appeared most plainly by the behavior of a great number of lords upon that occasion though that news was not then publicly known mons schutz will acquaint you with the consternation our ministers were under upon this occasion and the fright the chancellor was in lest it should be thought he had denied the writ they are so sensible that this step if it be followed by the immediate coming of the prince will so effectually ruin their designs and tend so directly to the securing the succession from all future danger that you may depend upon their making use of all arts and contrivances imaginable to prevent his coming neither threats nor flattery will be spared they are so intent and so bent upon prevailing with you to stop the prince that they will not rely upon mr harleys dexterity but have determined to send to you my lord pagett you must therefore prepare to be very vigorously attacked by way of message they see the spirit of the people here runs so high in your favor that they have no hopes of bringing either them or parliament up to any thing that may discourage the princes coming they are therefore forced to turn all their views toward you and are reduced to the miserable necessity of trying whether they can persuade your court to betray itself i shall trouble you no farther than only to give you the unanimous opinion of all our friends upon this occasion they are persuaded that you must be convinced by the manner in which this writ was granted that you have opened a most unexceptionable way for the coming of the prince it is plain the writ would not have been granted could they by law have justified the refusing of it and the uneasiness they expressed both when it was granted and since shows plainly they would not have failed to have attempted something in parliament in order to have discouraged him from coming could they have had the least hopes of carrying it from this we cannot think but that you must be satisfied that the inclinations of the people here are so strongly in favor of the house of hannover that the prince may come not only with great security as to his person but also that he will be received with all the respect and honor that is due to him but if after you have raised these expectations through the whole kingdom to the highest degree by the step you have made you should be prevailed upon to abandon the thoughts of sending the prince or be persuaded even to delay it such a proceeding will be so fatal that no man can be answerable for the consequences of it i cannot conclude this without doing justice to mons le baron schutz who has upon this and all other occasions behaved himself with so much zeal and prudence that he has deservedly got the entire esteem and consideration of all both whigs and tories who are well affected to the house of hannover  extracts of letters from schutz to

queen taking it as the greatest mark of contempt that could be given to her telling me that had it not been for this incident her majesty would have invited the electoral prince to come to pay her a visit next summer without recollecting that he had told me but a moment before that she was too much afraid to see any of the electoral family here and that this alone excepted she would willingly grant every thing else that could be demanded of her  he heaped together several very unintelligible things in this discourse to which i made no other answer than that having addressed myself to the proper officer for a thing which the law determined in our favor i could not imagine that the queen was angry at it nor that she would interpret wrongly a measure of that kind  hannover papers vol

have our interest at heart about the coming of the electoral prince etc  the advice which was given to me by lord oxford and confirmed by mr bromley not to appear any more at court seems too violent especially as the ministers say nothing to me but that i should have addressed myself to mr bromley instead of demanding the writ of lord harcourt and without proving this by any example or argument they say simply that the queen takes it as a mark of contempt although it would have been contrary to the custom of this country as well as to the order of the electress to have applied the other way  i acquainted our friends with every thing that happened to me in the course of this affair i placed the same confidence in lord anglesea and sir thomas hanmer and they blame the conduct of the ministry being now fully convinced that the protestant succession is in very bad hands  lord anglesea who is very well acquainted with lord paget gives me a bad character of him saying he is false and

tell me not to appear any more at court as she looks upon it as an affront i have done her to have asked the chancellor for the writ to the duke of cambridge a prince of her blood and that for that reason she had ordered mr harley to solicit the elector and electress to recall me instantly upon which i said to him that in consequence of the respect i owed to and had for her majesty i would not fail to obey her orders  an original hannover papers vol marked strafford extracts of a letter from lord strafford to sophia electress of hannover he answers her letters  advises her and the elector to disapprove of baron scbutzs conduct and vindicates the ministry from having any designs in favor of the pretender  hague may  th       the reason why mons dalay makes difficulty to go to the foreign churches which other ministers before him never did is since the passing the bill of occasional uniformity about three years ago which only affects those that are in employments of trust or profit so that my lord morpeth having none did not lie under those difficulties mr dalay does i make a doubt whether that act extends out of her majestys dominions but as it is a doubt i would no more risque it than i find dalay will and had it not been for mr cadogan i had not minded it but asking him just after the act passed to go with me to the french church to hear a famous preacher here he told me he did not know what i might do  i am assured his lord paget errand is to explain matters and set them in so true a light before you that no artifice of a faction or party for private views and interest may be able for the future to cause any inquietude between the queen and your illustrious family i took the liberty at my last coming hither to state that matter plainly to your royal highness who was so good as to make me the answer i could wish both in relation to your respect for the queen and your being of neither party and yet i am sorry to find your minister in england has lately acted as if at least he was governed by the party that is against the court because the chief amongst them have not the chief employments at court and i am afraid his late behavior is something resented as being very irregular and neglectful of that respect due to the queen for though by strictness of law i believe a peer may demand his writ of the lord chancellor though absent yet it is never done but the lord chancellor keeps it by him till such time as the absent peer returns and demands it himself to sit in parliament i know this better than any man it having been my case under several lord chancellors as i have been abroad ever since the first year her majesty came to the crown and having often had leave to take turns into england the chancellors have always kept my writ till i came and demanded it to sit in parliament which they immediately were obliged to send me and so it would have been with the duke of cambridge whenever he should come into england to sit in parliament upon his demanding it the chancellor is obliged by law to send it him immediately this being so what occasion had mons schutz to go just at this juncture and to demand it of the lord chancellor without having previously acquainted some of the queens ministers of state or having first notified his intentions or orders if he had them to do it to the queen by the secretary of state for her majestys approbation which he might have been assured would not have been denied him no more than she did her leave to lord chancellor to deliver the writ when he asked her if he should do it i must own to your royal highness i am very sorry to see such things happen let the partys jar as they please but let not any thing happen by any minister of yours that may be interpreted as if your illustrious family wanted all the confidence and consideration imaginable for the queen who i find by mr secretarys letter is herself a little startled at this way of proceeding of mons schutz and if you will pardon the liberty i take i believe nothing could have a better effect than your and the electors disapproving what mons schutz has done in this matter as i certainly wish well to the protestant succession in your family and desire heartily the peace and tranquillity of my country i cannot but apprehend for both if some effectual means is not immediately found out to put matters upon such a foot as to convince the world that there is a mutual good understanding between the queen and your royal highnesss illustrious family and that you act on both sides with the just consideration and confidence you ought to have for and in one another your royal highness knows my character and opinion of partys you know my zeal for your interest and therefore i hope will excuse this liberty i take to beg of you to consider seriously with the elector your son upon some expedient to put matters upon a foot of reciprocal confidence in the queen and your illustrious house a king or queen of england must govern by the bulk of their people and must never be tied to one or the other party which made king william and all the kings his predecessors change from one to the other party as they had the majority of the nation and parliament and any king or queen who would reign with a party against the majority of the nation would have but a most uneasy life and god forbid i should live to see ever the queen and her successors struggling to support different parties  after all the foolish and malicious outcry of the danger of the pretender i have asked the people here to tell me one thing done in his favor or one thing left undone to exclude him and to secure your succession nay i have desired them to let me know what was desired or if there could be any thing more done to secure the protestant succession in your illustrious house and if they would tell me i would engage it should be done and upon discoursing this matter the other day with the pensionary he seemed convinced of the truth of what i told him and that there was no just grounds for this outcry about the pretender and that nothing could be of a worse consequence than the project talked of by some whigs of getting the electoral prince over and setting him up for successor in prejudice to yours and the electors right the pensionary told me upon this that he would go and talk roundly to that man pointing to baron bothmar who was then in the treveschamber when i was in this discourse with the pensionary and that he would afterward tell me if there was any thing the baron could propose to be done he told me after having talked to bothmar that all he had to oppose was that the pretender was suffered to continue in lorrain your royal highness is judge whether the queen can oblige the duke of lorrain to send him from thence if he will not and has engaged to france not to do it and what we can say more to france when they answer us that they have punctually executed their treaty by sending him out of france and yet that article in our treaty was looked upon as a hardship on the french king since even in the preliminaries in   0  they did not oblige the french king so strongly as we had done in our treaty being all was said in those preliminaries was that whereas the chevalier st george had a mind to travel the french king consented to it  hannover papers vol marked schutz

been forbid to appear at court had begun to take courage do not relish it much i know from good authority that the lord treasurer said some days ago to one of his creatures that he never thought that affair should have been pushed so far and another person affirmed to me that he said that he apprehended he would be very soon disgraced that they wanted to oblige him to enter into the measures of

anglesea lord abington and the archbishop of york it will be the more necessary to make them to the archbishop because it is well known he is not yet quite firm in the good cause and it is for this reason some friends desired me to write to you that a letter from the electress would confirm him much in the sentiments which he has begun to discover  i enclose the examiner of this day i would not

from exclaiming against the coming of the electoral prince that they applaud it and pretend to have the principal share in his good graces this we will not envy them providing they attach themselves to him as they appear resolved to do and it is not to be doubted but as soon as he appears the lord treasurer will seek his protection and both parties pay their court to him there is no question therefore of sending the prince to be the head of a party but to have the glory of uniting the two parties who will concur together in parliament to settle a revenue of  0 or  0000 l sterling upon him but for this purpose he must come before the end of the session  you see the prince may come with entire security and with the greatest pleasure imaginable and prevent the designs of the pretender

to be so good as to offer my very humble thanks to the elector for the share he appears to take in my affliction for the death of my daughter  it is so evident that the queens ministers are determined to place the pretender on the throne that it would be losing ones time to produce proofs of it their greatest desire and their only view in mr harleys embassy is to obtain some declaration from the elector which may impose upon the nation and make it believe that your court is satisfied with them if you have fallen into this snare it will render all the efforts of your friends of no avail but we rely upon the great prudence of his electoral highness  a more proper time for demanding the writ for the electoral prince could not have been chosen for you see how many of the richest and most considerable among the tories declare for you and acknowledge that they were deceived by the ministry who lose so much ground in both houses that you may depend upon it they will take care not to call the second session of this parliament before they have executed their design in favor of the pretender for otherwise they will run a risk of being prosecuted for having betrayed their country and violated the laws and as they cannot justify themselves in that respect it is not to be believed that they will expose themselves to the hazard of another session for if they lose any more ground however small their ruin is certain  luckily this session is to continue for two months longer as no supplies are yet found so that the electoral prince will have time enough before the end of it to arrive and take his seat in parliament in which case the balance will incline entirely to your side as it begins to do already upon the mere rumor of his coming so that you may judge what effect his presence would produce accordingly our friends write to me that in that case the parliament will not rise before they have settled a pension of  0000 l sterling for a subsistence to the prince who will have nothing to do but to make his court to the queen and caress the ministers without meddling in any thing  by this remedy the succession will be secured without risk without expense and without war and likewise it is very probable that france seeing herself prevented in that manner will abandon her design of assisting the pretender  in my humble opinion it would be proper to use dispatch and that the prince should set out before lord paget arrives this journey of the prince attended with the success which there is reason to expect from it cannot fail to give the elector new influence and much greater consequence over all europe as he will secure to himself thereby the crown of great britain which will attach the emperor holland and the court of prussia to him and render him the arbiter of the differences of the north whereas if this opportunity is lost which according to appearances will be the last the contrary will happen and the influence of his electoral highness at other courts will suffer considerably by it especially after the great noise which this demand of the writ for the electoral prince makes every where which leaves no one room to doubt of his setting out soon so that if he does not set out at all your friends in england who have exposed themselves so generously for your interests will be absolutely ruined and the succession in the utmost danger which cannot fail to be productive of bad consequences to your court in all the other courts of europe  it is easy for your court to conceive of what importance it is that the prince should arrive while the parliament is sitting as the reason to justify his journey is the right he has to take his seat in parliament and the writ by which the queen calls him to it i hope you will send me good news  i believe mr molineux will be now at your court i recommend him to you as being a man of quality who has very large possessions in ireland but principally as a man of parts and of merit

laws as there are no other interests more worthy than these of the attention of a queen so distinguished for her piety and for her love of her subjects i doubt not but your majesty will give them as

the obliging assurances he added to it that her britannic majesty would have a pleasure in granting whatever they desired in that respect  it is in reliance on this that their electoral highnesses take the liberty of representing to her majesty the necessity of obliging the pretender to remove to italy and the danger which may result from his staying longer in lorrain both to her majestys kingdoms and to her royal person and the protestant succession  it is impossible to be more obliged to her majesty than their electoral highnesses are for the instances which she has been already pleased to make for the pretenders removal and as the present parliament as well as the former have shown they are persuaded that the security of the nation and of the succession is connected with it which is likewise the opinion of their electoral highnesses they entreat her majesty to take most effectual measures for attaining such a salutary end and the more so the pretenders adherents publish with the utmost assurance that he is preparing to make a descent in the north of great britain while the kingdom is unfurnished with a fleet and troops which is confirmed by different advices received from persons who have been lately at barleduc and have a share of the pretenders confidence and who affirm that he will begin very soon to execute his enterprise and that he depends upon a powerful foreign assistance  affairs being in such a dangerous situation their electoral highnesses hope that her majesty will own with them that it is necessary for the security of her royal person and for that of her kingdoms and of the protestant religion to settle in great britain some one of the electoral family who would be attentive to such important concerns and show her majesty by a fidelity and an inviolable attachment to her person how much their electoral highnesses are filled with respect and gratitude toward her the time appears to be now come when the security of their common interests cannot be found any longer but in a reciprocal confidence and in measures taken with perfect concert and when their electoral highnesses as they do not expect the security of their rights to the succession but from the continuance of her majestys goodness are ready to contribute on their side as much as is in their power to defeat the designs of those who would choose to disturb the tranquillity and felicity of her glorious reign  their electoral highnesses likewise take the liberty of renewing the instances they made near two years ago to her majesty and to her ministers for asking that such a pension and establishment should be settled by act of parliament on her highness the electress as the nearest heir to the crown usually enjoyed their electoral highnesses did not choose to form any pretensions in this respect while the nation was burdened with the expenses of the war but these expenses being discontinued and as every thing ought to be put upon a sure and solid footing by the peace they hope that during this very session of parliament her majesty will be so good as to procure them a thing which is so just and which is but a natural consequence of all that she has done already in their favor  their electoral highnesses hope likewise that her majesty will be pleased to grant titles belonging to the princes of the blood of great britain to such of the

succession this prelate cannot reconcile all this with what he himself and every one sees she said nothing at all of the coming of the electoral prince but only of the disobliging manner in which the writ was demanded  it is confidently said now and it appears very probable that lord oxford has carried his point with the queen and is become prime minister it is believed that the affair of the writ contributed not a little to this as his lordship insinuated with great address that lord bolingbrokes violent conduct induced the elector to take that step  in the news which was sent this post in

he would discover very important secrets to mons de bothmar he added that the coming of the electoral prince would remedy every thing that even the ministers at least some of them would pay court to him and that there was no other remedy for saving the nation and the succession but that it must be applied without delay and before the end of the parliament  they give out at court that it is not the affair of the writ but the manner of asking it which displeased the queen and for that reason they affect to show a thousand civilities to kreyenberg who has been two following times invited to

every thing is at stake and when our safety and the security of the succession depend entirely upon the journey of the electoral prince i consider it is my duty to represent to you in the strongest manner i am able that if his highnesss journey is put off the succession is inevitably lost  one may say that the whole nation expects the prince now with the utmost impatience and that there is such a general disposition to receive him well that the ministers will be obliged to treat his highness with the respect which is due to him but if the opportunity is lost this inclination may cool they will think themselves neglected and will be capable perhaps of going from one extreme into another  undoubtedly the reasons for the princes journey become every day more strong you know them sir better than any man therefore i shall only say that all the tories excepting such as are entirely devoted to the ministers wish for the princes arrival with as much earnestness as the whigs and there is reason to fear that if the resolution of sending him is changed our new allies lord anglesea the archbishop of york and the speaker of the house of commons with their friends will leave us soon for they declare publicly enough that the succession cannot be secured but by the presence of the prince and they insinuated that if he does not come they will be obliged to take other measures  you would see by the gazettes that the stocks rose very high since the princes journey was spoke of an undoubted sign of the good disposition of the nation and i think i may assure you that his presence here will give us immediately a majority in both houses the tories do not conceal their sentiments in this respect and they say publicly that they only wait to see the prince for declaring against the ministers  the lord treasurer and lord bolingbroke are more exasperated than ever against one another the lord treasurer found means of reconciling himself with lady masham and boasts that he will very soon turn out lord bolingbroke and the lord chancellor and the treasurers friends begin by private rumors to charge these two noblemen with the design of bringing in the pretender in a word this is a fine opportunity for bringing over the prince and the ministers being come to an open rupture with one another the parliament and the people are impatient to see him arrive and the partisans of

when the queen gave the prince the patent of duke of cambridge and regulated the rank of the protestant princes of the family as princes of the blood by the act of precedence which was carried to them two years ago by mr harley that court imagined these were real favors of which they might make use when the opportunity offered and that the electoral prince when he made use of his writ of summons only made use of what was his right and that if he went to england it would be with an intention to continue inviolably attached to the queen and to her ministers and to your lordship in particular wherein her britannic majesty would find her own safety and that of her kingdoms against the attempts of the pretender who would not dare in that case to think of an invasion besides that the king of france would have this reason to allege for dispensing himself from assisting him that there would be no means of doing it as the family of hannover was beforehand with him so that nothing appears more conformed to the interest of the queen and the nation than the sending over the prince which is evident as the jacobites fear it as a mortal blow to their hopes  i hope my lord that you will have no difficulty of conceiving the electors views and i pray god with all my heart that the measures taken to secure the protestant succession to the crown of great britain may succeed persuaded as i am that the preservation of our holy religion and the safety of europe depend upon it your lordship is in a situation which enables you to procure so great a benefit by uniting still more clearly the

given and this expectation is so strong that a disappointment will discourage entirely his friends and encourage his enemies  i can assure you it is the general opinion of people of the first consequence and the well affected to the succession who are the majority of the kingdom that nothing can contribute more to render the queens reign happy and safe and at the same time secure the succession as it is established by the laws in favor of the family of hannover than the presence of the duke of cambridge among us that being the surest means to curb the great and continued efforts of those who act for the pretender and give themselves out to be a very powerful party with a view of gaining over many to their faction at home and of encouraging france to send them the pretender with french troops upon that assistance their greatest expectations are founded you may judge then at hannover of what importance it is to prevent such an event by sending over the prince i expect from you with the utmost impatience the good news of his departure  hannover papers vol marked schutz fills   p     an unknown friend in england to monsieur de bothmar the same subject continued  it is a translation from the english in robethons hand translation may    n s      the pretenders faction acknowledge that if the prince comes over their systems overturned and they invent lies of every kind to destroy all hopes of the princes coming producing letters from hannover which bear that monsieur de schutz has been disavowed and very ill received and that it is certain the elector will not send the prince to england  mr bromley secretary of state in particular spoke in this manner which has thrown the pretenders faction into transports of joy and the friends of hannover both whigs and tories into the utmost despair i have heard several of them and among others the duke of argyle exclaim if the elector abandons us in this manner and refuses to embrace an opportunity so favorable so easy and so conformed to our laws sacrificing us and abandoning us to the rage of our enemies after all that we have done for him we have no further recourse but to go to the other extremity and invite the pretender to come over on tolerable terms and without a french army  i entreat your excellency to communicate this to his electoral highness consider what advantage the pretenders friends will draw from it and if your friends being refused and disgusted it will not be very easy for your enemies to carry any bill they please in parliament for infringing the acts of the succession which they have attempted before now several times but without success the boldness of these people goes so far that sir john packington in a club of more than  0 tories proposed that the parliament should order the black box to be opened so they call the sealed instruments of the electress appointing a regency in case of the queens death but the affair was dropped  this and some things still worse will be brought now again upon the carpet if the prince does not come for then your enemies will reassume courage and seeing that your court shows no resentment of the affront done to your minister they will imagine as you put up with every thing that every thing is allowable to them  the pardon which the queen granted to doctor bedford author of the bock on hereditary right is the greatest affront which her majesty could offer to the electoral family i dont know if these things are understood at your court or if attention is paid to them  they continue to dismiss all the officers civil and military who presume to show any attachment to the hannoverian succession and yet they give out that the queens ministers assure your court that they have the greatest zeal and attachment to them it would be very curious if they could succeed to persuade you of this  my conclusion from all this is that if the prince does not come over the succession is lost the delaying his journey has had already the bad effects i apprehended from it having given time to the ministers to contrive new intrigues and give life and courage to their party which was half extinct and which laughs now at your friends every where and asks them where is then your duke of cambridge and where is your succession is it not more than a month since the writ was demanded a proper resolution on the part of his

illness  the quarrels of the ministry  oxford makes advances to the whigs  translation london      may      the inexpressible impatience which every one shows here for news of the electoral princes departure induces me to take the liberty of embracing every safe opportunity which offers of repeating to you that every thing is irreparably lost if the resolution of sending him is changed or delayed for the earnest desire of seeing him here having become so universal and augmenting every day his coming is so absolutely necessary that i fear a longer delay may produce very disagreeable effects  as to the queen she continues much indisposed the st anthonys fire  lerisipele which broke out in her leg and thigh has considerably deminished the violence of her fever but it is believed on the other hand that a mortification may follow she sleeps little and eats nothing and she is in such dreadful anxiety that her mind suffers no less than her body  the quarrels between the treasurer and bolingbroke are greater than ever it is true their common friends reconcile them for a day or two but they quarrel more violently afterward the partisans of both the one and the other give out that their leader possesses all the favor and confidence of the queen but it is impossible to write any thing positively on this subject this scene at court having lately changed as frequently as the wind the fact is that these two ministers exert themselves very openly to ruin one another and as this division among the leaders reigns also among their followers it is very certain that if the electoral prince comes over both of them will be very soon overturned to which i may add that at bottom the treasurer would not be sorry that the electoral prince were here although he is obliged to declare and to publish the contrary for fear of losing entirely the queen who cannot hear the princes journey spoke of without putting herself in a passion and the more so that she perceives the nation desires it with ardour  what i write to you of the real sentiments of the treasurer concerning this affair comes from his brother the auditor who told it to general earl from whom i had it the treasurer has likewise commanded several secret negociations with the whigs since his credit has begun to decline at court and they have answered that in case he will consent to the coming of the electoral prince and exert himself seriously to secure the succession they will not only forget the past but they will endeavor to support him and to maintain him in his authority and in his office  i imagine sir that it is impossible to act in a more disinterested manner than the whigs do and i am almost persuaded that the presence of the electoral prince will determine the treasurer to adopt that plan  i shall expect with great impatience to hear from you and you may write by the usual conveyance in the cipher which you gave me i make no use of it in this letter because i send it by a lady who will deliver it safely the house of commons adjourned till thursday i am etc  the letters which queen anne wrote to the princess sophia and to the duke of cambridge when the writ of summons was

has resolved to come over to settle in my life time in my dominions i do not choose to delay a moment to write to you about this and to communicate to you my sentiments upon a subject of this importance  i then freely own to you that i cannot imagine that a prince who possesses the knowledge and penetration of your electoral highness can ever contribute to such an attempt and that i believe you are too just to allow that any infringement shall be made on my sovereignty which you would not choose should be made on your own i am firmly persuaded that you would not suffer the smallest diminution of your authority i am no less delicate in that respect and i am determined to oppose a project so contrary to my royal authority however fatal the consequences may be  your electoral highness is too just to refuse to bear me witness that i gave on all occasions proofs of my desire that your family should succeed to my crowns which i always recommend to my people as the most solid support of their religion and their laws i employ all my attentions that nothing should efface those impressions from the hearts of my subjects but it is not possible to derogate from the dignity and prerogatives of the prince who wears the crown without making a dangerous breach on the rights of the successors therefore i doubt not but with your usual wisdom you will prevent the

other friends likewise as nottingham townshend sunderland halifax etc continue in their old opinion but they all in general think that if the elector does not choose to send the electoral prince it

she hopes it will meet with suitable returns  your lordship will endeavor to satisfy the elector the queen has no intention but to secure the succession to her crowns as by law established in the house of hannover and is ready to do every thing that may contribute to that end consistent with the safe and quiet possession of them during her own time  her majesty having been very sincere in the public declarations she has made and in the assurances she has frequently given in favor of this succession she expects from the elector he will speak freely on this subject and particularly if he thinks he has reason to suspect designs are carrying on to disappoint it that he will declare what foundation he has for such suspicion and your lordship will assure him he may depend that no person shall be continued in her majestys service he has reasonable ground to imagine has other views and if that can be made appear her majesty will not fail to make examples of such persons  upon your lordships arrival at hannover you will learn what resolution that court has taken about the electoral prince the duke of cambridge coming hither the demanding the writ for his setting in parliament having given an expectation it was soon intended your lordship will find such resolution is either taken or suspended or a resolution taken that he will not come over without her majestys consent and invitation  if the resolution for his coming is taken or suspended your lordship will represent to the elector the great uneasiness his coming hither at this time will give to the queen how unseasonable it is and that it may endanger the succession itself  it must make the queen uneasy as it will be thought to confirm a jealousy maliciously and industriously spread of her majestys want of sincerity and good inclination to the succession and as it will be understood to gratify those who desire and there is cause to believe have solicited his coming over in opposition to her majesty it is unseasonable because of the divisions among us which his presence at this juncture will rather foment and increase than compose and quiet and it may endanger the succession as it will certainly cool the zeal of many now wellaffected to it who from their duty and regard for the queen will be disgusted with every thing that shall have the appearance of a contemptuous treatment of her majesty and who will apprehend such a step to be a declaration of the faction and entering into the heats and extravagances of a party for whom they have so strong an aversion that they dread nothing more than their returning again into power  but if the resolution is taken that the duke of cambridge shall not come without the queens consent and invitation your lordship will let the elector know that this deference and respect to her majesty will lay such an obligation on her as will entitle him to all the good effects he can expect from it  upon the whole your lordship will observe to the elector that a good use may be made of this accident of this attempt to bring over the duke of cambridge in opposition to her majesty since the regards he shall show to her majesty on this occasion must

it was observed yesterday that those who were of oxfords party as anglesea and hanmer joined the whigs and that bolingbrokes party alone were against the resolution which was taken  matters begin to be in a situation which gives our friends reason to hope for great advantages to the protestant succession they flatter themselves especially that they will be in a condition to overturn bolingbroke they have concerted two ways for that purpose the one by the queen and the other by the parliament with regard to the first it happens that oxford shrewsbury dartmouth pawlet and the bishop of london

bolingbroke but it seems they dared not attack the latter directly seeing themselves uncertain of the treasurer and of his friends while bolingbroke endeavored to gain lord anglesea lord abington and some others to his side at last they contented themselves with attacking only his friend arthur more so that lord bolingbroke will maintain himself in his post and may be able to turn out the treasurer by his credit with the queen the fall of the treasurer appears to be very near according to the opinion of his own friends some of those who would have assisted him to bring down his rival say now according to the maxim which prevails much here that he does not deserve to be assisted as he does not choose to assist himself  the reasons of his conduct in this situation of affairs are perhaps   his own humor which does not allow him to keep himself entirely to one side   the hopes of maintaining himself still in the queens good graces by the same means by which he introduced himself into her favor   the hopes of entering again into favor by degrees although he should now lose his employment providing he does not declare openly against the court party   that he is engaged so deeply in certain projects with lord bolingbroke that he dares not attack him openly for fear of being involved in his ruin probably all these reasons contribute to influence his conduct  he seems however to reckon upon the good graces of the elector and to be inclined to pay attention to them which bolingbroke thinks incompatible with the service of the queen from which one might conclude what are his intentions although they were not otherwise known we may be sure he will proceed rapidly if the direction of affairs falls into his hands it is said now that he wants to continue secretary of state but that bromley will be turned out and sir william wyndham put in his place that the treasury will be put in commission that lord anglesea will be the first commissioner of it and have alone the vicetreasurership of ireland which he shared till now with lord rochester and that shrewsbury will continue lord lieutenant of ireland from whence they would infer that he will abandon the treasurer to unite himself with bolingbroke although others do not believe this on account of the irreconcilable difference in their tempers   july       the letter in bothmars hand of this date contains nothing material hannover papers vol marked bothmar x no     but the copy in robethons hand of what bothmar wrote to him in ciphers contains the following particulars about the quarrel of the ministry  it is thought that a reconciliation is made by the mediation of their friends but that bolingbroke has always most credit with the queen they say that not only the favorite but the duchess of shrewsbury is secretly for him by the persuasions of her daughter who is married to sir william wyndham  these two ministers have been for a long time on bad terms from the opposition of their tempers and manners but what gave occasion to complete their diffidence of one another and their disunion is a project which had been formed of dividing in    shares the profits which the queen was to have from the trade to the south sea of which five were designed for the treasurer five for bolingbroke four for lady masham and two for arthur more the treasurer having had his reasons for refusing the share destined for him was suspected on that account and at last became odious to the other sharers he afterward furnished their enemies with means of discovering this mystery which gave them occasion to examine the treaty of commerce without producing the effect which they promised themselves from it as the treasurer did not furnish them with the assistance they expected from him and as the prorogation of the parliament put an end too soon to the deliberations on that affair  the queens answer to the address of the lords at which they are so much offended is ascribed to bolingbroke lord anglesea is particularly offended having been the author of the address to which the queen gave that answer and if her majesty had not interrupted the debates by her presence matters according to all appearances would have been pushed very far in the animosity of all the house of peers against bolingbroke and against her majestys answer his lordship they affirm will be prosecuted vigorously in the next session but as he apprehends this himself it is feared he will bring over the pretender before that time to save himself and to finish his grand scheme from which he expects the completion of the fortune which his ambition promises him  they ascribe to him likewise the queens speech others believe it was composed by the chancellor harcourt it displeases people here in many passages they are persuaded that the last article reflects on the protestant succession and on the intention of having one of our princes in this country   july       bothmar having mentioned the quarrels of the ministry adds hannover papers vol marked bothmar  0 no     it is surprising that the duke of marlborough comes over at such a crisis and does not rather wait until it is seen which of the two competitors will carry it with the queen lord sunderland himself does not comprehend this i am told he will be the day after tomorrow at ostend in order to embark there for this country cadogan has been for eight or ten days in the country he is expected back this evening he said when he went away that the duke of marlborough would wait for him at antwerp the impetuosity of the duchess has probably precipitated this journey  there is a copy in robethons hand of what bothmar wrote by this post in ciphers he says the reconciliation of the ministry could not be durable their quarrels continued and he found it very difficult to speak with them his friends dissuaded him from pressing them to an alliance with the emperor and the king of prussia for quaranteeing the succession lest they should afterward think that the parliament demanded it of the queen at the instigation of the elector his friends likewise advised him not to ask at this time english titles for the prince of the electoral family as that might be delayed without any inconveniency until the next session of parliament  lord halifax continues bothmar thinks that the elector should have the title of prince of wales and that very little time is necessary to prepare the way for that they are surprised that the duke of marlborough is in a hurry to come here at this juncture if he adheres to his old friends he will run a risk with the ministry and if he wants to please the latter he will be abandoned by the former without gaining much upon the court it is thought that the treasurer has led him into this step by the means of cadogan and that at length he will find himself shifted off as his old friends were to whom the treasurer had promised likewise by cadogan august to second them in the affair of the spanish commerce of which promise he acquitted himself in the manner i wrote to you by former posts hannover papers vol marked bothmar x no        july  0    i see by what you tell me of the king of sweden that his return from turkey will not be so soon it seems to me that his minister here flatters himself with a real assistance from this court i dont see however that things are yet disposed for that it is said he has hopes from bolingbroke and wishes the pretender were here already      july  august  we are still in expectations here of a change in the ministry ibid no   0 there are some who believe that if the duke of ormond resigns his employments the duke of marlborough will have the command of the army but i think there are many reasons for believing that neither the one nor the other will happen i imagine your ker of kersland will embarrass you send him away speedily with a medal serve well the best      july  august  the duke of marlborough is not arrived yet ibid no     it is probable he wants to remain beyond the sea until he knows that there is a change in the ministry it is certain that the treasurer will resign his employment i imagine i can write to you this very evening that he has actually done so it was said today that mr boil was to be first commissioner of the treasury and mr bridges one of his colleagues but that neither of them would accept    0 july 0 august  i am very curious to know if there is any foundation for what i write in my postscript to his electoral highness ibid of a good understanding between the duke of marlborough and the pretender his highness himself can give a great deal of light in this affair as i am assured that the lord treasurer showed him by his cousin the originals of the letters between the duke and the pretender this correspondence appears to me to be altogether incredible it being inconsistent with all i ever saw or heard of the duke i refer myself to what i wrote about it to his electoral highness and to mr de bernsdorf entreating you to inform me in what manner they consider this affair i dont recollect it was to you or to his electoral highness himself that i gave an account of the communication of a letter by an unknown person to the duke of marlborough of which i speak in the same postscript perhaps that the person who wrote to him that letter has also forged an answer to it that letter consists in great reasoning on the weak state of the protestant succession and on the advantages which the duke might find in embracing the part of the pretender without running any risk  i imagine they begin to reason much in the same manner at vienna believing that our party is much weaker here than it is in reality and that we will weaken it by our indifference and that on that account they ought not to offend our competitor by too much opposition to him who can the more easily mount the throne here that we are indifferent about it i write that it would be proper to undeceive the court of vienna of this mistaken opinion  p s this instant at half an hour after nine the duke of grafton coming from kensington tells me that all the physicians can do to make the queen throw up two vomits of antimony produces no effect either up or down and that they believe she will not live out the night i have so much company in the house that i find it difficult to write to you  in another letter to robethon of this date hannover papers vol marked miscell detat no   no   he acquaints him that there was a change in the ministry that oxford and buckingham had resigned and that the queen was dangerously ill

understanding between her majesty and his electoral highness and as your lordship is a very proper so i hope you will be an happy instrument for settling the friendship upon a firm and lasting foundation the way to obtain it can never be by such a conduct as her majesty has at this time too much cause to complain of and which i am directed particularly to mention to your lordship  there has been printed here as your lordship will see by the enclosed the letters her majesty writ on the   th of may last to the late electoress dowager and to the electoral prince the copies can only have been obtained from hannover and therefore it is her majestys pleasure that you take notice of it to the elector and let him know that she is concerned to meet with such treatment which she thinks she has not deserved  i am directed to acquaint your lordship that the queen has removed my lord treasurer which you are to take notice of to the elector and at the same time to let him know that this domestic incident shall make no alteration with respect to public affairs the treasury will be put into commission  when your audiences are over your lordship will be pleased to give me a full account of your reception that i may lay it before the queen who desires to know all the particulars relating to it i am glad your lordship has had a good journey to hannover and hope your success there will

wanted to be chamberlain and would resign his place in the treasury and the lord lieutenancy of ireland which bothmar proposed first should be given to the duke of ormond when the duke of marlborough got the command of the army but he thought afterward it would be better to place the duke of ormond at the head of the prince of waless household as being fitter for a court than for any other

recommends to deprive lord north and gray of the government of portsmouth and to give it to general earl and to make this change before the kings arrival he hopes the house of commons will grant the king for life the same civil list they gave the queen and that the ensuing parliament will augment it on account of the princes family he forwards a letter to the king from lord manchester who had been ambassador in france and at venice and secretary of state at home and now begs only to be made a gentleman of the kings bedchamber a favor which bothmar recommends to grant to him but he proposes that no answer should be given to his lady who wants to be one of the princesss maids of honor he recommends brigadiers honnywood and dormer to be made grooms of the bedchamber the last having been recommended by the duke of marlborough he thinks it will be sufficient now to give general promises to such as ask favors and to fulfill them when the king has formed his plan he may then turn out in

before lord strafford applies to be continued and likewise to recall that man soon from the hague that will please the dutch and a great many here he is not only hated but likewise despised by his

think of putting the expense of your tables or any other expense for the court which you bring along with you upon the civil list here that would be directly contrary to the laws which exclude strangers from offices and emoluments in this country such a pretension would exasperate and so far from giving any room to hope for a mitigation of that law hereafter would suggest to them to make it still more severe when they saw that we pretended to elude it as france eludes treaties  if the king pays out of his finances at hannover all the court which he brings from thence it will be of infinite advantage to him in gaining the opinions and affections of the nation it will show his disinterestedness his generosity his rectitude and regularity in every thing the very proposal of charging that expense upon the civil list would not only deprive him of that advantage and give a quite opposite idea of him but would likewise create great difficulties with the ensuing parliament about the augmentation of the civil list which without such an unseasonable proposal there is room to hope for as also for a mitigation of the law i have just now mentioned  besides this we may depend upon it that this pretension of maintaining our hannoverian court in this country at the expense of england would not be admitted and instead of ascribing them to the kings generosity that he is at that expense out of his electoral revenues they would ascribe it entirely to the refusal he met with here as you yourself answer the arguments drawn from the customs of the court of france i have

me with at hannover i cannot but extremely rejoice at the occasion which will give me an opportunity of waiting on you in england where you will find a whole nation in the highest joy and thoroughly sensible of the great blessings which they promise themselves from his majestys accession to the throne i take the liberty to send you enclosed a poem written on this occasion by one of our most eminent hands which is indeed a masterpiece in its kind and though very short has touched upon all the topics that are most popular among us i have likewise transmitted to you a copy of the preamble to the prince of waless patent which was a very grateful talk imposed on me by the lords justices their excellencies have ordered that the lords and others who meet his majesty be out of mourning that day as also their coaches but all servants except those of the city magistrates to be in mourning the shortness of the time which would not be sufficient for the making of new liveries occasioned this last order the removal of the lord bolingbroke has put a seasonable check to an interest that was making in many places for members in the next parliament and was very much relished by the people who ascribed to him in a great measure the decay of trade and public credit you will do me a very great honor if you can find terms submissive enough to make the humble offers of my duty acceptable to his

born on the fourteenth of october      about twelve at night he went out of london with his father the queen and the princess mary to dover he was sent back to st jamess prince charles only going to york about easter the marquis of hertford was ordered to bring the duke to him the marquis had received an order from the parliament not to carry the duke of york out of town yet he did he went with the palsgrave and other lords and gentlemen to hull the king intending to follow the next day sir l dyves came the next day before dinner and told the governor that the king would dine with him they were on a platform by the waterside the governor turned pale he desired the duke and company to retire to their lodgings the gates were shut and the garrison put in arms the king came and seeing the gates shut asked to speak with the governor who excused himself from letting him enter as trusted by the parliament the king gave reasons in vain the governor had received advertisement from york from william murray he was afterward created earl of dysert  one of the kings bedchamber as a friend advising him not to let in the king who was resolved if master of the town to secure him and cut off his head nothing was more false yet it had effect on hotham  the king then desired that his son and the rest might come out to him they were accordingly sent out one after another he then went back to beverly and york in hull there was a magazine of arms and ammunition for above twenty thousand men and a train suitable the king could not arm a hundred men had he not sent sir l dyves before he might perhaps have been admitted and would then be master of the town which was affectionate to him and the gentry attending were too numerous for hotham to resist the soldiers of the garrison all threw down their arms being called upon by some of the kings train without to do so nor did they take them up again till their officers with their swords in hand forced them some vigorous bold men that went with the duke of york should have been trusted with the design with an order on the rest to obey the duke for it was in their power several times after hotham ordered the gates to be shut to have secured him or knocked him on the head either would have done the work hotham came into the dukes room without any officer with him where he had before confined the duke yet none seized the opportunity sir l dyves and william murray groom of the duke of yorks bedchamber were the only ones for such a step and were resolved to kill him but they were confined before they could do it and a guard put upon them yet they were let out with the rest  the king wanted money and arms the queen sent captain j strahan with arms and ammunition and officers in the providence from holland else the king could not have formed an army captain strahan brought them into the humber where least expected so run aground at a place appointed he went from brill to the humber the signal was not answered he was forced to anchor when the tide was spent the parliament ship of fiftyfour guns came down from hull and anchored with another from grimsby near him they ordered him aboard but commanding one of the kings ships he refused he waited till afloat and then stood toward hull till near high water he passed over a sand then but twelve feet water and when past it ran aground the parliaments ships drawing more water were not able to follow the providence drew but eleven feet and a half water he got into the other channel by bearing up with all his sails the parliaments ships trying to follow stuck fast strahan landed at powle some miles below hull on the same side of the humber and ran his ships ashore so that it served for a battery to defend itself whilst the arms were landed and the seamen and officers were entrenched so that hull garrison durst not attack them a convoy was sent from york the king would not let the ship be burnt after the guns were taken out and carried to york the seamen were made gunners  essexs men were posted in the vale near keynton      oct    the king marched down the hill to fight them ruthen who had served as major general under the king of sweden and the earl of brentsord being ordered to draw up the army lindsay took it ill and said he would serve as colonel and put himself at the head of his regiment of foot posted against essex the kings army was above four thousand horse and eight thousand foot the rebels were three thousand stronger in foot but had not many more horse and few cannon it was three p m before the kings army were embattled when they marched slowly but with great resolution receiving the rebels shot till they came to push of the pike both sides retiring as if by mutual consent back a few paces struck down their colors and stood firm till both drew off when it began to grow dark the enemys left wing fled as soon as charged they were pursued without falling on the foot the enemys foot made the kings retire to their cannon which playing with success stopped them prince rupert could not stop his horse from pursuing or make them charge the foot lord willoughbys gallant behavior over his fathers the earl of lindsey who died soon after of his wounds at warwick he was an officer of experience he served with great reputation under maurice and henry princes of orange body who lay with his thigh broke by a musket shot and carried him to bs dressed but he was taken by some straggling horse who came in the way sir edmund verney was killed and his standard taken but it was recovered by the means of sir james smith both armies retired to their former posts and the king sent early next morning five hundred horse which brought off his own cannon and six of the enemys sir faithful fortescue had given notice of his intention some days before there were not full one thousand on both sides slain as the parson who buried and counted them said lord aubigny and lieutenant colonel monro were among the number the earl of lindsey died of his wounds at warwick about sixty standards were taken from the rebels the king marched to edgert and banbury taking the castle and so to oxford but it was of fatal consequence that he did not march to london which in the fright would not have coil him a stroke  ruthen the day after the battle desired the king to send him with most of the horse and three thousand foot to london where he would get before essex seize westminster drive away the rebel part of the parliament and maintain it till the king came up with the rest of the army but this was opposed by the advice of many of the council they were afraid that the king should return by conquest and said so openly they persuaded the king to advance so slowly to london that essex got there before him and the parliament ready before to fly took heart all the kings old foot were lost in the siege of gloucester and battle of newbury  the duke of york might have escaped from oxford      april  0 if sir george ratcliff his governor would have suffered it without a positive order from the king he was carried to london where the duke of gloucester and the princess elizabeth had been left when the king went to the north the earl of northumberland was made his governor all respect was used to him george howard brother to the earl of suffolk and colonel joseph bampfield his real name was bamford an irishman contrived his escape the first carrying all the messages between the duke and bampfield which was all he had to do  all things being prepared the duke of york supped at the usual hour about seven with his brother and sister and after supper all played at hide and seek with the rest of the young people of the house having played at it constantly every night for above a fortnight before the duke used to hide himself in a place where they could not find him for half an hour or more and then he would come out to them to prevent suspicion of his being gone when he really was the duke locked up a little dog that used to follow him into his sisters chamber to prevent his coming after him slipped down the back stairs went into the innermost garden and so into the park out of a back door of the said garden of which he had a key where bampfield staid for him having a footman with a cloak which the duke put on with a peruke he had ready and went through springgardens where one mr trip staid with a hackneycoach which carried them to salisburyhouse here the duke and bampfield went out of the coach as if going in there and trip went with the coach into the city and kept it as long as he could at the end of the town but as soon as the coach was gone they took boat and landed on the same side of the river close to the bridge and went to one loos a surgeon where they found mrs murray who had womens clothes ready for him to put on he was dressed presently and went with bampfield to lionkey where there stayed a fouroared barge for them they went in it down the river the tide serving them  but they no sooner entered the barge than the master suspected something bampfield having told him to be there with his barge and he should bring a friend with him not saying it should be a woman he thought something more was in it and was so frightened that as they went down he did nothing but talked with them how impossible it was for them to pass by the blockhouse at gravesend without being discovered and that they had no other way to get on board the ship that staid for them at the hope but to land at gravesend and get a pair of oars to carry them down when they debated the distance and showed him the hazard of getting a boat to carry them to the ship he objected the light of the moon he was soon satisfied fully that his woman was some disguised body of great quality for peeping through a cranny of the door of the barge where they then had a candle burning he saw the duke put his leg upon the table and pluck up his stockings in so indecent a manner as made him conclude what he had before suspected this confounded him so as he told them afterward that he hardly knew what he did or said which they perceiving thought it best to tell him the truth and trust him knowing him to be an honest man so the duke told him who he was and assured him that he would take care to provide for him and if it was not safe to return to london to carry him to holland the mans mind was now settled he resolved to pass by the blockhouse without going ashore and when they came near the town he put out the light let the barge drive down with the tide passed undiscovered by the blockhouse and got to the ship a dutch pink of seventy tons lying for them at the upper end of the hope she had been cleared at gravesend where sir nicholas armourer colonel mayard richard johnson three gentlemen with each a servant expected them whom bampfield had trusted and sent before that by their help he might master the vessel if need  they set sail at break of day with a fair wind and anchored early next morning before flushing where they staid expecting the tide to carry them up to middleburg the master with two of his four hands went ashore with the boat to flushing intending to be back by the time the water was high enough to go to middleburg but before he came back owen master of the barge who came along with the duke came down in a great fright to the small cabin telling them that a parliament frigate was coming in to look for them and would be with them presently and that they must get their anchor on board and sail for middleburg he was positive it was a frigate the two seamen would not get up anchor till the master came back but they were forced by the gentlemen and servants to do it though they said there was not water for it and the ship would be lost the ship proved only a merchantman the vessel struck twice or thrice but the master coming on board and the tide serving they got to middleburg before the tide was spent the duke landed in womens clothes staid all night went next morning to dordrecht and sent bampfield next day to the hague to acquaint his sister and the prince of orange of his arrival and to desire clothes he was missed in an hours time at st jamess when he was not sound on search notice was given to whitehall and general fairfax  rising in kent  rainsborough commanded a squadron in the downs of one second rate may      three or four fourth one fifth and three or four sixth rates and some ketches the constantreformation convertin antelope swallow satisfaction hind roebuck pelican constantwarwick these on notice of the three castles being surprised and seized by the insurgents declared for the king rainsborough seeing that they of deal had been instrumental in it went on board a ketch to go nearer to the shore the better to see what was doing there and thence sent orders to his ship to get under fail and stand as near as they could to the shore in order to batter the town accordingly they worked to get their anchors on board and in doing which in the constantreformation rainsboroughs ship and heaving out the capstern one of the boatswains mates robert lindale thought it the proper time to execute the resolution which he had taken some time before of doing something to serve the king having opened himself to three more common seamen whom he had found to be of his principles he proposed as all kent had declared for the king to get some of the ships to do so they now as heaving the capstern began to grumble at the orders received saying they had no reason to batter deal which was full of their wives children and relations to destroy it and them this working on the men they ventured further to say that it would be better to join with them for the king on crying one and all for the king lindale told them he believed that the lieutenant and some other officers of the ship would be against it and they must immediately possess the gunroom and arm themselves and then they might seize their officers and those that would not join them they did so secured their officers telling them they would declare for the king and as they would not comply they put them in the hold till they let them go ashore and such as had a mind to go with them the officers were forced to submit this done he got under fail and passing along the broadside of the next ship told them what they had done and bid them seize their officers in like manner else they would sink them and thus from ship to ship till every one had declared for the king  rainsborough seeing his ship had got under sail and yet not come up to him as he ordered but speaking to one another went to them with his ketch and asked his own ship what they were doing they told him he must not put his foot in it they having declared for the king but would send him his servants and some of his officers they did so and on his beginning to talk with them to return to obedience bid him hold his tongue or they would fire on him so he went away in his ketch up the river to acquaint the parliament the other ships turned out all their commanders then came ashore to tell the kent gentry what they had done and to desire some that were seamen to come on board and command them as sir william palmer captain bargrave captain foy and others did and put in other officers before they got out of the downs the earl of warwick came down in a ketch from the parliament to get them to return to their duty and desired to come on board of them they sent to know first what his business was he offered pardon redress of grievances if they would declare for the parliament their answer was they valued not the promises of parliament that they had declared for the king and would be loyal the earl showed a letter by which he had been invited down by some all these were sent to him he desired one of the ships for his better accommodation to carry him up the river promising on his honor to send it back they let him have the nicodemus a sixth rate but he did not keep his word  they then went to holland where the duke of york was to receive the princes commands and arrived at helveotsluys the duke went and staid on board with them till the prince came by sea from france he took the command and failed for the downs leaving the duke in holland and having first discharged bampfield an unquiet intriguing head from his brothers service his tampering with the seamen and driving on a presbyterian interest so offended the duke that he would never take him again into his service whatever application was made yet he supplied him with what he was able in his condition till the restoration  the prince about the end of summer came with the fleet to helveotsluys the earl of warwick with the parliamentfleet followed to the same port the dutch would suffer no hostilities and warwick returned prince rupert who was made commander of the kings ships went with prince maurice to ireland portugal the streights and the west indies where prince maurice and some ships were lost prince rupert returned to europe in      and landed at nantz the duke of york went to paris a few days before his fathers murder the king came thither in his way to ireland where nothing considerable remained in the rebels hands but dublin but he staid all the summer at st germains or in jersey till the end of september where he landed on the twentysixth of september and received an account of the rout near rathmines all thoughts of ireland were laid aside and the two ships sent by the prince of orange to transport him were sent back to holland addresses were made

orders    about complaints and calumnies against the kings servants this order was probably obtained through the influence of the earl of melfort who had become very disagreeable to many of jamess friends in england there is a paper in his own hand after he had retired from st germains entitled memoire justificatif du comte de melfort       may      this paper consists of twentyfour pages melfort begins with observing that he had been in great favor with charles and with james and that neither the changing his religion nor his rising so high in office had procured him any enemies before the prince of oranges arrival which he had always foretold without being believed but that he had drawn upon himself hatred and many enemies for the following reasons viz for having advised the king to accept of the assistance of france to send the prince of wales into a place of safety and to seize the most considerable of his enemies before the prince of oranges arrival  when the earl of sunderland was dismissed king jamess business with the court of france was committed to melfort he says he persuaded his master to accept of the assistance of france and having by his orders made the proposals to barillon he received for answer that there were no troops now on the coast of france nor vessels to transport them this gave great offense to the english particularly to the earl of middleton one of the secretaries of state melfort was in danger of being assassinated such were the prejudices of the people against the french he was obliged to retire to france and had their majestys orders to meet the prince of wales at dieppe where the prince would have landed if he had been sent according to their majestys orders from portsmouth upon jamess arrival at st germains melfort was made secretary of state for england and against his will was obliged to attend his majesty to ireland he dreaded lord tyrconnels temper and pride he claims great merit to himself for having saved that kingdom by his invention of copper currency and from his other services and fatigues he left ireland and exposed himself to be suspected of having been in disgrace with his master until it was seen that he was employed to execute a particular commission at rome but still he says sir theophilus oglethorp and his lady who is very intriguing and cunning continued to do him ill offices they thought it impossible that he should pardon them and therefore they retained their malice against him  melfort was recalled from rome where he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the french ministry to act again as secretary of state he carried on the correspondence with england jamess friends increased the king of france was induced to attempt an invasion and communicated his intentions to melfort alone james from thenceforward never called to his council five roman catholic servants with whom he used to consult while melfort was at rome this step which melfort opposed in vain created him many enemies  while melfort was absent montgomery whose father and grandfather were great enemies to the crown of scotland proposed to the king and to the queen by his emissaries and particularly by one jones to seize the government the papers which concern this affair were delivered up to the ministry though montgomery and jones maintained the contrary as melfort had foretold from rome from his knowledge of the men who were to conduct it montgomery on account of his hatred to the prince of orange having gained credit with two or three of the kings friends began again to make proposals to the king and to give him information of some men of quality who were in his interest as these men in whose name montgomery had advanced several things were for the prince of orange and whigs at bottom the king had reason to distrust him and ask an explanation jones was sent over by montgomery and when he arrived at st germains instead of showing who these men of quality were the king saw that he had nothing to expect from montgomery and the correspondence was interrupted until melfort returned from rome except some letters which montgomery wrote from time to time to strafford soliciting money a person who was so attached to the king that he suffered the torture with great firmness without making any discovery was sent in the mean time by one of the kings loyal subjects from scotland to inform him that montgomery had declared at the table of the marquis of montrose who is the kings great enemy that he also would be his enemy to his death  the correspondence was interrupted jones at the instance of the kings friends in england was thrown into the bastile abbe renaudot complained that melfort received few letters from england and furnished him with no materials for his gazette he went to see jones in the bastile jones promised to renew the correspondence and by renaudots means was allowed to make his escape when he arrived in england he blamed melfort for his imprisonment  melfort in the remaining part of this long memorial enlarges upon the prejudice done to him by the misrepresentations of montgomery and jones in england the intrigues of abbe renaudot in france his own difference of opinion with the marquis de croiffy about the terms of a letter proposed to be written by  two houses of parliament and with the earl of middleton about

have heard of the great doings here with the principe inglese as they call him russel here he passes for duke of bedford the cardinals and ambassadors themselves make court to him his defects are supplied by father cosmo clark who is every thing to him except his divine which office is supplied by a parson but the father is interpreter maestro di camera major domo and i pray god he be not somewhat besides to speak freely but with secrecy there are great abuses in this matter this father pretending to every body by way of secret that he has a sort of commission from the king to treat with the english nobility who may come hither and says that the king has by mr carryl writ to this lord and given him the title of marquis of tavistock whether all this be real or supposed is not the question that is not my business etc but it seems very improper that one who has no better guard upon his tongue should be trusted in affairs of consequence one whose glory and vanity would make him not only boast of what is but invent what is not of the which i will give you a considerable instance at torre de specchi very lately he gave himself out for a person of a great family and related to the king by the by he is grandson to a tailor and his father was a contemptible advocate by this lie he got a considerable present of agnus deis finely wrought and set into cases from a nun of the house of massimi mrs white told me this enquiring into his birth being asked by the said nun if what he said was true his keeping company with protestants does not pass without giving great scandal and if he has any such commission as pretended he makes no other use of it but to satisfy his worldly satisfactions and appetites which his habit would not allow him to do without this pretext of the royal countenance he says he has if you would be informed of him ask  who had from an eyewitness an account of his atheistical wickedness monseigneur caprara and the two rectors are too much imposed

 and      it consists of    numbers and almost every one of these numbers contains several letters but extracts have been made from them all as they occurred in the order of time consequently there is

and      they are almost all in italian and consist of memorials to the pope letters to nairne and a few to the chevalier de st george himself the cardinal was the chevaliers agent at rome the subjects of his letters and memorials are the severity of the oaths of allegiance on the english roman catholics  an application to the pope for a dispensation to take them  lord peterboroughs arrest

throne  difficulties attending the chevaliers marriage and place of abode  coldness of the court of rome  various negociations and correspondences  gualterios letters are mostly in ciphers but the cantnames are easily explained neither his letters nor his memorials are of much importance and accordingly few extracts have been made from them  volumes vii viii and ix quarto the first of these volumes is a copybook of the earl of middletons letters begun at st germains   th april      to   th march      the second is entrys of some letters of the earl of middletons most of them writ by m

most by n nairne  these letters throw considerable light on the intrigues of the times and every thing has been extracted from them that was any ways connected with the general history or with the private conduct and characters of individuals they are mostly allegorical and in ciphers and are often without a key but every thing of importance in them has been explained by a careful attention to trace the chain of the correspondence and an unwearied application in comparing them with one another and in discovering the views connexions etc of the several persons concerned access to the letters to which these volumes contain answers would have greatly abridged this labor but perhaps have brought but few important facts to light  the late mr thomas carte was a great collector of anecdotes from one  vo and three  to volumes of his memorandumbooks and a bundle of loose papers such of them have been inserted in the preceding volumes as were supported by collateral evidence and connected with the history of the period to which mr nairnes papers extend but as many of the papers collected by him in a large solio volume marked a l were not comprehended within this period it is necessary

grand duke of tuscany to mr thomas killegrews memorial     jan  0th    0  sir john berkley to mr secretary long   0  paris sept   th       the queen has not been in good humor of late speaking with more earnestness than heretofore of her going to remain in the carmelites sir john certainly meant the carmelitesses  the great want she is in for want of money to sustain her household has somewhat disposed her m thereunto she has been this two last days in debate about the reducing and regulating her family and has not made any considerable alteration though her majesty expressed in her last to his majesty her opinion for his going into ireland yet she is a little troubled to find his majesty has taken his resolution to go thither before it came to him mr montague has been here this four days and returns to pontoize tomorrow he is very much with the queen and i believe we shall be able to know what her majesty intends before she goes into the carmelites convent which will be five days hence to remain there for ten days  i sent as soon as i came thither my lord duke of buckinghams commission into flanders as judging it the safest conveyance his grace is expected here the next week i think i did not inform you in my last that my lord duke hamilton has written to a consident friend of his here that by no means his majesty ought not to acknowledge the parliament of scotland but in a full conclusion with them in which case there can be little said for the contrary only i am still of opinion that windram is not to have a refusal but that his majesty should send his answer into scotland by deputies of his own instructed as amply toward their satisfaction as will stand with a good conscience void of scruples and without doing any prejudice either to his hopes of montrose or to his present possession in ireland and since the scots have in a manner appeared for the crown swedeland methinks it should be of no ill consequence that his deputies in case of disagreement in the treaty should provoke them to a decision by an arbitration of that crown but i am not ignorant how unlikely any such proposition is to take effect without the expedient you know of without which i must and do despair of it i shall endeavor it still to the utmost of my power my most humble service to my lord wilmot and am yours  j b   m de marsys to secretary long nov  0th      a l folio page       he was translating king charles the firsts works  lord colpepper to mr secretary long anchuisen january       0       the following paragraph of this letter is in ciphers the emperor of russia has you know banished all english trade and the merchants are making up their packs as fast as they can but before they go i intend to demand of the emperor of muscow the custom unpaid for the english goods since they submitted to the new authority in england and if the emperor will comply with the kings desire in any thing it will more probably be in this demand which is so notoriously grounded on his majestys right and which will not cost the said emperor any thing out of his own purse this shall not slacken my endeavors in the rest literally in my instructions but shall only be a reserve  the duke of courland as his agent at amsterdam told me will lend his majesty three good ships the least of twentyfive guns they are now in these parts but it ought to be concealed if accepted until they shall be at sea for many reasons m wicford at the hague will negotiate any thing with the agent who had orders to comply with the kings desire therein that you shall intimate he himself has a design to send two or three good ships to the east indies with the kings commission and likewise with goods to trade if his majesty thinks fit paying a good proportion of the value of the prizes to him i only propounded for you to judge of it as i do the raising of a very round sum upon the islands of scilly upon a treaty to be made with these states think well of this latter and whether the king will be able to defend and relieve them this next summer but if he might receive  0000 l and they be put into the states hands as caution only for the money whereby they should be defended by them and possibly they thereby insensibly engaged in the kings quarrel it might be no ill bargain  a copy of king charles the seconds letter to lord loudon a l folio page     jersey january         0  the letter was sent by mr wyndram charles appoints commissioners from scotland to meet him at breda along with it was sent a letter to the clergy of scotland     charles in these letters promised to submit to the conditions which were proposed to him and particularly to acknowledge the convention of estates then assembled in scotland to be a parliament at the same time he wrote a letter to the marquis of montrose assuring him that he would make no concessions inconsistent with the powers he had given him in his commission and declaring that though he called them a committee of estates he was determined not to acknowledge them to be legally so this letter was intercepted and was of infinite prejudice to the king abram cowley on the   th of march writes about it to secretary long   0 in the following terms no doubt it has done the king a great deal of hurt but it is very happy that it has missed of the chief end for which i conceive it was published which was to hinder the treaty that danger is now over and the only doubt remaining is whether the treaty will produce an agreement and i dare say all the world besides a few of our nation believe it so great a madness not to agree that they think it impossible to happen          anonymous letters with news from leghorn april  th and   th    0 the queen mother to the king paris may   th    0 original monsieur mon fills jay veu

of argyles defeat     june   th       it is an account of facts which are well known  extract of a letter from sir john percival     july   th       he writes about the affairs of ireland the hardships of the act prohibiting the irish to trade directly to the plantations and the consequences of the proclamation calling in the arms of the militia  this proclamation does disquiet the minds of the militia especially of the common sort who are all fearful left endeavors should have been used to represent them to his majesty as persons disaffected to his service and not fit to be trusted with arms though they are all english and universally in those parts protestants of the church of england and have all taken the oaths of allegiance and supremacy a little before king charles the seconds death such being then turned out as refused and the officers have all produced certificates of their having taken the sacrament as required by the church of england upon an order from the government of this kingdom about    months since and many of the irish gentlemen of this country openly spread abroad reports and tell the english themselves that their arms are thus called in to be given to them as the kings best subjects and that they say is the meaning of the proclamation in the expression used therein viz that the captains are to keep the arms for the use of the militia or such other uses as his majesty may have for them this serves to disquiet the minds of the common people but the officers and all others of better sense are so well satisfied with his majestys gracious and royal opinion declared to the advantage of all the church of england principles that no such idle fear enters their thoughts but they wholly rely upon and acquiesce in the assurances given by his majesty whose word they know is sacred and inviolable  peoples fears of troubles here are very great especially if the rebel monmouth should have any success which disturbance breeds a great deal of ill blood here between the english and the irish the latter charging this rebellion on the whole body of the english and telling them that now their turn is come and that they will make the english of this country good subjects and the english on such occasions justifying themselves and telling them that though this be a rebellion in england yet it is only by the worst of the kings subjects there and that there are none but his subjects of england that appear in the kings service against them with abundance of other hot discourses of this kind that run about the country the irish charging all the english universally hardly three excepted in all this country as devoted to monmouth and not fit to be trusted by the king which language gives great offense and provocation to such of the english as hear it and administers greater occasion of jealousy between the irish and them than formerly insomuch as each say they are afraid the others will cut their throats and some more fearful or disaffected than others speak of sermons being in many places preached by the friars of this country upon the  th  th and  th verses of the ninth chapter of ezekiel and though i cannot find any such sermon any where by them preached yet it serves to amuse and disquiet the ignorant sort of people and to prejudice the little trade that is going about the country nobody buying any thing of the countrymen insomuch that i have not been able to receive the sixth part of my rent in money and am fain to receive the rest in beef or corn or to go without it  the most apprehensive of my friends on this side the water have been advising me upon score of security to cross the sea and to go live privately in england and though i see not so much cause to fear or expectation of disturbance as they pretend to see yet because they desired me to move it to you i desire the favor of your advice about it it is upon the advice of our friends that we have thoughts of sending part of our stock of
