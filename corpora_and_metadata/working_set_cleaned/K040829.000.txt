momus a poem or a critical examination into the merits of the performers and comic pieces at the theater royal in the haymarket  london printed for the author and sold by j almon opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly and j williams no    next the mitre tavern fleet street  momus no more shall monkeys mimicry engage no more shall cats and dog susurp the stage alluding to signior placidos monkey etc  see momus sons a single unit higher divert the town with his detractive fire while patents royal are to merit thrown to please sir f  n  s and a tasteless town see f  te the foremost of the mimic race amuse the town with scandal and grimace while private characters each scene adorn held up by him to meet the public scorn where customs brought on some peculiar mode of speech or air out of the common road if but deficient in a leg or eye or from misfortune chance to look awry this maimed mimic favored so by fate that he might still more truly imitate with selfvain zeal a stupid laugh to raise he with a low audacity conveys his borrowed puns with a sarcastic face joined by the meanest of the acting race without restraint his dearest friends expose  but f  te and friendship are eternal foes never did folly with such sway maintain her seat and with her baby rattle reign over apollo and his laurelld sons with glees and catches mimicry and puns like the loud quack in some small country town who with his fool entices every clown to see his pranks and filthy drugs to vend and with a puff their quality commend so f  te like him his own loud trumpet blows and with a puff his trash for wit impose as wrecks and rubbish follow every tide so every blockhead joins the laughing side blessed with a face of humor to engage at once a drooping and a laughing age sh  t  r with some pretensions to a name stands forth distinguished in the book of fame the grateful public will for humor take whatever blunder he may chance to make who fond of laughter oddity and whim have fixed the mask of comedy on him with face by bacchus or by venus marred for he is with both the mighty powers warred in word expressive and in gesture dry in action simple with a meaning eye see weston gravely force the hearty smile nor pall with low buffoonery the while whenever in sneak or drugger he appears garrick attends with patient eyes and ears and owns his humor natural and true for garrick must give genius her due see d  e d  s better half the year a mere poltroon  a hero now appear unnoticd and obscure he struts unknown an utter stranger to the injured town till f  te his patron impotent and wise at once convinces each beholders eyes that merit often beneath oppression dwells for see how d  s now himself excells aimwell cassio nay and many more such parts were never acted so before and that my muse may show her meaning plain hopes never to see em murdered so again an arrant stroller from the lord knows where a true itinerant now here now there who often from barn to barn from town to town ten nights has labored for a single crown see b  nn  r assume unawed by shame a mimics vile and despicable name there is no degree of acting all allow so very puerile infamous or low  for who ever knew a mimic yet inherit the smallest grain of genius or of spirit and has it not for ever been a rule to join a mimics name with that of fool the laughing stock of candor and of fame a very monkey with a human name but joins not he then in a blockheads cause that yields them favor or that gives applause each man of reason and of judgment must confess it neither laudable or just  b  nn  r a wilkinson would be but cannot so truly imitate as he to ape the manner of some better playr an act ungenrous at the best unfair why should one actor villainously try to damn another in the public eye either by malice or by envy led to hurt his brother in his fame or bread when to the world it is evidently known he never could boast a method of his own such are a pest and scandal to the stage and who but f  te would any such engage why dont the candid and insulted town in justice cry these imitators down for all must own the stage was never designed to point at this or that but all mankind even devotees must own the stage of use where it dont leave instruction for abuse lead by conceit and fond of stage applause yet stands condemned if judged by acting laws with face nor voice nor action to commend or win one single auditor his friend see s  w  n great in capitals appear disgust the eye and grate the dullest ear for he most surely of all human kind was never by nature for the stage designed long in hibernia has he trod the field where judgment often to prejudice must yield and with no small indulgence and regard though every night some noble part he marred see him return declining and in age riding his only hobbyhorse the stage and with a boyish zeal the toy embrace though time with years has wrinkled over his face of vulgar accent and of bullys pink a rolling sidle with a knowing wink coarse and robust who might perhaps engage had he been cast on the broughtonian stage p  l  r selfconfident attempts to please in highwrote parts of elegance and ease but like to him who rolled the stone in vain will never the summit of his hopes attain yet must we own him some small share of praise when bruin loader and such parts he plays he is sure to please while in this line he steers for in such parts he still himself appears then let him ever in that track remain where he is sure some small applause to gain and never more in gentlemen and beaux disgrace the stage the author and the clothes barry each season might delight the town but that we have better actors of our own yet think not barry that i will disgrace or mean to herd thee with the common race thou art an actor every judge must own and many years a favorite of the town till powell chanced within thy walk to tread and plucked the blooming laurel from thy head yet in othello must each actor yield there even garrick must give up the field and own thee for the part by nature framed we think of barry when othellos named not so thy son when in each part he tries to copy thee too often from nature flies yet will it faintly bear the name of fault to follow close the manners we are taught from thee his every method he conceived from thee each beauty and each fault received nor should we deem him destitute of art did he with decency perform one part o could my ardent yet unwilling muse obtain one kind and plausible excuse and without censure be indulged to spare and overlook the errors of the fair  but chaste astrea guides my feeble hand and will not listen to my warm demand blessed with a form of elegance and ease two requisites that must for ever please who for a season might perhaps engage when yates awhile retires from the stage see dancer now each highrate part possess and try to picture virtue and distress but judgment seems to leave her in the dark whenever she aims to hit the doubtful mark with bold presumption in despite of shame j  ff  s attempts to join the rank of fame and void of judgment attitude and speech she aims at characters above her reach when poor alicia with distraction raves and calls for racks for thunderbolts and graves did cinderilla ever scold so well when in her airs she bid you go to h  ll when drove by love and passion to despair and having lost all hopes begins to swear so sad alicia when by j  ff  s played a mere impetuous termagant betrayed  forgive me j  ff  s that i speak my mind true satire never leaves one fault behind but since she is brought thy errors forth to view so shall she speak of thy perfections too in thirdrate parts where nature dont require such skill in action or such force of fire when nor by pride nor by ambition led content the paths of moderation tread there spite of censure shall thou justly raise the smile of pleasure and the voice of praise see one in parts of wit and humor strive to catch the manner of a pope or clive for g  d  r the copyist betrays in every part of humor that she plays and from her acting it is plainly shown she likes their manner better than her own but such a barren genius declares who having no invention borrows theirs oglevies pretty and genteel i own and has some little sparks of genius shown time and instruction may in her produce with some small pains an actress of use behind appear a despicable race without one single requisite or grace beneath the notice of my honest muse and but to mention would herself abuse names both to genius and to fame unknown the needy stragglers of each country town fit but to form some necessary group or to complete f  tes miserable troop when furnished out with truncheons and with clothes see em a royal company compose by these enforced and armed with impudence see him invade the boundaries of sense break through the rules of genius and taste and lay with ridicule their kingdoms waste pleased with his own behold the mocker strive with some success his grubstreet to revive and every season palls us with the same till jaded patience sickens at his name each man of candor must in this agree his merit lies in inconsistency in art theatric destitute of skill yet makes a figure in a puffing bill in this judicious it is a crafty snare to catch the vulgar and to make em stare pleased with the promise of the joyous fun away to f  tes the herd unthinking run he gains his riches at the fools expense despised and shunned by every man of sense high on parnassus would he wish to ride and unrestrained the winged courser stride but is it not most evident to all the limping bard has had a fatal fall a famous playwrite would he seem to be a very phoenix to posterity  grief that his name must with his body die and all his bantlings with their father lie when lacking his distortion and grimace their sole protection and their only grace spurned and detested in some wiser age will never more get footing on

which we must own both laughable and new but candor will admit of no excuse where she beholds such personal abuse his patron commissary even all his drolls beneath this censure fall his orators a very hodgepodge see made up of rubbish and absurdity crammed full of puns of nonsense and parade with neither plot or meaning to its aid and while to wit he makes a false pretense or tries to introduce one line of sense with vain attempt he stammers at the task a very midas in apollos mask these grown quite threadbare and worn out with age like f  te himself a nuisance to the stage he is brought his
