the dissenters answer to the highchurch challenge  london printed in the year   0   the dissenters answer to the highchurch challenge as it is the character of the devil to bring a railing accusation so no man of sense or manners cares to imitate him all men of learning that ever i met with will allow that people may differ debate and dispute without billingsgate language that invidious names and indecent reproaches serve to gratify the spleen and flow from a redundancy of gall in the author but add no manner of force to his argument good words are as strenuous as bad and the satyr lies in the truth not the ill language of the book  from this principle the author of a late pamphlet with a title as long as a book and called the wolf stripped must not expect a return of dirt for dirt and while he calls every man by his name and yet is ashamed of his own calls most men out of their names and fills his book with the exuberance of his hypochondriack vapors he ought to be looked upon as an author not worth while to meddle with if a gentleman should fight with a chimneysweeper he may beat the man but he will daub himself so much will stink of the soot and foul his clothes that the victory is not worth the disorder twill put him into  in like manner he that will deal with this author in his own way must foul his mouth with so much beargarden language such rude unmannerly and unscholarlike behavior that he must be tainted with the ungrateful savor of his enemys malignancy and look like the man he meddles with as not worth any mans while  upon this account i shall not meddle with his voluminous tract it self but as he has made a fair challenge in the eighth page of his book to all the dissenters i am willing to enter a little in the case not so much expecting to silence a tongue pointed with raillery but to let the world know that the dissenters are not unprovided with strong arguments to defend a just cause  the challenge that this gentleman has made to the world and of which he seems so very confident is as follows  the dissenters make a heavy noise that the church will not purchase a reconciliation with the giving up only of a few indifferent things which offend their tender consciences  and the lowchurch lay the blame upon the highchurch with very severe reflections that they are obstructers of this blessed union  now let none of these be judges in their own cause therefore let the dissenters give in to the present convocation a list of such indifferent things which if granted they will promise to conform and heal the schism the scruples are theirs therefore they must make the proposal none others can tell what will satisfy them  if they will not do this let them stop their clamours and never more say that nothing will be granted them and that the church of england has no mind to heal the schism  but if they will do this then it will appear whether the high or the lowchurch will go farthest to purchase this desired reconciliation and which of them do in good earnest wish it and not rather to keep open the breach to serve other designs  next let those of the convocation who were formerly employed in this grand project of reconciliation of which they have made such boasts lay before the house the grounds and the terms of it that it may appear they were none but indifferent things which were to be given up to the dissenters otherwise let them too cease their railing at the highchurch as men of violent spirits etc for obstructing their designs or for suspecting whatthey were  the highchurch desire that they and the lowchurch and the dissenters too may be tried by their actions and not by the clamours on either side and that they may be heard publicly in the face of the world by the method proposed  and whoever refuse this and cannot propose a more rational and convincing way for the clearing of themselves let them be guilty  had this been a new challenge this author might have had some reason to have expected it should have been accepted and replied to  but since i find his reading as short as his censure is hasty i think the properest method is to revise what of this kind has been already done and to put him in mind that all he has said only ends in this absurdity of arguing viz the dissenters have already been challenged to this have accepted the challenge undertaken the defense of their doctrine and of their dissenting have effectually vindicated themselves from the charge of schism given reasons for their scruples and made proposals for conformity they have challenged the church to union and peace they have defended themselves from the charge of disloyalty and rebellion and offered the church to bring their loyalty to the test with them and none of these things have ever been answered or some of them not so much as replied to  now as this gentleman supplies matter of fact with indecency and railery i shall not need to follow him there he begins the very first page of his book with three positive falsities neither of which he can in the least tolerable manner make out  first that they have a society of writers  secondly that the dissenters find themselves worsted in argument  in the same page he tells us it is the method of the dissenters not to mind any answer but to repeat and repeat their own objections in infinitum  it is far from my design to reply to a book as full of absurdities and contradictions as it is verbose and malignant and therefore i shall content my self with these three instances    as to the dissenters having a society of writers i am so well satisfied of its being a forgery of his own that i challenge him to make appear that there is so much as a correspondence among them of any two together that have ever wrote in the behalf of the dissenters and as he is mighty forward to print names and to abuse them by name too he is welcome to set down their names if he can in which if he pursue his usual method of presuming things are so and then affirming it as positively as if he could prove it he will certainly ensnare and expose himself as much in the particulars as he has done now in the general  had the dissenters so much unanimity among themselves as he pretends they have they would have too great a share in the public regard to let such a hardmouthed author treat them in so scurrilous a manner as he does the government would suppress the spirit of railery in the mouths of these enflamers that they should not have such a full liberty of traducing and abusing their brethren in order to keep open the breach which it is every true english protestants desire and interest to see healed  no sir the dissenters have no such societies the spirit of union the more unhappy for them is not so much among them they are all forward enough to have any body serve them but it must be at their own hazard and at their own expense which a late unhappy author of theirs very lately had experience of enough to warn any man from venturing to serve them again  but therefore sir is it plain that this book is far from being wrote as a design of the party but with the sense of truth which every honest man has a right to vindicate  at the same time sir i affirm your party has and ever had a society of writers and whenever you desire it i am ready to gratify you with some of their names though i am not forward of printing names as a piece of rudeness unbecoming an author but a certain weekly paper now in course is publicly owned to be so wrote and i know personally that the wretched performance has occasioned some considerations among people of greater capacities to provide a set of men to do it better and to gratify them for the service  but sir i shall not enter upon the tedious work of recrimination as a thing in which there is so much room for launching out that the compass of this small tract would be too straight for it    you tell us the faction which is your civil term for the dissenters find themselves worsted in argument  it had been time enough to have boasted thus when you had put your armor off and when the many tracts wrote by the dissenters in their own just vindication have been answered  but this gentleman has the misfortune so to be blinded by his passion as to cry victoria before the battle is ended and not to trouble you sir with many negatives i wish you would let us see one time whenever by any thing but railery you worsted the dissenters  we confess sir that at ill language you have the better of us whether you have any professors of the scolding talent among your students we know not for you will not suffer us to be taught in your universities but we assure you that in those schools where we are fain to bring up our youth we teach no such science  but as if all you had laid down on that head were true and you were very certain that you had worsted the dissenters in argument you give them a home charge    that it is their method not to mind answers but to repeat and repeat their own objections in infinitum  now sir this may or may not be true according as you can or cannot give a genuine answer to the following account of answers given and books written by dissenters in their own vindication which you nor any of your church have ever yet thought fit to venture an answer to and when you can you may defend your church from unfair treatment of the dissenters in point of argument on this head  and not to go too far beyond the memory of those we are talking to i think there stands two books of the learned mr clarkson yet unanswered the one entitled no scripture evidence for diocesian bishops and the other a discourse of liturgies it is true there is a long and learned discourse of dr combers then precentor of york wherein with some of our authors spirit treating the memory of mr clarkson neither like a gentleman nor a scholar though all men know he was as much of both as ever the nation bred and though a dissenter had the honor to be tutor to the learned and most excellent dr tillotson late archbishop of canterbury  after this author has pleased himself with sufficiently reproaching his deceased antagonist he goes on to rummage antiquity to prove that liturgies were in use in the primitive church this was no part of the dispute and had not the doctor overlooked it in his haste mr clarkson had anticipated his whole discourse in p  whether liturgies or forms of worship and administration were in use in the primitive church or not is no part of the present dispute  but whether these liturgies were prescribed and imposed as terms of communion this is the question  now to this question the dr is not pleased to say one word as i can observe in his whole book but goes on to prove that to be true which mr clarkson granted and lets that alone which he denied  nay so ridiculous was this answerer in the management of himself both in the search of antiquity and in rendering those authors he quotes that a learned minister of the church of england merely with a respect to justice and learning replied to him and made it appear that the doctor did not so much as understand the language of the quotations this was mr samuel bold rector of steeples in dorsetshire  this i suppose is some peoples way of answering the dissenters and if this may pass for answering they are answered indeed but i must take the freedom to say it has yet remained unprovd that ever a strict literal compliance to any prescribed form of worship and administration of sacraments was imposed as the term or condition of communion in any branch of the christian church for above  00 years after our saviors time nay twould be hard to prove it ever done in any church in the world but ours to this day and they are still welcome to make it out if they can and till they do the world may judge whether the dissenters are worsted in argument or no  that there were bishops in the primitive church has also been defended with a great deal of skill but as to their diocesan royalty and juridiction they have always in prudence thought fit to let the dispute of it alone and i would advise them to do so still for they must find some other book to defend it from than the scripture and some other ages of the world to search for the practice in than that of the primitive church  but i must confess the dissenters were worsted another way in the case of dr calamy and mr delaun of which remarkable story this is the short abstract  dr calamy preaching a sermon at aldermanbury church entitled a discourse about scrupulous consciences makes the dissenters this fair challenge as by his printed sermon p  appears in these words could we but prevail with the people diligently to examine the merits of the cause our church would every day gain ground amongst all wise men for we care not how much knowledge and understanding our people have so they be but humble and modest with it nor do we desire men to become our proselites any farther than we give them scripture for it and in another place he goes on all we desire of the dissenters is that they would equally hear both sides that they would weigh and consider the arguments that may be propounded to them and being indifferent to either part of the question would think it no shame to change their mind when they see good reason for it  mr delaun a man whose learning and temper were conspicuous to all the learned world and particularly in the book he wrote accepts this challenge and writes down his reasons for nonconformity and as the doctor had printed his sermon and thereby appealed to the world all peoples mouths were filled with the fairness of the proposal and every body cried out the dissenters were worsted mr delaun therefore thought himself obliged to print his reply  but as the victory consisted as it does still in boasts and rhodomontades so they were as loath to be overcome as sensible that they should be so and took immediate care to suppress the book by seizing the copy at the printers and this was followed by seizing the author for writing a seditious libel put him in prison fined him vltra tenementum and were hardly prevailed upon to vouchsafe him the favor to excuse him the pillory which they at last told him in court was only remitted in respect to his learning  here was a true churchconquest and this gentleman was persecuted with so much true church zeal that he lay in newgate for his fine till he his wife and children died there to the eternal scandal both of the churchman and the dissenters the one that he should first challenge a dispute and then so basely treat the man that accepted it and the other that they should not contribute    l to save a life sacrificed for their defense and such a life as for real merit deserved infinitely more regard in a nation of humanity and religion as we fancy our selves to be  the book for which this gentleman was thus handled remains to this day unanswered by these people that boast so much of worsting the dissenters and they would do well to look back upon that book and make some rational reply to it before they tell us we can show no reasons for our dissenting  in like manner they proceed still with the dissenters upon other points of arguing as particularly by repealing and repeating in infinitum the charge of rebellion and faction whereas they have been over and over challenged make out their own loyalty of principles or practice to exceed the loyalty of the dissenters  and de foes test of the church of englands loyalty has received yet no other answer than his shortest way by a fine vltra tenementm and the reproachful answer of the pillory if this be your way of answering arguments gentlemen it is no wonder you can worst the dissenters  to proceed in their usual method a worthy member of the house of commons has published a book to vindicate the occasional bill and like those who take things upon trust has affirmed that all wise nations in the world have thought it necessary to entrust the administration of public affairs in the hands of such persons only as are of one and the same persuasion in matters of religion  a very handsome way of calling all the christian world fools for i defy him to show me one of those wise nations and to prove it by one instance unless where there has not been any toleration of other persuasions the turks only excepted  thus gentlemen we are worsted by forgeries and falsities not by arguments we are challenged to dispute and then ruined for disputing asked questions and then fetched up for answering them but since this gentleman has found an adversary capable to deal with him power and p  ts excepted i leave him to say the dissenters are worsted when he proves it by a sufficient reply  we are now challenged to prove that we dissent from the church in points so far from being essential as that the chnrch cannot be justified in refusing to abate them and we are desired to give in the objections to the convocation  what authority their author has from the convocation to make this offer i know not and do not see how i shall know it or whether the convocation will receive such a list of the indifferent things or no but since this bold challenger would be answered and will not be satisfied with a general reply but this must be spoken to by it self i crave leave to accept his challenge as far as the following particulars reach  first i do affirm this has been done already by the whole body of the dissenting ministers in such a manner and with such modest reasons as several of the episcopal clergy were so satisfied with and did so represent to king charles the second that their concessions were a sufficient ground of a union what and who hindered a union when the dissenters made such concessions i leave to this gentleman to tell us if he cares to expose his friends so much  secondly i do affirm that if the church of england would think fit so far to stoop to their dissenting brethren as to abate such things only and all such as are acknowledged by themselves to be indifferent if it would not reduce us all to such a perfect union as to comprehend all parties it would yet embrace so many in the arms of the church twould cause so many to return to the church among the dissenters as would render the remainder less considerable  i am to suppose the challenger in this matter does not expect i should give in such a list of alterations as would reconcile the quakers or perhaps not all other societies or to tell him what sorts would conform and what would not but i answer him in reason if i say for my self that upon such concessions i would conform with all my heart and thousands more i believe would do the like  since then he has made such an offer let us examine what it is we desire of the church what are the indifferent things we differ about and i join issue with him if the convocation thinks fit to make these abatements and amendments and we refuse to conform then i am content we shall pass for a people who are willing to keep open the breach to serve other designs  before i descend to the particulars it is necessary to make some enquiry into what i call indifferent    i call those things indifferent which are not essential points of doctrine without the belief or practice whereof a man cannot obtain salvation    all things introduced into the church of england either in worship or in discipline by humane institution which are not to be found either by command or by president in the holy scriptures which are the rule of our faith  on this head of indifferent things therefore i join issue with our author and if he thinks fit to present our humble address to the convocation that they will be pleased to make such abatement in the indifferent things following i am persuaded such multitudes of dissenters will come into the church as may very well deserve the name of a union though not of an universal conformity and the number of remaining discenters would be much the smaller  first of all as to liturgies we desire since it is all originally humane and made by men fallible and of like passions with our selves they may suffer such amendment as are reasonable and justifiable from scripture and the practice of the primitive church  secondly we desire that after such amendment the minister may not in all cases be tid up and prescribed by the letter of the book but may have liberty to express himself at large in prayer as the present exigence of the case may require and his own abilities may supply  thirdly we desire the ordination of ministers by presbyters may be allowed being justifiable by scripture and that our ministers may be admitted into holy orders without the reordination and imposing of unreasonable oaths  fourthly we desire the kneeling at the sacrament bowing at the name of jesus the cross in baptism the use of the surplice and all those things owned by the greatest masters of the dispute to be indifferent may either be wholly left out or so left at the discretion of the people as that they may not be imposed upon them without their consent  fifthly we desire the episcopal hierarchy to be reduced to such a pitch of authority as may be justified by the scripture and to no other and we are ready to enter into an examination with them what that particular of power amounts to and how far it extends  i do not say these are all the heads which i suppose the dissenters require but i say these are some of them and the most considerable and if the church would give such concessions as were reasonable on these heads the controversy would soon be decided whether the dissenters separated from the established church on frivolous grounds or no  first as to alterations in the liturgy it is the avowed opinion of the church of england that no church in the world is infallible and above all our church does not pretend to the title if then we are not infallible but subject to err and mistake why should she refuse to enter into the cause whether it is convenient to make any farther or more perfect reformation or no but though the consideration were not on a farther reformation yet if it were only giving up some smaller matter for the sake of christian peace it were not commendable only but a due requisite temper in a christian church  as to them that blame the dissenters for separating let us enquire of them if they are incapable of greater light and consequently of knowing better what they ought to do than they did before if then they will suppress this light and refuse to amend things though the light of their own conscience directs them to it where lies the charge of schism surely not at their door who would only pursue a perfect reformation and think it their duty to serve god in the way most agreeable to his revealed will in the scriptures but at theirs who would oblige them to worship him according to the inventions of men by forms and methods for which they have neither warrant command of example either in the scripture or the primitive practice of the church i appeal to all the world that as well now as before it is not our faults that they bring the liturgy upon the stage of dispute but the bold challengers of men that can never make good their arguments and they ought first to have answered what has been said already before they had challenged us to show new reasons  wherefore in the sense first of the irresistible force of what has been said already and secondly of my incapacity of saying more to the purpose at least in so short a time i make the proposers this fair offer and they are at liberty to carry it to the convocation for it is their business not ours    when they will please to answer mr de launs plea for the nonconformists and the substantial yet unanswerable reasons there given for our dissenting    when they will please to reply to the concessions of the dissenters in the conference at the savoy and prove they were not sufficient grounds of an union    when they will confute the scriptural authority of bishop ushers model of church government which was much the same with the scheme the dissenters presented to king charles the second and give the reasons why the bishops refused it baxt life cap      if they please to reply  a little more to the purpose than mr osfley and mr hoadly has done to the grounds and reasons of nonconformity in the  0th chapter of baxters life abridgd by mr calamy and to some yet unanswered things in mr calamys reply to mr hoadly    if they please to give a rational answer to the first second and third vol of the conformists plea for the nonconformists wrote by a member of their own church and to gillespys view of english popish ceremonies  whenever these things are soberly and judiciously answered and as dr calamy proposed good scripture and reason brought for it assure your self sir when these things are answered there shall be no manner of need to bring an occasional bill to prevent the alternate conformity of dissenters it is most certain that the far greater number of them will come in and become your christian united brethren and till you do these things gentlemen we appeal to all the world who are the causers of the schism you speak of those that all along offered to come in upon reasonable conditions or those that have persecuted us for not complying with humane institutions which are no where to be found in scripture which is the only rule of faith  and thus now the world may see with what truth these gentlemen blacken the dissenters with their repeating objections but taking no notice of answers which i here fairly return upon them and assure them that whenever they will answer the objections in mr de launs book against the liturgy and canon of the church of england and prove the same to be necessary from scripture and reason i will certainly conform for i believe and own it my duty to conform to them if i can and i can never resist conforming to any thing which is proved to be my duty from reason and scripture  i think it is needless to say much of my own after such men as these have appeared and gone off the stage with no reply neither can i satisfy my self to attempt any thing by way of addition to men of such exalted learning till i can see something new offered upon these heads and unless these gentlemen have something to say more than has been said before them by men superior in learning to themselves what they now advance savours of an arrogance peculiar to themselves and which i like so ill that i care not to imitate  i shall therefore think it more than sufficient thus to tell them what has been said already and if they have any thing to say by way of reply that demands an answer they may not want what is needful to justify the practice and principles of the dissenters to be such as neither the charge of faction or rebellion can be laid at their doors and it seems by this challenge he would let the world believe that the church of england would not stand with the dissenters for small matters and i cannot but wonder with what face he can publish to the world these following words which i am persuaded he has no authority for from his superiors  we should have little quarrel with the dissenters about all the objections they make as to habits ceremonies liturgy and even the grand point of ordination by presbyters in cases of necessity if it were not for that fulsome word schism if they did not gather separate congregations and set them up in opposition to the church and so form a schism they would be no dissenters notwithstanding their different sentiments as to the points before mentioned all these are his own words p    thou hypocrite out of thine own mouth shall thou be condemned if you had not quarreled with us about habits ceremonies liturgy and ordination there had been no schism no separate congregations gathered no breaking off from the church no such thing as dissenters at least but few among us and to impose this upon the world after such plain evidence as has been given to the contrary deserves a courser title than i care to foul my paper with and evidently shows the method of the party who run down the dissenters by falsities and forgeries  and that i may do what these people seldom concern themselves about i lay it down as a truth that when king charles the second was restored to the crown the present dissenters being then desired to conform to the church of england and their ministers having very good inducement so to do viz the possession of their livings and benefices they were commanded by the king to give in their proposals upon which they would conform  and it is needful to give a short abstract of the proceedings in that case in order to let the world see what occasioned the schism these people cry so much out of and to place the guilt of it where it really lies for as the morality so the immorality of every action consists in the principle from whence it proceeds and the end to which it is designed  at the restoration of king charles ii to put the dissenters in hopes that a reconciliation was intended ten or twelve of the principal of them were made his majestys chaplains and these designing to improve that opportunity waited upon him introduced by the earl of manchester and humbly recommended to his majesty the happiness and the opportunity of a union among his protestant subjects in matters of religion and begging of him that only necessary things might be the terms of union  the king declared himself very favorably on this head professed that the proposal was exceeding agreeable to him and promised them to do his utmost to bring it to pass telling them withal that this agreement could not be expected but by abating something on both sides and meeting one another in the midway and that if they were willing to do their parts if it was not effected it should be their own faults and not his  here it may very well be observed that the schism lies directly at the door of the church if the kings words are true for the dissenters did make offers of meeting half way and more than half way as shall presently be made out and if our brethren of the church can make out one step offered by them in the most indifferent circumstance then ours is the schism and not theirs if not vae vobis hypocritae job      thine own mouth condemns thee and not i yea thine own lips testify against thee  the king after this directed that they should bring in proposals of the utmost they could yield to and they in return besought his majesty that at the same time that they offered their concession to his majesty the brethren on the other side might also bring in theirs containing the utmost they would abate and yield to in order to concord and the king promised them it should be so call ab baxters life p      according to this direction of the king they met and agreed upon a paper with a most humble address to his majesty they make four preliminary requests to the king and then offered their proposals an abstract of which you have in mr calamys abridgment aforesaid p     and for the faithfulness of the quotation the reader is referred to the original which is to be seen in print  first they request that serious godliness might be countenanced a learned and pious minister in each parish encouraged that a personal public owning the baptismal covenant might precede an admission to the lords table and that the lords day might be strictly sanctified they offer to allow of the true ancient primitive precedence in the church with a due mixture of presbyters in order to the avoiding the corruptions partiality tyranny and other evils which are incident to the administration of a single person the things which they principally blamed in the english frame were the great extent of the bishops diocese their deputing commissaries chancellors and officials to act in their stead their assuming their sole power of ordination and jurisdiction and acting so arbitrarily in visitation articles bringing in new ceremonies and suspending ministers at pleasure and for reforming these evils they proposed that bishop ushers reduction of episcopacy unto the form of synodical government received in the ancient church should be the groundwork of an accommodation and that suffragans should be chosen by the respective synods the associations be of a moderate extent the ministers to be under no oaths or promises of obedience to the bishops as being responsible for any transgression of the law and that the bishops govern not by will and pleasure but according to rules canons and constitutions that should be ratified and established by act of parliament as to the liturgy they owned the lawfulness of a prescribed form of public worship but desired that some learned and pious and moderate divines of both sorts might be employed either to compile a new liturgy or to reform the old adding some other varying forms in scripture phrase to be used at the ministers choice as to the ceremonies they humbly represented that the worship of god was perfect without them that god has declared himself in matters of worship a jealous god that the reformed churches abroad most of them rejected the ceremonies that were reclaimed here that here in england they had ever since the reformation been matters of contention and dispute that they had occasioned the silencing of many pious and useful ministers and given rise to many separations from the church that they were at best but indifferent and in there own nature mutable and therefore they begged that kneeling at the sacrament might not be imposed and that the surplice and the cross in baptism and the bowing at the name of jesus rather than christ or emanuel might be abolished and that care might be taken to prevent future innovations contrary to law that so the public worship might be free not only from blame but suspicion  does this look like a proposal from men that did not dissent but upon factious and politic principles it is hard there should be any occasion to revive the discourse of these things at a time when we wish for that peace and union which her majesty has so earnestly invited us to but these men of storms and heat who are wilfully ignorant themselves are willing other men should be blindly so and therefore it is necessary a little to refresh their memory and to show to the world that this schism and separation of the dissenters was wholly occasioned by the church refusing to give up indifferent things and imposing those indifferent things as terms of communion upon the consciences of all the people  the king upon the ministers delivering in the proposals and address treated them very respectfully says the same author renewed his professions of his earnest desires of an accommodation of the differences told them he was well pleased that they agreed to a liturgy and yielded to the essence of episcopacy  here is an acknowledgment from the head of the church that the dissenters were for an accommodation agreed to a liturgy and to the essence of episcopacy and yet our modern men of peace will throw all the breach upon the dissenters  now gentlemen let us examine your christian highchurch temper these yielding complying dissenters met with that we may see whether they were out or were driven out from the church  the dissenters that were to be for yet they were not so expected according to their request and his majestys promise to be met with by the divines on the other side and to see their proposals but none appeared and after long expecting their condescentions and compliances at last they received a satirical answer by way of reflection to their proposals but not one word of condescension and compliance  as to churchcovernment they declare for the former hierarchy without any alteration and inviduously insinuate that their reflections on the consequences of a single persons administration in the church was as applicable to the civil state the extent of diocesses they declare suitable enough to the bishops office and the administration of ecclesiastical jurisdiction by chancellors etc regular in the main bishop ushers reduction they reject as inconsistent with two other of his discourses as being at best but a heap of private conceptions the liturgy they applaud as unexceptionable and think it cannot be said to be too rigorously imposed when ministers are not denied the exercise of their gifts in praying before and after sermon which sort of praying they declare however is but the continuance of a custom of no great authority and grown into common use by sufferance only without any other foundation in the laws and canons the revising the liturgy nevertheless they yield to if his majesty thinks fit as for the ceremonies they could not part with one not being able to think that the satisfaction of some private persons was to be laid in balance against the public peace and uniformity of the church nay were any abatements made they are satisfied unquiet spirits would be thereby encouraged to make further demands  ecce signum here is the foundation of the dissenters schism in three heads  episcopal hierarchy without alteration  liturgy vnexceptionable and impossible to be too rigorously imposed  ceremonies not one to be parted with  pray gentlemen how long have ye altered your minds that you can now say you will not quarrel with us for habits ceremonies or ordination and when we offered to agree with you in every thing else you would have your ordination without alteration you would not part with one of the ceremonies and thought your liturgy vnexceptionable and that it could not be too rigorously imposed how long is it since these gentlemen have been of a better opinion and when all is done how shall we be sure their proposal is genuine while we have experienced so much falsity and illgrounded passion as before  here now is the picture of a highchurch challenge to which we may very well answer we are the same that we were when we made the proposals to king charles the second and we have a great deal of reason to believe you are the same too ill nature seldom turns changling it is true you did promise us fine things you promised to come to a temper with the dissenters and declared twas your principle to give an ease to consciences truly scrupulous and upon this foot you obtained upon us to join with you in the revolution now you talk of honesty pray gentlemen do us the favor to let us know in what you ever performed that promise and when we are to expect it  now you shall be put to trial of your honesty and justice what commission you had from the convocation to tell us you would not differ about habits ceremonies liturgy and ordination i know not and believe you will be puzzled to produce it but i venture to say to you from abundance of the dissenters that then you shall differ with us for nothing remit us these and we will conform to you and be all one church and one people  it is about these things chiefly you differ with us you have no pretenses but these upon us the articles of rebellion forty one the ryehouse plot castaress evidences and more we can allow you all these and many more than is true and yet prove that your principles are as disloyal and your practices have been as full of rebellion as ours you have made as many insurrections against the established governors of the nation as we you have made as many factions against the princes and the laws took up arms as often killed as many kings or endeavored it as we and how often have you been challenged to come to a test of your loyalty with us but you are proof against argument and without taking notice of these things or of any thing else that stands against you you repeat and repeat your railings and suffer your tongues to launch out in a senseless and insignificant manner in insinitum  and to help load the dissenters with infamy you charge them with all that has been done in scotland where the arbitrary tyranny of state ministers oftentimes made the people desperate no wonder if from such principles you can charge them with burning the city of london one would think these gentlemens passions should not make them forget their reason so much as to expose their proceedings to their own friends  did not the committee of parliament fix the firing of the city upon the roman catholics by the irresistible testimony of the persons concerned and why must the dissenters do it had you brought them by persecution to such desperate fortunes to such despair as to set fire to their own houses were there not almost as many of them burnt out as of the church  the ridiculous fury of these men is an answer to themselves and upon the whole i offer to make out that the dissenters have on all occasions behaved themselves with as much zeal for the government as much sincerity to the sovereign and as much loyalty as the church has done let them begin the debate when they please  on the other hand i will prove that the high church party has tyrannized over them by all the illegal unchristian methods possible endeavoring to drive them to the extremities of despair and rebellion  i will prove by the preachings printings and declared judgment of several of the most zealous high party that however the practice was disowned by the party upon the unseasonable exposing it by the book called the shortest way yet that it has all along been their desire and very often in their design and i appeal for the truth of it among many instances to a letter of a known churchman whose original i have by me being wrote to a person who sent him the book for a present  sir  i received yours and enclosed the book called the shortest way with the dissenters for which i thank you and next to the holy bible and sacred comments i place it as the most valuable thing i can have i look upon it as the only method and i pray god to put it into the heart of our most gracious queen to put what is there proposed in execution  here is the character of a highchurchman drawn to the life but when in a post or two this gentleman understood it was wrote by a dissenter in his next he sends up an invidious character of a whig and what in his opinion such a one deserved  and now gentlemen would reason and arguments serve for a reply to you i should go on with your voluminous rapsody of scandal but really it is so full of rudeness and want of manners as well as want of truth that i choose to let it go and return to your challenge about our conformity and this you direct us to lay before the convocation which i cannot but make some just exceptions to    i see no reason to believe the convocation has given you any authority to make the proposal i cannot but believe that the convocation knows too well what and how often the dissenters have offered the very thing these gentlemen propose the convocation cannot be ignorant that all proposals of amendment and abatement are ungrateful and disagreeable to the temper of these highchurchmen and the convocation could not be guilty of so much imprudence to offer that to us now which we have so often offered them to no purpose    i see no reason to believe the convocation will perform the conditions these gentlemen propose viz to abate the habits ceremonies liturgies and ordination and therefore gentlemen you are desired to take back your own words with this fair proposal  whenever the church of england ceases to quarrel with us about habits ceremonies liturgies and ordination we are content that those dissenters which shall after that refuse to conform may be taxed with being unwilling to have the breach healed with being obstinate dissenters or what you please  it is an unaccountable assurance in any author to advance such a notion to the world in which had they power but of reflection on themselves they must of necessity see they were in the wrong  pray gentlemen what do you think we differ with you for we hope you are protestants we have owned you a true church and that we differ from you in nothing doctrinal or absolutely necessary for salvation will ye keep your words with us then here is your challenge answered  get the convocation to pass it into an act that the church will not quarrel with us about habits ceremonies liturgies and ordination the schism be upon us if we do not conform  if you cannot do this then make us no more challenges never write to us to tell you upon what terms we will conform we are ready to conform upon your own terms we take you at your own words do but perform what you have voluntarily proposed we are your own  not but that we have great reason to say we know very well that this offer is neither in your power nor in your nature not in your power as private men not in the nature of your high church as a party  nor is it any breach of charity to say so because we have had so much experience of your temper on all occasions in this matter and in particular in the conferences at the savoy where the dissenters made all the concessions of charity and obedience that they were able to do with any safety to their consciences they went through the common prayer book and proposed only such amendment as they found absolutely necessary to make it tolerable to them and their hearers they offered to dispute upon the amendments they had made and to justify all their objections by the scriptures  in a word they offered to conform so far as they were able to answer it to god their consciences and the world and he that requires men to offer more or else rejects them and shuts them out of their communion would do well to tell us who are the authors of the schism  but after all these gentlemen by what i can perceive are as ignorant in the thing they call schism as they seem to be in other things and we have the testimony of the house of lords in which there concurred most of the bishops of the church of england that the dissenters are not schismatics see the reasons of the lords against the bill to prevent occasional conformity  and had these gentlemen bethought themselves when they charge us with this schism for separating from the church they would have reflected a little on mr hales of eaton a sober and judicious divine of the church of england who in his treatise of schism lets them know that separating in communion from any particular church is not a schism if the persons are not separated from the whole body of christians but he that holds the head holds fast the faith and does not divide in faith and doctrine cannot be said to be guilty of schism for his refusing to join in communion with this or that particular church the church of christ is that whole body of christians however dispersed all over the world who are united to him by faith and are the members composing and joined to his mystical body professing the same doctrine and faith though divided into never so many several communities societies and other parts  if this be to be schismatics it is plain the dissenters are not no schismatics and thus we have the testimony of the church ministers we have the vote of the church of england bishops and a majority of the house of peers that the dissenters are no schismatics  what shall we say now if the dissenters are allowed by the church not to be schismatics and if the house of lords concur in the vote and if you will not will not quarrel with us for habit ceremonies liturgy or ordination pray let these authors tell us what is the difference among us the people may soon be united for here is little left to dispute of  what then is it we are treated for in such a scandalous manner for what is it we are called by sir h m a people unsafe to be trusted with any part of the administration in what are we dangerous to the government in what is it unsafe to trust us why ye are enemies to monarchy and always plotting against the government says these learned and passionate authors  say you so sirs we will come to an account of plots against monarchy and government when you will and whenever we do you will be found guilty of more than we  but you have given us a long list of dissenters plots as you call them and of people executed for them first of all i believe twould be hard to prove the dissenters were in a plot every time some of them were hanged for it and we have seen some church of england parliaments vnhang them again as far as they could to do justice to their posterity but i shall not ravel into the list of dissenters plots at this time only i cannot avoid telling this author that he has not given a fair account of them the dissenters sir have been guilty of more plots against the government than you charge them with and more have been executed for it than you tell us of for i assure you the author of this wears a mourning ring on his finger given at the funeral of mr christopher love a presbyterian minister beheaded anno      for the horrid phanatick plot contrived for the bringing in as they then called him charles stuart and the restoring of monarchy  and now we come to examine a little this authors preposterous motion that we should give in our grievances to the convocation why truly gentlemen we have grievances which the convocation might redress but we dont expect they will and some of them are as follow  i it is our grievance to be falsely accused as mismanagers of the late reign when we had little or nothing to do in it as unsafe to the government when we have all along endeavored to uphold it as enemies to peace when we challenge all our enemies to testify who has the greatest zeal for the public concord the dissenters or the church    it is our grievance to be challenged to show on what terms we can conform and large concessions offered us in the name of the convocation by men who are so far from having any authority from the convocation that the gentlemen of that assembly do not think it worth while to own what they say or perform what they promise in their names as it certainly is in this case    it is a grievance to us and to the whole nation that we should at first to gratify a party and to fortify the state policy of tricking and designing men be driven out and cast off from the church communion and the society of fellow christians for trifles and things indifferent  perhaps i am not of so free an opinion as to the indifferency of all the things in which we differ as the church themselves but they are allowed by the church themselves to be indifferent and they are particularly indifferent in the sense of indifferency explained as before and therefore ad hominem they are really indifferent even the whole of church discipline is so far indifferent that whether this or that model be settled either party are allowed to be capable of salvation without prejudice to their belief in that head or to speak plain a man may go to heaven in the practice of either of them but yet as conscience directs ought to have liberty to choose for himself  but to be cast out of christian communion for trifles for such are all the indifferent things compared to the more essential points of religion this is a grievance and this is indeed the original grievance and the first cause of all their speparation which our author calls schism to impose what they own the scripture does not impose  it is my opinion generally speaking that no church can justify keeping out any person from their communion for any thing that will not in its own nature and circumstances keep him out of heaven to keep us out of the communion of the church for things which you own we may be saved without will find but slender authority in the scripture to justify  but after all suppose our grievances were laid before the convocation will this author assure us of relief this way will he undertake to tell us any thing the convocation has done that way for any body nay will he be pleased to tell us whether that body who have now set above fifteen years annually have done one act or thing for the benefit of the church they represent will he please to give the world a history of their actions and engage to make out they have done any thing but wrangle among themselves for so long time these men of uniformity have they had any uniform proceedings have they in short done any thing worthy of themselves or the church they represent if they have we would be glad to hear it if they have not to what purpose should we apply to them for the healing our breaches  besides this let us ask him another question do the convocation agree among themselves have not some gentlemen filled the world with volumes and learned tracts on little matters relating to adjournings and recesses of that assembly and that one difficulty seems not yet mastered and how can we expect that spirit of candor that temper and peaceable mind which is absolutely necessary to bring to pass so great a blessing as this of a protestant union how can we look for it from an assembly that cannot decide their own controversies nor heal their own breaches  upon the whole it seems to me this man of gall has overshot himself has gone beyond his commission and has made a proposal he had no authority for and promised for people that will not perform for him  wherefore upon the whole matter as we have small reason to hope for a reconciliation of principles i think the present business of the nation is to arrive at a reconciliation of parties a conjunction of interests a general union of affection where there cannot be a union of opinions that the strife of parties and factions may cease and that clamor and contention may be at an end  could this be brought to pass it would really be the greatest step toward conjunction in religious matters  first this would make our charity extensive and we should not make it our constant business to accuse but excuse one another reproachful terms and marks of distinction would die of course protestant would be the common name of all opinions  god be praised we are all of one religion in england though we differ about methods we pretend to be all traveling to heaven though we fall out by the way and we fall out about the way too but if every man disturbed himself less about the course his neighbor steers and concerned himself more about his own there would more find the right way thither as far as humane conduct is concerned in the voyage to heaven  as to the dissenters in england they are misrepresented to the nation that they are for tumults and rebellions insurrections and pulling down monarchy and governments enough has been said here and elsewhere to invite the accusers to a fair debate but the present case chiefly respects their interest they are not a small nor a poor sort in the nation the old proverb of intrest will not lie is on their side men of estates are never for pulling down houses burning towns and ruining nations it is natural for trading men to be wise for themselves it is men of desperate fortunes are for embroiling kingdoms and setting states and governments into a flame  the dissenters in england generally speaking are the men of trade and industry and what estates they have lie principally in stock of goods houses and credit no public disaster can befall the nation but what affects their estates more than other mens banks stocks trade foreign and domestic these are the first things that suffer on any public disorder and none of those people who are thus embarked in trade can be properly thought to desire disasters and revolutions because they are generally the first that feel it  there may indeed be some men among them that want principles and may act ill but these are few and not remarkable the generality of the dissenters must be blind to their own interests as well as enemies to the government and their neighbors when they promote factions and divisions in the state  it may not be amiss to observe in this case what i appeal to any mans judgment in besides my own in the particular article of stocks in the city when the people are uneasy at any public matters and the prospect of affairs looks with an ill aspect the stocks fall again on the contrary when they are easy the stocks rise and the stockjobbers frequently manage such occasions and on this head it is observed that in the case of a certain bill depending in the house when the people thought it would be passed stocks fell again when the talk of it began to be laid aside as it really was for some time all stocks rose in price and when it came to a period they still advanced again  not that i argue from hence that the dissenters are the chief parties interessed in the stocks for it is plain they are not but from hence may be seen by any man who does not put out his own eyes the great benefit of peace and union the effect it has on trade credit and the value of estates  besides the author of this book discovers a spirit of too much rancor and malice to make it fit to talk with him i am told he is not an englishman and indeed he seems not to be an englishman by his furious way of treating the english nation at a time when they are all inclined to peace with one another the least thing can be said of him in this case is that he discovers impotent rage at a people who god be praised are out of his reach and the remnant of his railing talent may lie either against the lords who have rejected the occasional bill on whom without doubt he will plentifully bestow the usual titles of a faction a party lowchurch men and the like  or else he may give himself a loose at the queen who several of his habit for we understand he is a brother of the gown have left off to pray for except at church where they cannot help it and as mr  of highwickham has entirely left her majesty out of his grace after meat ever since her speech to the houses of parliament for peace and union so these gentlemen may be expected with him to give her majesty a cast of their foul language as soon as they dare do it  but one word with this gentleman and then i conclude and that is about plotting for the dissenters have been his plotters and his rebels all along and have on all occasions been very roughly handled by him as to associations treasons rebellions and the like  now i would fain desire this gentleman to tell us a little news about a plot in scotland her majesty has given her parliament an account that she has unquestioned information of a plot in scotland for our parts we expected it from the malignancy of the party there but now a declaration of its unquestioned reality from the throne has put the matter of fact out of question  now as this gentleman keeps a very good correspondence there which appears by his own writing i could most earnestly recommend to him to inform the world how many dissenters or presbyterians there are concerned in it  without doubt he can make it appear there are no highchurchmen in it for they good men are of such untainted principles as to loyalty they are so true to the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance that it is impossible they can ever be concerned in any such thing no no it must all go upon the poor papists those roman catholics are sad fellows they are always plotting and these whigs and dissenters they must have a hand in it just as this author says they had in the fire of london the dissenters were indeed very eager to set the nation in a flame when they set fire to their own houses to begin it  but alas for us what shall we say now if it may be proved that here are a great many highflying churchmen in this plot then the wolf will be stripped indeed what if here should be deposed bishops nonjurant parsons and highchurch episcoparian scotsmen in this plot against the queen and her government what shall we say then why i will tell you what they will say they will say that presbyterian tyranny has drove them to such extremities that flesh and blood could bear no longer to which i shall answer not at all granting the truth of fact that just as much had the rebels at  and bothwellbridge to say that episcopal prelatick tyranny drove them to such extremities that flesh and blood could bear no longer  from whence i draw this short inference that whether they are churchmen or dissenters one religion or another when men think themselves oppressed let their principles and pretense be what they will they will always forget those pretenses nature will prevail they will attempt their freedom and seek by force to resist force  church of england church of rome church of scotland church of france any church in the world whenever they are oppressed they will rebel  but one thing we must tell these gentlemen they differ from their brother rebels in that they have plotted and rebelled with half the oppressions and tyranny as others have done before them  and if ever these gentlemen please to compare the sad and doleful sufferings of the episcopal dissenters in scotland of which they have made so much noise with the miseries murders plunders and barbarous usage of the dissenters in scotland for  0 years before it will be easily seen which had the most cause to cry out of flesh and blood being able to bear no longer and whenever they please to enter into the detail of these things we are ready to join issue with them on this head  the author or authors of this wolfish book would have done well to have taken advice from a gentleman of their own party and who writes on the same subject who has said much more to the purpose and in language much more suitable to common civility and good manners i mean the author of a book entitled union to the church of england freely offered and earnestly recommended to the dissenters from it of all persuasions but particularly to the occasional conformists  now though i am of the opinion that the arguments that gentleman makes use of may be answered yet i must acknowledge to his honor that while on the one hand he discovers himself to be of highchurch principles yet he show himself a man of temper a scholar and a gentleman and if ever he is replied to ought to be treated accordingly the candor with which he treats the party he writes against at least deserves this acknowledgment that he is the first of that side that has used them civilly and is thereby just so much the harder to be confuted for railing is much larger answered than argument  i leave dr davenant and to answer those parts of the scurrilous invectives relating to them which it is not so much a question whether they can as whether it is worth while for them or any body else to reply to so much railery  nor indeed had this been wrote but to repeat to the world how willing the dissenters are at all times to enter into the merits of the cause to let the world see the reasons of their dissent and how willing they are upon such concessions as reason and conscience calls for to come to a general union with their protestant brethren notwithstanding all the misrepresentation of highchurch malice to the contrary  finis
