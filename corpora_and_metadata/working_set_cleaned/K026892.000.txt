remarks and observations on the morality and divinity contained in dr frees certain articles proposed to the court of assistants of the worshipful company of salters  in a letter to the reverend dr free  as free and not using your liberty as a cloak of maliciousness   pet ii    london printed by m lewis in paternosterrow and sold by e dilly in the poultry j fuller in blowbladderstreet near cheapside j robinson at dockhead and w lepard opposite battlebridge in tooleystreet  price threepence  remarks etc reverend sir true christianity breaths no other spirit than peace and love it is the peculiar genius of the gospel of christ to furnish its disciples not with carnal but spiritual weapons now to behave becoming the spirit of christianity and to wield the weapons of our warfare aright in opposing error and in defending the truths of our most holy religion is commendable it is praiseworthy this is to act the christian this to display the divine  now as you was pleased to make a public attack upon me surely it behoved you thus to act for in what ever light you are pleased to consider me either as a person in an inferior station of life to yourself or as a private christian though even held in the most contemptible view because deemed by you a methodist yet surely sir this will by no means justify that rudeness of insult that rant of defamation that venom of scurrility with which you was pleased to treat me and this without the least offense or provocation for on my cooly asking you why this treatment of me have i ever behaved amiss to you you ingenuously confessed i had not and that you liked me very well as from man to man but that my principles as a methodist you were averse to etc but sir is it consistent with the character of the christian the politeness of the gentleman the dignity of the clergyman or the eminence of the doctor in divinity to insult defame and abuse a person upon a supposed or even real disagreement in religious principles and even when you had nothing to charge upon a persons behavior in social life surely such behavior is unjustifiable even to a jew or a turk  but if my principles did not please you yet why should my complexion offend you though nature has not been so liberal with the tinge of blooming red to adorn my cheeks or if illness has caused paleness there yet why the reflection of a smockfaced fellow who could have expected this from the reverend dr free as to what you was pleased to tell me you should live to do after i am dead the lord in whose hands are the issues of life and death only knows who may be summoned to judgment first may he prepare you and me for it but if you should visit the silent mansions of the dead even to kick the dirt over my grave it will no more affect me when dead than your treatment of me when living  but of this i forbear to add more as i cannot but persuade myself that on the least serious and cool reflection you must be conscious of having acted much out of character and i assure you though the public attack you was pleased to make on me was so very furious though i was really grieved at your extreme warmth yet it by no means excited me to anger against you neither does it dispose me to be very ready to use your own words to run a tilt or to change a word with you in this public way  but as you was then pleased to exhibit a general charge against me and declined entering into particulars referring me to a thing you produced part of which you then read and have since published entitled certain articles etc now this pamphlet is intended to asperse those persons you are pleased to call methodists as a set of people of very dangerous principles pernicious in their nature and destructive in their consequences both to church and state and therefore unfit members of society and as you publicly read part of these articles in order to load me with the unjust allegations therein contained and thereby to bring me under the censure and contempt of the company then present silence here i think criminal in order therefore to do justice to my principles as a member of the established church of england i hope i shall be justified in this reply therefore i embrace this opportunity of publicly declaring my principles and of giving a reason of the hope that is in me and at the same time of detecting and exposing the errors you have advanced and showing how contrary your judgment is to the clear determination of the church of england and the express declarations of holy scripture  whether you think it decent to reply or keep profound silence it weighs nothing with me but you may be decent without being dumb write without wrath reason without scurrility and condescend to men of low estate without losing any part of your dignity or thinking them beneath your notice but just as you please doctor reply or forbear i am content i approve your example of brevity you say all wise and good people would choose to manage a religious dispute in this manner but sir suffer me to observe had your few pages abounded with less of the wrath of men and more of the mildness of the christian and if christian moderation and charity had been substituted in the room of that ferocity of spirit and uncharitableness of censure had you consulted this wholesome advice  be calm in arguing for fierceness makes  error a fault and truth discourtesy sure i am your performance had met with less censure and more approbation and the author would have had a juster claim to the epithets of wise and good  but let us attend to this treatise or these directions to a worshipful court or this libel against a clergyman or  what shall i call it why page the  st begins the preamble of certain articles proposed to the serious consideration of the court of assistants of the worshipful company of the salters relative to the application of a methodist for their votes and interest in order to his being promoted to the tuesdays lectureship at st dunstans in the east at present in the possession of the reverend mr b  n he being still alive and by gods favor likely to continue to live  to be sure it begins pretty enough but then will not the worthy gentlemen of of this worshipful court think you take too much upon you is it not rather too free thus publicly to direct or influence them in their choice as though they would be remiss in enquiring into or were not capable to judge of the merit of the candidates themselves what can you say to this sir why you tell them that you are  a person concerned both for their honor and the public good vastly kind indeed how useful are your publicspirited gentlemen to society for upon supposition that these worthy gentlemen of this court are not duly concerned for their own honor and the public good then your hints and directions are well timed  for you observe page     there are in all places some bystanders to observe whether such duties be rightly performed or not so sir you as one of these bystanders are just looking on and as you see need are giving all just and necessary hints and directions to this worshipful court well since this is the case what distinguished honors and what noble emoluments are to be your reward for all your disinterested pains and labor who is able to say  the freedom of a company in a gold box is no inconsiderable present besides enjoying the much greater honor of being free of a company than making free with the worshipful court of assistants or  in case of a vacancy of this lectureship suppose dr free as a reward for his certain articles etc was to be promoted to it sir what say you to this would not this silence the accusations or murmurings of the bystanders free the gentlemens characters both from the censure as well as the complaints of the people which you represent the danger of page    you can have no objection to this little donation it is pretty evident you cannot as it is well known you stand a candidate and are making interest for this lectureship  now doctor here we have a key to the whole hence it is obvious that all that pretension of your being concerned for the gentlemens honor and the public good alas sir it dwindles into little low mean and sordid motives tending to sinister ends and selfish views for as dr free appears to be a candidate he therefore looks on this avowed methodist as he deems him as his rival or competitor standing in the way of his interest now sir since this is the true state of the case in what light think you will all that defamation obloquy and reproach with which you have been pleased to treat this reverend and worthy clergyman appear  sir the discerning and judicious will have an eye to this they will heartily weigh this affair they will take knowledge of the bitterness of your spirit the extreme virulence of your language and the unchristian treatment of the gentleman you thus write against and in the determination of cool reason and solid judgment you will be censured as having exceeded all bounds of moderation charity and benevolence and all this in subservient views to your own selfinterest and in the end you will be found to have overshot the mark and to have counteracted your own crafty arts and schemes  here then we see the motives and designs of these certain articles the short view of the history of this doughty performance stands thus    st here is a tuesday lectureship in the gift of the worshipful company of salters which dr free thinks worth his applying for therefore    dly offers himself as a candidate and makes interest for the same but    dly on application finds the rev mr  has the favor of some of the worthy gentlemen of the court of assistants on which he tells them mr  is a methodist but not thinking this sufficient to prejudice the minds of these gentlemen against mr  therefore    thly in an extreme ill humor you set about drawing up certain articles which you present to the gentlemen in order to asperse blacken and vilify this opposing candidate how far you have succeeded herein these few sentences set forth you assert he acts in open and scandalous opposition to the church of england  with blasphemy and impiety  diabolical phrenzy  gives our savior the lie  an enemy to all good works  decries virtue and morality  acting like a mohammedan or infidel or the devil himself  releasing men from their natural fears of a deity  making room for all manner of vice and villainy  not only guilty of atheism but treason also against the state and government etc etc etc and after all this who would wonder to find that hint as a specimen of your moderation and charity for dispatching a person so obnoxious in your eyes as being not fit to live for you say atheists in some countries have been put to death as persons very dangerous to a state and    thly all through these articles you admonish the gentlemen that they cannot as members of the church of england be concerned in promoting such a person  nor as good subjects to the state for fear of the magistrates censure of their characters  incurring the censure of the bishop and page    you suppose the gentlemen to be governed by private interest and influenced by avaritious views in dealing not very delicate not very genteel this i think doctor you tell them if they fall under the bishops censure the best excuse they can make too much supposed and too much implied indeed sir is that they had unwarily promised an acquaintance with whom they had some dealings or private interest that they would at all adventures be serviceable to such a person  what all this to gentlemen of common prudence doctor then you show the gentlemen a pretty knack of departing from a precipitate promise what at them again sir after having introduced a quotation from a letter of the late bishop of london wish the preservation of the life of mr b  n and the disappointment of the arts and schemes of this crafty enthusiast you take your leave of the gentlemen and so  are their humble servant and  lastly while this peccant humor was operating and being ready to run atilt as you say i chanced to fall n your way and so you vented some of your anger and resentment upon me as a methodist  here ends the history of dr frees certain articles and postcript thus much for the morality of them next let us attend to the divinity they contain  but i would premise that after all i am really at a loss to know what you mean by a methodist the appellation is a very simple inoffensive one i see no more harm in it than in being called a tradesman a mechanic or doctor in divinity though you are pleased to use it as a term of reproach in order to convey some very bad idea of the persons you are pleased to apply it to i told you my profession that i am a member of the established church of england consequently that i attend upon her worship approve her doctrines and live in communion with her i am of no other sect or party  now am i a methodist for this no what then why you hear particular men such as mr roman jones etc i do i do hear and rejoice constantly to hear them and all such ministers who faithfully and conscientiously preach the doctrines of the church of england does this constitute me a methodist yes why then i will be a methodist one of your church of england methodists  but are not these gentlemen ministers of our church are they not regularly ordained and do they not act regularly yes but they are methodists for all that how so why they preach different doctrines from the rest of the clergy this may be truth and yet no fault in them for no sooner does a minister preach the ancient scripture doctrines of our church but he is deemdd a methodist  i wish doctor you had obliged the world with your description of a methodist but as you have not i will here lay before you and the world the best description i am able  he is one whom god has chosen in christ out of mankind to deliver from curse and damnation and to bring by christ to everlasting salvation he is called according to gods purpose by his spirit working in due season he through grace obeys the calling he is justified freely he is made the son of god by adoption he feels in himself the workings of the spirit of christ mortifying the works of the flesh and his earthly members and drawing up his mind to high and heavenly things he is made like the image of christ walks religiously in good works and at length by gods mercy not for works of righteousness he has done but according to gods mercy he is saved and attains to everlasting felicity  now sir have you any dislike to this view of methodism i think you cannot as i greatly approve the language of our church i have borrowed these words from the   th article may the lord god of grace and love make you and i such kind of methodists i pray to spread such kind of methodism as is here described and to bring mankind into this happy this holy state is the chief end and design of these truly reverend and worthy clergymen of our church who pass under this denomination with many of them i have the honor to be pretty conversant and as it is my great happiness to hear the doctrines which they publicly deliver i can and do venture to affirm that to promote and propagate true christianity that men might be christians not in name only but also in true faith and holy practice to be their view to this great and good end they labor and are indefatigable and for the sake of this they go through evil report and good report for christs sake and the good of precious souls they are content to be accounted madmen and fools they are despised reviled defamed yea they are treated as the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things and under all this they think themselves happy in being instrumental of begetting in the hearts of sinners repentance toward god and faith in our lord jesus that from a principle of love to god and man they might be holy in all manner of conversation and godliness and zealous of good works here and that from being members of christs church militant on earth they might be admitted to the church triumphant in glory  and in order to this the doctrines they preach are such as are agreeable to gods holy word and that plain thoshort system of divinity laid down in the articles of the church of england  but you object page   that it is notorious that the methodists under the mask of being true sons of the church do ever explain the word faith as it stands in some of st pauls writings in a manner so different from the clear declaration of st james as to make the doctrine of one apostle a direct and flat contradiction to the other  sir i affirm this charge from beginning to end to be notoriously false one circumstance is wanting there the proof the proof doctor where is that proof to support these assertions which of the methodists do this why did you not name some one or more of them why have you not produced some quotation from some of their writings as many of them have published what they preach to prove your assertion the plain reason is because you could not and  therefore in the judgment of truth you would have been equally justifiable in saying that the methodists put both the apostles st paul and st james to death so far from making the doctrine of one apostle a flat contradiction to the other the doctrines they advance have a direct tendency to reconcile and explain them for they allow and make use of that just and well known distinction approved of by all sound protestant divines that st paul speaks of justification before god st james of justification before men st paul speaks of the justification of our persons through faith in jesus the savior of sinners st james of the justification of our faith in the sight of men by its bringing forth good works as the certain evidence and effects of its being a lively faith neither do they preach as you would insinuate that men are saved by a dead faith contrary to the doctrine of st james  but not to do as you have assert without evidence of the many that might be brought to invalidate your assertion i will produce a sew sentences from my honored and much esteemed friends the rev mr roman and mr jones vicious selflove raises a thousand objections against free justification through christs righteousness but there has been one made by men of corrupt minds in every age and which they are still making they object to the scripture doctrine that it makes void the law and renders an holy life needless  the righteousness of god is a new creation and why are we created anew in christ jesus that we may live still to the flesh and its corrupt appetites no for then we should be created anew in the devil and not in christ jesus but we are created anew unto good works  god gives us righteousness from heaven that it may raise us up to heaven  it will not remain in us as a dead and barren principle but will make us fruitful in good works even that we may be filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god the father vide mr romaines sermon lately preached before the university of oxford on the lord our righteousness and mr jones on this very subject namely reconciling st paul and st james in his exposition of the church catechism we have these words when we preach up justification by faith we mean not a dead lifeless faith the faith of devils but such a faith as is the gift of god witnessed to souls by his spirit and leading them into holiness of heart and life and again by faith is meant a certain principle implanted in the soul which will not fail to produce piety and holiness of heart and life and once more we are justified only by faith in christ jesus this faith however is a vital principle of holiness within us and they who really have it are never destitute of good fruits works are very far from being unnecessary because without them our faith can never be tried  hence all that you have said on this head amounts to no more than mere rant and declamation and all the consequences which you have attempted to draw do not at all affect the persons against whom you design them for this very plain reason because the premises laid down are false and the farther you advance the more you lose sight of the truth therefore i need say no more upon this head those who hear these ministers preach know the contrary of what you have charged upon them and those who do not unless utterly blinded by prejudice may have fuller satisfaction of the unjustness of your charge from the many tracts sermons etc which have been published by these reverend ministers of your church who are called methodists  sir before i quit this part permit me to remind you that the evidence you should have given to this worshipful court though even against methodists ought to have been the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  i do not believe any one of the reverend body of the clergy beside yourself how much soever they may disapprove of what is called methodism would have wrote either against the worthy and pious clergyman you in particular oppose or the body of those clergymen who are deemed methodists in so unkind uncharitable and unchristian spirit i am persuaded that a regard to truth modesty and decency would have influenced their pens to more mildness and humanity and yet you talk very highly of virtue and morality and say it is a rule in religion to do as we would be done by  here that question from st james is very pertinent show me your faith by your works is not gentleness meekness kindness brotherly charity in your system of morality but whose image and superscription does your performance bear this i leave to the public to determine i forbear and shall pass on to take a view of your divinity here i must not forget your very extraordinary note the bottom of page   you say in the epistle to the romans and galatians the word faith generally stands for the whole of the christian religion no more than your hand can be said to be your whole body faith there stands for that heavenborn grace which is the gift of god ephesians ii   wrought in the hearts of sinners by the holy spirit and gives evidence trust and confidence to the soul of its interest in and justification by the blood and righteousness of jesus christ and is attended with the sweet and happy sense of peace and love holiness of heart and obedience of life may my reverend and learned correspondent ever know the joy and feel the peace of believing even that peace of god which passes all understanding and that joy in the holy ghost which is unspeakable and sull of glory  in the next observation here is a most egregious blunder you say the word alone excludes only the jewish ceremonies now it happens a little unlucky for you doctor the word alone is not once used upon this subject in neither of the epistles to the romans or galatians how is this sir but come humanum est errare well go on next you say the word works means not works of morality but the ceremonial part of jewish ceremonies this i absolutely deny and that upon the authority of our church and the judgment of all found protestant divines see romans iii    do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish it now i ask you does st paul mean to establish the moral law or the jewish ceremonies what say you sir is not this one text sufficient to overthrow your assertion now then what door of advantage has this key opened to you and yet you call this a  key to the whole what are we to understand that this key opens the view of all that error and absurdity of your whole performance  page   and   you say we must contend that there is comparative merit comparison being made between man and man some men are better than others and this difference in the behavior of men is virtue and vice it is blasphemous to say that god makes no distinction between virtue and vice or that he does not love virtue and hate vice but if he love virtue there must be something in virtue naturally amiable and that is merit not absolute merit indeed but human merit merit in one man above another otherwise the wicked would have as good a title to salvation as the good  should we not expect as a christian divine you would have used scripture language and scriptural distinctions but this you have not done be it known unto you that we protestant church of england methodists object to all kind of merit of man merit of works all human merit we have the authority of scripture we have the determination of our church to support us herein we have heard indeed of a champion for the church of rome who says good works are mercatura regni coelestis the price we pay for the kingdom of heaven and another zealot of that communion declares coelum gratis non accipiam it shall never be said that i receive heaven as a matter of alms and though you are pleased to appear as the triumvirate and to contend for comparative merit and human merit and the merits of virtue and morality and i know not what unscriptural jargon yet we protestants know of no merit to give us a title to the kingdom of heaven but the merits of jesus christ alone our church teaches us not to presume to approach the table of the lord trusting in our own righteousness nor to address the throne of grace but through the merits and righteousness of jesus only for thus she concludes all her prayers if you are given to change we are not we know the voice of our church we approve her doctrines and we will abide by them let others do as they please we are for none of your arrant popery none of the heresies of that church though under the veil of protestantism  we own and believe the misery and depravity of mans state by the fall that every man is far gone from original righteousness and is of his own nature inclined to evil and that therefore through original sin every person born into this world deserves gods wrath and damnation as our church teaches us in the ninth article and we are taught likewise that it is by the free grace and unmerited love of god only that sinners are delivered from such a lost and helpless state as declared in the tenth article for the condition os man after the fall is such that so far from meriting any thing at the hands of god he is unable to turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works to faith and calling upon god without the grace of god by christ etc and so far are we from trusting to relying upon or boasting of our own works or comparative or human merit to procure us a title to the kingdom of heaven which you talk of that we firmly hold and believe with our eleventh article that we are accounted righteous before god only for the merit of our lord and savior jesus christ by faith not for our own works or deservings as you tell us but we are justified by faith only and our church farther calls this a most wholesome doctrine and very full of godly comfort though you are pleased to deny and explode this we believe and are firmly persuaded by the word of god as well as the declaration of our church article    that good works are the fruits of faith and follow after not go before in order to procure our justification or title to glory they follow after our justification yet they cannot put away our sins nor endure the severity of gods wrath how then can you in any sense say they give us a title to glory for observe our church here speaks of the works of the saints real christians true believers such works as spring from faith done from a right principle and to a right end and yet these works our article declares cannot put away our sins nor endure the severity of gods wrath yet are they pleasing and acceptable to god how through their own natural amiableness as you say no acceptable to god in christ through whom our persons are justified pardoned and accepted and through whose merits alone we obtain a title to eternal glory and our works are also accepted in him as springing necessarily out of a true and lively faith  this is what we contend for not a dead faith that produces nothing as you unjustly charge against us we know without much logic that a dead faith which produces nothing cannot produce salvation but it is a lively faith which may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by its fruit and we do allow that good works works of faith in jesus labors of love to our god and savior shall by no means lose their reward even a reward of grace not of debt a reward of mercy not of merit therefore we wish and pray for the increase of holiness and the practice of good works we are grieved to see iniquity abound we desire that the love of jesus to sinners was more preached and insisted on than it is for we know were the hearts of men more affected with the love the unexampled love of our only lord and savior jesus christ in laying down his life to atone for their sins and in purchasing for them a title to eternal glory this love would constrain them to hate sin and love and obey him who so loved them humility repentance faith holiness good works and all the graces of the gospel would be more experienced among men whereas filling mens heads with unscriptural notions of their comparative merit their human merit and merit of one man above another only tends to counteract the gospel by leading men contrary to our saviors doctrine to trust in themselves that they are righteous and to despise others to exalt instead of humbling them and keeps them from repentance fills them with pharisaical pride and gives them the language of come not near me for i am holier than thou isa lxv   which is offensive to god instead of that humble and acceptable cry god be merciful to me a sinner and through pride it keeps them in a high conceit of their own works and deservings so as to slight and entertain very superficial thoughts of the love and merits of our only savior so as not to believe on him for justification unto life  and before a person attains to this state our church declares in article xiii of works done before justification all works done before the grace of christ and the inspiration of gods holy spirit are not pleasant to god for as much as they spring not of faith in jesu christ neither do they make men meet to receive grace or as the schoolauthors say deserve grace of congruity for they are not done as god has willed and commanded them to be done we doubt not but they have the nature of sin  but you assert some men are better than others do you mean by nature if so you contradict the whole tenor of gods word which declares all are sinners there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god but you say there is a difference in the behavior of men it is granted but our church declares that neither the behavior of men their virtue or morality or any works they can do can merit or deserve grace procure justification or purchase a title to glory but what makes a difference in men grace not merit by the grace of god i am what i am is the language of every humble christian as well as of a holy apostle for thus argues the apostle who makes thee to differ or distinguishes thee from another and what have thou that thou did not receive now if thou did receive it why do thou glory as if thou did not receive it   cor iv   and again the same apostle declares by grace ye are saved through faith and that faith not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works left any man should boast for god will have no flesh to glory in his presence not upon any supposed merit in himself but he that glories let him glory in the lord where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith if salvation be by grace then argues the apostle it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work therefore we conclude a man is justified his sins pardoned his person accepted to gods love and favor and his title to glory is evidenced to him by faith without the deeds of the law either natural ceremonial or moral says the muchadmired burket in his exposition on this chapter so that as st paul declares romans v   when we were without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly and not as being holy just and righteous persons are we justified by christ but as sinners as the ungodly as the same apostle declares romans iv   by being united to christ by faith we are as our church expresses it communion service one with christ and christ with us we dwell in christ and christ in us hence we partake of the influences of that holy spirit whose gracious office it is to sanctify the unholy so milton  his merit imputed shall absolve them who renounce their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds and live in him transplanted and from him receive new life   and the venerable reformers of our church in the homily of salvation declare that this saying that we be justified by faith only freely and without works is spoken to take away clearly all merit of our works  and therefore wholly to ascribe the merit and deserving of our justification unto christ only and his most precious bloodshedding this faith the holy scripture teaches us this is the strong rock and foundation of christian religion this doctrine all old and ancient authors of christs church do approve this doctrine advances and sets forth the true glory of christ and beats down the vain glory of man this whoever denies is not to be accounted a christian man nor for a setterforth of christs glory but for an adversary to christ and his gospel and for a setterforth of mans vain glory here you see how widely you differ in judgment to our first reformers who again in the homily of good works farther testify these works the apostle calls good works  i e works becoming new creatures in christ saying we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to good works which god has ordained we should walk in and yet his meaning is not by these words to induce us to have any affiance or put any confidence in our works as by the merit and deserving of them to purchase to ourselves remission of sins and so consequently everlasting life for that were mere blasphemy against gods mercy and great derogation to the bloodshedding of our savior jesus christ for it is of the free grace and mercy of god by the mediation of the blood of his son jesus christ without merit or deserving on our part that our sins are forgiven us that we are reconciled and brought again into his favor and are made heirs of his heavenly kingdom here i rest the evidence of our church against what you have advanced and these scriptural doctrines of our church are my principles these i firmly adhere to and abide by i know the force of these divine these evangelic truths and feel the comfort and happiness of them upon my own mind i am nothing terrified by the names of methodist and enthusiast etc nicknames and words of reproach i can bear they neither disturb my peace nor destroy my comfort for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ i glory in the cross of jesus and rejoice in that salvation he has wrought out for sinners and that he has loved me and given himselff for me   survey the wondrous cure and at each step let higher wonder rise  pardon for infinite offense and pardon  through means that speaks it is value infinite  a pardon bought with blood with blood divine  with blood divine of him i made my foe  persisted to provoke though wooed and awed  blessed and chastised a flagrant rebel still  a rebel midst the thunders of his throne  nor i alone a rebel universe  yet for the foulest of the foul he dies bound every heart and every bosom burn enthusiastic this then all are weak but rank enthusiasts  dr youngs night thoughts now sir to use your words who acts with open and scandalous opposition to the church who are  the true sons of the church who the best friends to the gospel of christ who endeavor most to harmonize its doctrines and make the whole consistent with itself and right reason we that hold these fundamental doctrines of our church these truths of gods holy word or you that explode and deny them let candid judgment and impartial determination decide this  thus have i declared my principles but as i never considered myself called nor qualified to preach these momentous and important truths therefore i never once presumed to attempt it your information and this report concerning me is false and groundless it is yours to be called by our church to preach the glad tidings of salvation to lest sinners in the name of christ jesus only may you be found faithful as one who must give an account in the great day  what i have now addressed to you i trust has been from a concern for the cause of god and the truths of our most holy religion and permit me to assure you without the least prejudice or resentment to your person as a clergyman and as a scholar i esteem you and heartily wishing you the peace of the gospel and the love of christ in  perfect friendship and sincere respect i am reverend doctor your humble servant w m rotherhithwall may
