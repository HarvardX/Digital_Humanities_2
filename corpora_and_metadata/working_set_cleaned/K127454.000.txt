an essay to instruct women how to protect themselves in a state of pregnancy from the disorders incident to that period or how to cure them  also some observations on the treatment of children which if attended to may ward off dangerous diseases and prevent future evils  by mrs wright midwife  london printed for the author no  0 southamptonstreet strand and sold by j barker dramatic repository no    great russellstreet covent garden lee and hurst paternoster row and j kiry no   0 oxfordstreet        introduction to a woman who never wrote more than a common letter it seems somewhat awkward to take up the pen to write for public perusal but my friends desire that i may do it they have a better opinion of me than i have of myself they say if i give nothing new to the world i may still be useful to my own sex by recommending many things familiar to my experience which they may have had few opportunities of knowing much experience is not the portion of many young women few read large elaborate works and many would be glad to receive instruction advantageous to themselves and their families from a small pamphlet they have many occupations and care not to torment themselves with technical terms in languages unknown to them or toil over hundreds of pages they do not understand my greatest anxiety shall be to be plain and easily comprehended some females ascend into the paths of literature by accident genius or industry to the first and last i am indebted but as to the second alas i have few pretensions all i can boast of is much good temper patience and a tolerable share of common sense  if this little essay should make its way to the hands of a learned critic it is not improbable that after reading the title page and seeing it comes from a midwife he may throw it aside with disdain supposing it smells too strong of gruel caudle and the slops of the nursery and so i may escape a scourging from him but another after some investigation may tell us that this obstetric dame might have employed herself better with her needle a third with as much good nature and full as much science may kindly invite her into the field of literature hoping that a little more study may enable her to correct her deficiencies and i will bend to him with obedience and the lowest courtesy of my acknowledgment for his gentleness and liberality  the intention of this essay is to convey to my amiable countrywomen some hints or instructions how to preserve themselves in pregnancy from evils that often torment or destroy them and from which a little rational instruction may stand as it were like a beacon to point out latent evil and i have the vanity to hope that my humble attempts to be useful will neither be neglected nor lost another part of my intention is as a tender mother myself to teach others who have less experience how to superintend their infant offspring this is an important concern for it is a melancholy truth that above half the human race suffer much or sink into untimely graves before they are two or three years old nor is it unlikely that many of these infants are injured by the ignorance or carelessness of persons employed to look after them perhaps in my way through this little tract i may touch on the office or duty of a midwife and other articles in a miscellaneous manner on sexual disorders it was my intention to have exposed the futility of what is often done and how to substitute some things more effectual but i find myself incapable of writing publicly on this branch of feminine infirmities without violating in some degree my own sense of delicacy and modesty but to make up for this it is my intention henceforward to act as a midwife and to give advice and even particular medicines in all diseases of women and children to all who may do me the honor to employ me whenever i may be puzzled the most able are nonplussed sometimes though they may not own it it is my determination to apply for help to some of my friends physicians of learning and much experience that will readily give me their best advice  the diseases of children are numerous and require the most careful examination i have studied them much on pathological principles and though i have not consumed much of the midnight oil have been successful in removing them that dismal train of evils that depends on worms bred in the intestines of children and frequently of grown up persons may commonly be removed by proper attention i pretend not to the possession of infallible nostrums nor would i practice on dogmatical principles for then we can have no clue to causes nor could we have occasion for reason or education a few recipes without knowledge would in this case be sufficient to cure diseases on this plan a person who knows the names of the ropes and sails may go to sea but without the art of navigation he would seldom carry a ship safe to her port  it may be supposed i am no great theorist yet i am not altogether ignorant of pathology or the difference in distempers or of their causes and effects i have practiced much among poor people gratis on the continent and at home giving them their medicines because i think it a duty on all to do good and my intentions have been answered with general success it is my intention still to carry on this eleemosynary practice with this difference that in london i cannot afford to furnish remedies for all that may want them but if female paupers will call sundays and thursdays in the morning from   to  0 oclock they shall be welcome to my best endeavors to serve them if they are sober and obedient to directions i will sometimes give them medicines and i shall never be wanting to their welfare if not they must not be surprised if i excuse myself from hearing their complaints  if any person who never heard of me before should have any inclination to employ me they may naturally wish to know who i am and to know my character i shall only hope to be known my vouchers are neither obscure or unworthy of notice i may venture to say this for myself my friends all say it of me though no sycophant i never yet made a foe or lost a friend it may be objected to my proposals that this essay may be regarded as a quack advertisement i feel and i dread the force of such a charge but i am neither a boaster nor a vain pretender this truth may be easily made evident i may after six years residence call myself a stranger in this great city for i am very little known only to a few friends of the middle rank who cannot step beyond their line to recommend me and i may remain in obscurity were i now to suppress this essay which may be found useful by many on purpose to prevent the calumny of objectors my friends support my spirits on one hand on this attempt to become an author but my own apprehensions depress them on the other and it is with much trepidation i am prevailed on to risk my reception with the public  no  0 southampton street strand an essay etc section i on the diseases of early pregnancy this section may deserve the attention of women who are constitutionally afflicted with troublesome complaints in the first months of pregnancy the most common symptoms of breeding are sickness loathing vomiting giddiness drowsiness heartburn diarrhoea a painful fullness of the breasts nervous fits faintings etc if the patient is healthy or of a full habit it may be useful for her to let blood repeatedly in small quantities not exceeding six or seven ounces at a time especially if the sickness is attended with flushings parched mouth or any other feverish symptoms larger evacuations are not safe the bowels in such cases ought to be kept soluble by ripe fruits cooling diet magnesia cream of tartar whey soluble tartar manna or such gentle things and yet more advantageously by oily or emollient clysters an useful domestic injection may be made in a few minutes thus  take of strained gruel about three quarters of a pint brown sugar one ounce castile soap half an ounce salad oil two ounces this or something like it may be thrown up occasionally if frights or falls have done harm the same treatment is recommended when vomiting is troublesome i have frequently known this symptom carried off by drinking chamomile tea or giving two or three grains of ipecacuanha to cause a discharge of the offending matter from the stomach it may be remembered as a general rule that all strong or violent remedies are hurtful therefore we caution against antimonials mercurials cathartics jalap aloes or even rhubarb because it often causes griping pains when nervous complaints come on the most effectual relief may be obtained from gentle opiates if the patient is delicate or weak bleeding may do harm but an invigorating diet in small quantities and a little pure old wine taken from time to time may be useful much more may be said to make up a book if more is wanted we recommend the advice of an experienced physician let it be remembered i do not propose to trouble my readers with a large volume my intention is only to give useful hints in a shilling pamphlet it is not necessary to say more on this part but come in course to our second section  section ii on the diseases of advanced pregnancy the diseases of advanced pregnancy ought to be well understood by every midwife for if ill treated may be attended with the worst consequences as pregnancy advances the uterus increases in size and presses more and more heavily on the bowels by which their important functions are impaired the circulation of the blood and the nervous influence are materially obstructed what wonder then if disagreeable effects often come from such causes  let us now mention some of the complaints that take place and the best means of removing them when the gravid uterus rises higher up into the abdomen in the fifth sixth or seventh month of pregnancy then commonly commences the complaints of advanced pregnancy such as colics cramps hysteric fits pains in the back difficulty of breathing oedematous or watery swelling of the legs etc vomitings convulsions difficulty or suppression of urine micturition haemorrhoids varicous swellings in the veins of the legs besides some others we shall not mention if colic torments the patient let her have the intestines moderately emptied by gentle laxatives lubricating clysters or bloodletting according to circumstances in case she is strong or feverish and costiveness ought to be guarded against if cramps are frequent the same treatment may be useful if they are slight we have frequently known walking barefooted on the cold floor to give speedy relief when more uneasy the following liniment will afford case take of tincture of opium one ounce of camphorated spirit of wine six drams oil of amber two drams spirit of ammonia four drams mix them and let some of it be well rubbed occasionally on the parts affected if piles are painful the body must be kept open as above but we recommend castor oil if not offensive for this purpose one or two spoonsful is a moderate dose if the haemorrhoids are very uneasy we recommend strongly the following mixture and ointment take of balsam capivi two drams mucilage of gum arabic one ounce tincture of columbo root one ounce simple cinnamon water two ounces sirup of ginger one ounce mix them and give a desert spoonful thrice a day the ointment may be depended on take of gall nuts in fine powder one ounce pure verdigrise powdered two drams hogs lard two ounces mix them to make an ointment which may be applied to the swelled parts occasionally when great difficulty of breathing attacks the patient great relief may be procured from bleedings and keeping the body soluble when a dropsy of the whole body called anasarca comes on it may proceed from laxity and ought if possible to be removed without loss of time we have little experience of this complaint it seldom occurs yet we have heard much but we believe that a strengthening and warm stimulating diet is useful with generous wine but spirits watery meats or fluids are hurtful after a safe delivery much may be done if the fluor albus comes on the same mode of treatment as in the dropsy may be recommended  the oedematous or watery swellings of the lower extremities seldom come from the same cause as the general dropsy but entirely from the presture of the gravid uterus and though they are of little importance yet it may be proper to diminish them by bleeding laxatives a spare opening diet friction and a horizontal posture if the patient is weakly cordials and a comfortable diet may be useful delivery contributes more than any thing to the cure when varicous or distended swellings of the veins become large and painful they may be made easier by taking away occasionally small quantities of blood from the arm and keeping the body open because they come from the pressure of the gravid uterus the best application to the parts is a styptic or astringent water which a venerable physician of great experience assures me is often very useful in varicous dilatations take of blue vitriol and alum of each three ounces of water two pints boil them till the salts are dissolved then filter the liquor and add one ounce and a half of the vitriolic acid and two drams of pure or refined verdigrise lay on the swelled veins compresses of linen and bind them on with a tightish roller and keep these compresses constantly moist with this solution  we have strongly recommended the frequent use of injections to keep the body soluble and if we could persuade those for whom this little essay is intended to use the selfsyringe with their own hands without any assistant it might prevent the trouble of taking medicines it would be less uneasy less painful less expensive or disagreeable at the same time more delicate but these are not all the advantages a syringe throws the clyster farther up than any other contrivance into the colon or great gut where all the obstructed matter is detained by the pressure of the distended uterus on the os sacrum or rump bone  we earnestly recommend the introduction of the selfsyringe into every house for the use of those who have complaints in their bowels about the anus or are troubled with costiveness they may be purchased in every considerable pewterers shop i have been told and i believe it implicitly that there are many persons of both sexes who with some hesitation took these machines into their houses that now they understand how to use them they would not part with them on any consideration  section iii the qualities necessary in an accoucheur and an accoucheuse here we will offer a few remarks on the qualifications necessary for an accoucheur or rather let me describe the sort of accoucheur i would recommend a manmidwife ought to be not younger than forty not talkative possessing much sagacity and prudence naturally modest benevolent and humane in short a gentleman and withal have the reputation of being well educated a midwife ought to be turned of thirty clean and neat in her person pleasant in her manners gentle attentive and kind to her patients by supporting their spirits in distress civil to servants but nothing of a gossip healthy and active never taking snuff fond of children skilful and tender in handling new born infants capable and ready to teach awkward nurses how to dress or clean them qualified to write safe and useful prescriptions for a morbid mother or an ailing child she ought to be a woman that has been well instructed that has had much practice not conceited nor proud nor vain nor superstitious but firm in her mind plain discreet and honest a sincere friend in every family always disposed to call in to her assistance a physician or an experienced accoucheur whenever there is any necessity or even a distant desire of some kind relation for this will raise her reputation prevent reflections and demonstrate her discretion  the fashion of latter years has taken the practice of midwifery almost entirely out of the hands of women and placed it into those of the men and the reasons for it were obvious formerly every conceited gossiping woman that chose to act as a midwife began this profession without instruction i had almost said without common sense or any one requisite for such an important employment and many notorious evils ensued then the physicians and surgeons being men skilled in physiology rescued many unfortunate patients from the fangs of ignorant women and it becoming a lucrative branch of business they kept it snug till a numerous body in the inferior departments desiring to share the profits came forth like a hord of hungry untaught men from the labors of the pestle and mortar with a few hooks forceps and crotchets in a bag like dr slop they call themselves accoucheurs or menmidwives but for obstetric knowledge we have seen some of them as ignorant as messengers of the contents of their dispatches yet some of these men have arrived at eminence or rather have acquired extensive practice and fortunes but in cases of difficulty they are as awkward as any of the most ignorant female practitioners women often employ men to act as midwives from a supposition that they must know more than the women midwives but this like many other suppositions may frequently have no real foundation in truth  section iv let us attempt to remark the difference betwixt the accoucheur and the midwife  comparison of an accoucheur with a midwife i i the adroit accoucheur is a person that can foresee and often prevent all the evils of difficult labors with as little hurry or unnecessary delay as possible and to assist can sometimes use the forceps or other instruments contrived to remove the obstructions to delivery the instructed accoucheuse is one who is not ignorant of all the natural or preternatural causes of danger that can happen nor of the means of removing them yet never uses any artificial instrument but in preternatural cases when patience and the hopes of parturition are lost in fruitless endeavors before it is too late she calls in an approved accoucheur to assist her  n b it is a certain truth that instruments the catheter excepted are very seldom wanted perhaps seldomer than they are used  ii ii the uninstructed accoucheur is commonly in too great a hurry to exhibit his dexterity in using his iron instruments and thereby often does mischief it would be horrible to relate  the most intelligent of the faculty seldom or never use instruments  the ignorant midwife knows not when to assist or to leave the business to nature so blunders on till sometimes both mother and infant are lost where there was in reality no danger iii iii the accoucheur in great practice cannot in lingering labors afford to lose so much of his time in waiting for slow operations of nature therefore hurries on delivery or leaves the patient till he can call again when he can find time particularly if his patient is not opulent the accoucheuse can sit more patiently among females in a lyingin room where she is looked up to every moment for assistance she can better sooth impatience by recalling hope she can more properly continue in the room constantly and delicately give directions about what is necessary so is not so easily tired out with attendance iv iv the accomplished accoucheur has a more general and liberal knowledge of things by his study in physiology all the parts of animal bodies are known to him and he can reason better on cause and effect than women who have amused themselves with fashions dress taste or appearance but such men i have observed are soon fatigued with the conversations of us poor women the sensible and sagacious midwife may make herself more agreeable though she is less learned and as to her necessary knowledge in anatomy she may learn it and all the technical terms in a few months learning is not difficult to those who love study but knowledge is only useful when we possess sagacity or sense to apply it properly we have all seen learned fools v v men in high practice seldom know how to handle new born children they often touch them with dislike as they would toads or young snakes what is then to be done when the nurse is awkward or at a loss how to manage the infant which is too frequently the case women have commonly a great superiority over men in the care of infants it is more in their province and a sensible midwife thinks she should qualify herself for every adverse accident that may happen in this respect women are preferable to men  seem reasons offered why women are preferable to men as midwives there are many women who cannot converse easily or freely with a man on many circumstances that happen about the time of parturition or even on some sexual disorders this may be called false modesty but still it exists and causes many evils here we suppose skilful women might be more agreeable and useful one of the first physicians in the city who i believe to be my friend said to me one day lately that if clever women would diligently study to accomplish themselves in midwifery he would wish for the sake of propriety and the good of mankind that this profession was again restored to female hands it is the opinion of many learned physicians that the advantages to the sex are small if any by the over grown number of male practitioners at the same time they are clearly of opinion that a number of eminent accoucheurs should be selected and appointed to give advice both to ordinary men and women midwives in difficult and preternatural cases it is fortunate for us few very few parturient females not one in many hundreds need be under the necessity of calling in an accoucheur indeed the numbers of women who are delivered with little assistance may convince us how much nature acts in these cases for our advantage in the obstetric art as well as in other branches of the science of healing it might be better if we could wait patiently and would humbly rate ourselves as the handmaids of nature premature practitioners are apt like the philosopher in rasselas to suppose they can govern the natural course of things but after a few trials they must find out their incapacity a little modesty and common sense may point out their errors but conceited young men and ignorant women are seldom easily reclaimed from forwardness therefore prudence ought to induce us to have recourse when we can to intelligent practitioners  section v on the care of children infants often suffer much from the carelessness ignorance or officiousness of nurses to prevent this it is the duty of an intelligent midwife to cast a careful eye over their conduct a little conscientious pains ought to be bestowed upon it cleanliness is a most important article the infant ought to be washed twice a day in lukewarm water it is the constant custom in the south of europe even in summer for if perspiration or any other excrementitious matter is left on their tender skins it will soon become acrid cause inflammation excoriation and consequently much uneasiness this is not written from a fine spun theory but is the result of experience we are of opinion that washing of tender infants in lukewarm water is greatly preferable to cold water and that the theory of relaxation is here more imaginary than real and that experience confirms this doctrine if from neglect the skin of infants becomes inflamed or excoriated let the parts be well washed and made dry then dust on a little powdered white lead from a muslin cloth this is simple but effectual but let the cerussa or powder of lead be removed so as not to go near their victuals  an intelligent midwife that has as much perhaps more experience and i believe has had better opportunities of instruction than any other in this city from the repetition of lectures has emphatically desired me to mention in my pamphlet that if infants are kept dry and clean their tempers and dispositions will be more pleasant they will seldom be liable to rickets or any of those disorders that affect the bones so as to cause bandy legs etc and that when female infants are neglected in these articles the bones of the pelvis or lowest part of the body are often softened and diminished in their natural capacity so as when adults the distorted pelvis cannot admit a child to pass easily and from thence proceeds the reason for inventing of so many iron instruments to faciliate difficult labors and to give occasion to bold operators to try their hands moreover this gentlewoman adds that if it were not for the neglect of cleanliness in infancy many men and women would be stronger in their loins better proportioned in their limbs more healthy and move more gracefully but above all there would be rarely any cause to call in even the prudent and experienced accoucher to assist in parturition let me add that these observations are confirmed by the opinions of practical men whose judgments are not apocryphal an attention to this doctrine can never do harm and nurses who conscientiously discharge their duty deserve rewards and friendship  it sometimes happens that wet nurses have not enough of milk for their nurselings and make up their food with bread tapioca or indian arrow root and the common milk of this town we believe that in general beef tea mutton or veal broth mixed with them is preferable infants are liable to acidity in the stomach and guts which often occasions griping purging etc a little magnesia given occasionally is the best domestic remedy if costiveness at any time comes on a little manna or when very young a few teaspoonsful of equal parts of fresh oil of almonds and syrup of violets repeated occasionally is a safe and useful laxative if vomiting from foul matter in the stomach is troublesome one or two grains of the powder of ipecacuan may be given as an emetic with safety and sometimes two or three tea spoonsful of wine and some warm water by way of assisting the evacuation will answer the purpose if more is wanted the best way is to apply soon for proper advice  in childrens diseases much may be done by liberal well informed women in diseases of the bowels diarrhoea or flux of the belly vomitings worms hooping coughs etc rational women may be more in the way of examining their evacuations and prying into particular complaints and naturally attend more to their disorder than either the learned physician or the skilful apothecary whose longest visits last only a few minutes and then are told the symptoms and circumstances by some indistinct attendant that knows less than she pretends to do thus a child is often lost in the hands of able men even when children are ill in the smallpox measles fever fits etc they are often totally trusted to the care of very ignorant pretending old women who know as little of these disorders as i do of the french directory or the irish rebellion would it not be better to find out some intelligent person who can and will give attention to them it is true some do recover in spite of bad treatment but if they die are not the parents blameable for overlooking so important a concern if some women can be found fit for all the important duties of a midwife and of giving sound advice in sexual disorders or in those of children why hesitate to employ them are women by nature incapable of instruction or are they deficient in sagacity to be useful custom or fashion govern the world and often deprives us of that judgment or common sense that would be more advantageous to society let it not be supposed i wish to reject the advice of able men far from it i wish only to demonstrate that women may be capable of being very useful in sexual disorders as well as in those of children it seems to me as if nature had allotted this part of the healing art to females because we have better opportunities of investigating the real state of the illness and if benevolently assisted by sagacious physicians might save many lives  there has been some conjectures agitated among men of no mean consideration false or true i leave to others to determine they have supposed since women of all ranks gave themselves up to menmidwives they have lost much of that delicacy which before rendered them so amiable and in losing delicacy say they may not chastity itself be easily violated if we lose possession of either or both what are we others suppose since that period more elopements trials for crim con divorces private intrigues among married women have been common and that we have acquired more of a masculine swing in our gait some men of gallantry have not scrupled to say that women who employ menmidwives are in general an easier prey than those who do not it is step by step or slow advances that women commonly arrive at vice just so do thoughtless boys become cruel by being suffered to torment birds beasts reptiles insects etc by and by they lose every feeling of humanity and can murder men without horror if we could but be cautious to defend ourselves against the approach of all impropriety the ladies of britain would be as superior in virtue as they are in beauty   a comparative review of male and female temperaments females when young may at least claim equal esteem with their brothers the lords of creation for filial affection and all the virtues of parental obedience as wives men of great observation have given testimony in their writings that we are by no means inferior to our husbands in conjugal duties  as mothers i have still the testimony of men that we are full as tender and careful of our children as their fathers are as mistresses of families are we not equally economical as kind to our servants and benevolent to the poor authors of the most eminent abilities after a comparative review of both sexes have heartily declared upon the whole we are by no means inferior or rather we are superior in acting our parts in all the concerns of life all these commendations we can receive with conscious pride while we merit them but when we part with delicacy or modesty alas how are we fallen even like a flower after it is cropped soon loses all its sweetness and is cast like a loathsome weed away i wish my amiable readers may consider here what i have said both in a moral and a religious point of view it can do them no harm and if the thinking part of men can also agree with me it may be an object worthy of their attention to lessen or do away one of the greatest causes of our misfortunes and unhappiness  i could wish that female education was more solicitously attended to when young we often have a bad education which is worse than none so by imitation from bad examples of ease freedom fashion grace etc insensibly we lose the elegant sweetness of female delicacy and reserve i am always happy to see young ladies exhibit excellence in the dance to hear the charms of music from their welltoned instruments or transported by the melting sounds of the voice and to behold their taste in drawing but i am sometimes sorry to find that these accomplished young ladies are ignorant of the grammar of their own language that they are deficient in understanding the first principles of virtue and that they have had no instruction on the holy scriptures the first of these two last may show them the beauty and felicity of moral conduct and the second the eternal bliss that is promised us in studying the laws of our almighty creator or redeemer and i will venture to assure my fair readers that by studying carefully these sacred laws so as to practice them as strictly as possible they will find continually that satisfaction in their minds that will give cheerfulness to their features that will beautify their beauty besides if the day of adversity should overtake us the consciousness of having done our duty will feel to afflicted minds as a source of celestial consolation  i am a mother myself and it is on these principles i endeavor to instruct my children if i dared as a female writer i would venture to recommend to young ladies of fashion some attention to history geography botany natural history moral and natural philosophy etc these might occupy any blank in their minds and make them capable to carry on agreeable conversations on any subject this would make them admired by all their acquaintances and adored by their husbands it would render their actions more graceful and their beauty more pleasing it would make religion more rational by opening their eyes to the power and goodness of the almighty in all his works  appendix it may be observed by some that i have been silent on three most important parts of midwifery abortion uterinehemorrhage and the puerperal fever these have been ably discussed by more intelligent writers therefore i purposely passed them over but i may venture these observations that abortion when well treated is seldom attended with any danger that uterinehemorrhage almost always requires great attention skill and sagacity to prevent danger and as to the puerperal sever as it is a complicated disease of a mortal tendency we recommend it to the care of the intelligent and experienced physician either to prevent or to cure it  having finished my little work with the assistance of some friends much more intelligent than myself they desire me to add by way of postscript that i intend to practice midwifery being entitled to it by my liberal certificates from the physicians and surgeons of the british lyingin hospital in brownlowstreet to whom for their goodness and able instructions i shall always feel the sincerest obligations and to the intelligent matrons of that useful charity i also offer my honest acknowledgments  i have taken much satisfaction for years to acquire knowledge in female diseases under able instructors both at home and abroad the witnesses of my success in practice are not few and i hope to be employed by many in this city who are or may be afflicted with weakness relaxation fluor albus scorbutic or any other eruptions nervous or hysterical affections complaints in the bowels irregular fluxes or obstructions etc  letters from the country post paid distinctly stating all the symptoms or if they can the causes of complaint age habit of body and how long ill shall receive an answer and we trust satisfaction the diseases of children are numerous though some of them are obstinate yet many if taken early are easily conquered therefore we recommend timely attention procrastination kills many i have said above the knowledge of childrens diseases requires application instruction sagacity observation and patience in these i hope i am not deficient success in many of their illnesses embolden me to offer my assistance and if strangers to me can be induced from what i now write to trust to a woman whose character will stand any test of examination i will promise that all my poor abilities with the help of my medical friends shall always be exerted to relieve them or if i discover that the cause of malady comes not within the sphere of my capacity i will honestly without opiniatry desire them not to trust to me but to call in more learned advice  to prevent any complaints from any of my female readers who may not clearly understand me or be accustomed to technical terms that for the sake of brevity or more agreeable reading were inserted in this little essay i will subjoin a compendious explanation  if i had written this pamphlet with a circumlocution of phrase familiar to myself it had much exceeded the size i intended but my friends and dr johnsons dictionary assisted me to contract it now it is finished i tremble to think of its publication  explanation of a few words that are somewhat technical but may be found in johnsons dictionary a abdomen that part of the body which is placed betwixt
