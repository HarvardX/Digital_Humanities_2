north wales as every one now who has either traversed a steep ountain or crossed a small annel must write his tour it ould be almost unpardonable  me to be totally silent who have visited the most uninhabite regions of north wales  wh have seen lakes rivers sea rocks and precipices at unmeasurable distances and who from observation and experience can inform the world that high hill are very difficult of access an the tops of them generally ver cold  but ancient britain has a kin of hereditary claim upon me  i have the honor to boast of m origin from thence and as the name and exploits of my ancestors continually occur through the wild heroic pages of welsh fable or history  this journey was undertaken rather late in the autumn      he season proved remarkably favorable neither rains not winds impeded my progress  he air on the mountains was ft rarefied by the summers heat e sun shone out all the day  cader and snowdon had not begun to fortify himself against this almost winter approach  i set out from shrewsbury for welsh poole  the last eigh miles afforded a most beautifu prospect of a rich vale in mongomeryshire the vales through out this county are remarkabl pleasant but they have bee so frequently described that  is almost superfluous to observ that they abound with corn a are luxuriant in pasturage  welsh poole is a place of some note  it is one of the five boroughs in montgomeryshire which jointly send a member to parliament it has a good market but though the severn is navigable within two miles of it there is scarce ever any fish  even salmon is never under twelve pence a pound it takes its name from a contemptible black pool which is said to be unfathomable and of which there is a prophecy that it shall some time or other overflow and deluge the town this prophecy is still believed in wales  about a mile from hence stands powis castle or red castle from the color of the stones of which it is built the situation of it is certainly very noble but i cannot agree with lord lyttelton that three thousand pounds would make it the most august place in the kingdom there is much to be done in the mere approach and at present you are obliged to ask where the severn runs the ground is laid out in that formal style of gardening that was brought in at the revolution and there will be much difficulty in altering it with propriety a common undertaker in taste would immediately convert the clipped hedges and trueloveknots into a gauy and unmeaning shrubbery ut to decorate this place to dvantage the genius of this place only must be consulted the pope parts should every where b connected with each other an must likewise bear a referenc to the whole on my retur to poole i ordered a carriage t convey me to llanvair  this wa to be my last stage on know ground  the road was perfectl good the people in general spok english and their civility was  remarkable that the very turnpike man was grateful for the toll i was here most strongly recommended to a good house about twelve miles distant but found it only a miserable hut i therefore pressed onwards as fast as possible and after some difficulties arrived at dynysmouthy  this city for dynys is welsh for city is possessed of many and great advantages there is no bodycorporate to divide it into faction there is not a single office that can possibly be contended for  the rent of houses will be the same at all seasons and even in august you are never incommoded by the sun the river is not large but it will never be encroached upon by the inhabitants their sequestered walks will never be injured by any fresh dealers in taste  in deed they have only one tree to cut down an oak planted in the reign of charles the second an i believe they have never hear of any king since  as to fashions they are similar to those in town  the headdress of the females is very high and in a morning they generally ear the half palonese jackets and petticoats   the inns too like the london nes are dark and dirty but ere is very little noise in them d as to provisions the people  not attempt to make what name has not bestowed upon them hey gave me whatever they had bread uncontaminated wit spurious mixtures and milk tha was absolutely from the cow  i did not see a cathedral no heard of either bishop or palace probably he might reside at  great distance and have consigne his flock over to a chapel of eas  there is no court of judicature open here this city is a free from attorneys as ancie thebes indeed the two never failing sources of litigation t poor laws and the game law are entirely unknown there is not even a quack so that those whom liquor spares generally die at a very advanced age  the theater is held in great repute i had the pleasure to be present at one play which is here called an anterlute probably a corruption from our term interlude the piece was said to have been written by a celebrated mr evan something who lived at bala but from the actions gestures and emblems i conceived it to have been modelled from before shakespeares time the plot was in part similar to a burletta which has frequently been exhibited in london called la serva padrona but the music was certainly not pergolen the orchestra to be sure was exceedingly contracted but we must reflect that some of our best as well as earliest dramas were only accompanied by a harp the price of admittance to this elegant entertainment would have been termed by the romans denarius  the road from dynys mouthy afforded but little amusement and the first cast of cader idris greatly disappointed me but i soon recollected that as i was then on very high ground it must have been from some other point of view that this mountain had rendered itself so remarkable in the course of this reflection i was on a sudden delighted with the country round dolgelly  woods rocks a ric vale a fine river and at that distance the appearance of rathe a decent town surrounded wit many gentlemens seats  these contrasted with the barrenness had just traveled through al joined to render the prospec truly delicious but how was  disgusted on my arrival at the interior parts of this miserable place there is no street in it you pas from dungeon to dungeon through a multiplicity of hog yards  before i reached the inn  heard a cracked trumpet soundng every where about and immediately concluded that i might ee in the evening another farce r anterlute but was informed it as only intended to call the ustices to the quarter sessions  the inn there was nothing to e obtained so that as soon as ssible i sent out for a guide at i might retire to the mounns  whilst i was in waiting nquired about the only tolerable building i then saw an was told it was for cockmatch such as we had in england  that they were just over but the i might go immediately and  a famous man from london she tricks of slight of hand i chie wished for some refreshme having greatly suffered from tigue and illness the preced day but as i was a stranger people showed me little or novility and on my enquiring horses took every advantag my distress i was now almost nclined to have bestowed upon them some rather ungracious epihets but i considered that as we emed to be teaching them noing from england but cruelty and fraud i ought rather to laent the cause than insult the ect of their brutality  on the arrival of the guide i t out immediately for cader ris and found the tract exedingly good till i came to a ominent part of the mountain and here i must acknowledg my head was too giddy suffciently to admire the amazin scene that was opening to m view at length having gain the summit the whole asce being near three miles on fine piece of level ground i cou with comfort survey the sea t carnarvonshire shore snowd without a cloud upon his to lakes rivers rocks and precipi which were every way spre before me  at the bottom  the hill on the opposite side was a small village to which several were returning heavy laden from dolgelly market this village is remarkable for nothing but the remains of a small castle whose miserable situation could not secure it from the depredations of cromwells army in the course of my survey of the mountain it seemed to take a thousand capricious forms but the most wonderful part of it is he tremendous peak which overhangs the lake of the the common people believe these three large craggs to have been cast out o the shoes of the giant idris thre grains  but here i shall forbear description as a fine representation of it has been latel executed by the ingenious an accurate pencil of mr wilson  on my return i discovered fai out of any tract on the steepes part of the hill a man gathering rockmoss to dye baizes red  dreadful trade one could only exclaim  this excrescence is chiefly sold to dublin  it affords a most beautiful color at first and if mixed with proper ingredients and distilled will it is said become permanent being very thirsty from heat and fatigue i enquired for some goats milk but to no purpose the guide however informed me that he could procure me from a neighboring cottage a liquor peculiar to that part of north wales which infinitely exceeded stirom cider  i tasted it and found it was made of mountainash berries and crabs or sloes the following lines have since occurred to me then she describes the scythian winter nor disdains to sing how under ground the rude riphaean race mimic brisk cider with the brakes product wild sloes pounded hips and servis harshest juice philips   it should remain at least half a year in the vessel before it is bottled off and if it were then kept to a proper age it would not be altogether contemptible the tediousness of my return to dolgelly was somewhat beguiled by the consequential information of the guide and i must own he greatly entertained and at the same time shocked me with the respect he paid me as an english gentleman  whenever he replied to me he thought it necessary to nterlard his answer with frequent oaths whereas i found when he spoke to my servant only it was entirely in an unadorned style without the least display of these sensible embellishments  the next morning being sunday i went to eight oclock prayers here  the area of the church is spacious and the pews neat  there is a coving roof of wood which is necessary to aid the voice as the floor is only clay covered deep with rushes the congregation was large and the service was read with devotion and tolerable propriety  my stay was prolonged at dolgelly that the master of the inn who was absent on my first arrival and who was justly recommended to me as an intelligent person might attend me to see the three wonderful waterfalls in this neighborhood  one of them is in so obscure a place that the minister of an adjoining parish whom i afterward met with had never till that time even heard of it  about five miles on the road toward tan y bwlch we turned on the left hand to see the first which i take to be a part of the river dery  this is not more than fifty feet in height but you may afterward trace it for near a mile through crags and trees before it reaches its rocky bed at the bottom the others are falls of whole rivers the mothwaye and the cayne over the tops of two rocky mountains  the former perhaps may not be above one hundred fee in height but the latter is certainly at least an hundred yards  both of them are shaded with beautiful woods on the sides of hills whose summits are in the clouds and whose feet are whitened by the foam of these tremendous cataracts  before we reached tan y bwlch we stopped to look into a small church where some cleanly villagers were assembled at evening prayers  the women were by far the handsomest of any i saw in this country the clergyman was reading the lesson concerning david and his concubines and i could not help reflecting that if these ignorant people should any way confound the old with the new law they might here find some excuse for that gallantry which sacrifices the virtue of so many females in this neighborhood to prevent such a mistake would it not be proper to have an exposition made of this chapter and translated into welsh  i mean only provided the learned labor could be confined within the narrow limits of five volumes in folio  i was much struck with the situation of mrs griffiths house at tan y bwlch  at first fight it somewhat resembled matlock bath but the hills in front are thrown to a fine distance and behind the house they are covered with wood  through a very spacious valley the river dryryd runs and from the tops of the mountains are frequen and not inconsiderable cataracts  indeed most of the romantic prospects of north wales taken separately are infinitely superio to those of derbyshire but where shall we find within the same distance such amazing contras as the high polish of kedleston opposed to the bleak horrors of the peak  mrs griffith is possessed of a considerable fortune  she has an only daughter to whom a sensible clergyman who resides in the house is tutor and who though a chaplain is treated as independent a lady it is true in such a country cannot be every day interrupted with visitants but mrs griffith has generally a select party of friends  these form a rational society whereas in many places a good neighborhood means little more than eeping an inn at your own exence  at the distance of about three miles the road most beautifully diversified the scene changes on a sudden to some dark and naked precipices at the bottom is a large rocky basin which receive the rhaidrdu or black cataract as it is called  this i am confident is exactly similar to the spot where hecate appointed he sisterwitches to assemble an offer their choicest incantation to complete the ruin of macbet and at the pit of acheron meet me in the morning thither he shall come to know his destiny   the mistress of the little inn  tan y bwlch has lived many ears servant in considerable families and from her attentive ivility has received great commendations from the few engishmen that have hitherto visitd this country  her house is his year much improved  lord adnor having staid a day or wo there has made her a present of the fitting up of her parlour two sashwindows add great cheerfulness to the room and each grateful passenger readily joins with the landlady in celebrating the kindness of the publicspirited young nobleman  the road to harlech afforde great variety there could scarc be more within the compass of ten miles for the first thre we surveyed the happ valley vide johnsons raffelas  we then passed b a beautiful lake and having gained the next mountain saw the castle situated on a high rock which projects into the irish sea it must be confessed however that the last two miles were rather a staircase path but i have frequently traveled for twenty miles together in the midland counties of england with more danger and difficulty in wales one has the pleasure of seeing that they are making daily improvements in roads but in england the farmers are so rich that by the aid of some petty attorney in the neighborhood they can generally protect perverseness by knavery  harlech stands on the northwest side of the county of merioneth its houses are mean and its inhabitants uncivilized there is a good harbor for ships bu no ships for the harbor it is remarkable only for its old decayed castle which was defended by a british nobleman against edward the fourth till an earl of pembroke after almost incredible difficulties compelled it to surrender it has been confidently asserted that this castle was built before edward the firsts time and that all he did was the making some additions especially to the fortifications but i should be rather inclined to think that it was planned at least by edward a tradition goes that the workmen after they had got to a considerable height were all taken off to build the castles of aberystwith and carnarvon and indeed there are evident marks of a separation  an unpolished people it is observed have little or no curiosity  i had seated myself by the fireside in one of the houses at harlech without the inhabitants expressing the least surprise at it the guide and attendants began to be rather clamorous for some refreshment and the people at length brought them some oatmeal bread sour porter and linking cheese on my leaving he house i believe i gave the mistress of it more than she exected for she immediately realled me to share some cockles with her that were stewing on he hearth and whilst i was asting them she superadded a ook of such native kindness and good will as infinitely surassed all the artifices of refinement  from harlech a fresh guid conducted me over the top o the mountain and i found a entire good road on my retur to tan y bwlch  leaving my little inn the with regret i passed a drea cloudcapt country till i cam to a road which for near a mi was cut through a barren roo and finely preparative for t scene that was to open upon me on a sudden i came upon pont aberglaslyn the bridge that divides the counties of merioneth and carnarvon it consists of only one wide stone arch thrown over a considerable waterfall from two perpendicular precipices beyond it is a semicircle of rock which forms a salmoneap above which in spawning time the fish frequently atempt to lodge themselves at he amazing height of five or in yards they are frequently taught here in the season with nets and sometimes with spea that are barbed for the purpose but having passed the bridg how shall i express my feelings  the dark tremendous precpices the rapid river roarin over disjointed rocks blac caverns and issuing cataracts  all serve to make this the noble specimen of the finely horri the eye can possibly behold  the poet has not described n the painter pictured so gloom a retreat  it is the last approa to the mansion of pluto through the regions of despair  having staid too long in contemplating this amazing pass i posted as fast as possible over a rocky desert to gain some refreshment at bethkelert the blacksmiths house appearing the nearest i alighted and was able to obtain two eggs which might here be considered as a most luxurious repast at tan y bwlch i had been informed that i should really meet with very decent accommodations at bettus and might with comfort take up my abode there for an evening as i traveled i reflected on burnets description of a part of carnarvonshire that it was the fragment of a demolished world and on making some slight observation to the guide of the dreariness that surrounded me aye master says he this must have been an ancient country indeed for you see it is worn out to the ery stones this remark however is probably rather good han new  but we were now arrived at bettus and the guide pointed to the house where i was to get lodging and entertainment  the violent stench did not prevent my looking in  the avages sat lapping their oatmeal and milk and the swine were ttendant at the table in such  situation only one question ould properly be asked which was how many miles to carnarvon finding the distanc only six miles i determine to hazard being lost in the night rather than to be sufocated in this nauseous dungeon i must own i did her expatiate a little on recommendations and said it was impossble that the guide as well as the mistress of the inn at tan  bwlch could be so intolerabl mistaken the man apologize with great frankness that he di ot think the house altogether o bad as my honor would ave been sure to have gotten ome good ale  however amidst all my vexation i could ot help doubting whether man ink into a savage at bettus or polished into an ape at paris was altogether the more respectble animal  within three miles of carnarvon i was agreeably surprised with a very fine road and a new ridge which will open a free communication with these unfrequented regions and induce the curious to visit the wonders o the british alps in preference t the mountains of switzerland o the glaciers of savoy  mr barington who to a consummat knowledge in the formation o laws adds zeal and propriety i the execution of them has now indicted all the parishes betwee carnarvon and bethkelert an indeed unless men of great ran or the justices of each distric ill take upon them this office at bill which was in many rts so excellently framed by r gilbert about two years ago ust become totally void and inicacious  i know that it will  immediately said that any ivate gentleman has the same ans within his own power t what private gentleman for  sake of a road will live in petual warfare with five or six ishes around him  who for  convenience of rolling his carriage a quarter of an ho sooner to some neighboring mkettown will endanger his pltations being cut down or  cattle to be either maimed or stroyed  i passed my evening at a v good inn at carnarvon and hing procured an intelligent gu returned early next morn through bettus to the foo snowdon  having left my h at a small hut and hired a mtaineer to carry some cor d provisions with a spiked ck but imprudently without ils in my shoes about ten clock i began to ascend the ountain  the two first miles ere rather boggy and disagreeble but when the prospect opend i soon forgot all difficulties  in the course of the two last i assed by six precipices which i elieve were very formidable ut as i was near the brink and e wind very high i did not enture to examine too narrowly  on the summit which is a pla about six yards in circumferen the air was perfectly mild and  rene and i could with pleasu contemplate the amazing m that was unfolded to my view  from hence may be distinct  seen wicklow hills in irelan the isle of man cumberland la cashire cheshire shropshire a part of scotland  all the couties of north wales the isle  anglesea  rivers plains wood rocks and mountains six an twenty lakes and two seas  it is doubted whether there is another circular prospect so extenive in any part of the terraqueous globe  who could take such a survey without perceiving his spirits elevated in some proportion to the height  who could behold so bountiful a display of nature without wonder and ecstacy  who but must feel even a degree of pride from having gained an eminence from which he could with ease overlook the nest moel guidon and moel happo two mountains near snowdon mention by lord lyttelton  vide account of a journey into wal   of the eagle and the ne of the hawk  but as the level walks of lif are best suited to the generality  mankind it became necessary t consider that this was no sp where i could properly make an lasting abode and that the return would be attended with a least as much difficulty as the ascent  having descended mile or two i did not think it amiss to enquire about an exhausted mine that i saw at a distance and i could make this enquiry with the better grace as the guides had hitherto quite wondered at my prowess  the mine i was informed was only copper and happy was it for the welsh that their mines did not consist of choicer metals  had they been cursed with either gold or silver foreign nations long since in the name of the god of peace and under pretense of teaching them an immaculate religion the spaniards made the gospel an excuse for all the barbarities they committed in the conquest of peru and when they plundered the rich mines of potosi they frequently says las casas erected gibbets all over the country and hung twelve poor wretches at a time in honor of the twelve apostles  had laid waste their country and murdered its inhabitants  at the foot of snowdon i turned about half a mile out of the way to see a waterfall  the siderock was exceedingly beautiful but the cataract itself was rather contemptible after the noble ones i had seen in the neighborhood of dolgelly  as the guides seemed to think a floating island about two miles distant was a most wonderful phenomenon and related many singular and surprising tales concerning it i indulged their credulity so far as to go and inspect it  the lake as they called it was somewhat bigger than a common duckpond and the island was a knotty piece of bog which after very heavy rains might very possibly float in it  on my return to carnarvon i examined the town and castle  the town was built by the command of edward the first out of the ruins of the ancient city of segontium that stood a little below it  it is situated between two rivers and has a beautiful prospect of the isle of anglesea  it was formerly of very great account when the princes of wales kept their chancery and exchequer courts there  on the west side of it stands the castle which was built to curb the welsh mountaineers and secure a passage to the opposite shore  in a part of it called the eagle tower you are shown the remains of a chamber in which edward the second the cradle of that weak wicked unfortunate prince is still preserved it is now in the possession of a clergyman in gloucestershire to whom it descended from one of his ancestors who attended the prince in his infancy is said to have been born about ten years after his birth it was besieged by the welsh but was afterward repaired and both the town and castle had diverse privileges confirmed to them by different sovereigns down to the reign of elizabeth during the last civil war they were held for king charles but were afterward surrendered on conditions to the parliament on viewing these spacious ruins i could only ruminate on the changes they had undergone  strange reverse  to think that those walls which heretofore resounded with acclamations on the birth of the first english prince of wales should now afford shelter only to a few miserable cottages from the tempestuous blasts of the bristol channel  i made several excursions into the isle of anglesea the wellknown seat of the druids  this may now be considered as classical ground for though mona is destroyed and her altars abolished  though fires have consumed her groves and her priests have perished by the sword yet like the phoenix she rises more glorious from decay her ashes have given birth to the caractacus of mason and the fate of her bards to the inspiration of gray  nothing could be more deightful than the ride from cararvon to bangor to the right and were snowdon hills and to he left the river menai or more roperly speaking the strait beween the continent and the land of anglesea i had now ot into daylight and the polite world again  there had been a iversion the night before at cararvon and the road was covered ver with carriages  bangor lies at the north en of the same frith or arm of the sea which is the passage to anglesea where it has a harbo for boats it was once so lar as to be called bangor the great and was defended with a poweful castle built by hugh earl  chester which has long sin been demolished the town  now of very little note except f being the sea of a bishop t palace is neat but deplorab ituated  this is doubly mortiying in a country where every art of the neighborhood is icturesque and pleasing his ordship however has the happiness of being so much beloved in his diocese that it would have een almost treason there to have wished him a removal  between bangor and conway i assed over the famous mountain alled penmaen mawr  the road ust formerly have been very ightful but a wall is now built to the sea side to which it is said the city of dublin very largely contributed  to form this roa it has already cost upwards o two thousand pounds and it ca be kept open only at a continua expense for vast fragments o rock are frequently falling fort fathom from above which entirely block it up till they a forced through the parapet into the sea which lies perpendicularly full as deep below  from hence the country opens into a plain which extends as far as the river conway the eastern limit of the county of carnarvon it rises out of a lake of the same name and runs with a northwest course receiving in the short space of twelve miles more than as many rivers so that at aberconway where it discharges its waters into the irish sea it is full a mile broad and capable of bringing ships of almost any size up to the town at present conway bears only some melancholy marks of wha it once was and to what a wretched state by a total decay o trade it is now reduced  the castle still remains one o the noblest monuments of antiquity it is built in the sam style with that of carnarvon bu is far more regular the outside is the same as in the tim of edward the first except on tower and that was not demolished with either battering engines or cannons but by the people of the place taking stones from the foundation of it some remains of the principal rooms are still to be seen the dimensions of which have been accurately given by lord lyttelton and an elegant view of them in antiquities by mr gross but i had never seen the outside of this most venerable ruin to advantage had i not walked over some polished ground about a quarter of a mile from it which i believe belongs to a gentleman o conway  there you see the castl finely sheltered by an oak wood  on one side the chief of river opening into the irish sea and on the other the mountains surrounding penmaen with a distan country most beautifully diversified  art and nature cannot combine to form a more various and more delicious prospect  i could not possibly leave this part of the country without seeing the vale of llanryst the bridge built by inigo jones and the chapel supposed to have been planned by him which contains the rich monuments of the guedir family  the vale upon the whole i thought inferior to that i had seen in montgomeryshire but the bridge is certainly a very elegant structure and speaks itself to be the work of a great architect most probably of jones for i incline to the opinion that llanryst was the place of his nativity  the chapel which adjoins the parish church was erected by sir richard win one of the grooms of the bedchamber to charles the first when prince of wales and was chiefly made use of for the almshouse in the neighborhood which was endowed by the guedir family i took the pains of copying the different inscriptions in it and as they are not contained in the history of that family lately published they may not be unacceptable to the curious antiquary  this cappel was erected anno domini      by sir richard win of gwydir in the county of carnavon knight and baronet treasurer to the high and mighty princess henrietta maria queen of england daughter to king henery the fourth king of france and wife to our soveraing king charles where lies buried his father sr john win of gwydir in the county of caernarvon knight and baronet son and heir to maurice win son and heir to john win son and heir to meredith which three lie buried in the church of dolwyddelan with tombs over them this meredith son and heir to evan son and heir to robert son and heir to meredith son and heir to howel son and heir to david son and heir to griffith son and heir to carradock son and heir to thomas son and heir to roderick lord of anglesey son to owen gwynedd prince of wales and and younger to david prince of wales who married eme plantagenet sister to king henery the second there succeeded this david three princes his nephew leolinus magnus who married jone daughter to king john davil his son nephew to king henery the third and leoline the last prince of wales of that house and line who lived in king edward the first his time sr john win married sydney who lies buried here the daughter of sr william gerrard knight lord chancellor of ireland by whom he had issue sr john win who died at lucca in italy sr richard win now living thomas win who lies here roger win who lies here william win now living maurice win now living ellis win who lies buried at whitford in the county of flint henery win now liveing roger win who lies here and two daughters mary now living married to sr roger mostyn in the county of flint knight and elizabeth now liveing married to sr john bodvil in the county of caernarvon knight on the floor are four brass plates with drawings of figures upon each of them in the dresses of the times one of maria mostyn wife of roger mostyn another of sir owen win another of sir john win and a fourth of lady sydney win wife of sir john win and in the corner of the chapel a stone coffin which was removed from the abbey of conway about two miles from hence on which is the following inscription this is the coffin of leolinus magnus prince of wales who was buried in the abbey of conway and upon the dissolution removed from thence on each side are six carved recesses in the figure of flower de luces which bear evident marks of having contained brass plates and two at the bottom of the coffin  there is now erected in the church a gallery of exquisite workmanship which was removed likewise from the abbey and i was at the trouble of having a large quantity of rubbish taken away from under an old staircase that i might inspect a stone effigy which is said to be of hoel coetmore who sold the guedir estate to the win family the word gwedir is supposed to signify glass and tha family probably was the first who in these parts had a house with glazed windows  i ought to make some apology for the foregoing heavy articles but elaborate inscriptions frequently illustrate history an these will at least show that some of the welsh were not totally regardless of pedigree  i made diligent enquiry through all carnarvonshire and this part of denbighshire for the glyder mountain which gibson has particularly described and which from its singularity say the authors of a tour through wales we more wished to have seen than the summits of either plinlimmon or snowdon  on the utmost top of this mountain according to the continuator of camden who saw it is a prodigious pile of stones many of which are of the magnitude of those at stonehenge they lie in such an irregular manner crossing and supporting each other that some people have imagined them to be the remains of a vast building bu gibson more naturally suppose them to be the skeleton or ruin of the mountain the weaker parts of which may have been worn away in a series of ages by the rains and meltings of the snow  on the west side of the same mountain he speaks of a remarkable precipice adorned with numerous equidistant columns formed to that shape by the almost continual rains which this high rock being exposed to the westerly sea wind is subject to  notwithstanding the situation of this mountain seems to be pointed out by the last line and though its phoenomena ar so peculiar yet we add the authors of the same tour were obliged to leave the country without gaining the smalles knowledge of it    i was equally unfortunate i not being able to see this mountain but in crossing the wid ferry at conway i by acciden gained such information that i am confident any future traveller may very readily satisfy his curiosity an old boatman there informed me that he had frequently seen it  that in his younger days indeed it was sometimes termed the glyder but was now known only by the name of wythwar  that it was within a mile or two of a village called clynog and upon the shore almost opposite to carnarvon  on my way to st asaph i passed over the top of penmaen ross a steep and formidable mountain this is by far the worst part of the road between holyhead and chester  a nearer path was some time since cut along the side of the sea cliff but a man and horse had lately been killed and by order of the commissioners it is now entirely broken up  the city of st asaph is called in british llan elwy on account of its situation at the conflux of the river elwy with the clwyd and st asaph by the english from its patron asaph who in the year   0 erected a bishops see there the bishop of this diocese has no entire county under his jurisdiction but parts only of the counties of flint denbigh montgomery merioneth and salop the cathedral is a mean structure and the houses in general but ill built st asaph however may boast that it stands in the delightful vale of clwyd though by no means in the finest part of it  about five miles from thence near the road to holywell you have the best view i think of that fertile and delicious vale  it is of an oval shape about    miles in length and about eight miles wide in its broadest part it lies open only to the ocean and to the clearing north wind being elsewhere guarded with high mountains which toward the east especially are like battlements or turrets for by an admirable contrivance of nature says camden the tops of these mountains resemble the turrets of walls upon the whole however i think that there are other cultivated scenes in north wales equal if not superior in the vale of clwyd indeed you have the lively and the beautiful but in montgomeryshire the awful and sublime  holywell and the history of its virgin saint would require at least a folio i shall only say that i was truly sorry to find that blasphemous papers should still be suffered to be publicly sold at the spring there which compare the ludicrous legend of winefrid with the most sacred truths of the gospel  it was my intention to have seen winstay erthig and chirk castle sir watkin wynnes mr yorkes and mr middletons  and afterward to have traced the river dee to bala but i was unexpectedly called off from my tour i had the good fortune however to join party with the bishop of kildare whose easy manners and refined conversation left me no room to regret a disappointment  to the foregoing account which was in part printed off for the use and amusement of some select friends only i shall now add a few general remarks on the history of the country and the manners of its inhabitants  the origin of every nation is necessarily obscure and always lost in a pretended antiquity on the authority of bochart we may trace the welsh from japhet the son of noah according to others from trojans and phoenicians who were the offspring of gods and one writer i think has asserted that a true briton is a compound of all nations under heaven that britain however was peopled from gaul  000 years before christ appears very probable  the arguments in favor of this opinion are deduced from the state of population on the continent and from the progress of it in the island itself it has been well observed by whitaker that names descriptive of national manners cannot be the original appellations of any people they result from the intercourse and experience of the states around them on whose territories they have dared to encroach the appellation of brigantes according to strabo came to signify a turbulent and plundering race and the denominations of celtae and gael came to import even amongst themselves the ferocious and the stranger  the name of cymri appears to have been the great hereditary distinction of the gauls upon the continent and to have been carried with them into all their conquests it was not retained in our island merely by the natives of wales but was equally the appellation of a nation in the southwest of somersetshire and the northeast of cornwall  the first denomination of our island was certainly albion a name given before the country was inhabited it was the celtic term for heights or eminences the alps some ages before the days of strabo were called albia and in his time there remained two tribes on the mountains that bore the names of albioeci and albienses  the second denomination was that of britain derived from a celtic word likewise signifying divided not painted this etymology has lately been proved not to have been applied to the region but bestowed on the inhabiters not previously borne on the continent by the original settlers of the country but assumed o received at their first removal into the island  the title of welsh seems to arise from the word wall or gall an appellation which the britons frequently gave each other nor will this derivation appear forced if we add that the channel betwixt france and england was denominated sinus vallicus or the gallick strait so late as the eighth century and that the dutch and germans call the french by the name of walls and walloons to this very day  the general denomination of wales was not imposed on the country by the saxons but was the acknowledged appellation of the region as early as the sixth century if we may believe a quotation from taliessin as cited by dr davies  nor were some plain and certain derivations of names till of late only unknown to us  we have not always had either just ideas of british manners or british antiquities this ample field of history has been greatly laid open by an individual whitaker  and a ich produce will continually rise from the judicious publicaions of a most respectable soiety society of antiquaries   our knowledge of the druids  still vague and unsatisfying and must ever remain so as they committed few things if any to writing though they were certainly not unacquainted with letters for among the maxims collected by gollet there is one tha forbids their mysteries to be writen a prohibition which could never have been given had leters been entirely unknown some curious particulars however ma at least be traced from tradition and others from specimens  their poetry that have been recit by the natives as guardia of what they called true religion they of course possessed the greatest authority among the people no laws were instituted by the princes without their advice no plunder taken in war without their partaking of it they held the dissolution of the world by fire and water they taught the immortality and some say the transmigration of the soul a doctrine borrowed from the pythagoreans though clemens alexandrinus expressly asserts that the pythagoreans borrowed that doctrine from them in my own opinion they never believed the transmigration of the soul at all and i found this opinion on some late accounts of gaulish funerals which certainly corresponded with the british ones the customs and ceremonials of which were absolutely incompatible with that doctrine  they sacrificed human victims to propitiate the gods and prophesied future events from the falling of the body and the manner in which the members were convulsed  they believed there was a divine mystery in misleto but took their first distinction from the oak to which the jews paid the same regard during their idolatry according to a passage in ezekiel under every thick oak did they offer sweet sacrifice to their idols once a year they with their chief an archdruid assembled at a fixed time and place to hear causes and determine all disputes where their decisive court was held has never been determined but most probably in anglesea as that island was certainly their metropolis so great was the power of the druids that not only the property but also the lives of the people were entirely at their disposal and this power continued absolute till the time of tiberius  it was afterward suppressed by claudius under the fair pretext of abolishing human sacrifices but the priests themselves their gods and their altars subsisted though in obscurity till the final destruction of paganism  the manners of the people were naturally tinged with the discipline of their teachers in proportion to their ignorance they were superstitious and in proportion to their zeal they committed cruelties and fraud i shall not raise disgust by a recital of barbarities but rather refer my readers to the journals of modern voyages where they will find that there is a sameness in the primaeval state of every savage nation a few other particulars however may not be uninteresting the britons lived in tribes or clans under the aristocratical rule of their several lords their villages were a confused parcel of huts placed at a small distance from each other and generally speaking in the middle of a wood whereof the avenues were defended with trees that were cut down to clear the ground  their trade was very inconsiderable notwithstanding the convenient situation of the island for carrying on an extensive commerce their vessels were very small with their keels and ribs made of slight timber interwoven with wicker and covered with hides which shows that they never undertook long voyages most probably never ventured to sea beyond the coasts of gaul  the britons were not so totally destitute of defense as has been imagined the island is of itself a shield and they certainly made use of the battleaxe as well as military chariot these chariots were drawn by horses and the axletrees were generally furnished with scythes but the people were not united under a well regulated government or they would always have continued formidable to their enemies  a number of petty communities will never act in concert with each other though history informs us that upon great and extraordinary dangers a chief commander was always chosen by common consent but what state or colony will acquiesce even with the leader themselves have chosen and in the end if unsuccessful he must always fall a sacrifice to those miseries their own inconsistencies alone have occasioned  when that part of britain which comprehends the present kingdom of england and principality of wales was divided into several petty kingdoms the inhabitants were all distinguished by different names the principality of wales formerly comprehending the whole country beyond the severn was in the roman times occupied by the silures the dimetae and ordovices to these belonged not only the twelve counties of wales but likewise the two others lying beyond the severn herefordshire and monmouthshire which in the reign of charles the second were first reckoned amongst the english counties  the country now known by the name of north wales was inhabited by the ordovices only who held out first against the romans and afterward against the english after the other britons were subdued for by the romans they were not reduced till the time of domitian nor by the english till the reign of henry the first  about fortyfive years before the christian era britain was first invaded by the romans under julius caesar  afterward by claudius and at length became a province under the roman empire it was governed by lieutenants or deputies sent from rome as ireland is now by deputies from england and continued thus under the romans for upwards of  00 years till that empire being invaded by the goths and vandals the romans were forced not only to recall their own armies but also to draw from hence the bravest of the britons for their assistance against those barbarians  the country being left in a defenseless state was invaded by the scots who were so rapacious that the britons sent over a miserable application for relief to aetius the roman general who by several famous successes for a time had repelled the violence of the gothic arms but receiving no hopes of any succors from that general the south britons invited over the saxons who no sooner delivered them from their ancient foes the picts and scots than they strengthened their own numbers turned their arms against the natives and conquered them some few excepted who secured themselves in their mountains of wales whence their descendants have always been distinguished by the title of ancient britons  during the saxon heptarchy ived the renowed prince arthur whose valor would have retrieved the miserable state of the britons had valor only been wanting his history has been so blended with fable that some have doubted the real existence of such a person but it seems rather hard because stories have been invented concerning the actions of his life that he should not be allowed to have lived at all it is true that the saxon annals make no mention of this king but it was not probable that the saxons would be fond of recording exploits which redounded only to their own discredit an ancient english historian speaking of cerdic mentions his fighting several battles with king arthur and william of malmesbury owns that though the britons had vented innumerable fables concerning this prince he certainly was a hero worthy to be celebrated in true history the britons bewailed their long lost arthur for several ages after his death  they believed he was still alive in fairy land and that he would return once more to reign over them nor was this notion rooted out till the reign of henry the second about six hundred years afterward when his coffin was dug up at glastenbury in somersetshire with the following inscription here lies buried the renowned king arthur in the island avalonia the exploits of this warrior have not only been sung by taliessin and other british bards but have been celebrated by one of the greatest of our english poets it seems by some hints given by spenser that he intended a poem whose title was to be expressly king arthur  dryden tells us that he had some thoughts of making choice for the subject of an heroic poem king arthurs conquests over the saxons milton in a latin address to mansus has likewise intimated the same intention  wales was anciently bounded by the irish seas and by the rivers severn and dee till the saxons became masters of all the level countries over those rivers and till offa king of mercia made the celebrated trench which is still called by his name this trench which extended from north to south  from the mouth of the river dee to that of the wye has been thought to have been an imitation of the ramparts which were thrown up by agricola adrian and severus to guard the romans against the incursions of the northern barbarians but from some remains of it as well as for several other reasons it seems more probable that it was not intended by offa as a fortification but rather as a boundary betwixt his kingdom and the cambrian province  when after many events between the several races of the heptarchy ecbert became the sole king of england as it was now distinguished from the principality of wales he possessed himself also of mona the capital of the cambrian province but the saxons some time afterward being driven out of it it was from them called anglesea englishmans island a name which it has retained ever since  in the year eight hundred and fortythree all wales was united under the dominion of roderic surnamed the great who by a testamentary settlement made a new division between three sons into three districts which were called kingdoms and distinguished by the names of south wales powis land and north wales this partition gave rise to many wars which caused the kingdom of powis land to be portioned among the conquerors and annexed partly to south wales and partly to north wales divisions which subsist to this day  no sooner were the saxons settled under one monarch than the danes began to trouble them as they the saxons had before done the britons till after many invasions edgar king of england set forth the first navy made peace with the danes and allowed them to live in his dominions mixed with the english  at this time we read of five kings in wales who all did him homage for their country  notwithstanding many attempts of the english the welsh enjoyed their own laws and lived under their own princes till in the year      llewellin lost both his principality and life in the reign of henry the eighth wales was incorporated and united with england and by a statute of the   th of that reign all laws and liberties of england were to take place there from which time the welsh have approved themselves truly worthy of their high origin loyal and dutiful to their king and always zealous for the welfare of the community  the welsh language is still the gomerian or old celtic the same that was once spoken throughout europe except that through length of time and intermixture of the people with the scythians and other nations it has split into a variety of dialects no tongue either ancient or modern i believe bears greater marks of antiquity its strong resemblance to the hebrew has been generally admitted insomuch that one author of great learning has given a specimen of a considerable number of phrases out of the old testament which are so alike in both that they seem to have been originally the same it is no uncommon error to give the name of mother tongue to those languages from which some known idioms only are derived the hebrew has been considered as a mother tongue but was evidently borrowed from the phoenician the latin is called the mother tongue to the italian the spanish and the french but the latin itself was derived from the tuscan and the tuscan from the celtic and the greek it will reasonably be asked how the gomerians have preserved their language almost entire whilst the jews have suffered theirs to be corrupted and blended with those of their conquerors  for this many reasons may be assigned the former have not been so frequently subdued and they have always preserved a considerable regard for what they conceived to be a mother tongue a regard greatly kept up perhaps by the custom which the lowest of the people had of reciting their genealogies this ancient language is spoken the nearest to its original purity in the uncultivated parts of north wales but the welsh in general still retain so high a veneration for it that i am confident they will never readily suffer the english to be entirely made use of in their churches or taught solely in their schools  much has been said of those druidical remains which by many authors have been indiscriminately called carns carnedds and cromlechs but of their original meaning i shall venture the following conjecture  that by the word carn which signified a rock the britons simply implied one large broad stone as a covering for a grave the word carn was afterward used in an ill sense most probably when the mode of burial came to be changed on the introduction of christianity ther malefactors being thrown into holes nea the highways and great quantities o stones heaped upon them it was no uncommon thing for a man to say to hi enemy may a carn be your monument  by a carnedd a heap of stones thrown rudely together to commemorate an event and by a cromlech an huge broad flat stone raised high on other stones where the ancient britons like the hebrews made sacrifices or paid religious adoration  those nice distinctions that have been formed of the druids the bards and the vates subsisted only i think in particular societies the druids in general composed and recited hymns as worship to their deities the bards the bards who were inferior druids wore an ecclesiastical ornament during the celebration of their rites called by the latins caputium or cucullus which is still retained in our universities the gauls who borrowed this custom from the british druids wore the cucullus remarkably long whence it obtained on its being made use of at rome the name of bardocucullus or bards hood it was in allusion to the shape of this hood that martial feared lest a sheet of his book should be rolled up to put pepper or frankincense in ne thuris piperisve sit cucullus vid nicholls certainly composed hymns likewise but it was in the hour of battle that their labors were chiefly celebrated by singing the exploits of deceased heroes while the vates were principally engaged in the rites of sacrifice or the arts of divination  the welsh have always laid claim to the discovery of america in preference to the great columbus but this claim has hitherto been supported with little more than bare conjecture in the twelfth century according to powell there was a war in wales for the succession upon the death of owen guinneth and a bastard having carried it from the lawful heirs one of the latter called madoc put to sea and sailing west from spain discovered a new world of wonderful fertility  to prove that a country was thus discovered the welsh have recourse to the authority of meridith ap rhees who composed an ode in honor prince madoc and his newfound land and that this country was america they have alleged on the credit of peter martyr that the natives of virginia celebrated the memory of one madoc as a great and ancient hero and always supposed their ancestors to have come thither at first from some very distant countries on the other side the great water at the time that has been asserted and from the same point of the compass the affinity of language has since been frequently urged by modern travelers and bishop nicholson in particular speaks confidently that the british makes a considerable part of several of the american tongues in answer to these assertions the ingenious dr robertson has just now declared that he conceives the skill of the welsh in the twelfth century not to have been equal to such a voyage and that the instances given of the affinity of language are so obscure and fanciful that no conclusion can be drawn from them to these remarks he adds that if the welsh toward the close of the twelfth century had settled in any part of america some remains of the christian doctrine must have been afterward found among their descendants when they were discovered three hundred years after their migration  but here i must entirely disagree with the learned author  three hundred years cannot in this case be called a short period  one century would probably have been sufcient to have obliterated every mark of a religion that had to combat with the prejudices of an unlettered people that did not address itself immediately to their interests and through a mode of civilization teach them at first only as warburton well expresses it the gospel plain and simple as it is and fitted in its nature for what it was ordained to effect requires an intellect something above that of a savage to apprehend nor is it at all to the dishonor of our holy faith that such a one must be taught a previous lesson and first of all instructed in the emollient arts of life  see the bishop of gloucesters sermon on the propagation of the gospel   the emollient arts of life  christianity seems to have been introduced into britain as early as the first century but of this great event our accounts must necessarily be very imperfect as the saxons destroyed almost all the writings in which it was recorded mona we read had certainly a school of christian learning many years before     when there was an archbishop of caerleon and suffragans under him but the clergy had no distinct parishes either in anglesea or any other part of the kingdom till many years afterward about the year  00 pope gregory sent austin the monk to preach the gospel in england to the heathen saxons who was received by ethelbert and being admitted to explain the doctrine and mysteries of it so well succeeded that he converted great numbers and at length the king himself thus the christian religion came to be established in england under the rites and authority of the romish church by which austin was instituted chief bishop and seated by the saxon king at canterbury but his jurisdiction though admitted in all the saxon territories was not received by the british priests or people in wales  in the reign of elizabeth the bible and common prayer were first translated into the welsh tongue and at that time the people are said to have adhered to the rubric and constitution of the church with a scrupulous exactness how far the doctrines and worship of christianity may have deviated from their original purity or how far the welsh may have been affected by the refined tenets of their english neighbors i shall not presume to determine at present i think there is every where much to be feared from the growth of enthusiasm the subtleties of infidelity and the necessity as well as danger of innovation  many popish customs are still retained in wales particularly offerings made to the dead  these offerings must of course vary according to the rank of the persons deceased as well as the affection that is borne to their memories i was at a paupers funeral where the donations amounted to half a crown and i met with a clergyman afterward who had once received ninety guineas  great complaints are made in many parts of this country of the exorbitant demands of landlords and that the rent of ground is now advanced much higher than it will bear  such complaints must of course be expected from the sufferers but i believe they are here in some instances made with reason the landlords on the contrary may urge perhaps that they act with strict justice and that they have a right at least to try the experiment but it should be remembered that the extreme of right is wrong and there is a tribute of humanity due from the superior that he should be always on a certainty that he does not exact too much  national characters should always be read with exceptions but if i must give my opinion of the inhabitants of north wales i shall say that the common people in general are civil and grateful the farmers rather slow and suspicious a few of the inferior squires retain somewhat of the sottish and the brutal but among the higher ranks i have found in the same proportion as in england lettered society hospitable reception and refined address  finis
