the history of sir charles grandison in a series of letters published from the originals by the editor of pamela and clarissa  in seven volumes  vol iv  london printed by s richardson and dublin reprinted and sold by the booksellers m dcc liii  the history of sir charles grandison bart letter i miss harriet byron to miss lucy selby friday march    you now my dear friends have before you this affecting story as far as dr bartlett can give it my cousins express a good deal of concern for your harriet so does miss grandison so do my lord and lady l and the more as i seem to carry off the matter with assumed bravery this their kind concern for me looks however as if they thought me an hypocrite and i suppose therefore that i act my part very aukwardly  but my dear as this case is one of those few in which a woman can show a bravery of spirit i think an endeavor after it is laudable and the rather as in my conduct i aim at giving a tacit example to miss jervois  the doctor has whispered to me that lady olivia is actually on her way to england and that the intelligence sir charles received of her intention was one of the things that disturbed him as the news of his beloved signor jeronymos dangerous condition was another  lady anne s it seems has not yet given up her hopes of sir charles the two sisters who once favored her above all the women they knew have not been able to bring themselves to acquaint a lady of her rank merit and fortune that there can be no hopes and they are still more loath to say that their brother thinks themselves under some obligation to a foreign lady yet you know that this was always what we were afraid of but who now will say afraid that knows the merit of clementina  i wish methinks that this man were proud vain arrogant and a boaster how easily then might one throw off ones shackles  lord g is very diligent in his court to miss grandison his father and aunt are to visit her this afternoon she behaves whimsically to my lord yet i cannot think that she greatly dislikes him  the earl of d and the countess dowager are both in town the countess made a visit to my cousin reeves last tuesday she spoke of me very kindly she says that my lord has heard so much of me that he is very desirous of seeing me but she was pleased to say that since my heart was not disengaged she should be afraid of the consequences of his visit to himself  my grandmamma though she was so kindly fond of me would not suffer me to live with her because she thought that her contemplative temper might influence mine and make me grave at a time of life when she is always saying that cheerfulness is most becoming she would therefore turn over her girl to the best of aunts but now i fancy she will allow me to be more than two days in a week her attendant my uncle selby will be glad to spare me i shall not be able to bear a jest and then what shall i be good for  i have made a fine hand of coming to town he says and so i have but if my heart is not quite so easy as it was it is i hope a better at least not a worse heart than i brought up with me could i only have admired this man my excursion would not have been unhappy but this gratitude this entangling with all its painful consequences  but let me say with my grandmamma the man is sir charles grandison the very man by whose virtues a clementina was attracted upon my word my dear unhappy as she is i rank her with the first of women  i have not had a great deal of sir charles grandisons company but yet more i am afraid than i shall ever have again very true  o heart the most way ward of hearts sigh if thou will  you have seen how little he was with us when we were absolutely in his reach and when he as we thought was in ours but such a man cannot ought not to be engrossed by one family bless me lucy when he comes into public life for has not his country a superior claim to him beyond every private one what moment can he have at liberty let me enumerate some of his present engagements that we know of  the danby family must have some farther portion of his time  the executorship in the disposal of the  000 l in charity in france as well as in england will take up a good deal more  my lord w may be said to be under his tutelage as to the future happiness of his life  miss jervoiss affairs and the care he has for her person engage much of his attention  he is his own steward  he is making alterations at grandisonhall and has a large genteel neighborhood there who long to have him reside among them and he himself is fond of that seat  his estate in ireland is in a prosperous way from the works he set on foot there when he was on the spot and he talks as dr bartlett has hinted to us of making another visit to it  his sisters match with lord g is one of his cares  he has services to perform for his friend beauchamp with his father and motherinlaw for the facilitating his coming over  the apprehended visit of olivia gives him disturbance  and the bologna family in its various branches and more especially signor jeronymos dangerous state of health and signora clementinas disordered mind  o lucy  what leisure has this man to be in love  yet how can i say so when he is in love already and with clementina  and dont you think that when he goes to france on the executorship account he will make a visit to bologna  ah my dear to be sure he will  after he has left england therefore which i suppose he will quickly do and when i am in northamptonshire what opportunities will your harriet have to see him except she can obtain as a favor the power of obliging his emily in her request to be with her then lucy he may on his return to england once a year or so on his visiting his ward see and thank for her care and love of his emily his halfestranged harriet  perhaps lady clementina grandison will be with him god restore her surely i shall be capable if she be lady grandison of rejoicing in her recovery   fie upon it  why this involuntary tear you will see it by the large blot it has made if i did not mention it  excellent man dr bartlett has just been telling me of a morning visit he received before he went out of town from the two sons of mrs oldham  one of them is about seven years old the other about five very fine children he embraced them the doctor says with as much tenderness as if they were children of his own mother he enquired into their inclinations behavior diversions and engaged equally their love and reverence  he told them that if they were good he would love them and said he had a dear friend whom he reverenced as his father a man with white curling locks he told the children that they might know him at first sight who would nowandthen as he happened to be in town make enquiries after their good behavior and reward them as they gave him cause accordingly he had desired dr bartlett to give them occasionally his countenance as also to let their mother know that she should be glad of a visit from her and her three children on his return to town  the doctor had been to see her when he came to me he found all three with her the two younger impressed by the venerable description sir charles had given of him voluntarily the younger by the elders example fell down on their knees before him and begged his blessing  mr oldham is about eighteen years of age a wellinclined well educated youth he was full of acknowlegements of the favor done him in his invitatation  the grateful mother could not contain herself blessings without number she invoked on her benefactor for his goodness in taking such kind notice of her two sons as he had done and said he had been ever since his gracious behavior to her in essex the first and last in her prayers to heaven but the invitation to herself she declared was too great an honor for her to accept of she should not be able to stand in his presence alas sir said she can the severest truest penitence recall the guilty past  the doctor said that sir charles grandison ever made it a rule with him to raise the dejected and humbled spirit your birth and education madam entitle you to a place in the first company and where there are two lights in which the behavior of any person may be set though there has been unhappiness he always remembers the most favorable and forgets the other i would advise you madam as he has invited you by all means to come he speaks with pleasure of your humility and good sense  the doctor told me that sir charles had made enquiries after the marriage of major ohara with mrs jervois and had satisfied himself that they were actually man and wife methinks i am glad for miss jervoiss sake that her mother has changed her name they lived not happily together since their last enterprise for the man who had long been a sufferer from poverty was in fear of losing one half at least of his wifes annuity by what passed on that occasion and accused her of putting them upon the misbehaviour he was guilty of which had brought upon him he said the resentments of a man admired by all the world  the attorney who visited sir charles from these people at their request waited on him again in their names with hopes that they should not suffer in their annuity and expressing their concern for having offended him  mrs ohara also requested it as a favor to see her daughter  sir charles commissioned the attorney who is a man of repute to tell them that if mrs ohara would come to st jamess square next wednesday about five oclock miss jervois should be introduced to her and she should be welcome to bring with her her husband and captain salmonet that they might be convinced he bore no ill will to either of them  adieu till byandby miss grandison is come in one of her usual hurries to oblige me to be present at the visit to be made her this afternoon by the earl of g and lady gertrude his sister a maiden lady advanced in years who is exceedingly fond of her nephew and intends to make him heir of her large fortune  friday night the earl is an agreeable man lady gertrude is a very agreeable woman they saw miss grandison with the young lords eyes and were better pleased with her as i told her afterward than i should have been or then they would had they known her as well as i do she doubted not she answered me but i should find fault with her and yet she was as good as for her life she could be  such an archness in every motion such a turn of the eye to me on my lord gs assiduities such a fear in him of her correcting glance such an halftimid halffree parade when he had done anything that he intended to be obliging and nowandthen an aiming at raillery as if he was not very much afraid of her and dared to speak his mind even to her on her part on those occasions such an air as if she had a learner before her and was ready to rap his knuckles had nobody been present to mediate for him that though i could not but love her for her very archness yet in my mind i could for their sakes but more for her own have severely chidden her  she is a charming woman and everything she says and does becomes her but i am so much afraid of what may be the case when the lover is changed into the husband that i wish to myself nowandthen when i see her so lively that she would remember that there was once such a man as captain anderson but she makes it a rule she says to remember nothing that will vex her  is not my memory said she once given me for my benefit and shall i make it my torment no harriet i will leave that to be done by you wise ones and see what you will get by it  why this charlotte replied i the wife ones may have a chance to get by it  they will very probably by remembering past mistakes avoid many inconveniences into which forgetfulness will run you lively ones  well well returned she we are not all of us born to equal honor some of us are to be set up for warnings some for examples and the first are generally of greater use to the world than the other  now charlotte said i do you destroy the force of your own argument can the person who is singled out for the warning be near so happy as she that is set up for the example  you are right as far as i know harriet but i obey the present impulse and try to find an excuse afterward for what that puts me upon and all the difference in this as to the reward i have a joy you a comfort but comfort is a poor word and i cannot bear it  so biddy in the tender husband would have said charlotte but poor as the word is with you and her give me comfort rather than joy if they must be separated but i see not but that a woman of my charlottes happy turn may have both  she tapped my cheek  take that harriet for making a biddy of me i believe if you have not joy you have comfort in your severity  my heart as well as my cheek glowed at the praises the earl and the lady both joined in with a fervor that was creditable to their own hearts of sir charles grandison while they told us what this man and hat woman of quality or consideration said of him who would not be good what is life without reputation do we not wish to be remembered with honor after death and what a share of it has this excellent man in his life  may nothing for the honoursake of human nature to which he is so great an ornament ever happen to tarnish it  they made me an hundred fine compliments i could not but be pleased at standing well in their opinion but believe me my dear i did not enjoy their praises of me as i did those they gave him indeed i had the presumption from the approbation given to what they said of him by my own heart to imagine myself a sharer in them though not in his merits oh lucy ought there not to have been a relation between us since what i have said from what i found in myself on hearing him praised is a demonstration of a regard for him superior to the love of self  adieu my lucy i know i have all your prayers  adieu my dear  letter ii miss byron in continuation sat april   dr bartlett is one of the kindest as well as best of men i believe he loves me as if i were his own child but good men must be affectionate men he received but this morning a letter from sir charles and hastened to communicate some of its contents to me though i could pretend to no other motive but curiosity for wishing to be acquainted with the proceedings of his patron  sir charles dined as he had intended with sir hargrave and his friends he complains in his letter of a riotous day yet i think adds he it has led me into some useful reflections it is not indeed agreeable to be the spectator of riot but how easy to un being a partaker in it how easy to avoid the too freely circling glass if a man is known to have established a rule to himself from which he will not depart and if it be not refused sullenly but mirth and good humor the more studiously kept up by the person who would else indeed be looked upon as a spy on unguarded folly i heartily pitied a young man who i dare say has a good heart but from false shame durst not assert the freedom that every englishman would claim a right to in almost every other instance he had once put by the glass and excused himself on account of his health but on being laughed at for a sober dog as they phrased it and asked if his spouse had not lectured him before he came out he gave way to the wretched raillery nor could i interfere at such a noisy moment with effect they had laughed him out of his caution before i could be heard and i left him there at nine oclock trying with bagenhall which should drink the deepest  i wish my good dr bartlett you would throw together some serious considerations on this subject you could touch it delicately and such a discourse would not be unuseful to some few of our neighbors even at grandisonhall what is it that in this single article men sacrifice to false shame and false glory reason health fortune personal elegance the peace and order of their families and all the comfort and honor of their afteryears how peevish how wretched is the decline of a man worn out with intemperance in a cool hour resolutions might be formed that should stand the attack of a boisterous jest  i obtained leave from dr bartlett to transcribe this part of the letter i thought my uncle would be pleased with it  it was near ten at night before sir charles got to lord ws though but three miles from sir hargraves my lord rejoiced to see him and after first compliments asked him if he had thought of what he had undertaken for him sir charles told him that he was the more desirous of seeing him in his way to the hall because he wanted to know if his lordship held his mind as to marriage he assured him he did and would sign and seal to whatever he should stipulate for him  i wished for a copy of this part of sir charless letter for the sake of my aunt whose delicacy would i thought be charmed with it he has been so good as to say he would transcribe it for me i will inlose it lucy and you will read it here  i cannot my lord said sir charles engage that the lady will comply with the proposal i shall take the liberty to make to her mother and her she is not more than three or four and thirty she is handsome she has a fine understanding she is brought up an oeconomist she is a woman of good family she has not however though born to happier prospects a fortune worthy of your lordships acceptance whatever that is your lordship will perhaps choose to give it to her family  with all my heart and soul nephew but do you say she is handsome do you say she is of family and has she so many good qualities  ah nephew she will not have me i doubt  and is she not too young sir charles to think of such a poor decrepit soul as i am  all i can say to this my lord is that the proposals on your part must be the more generous   i will leave all those matters to you kinsman   this my lord i will take upon me to answer for that she is a woman of principle she will not give your lordship her hand if she thinks she cannot make you a wife worthy of your utmost kindness and now my lord i will tell you who she is that you may make what other enquiries you think proper  and then i named her to him and gave him pretty near the account of the family and the circumstances and affairs of it that i shall byandby give you though you are not quite a stranger to the unhappy case  my lord was in raptures he knew something be said of the ladys father and enough of the family by hearsay to confirm all i had said of them and besought me to do my utmost to bring the affair to a speedy conclusion  sir thomas mansfield was a very good man and much respected in his neighborhood he was once possessed of a large estate but his father left him involved in a lawsuit to support his title to more than one half of it  after it had been depending several years it was at last to the deep regret of all who knew him by the ehicanery of the lawyers of the opposite side and the remissness of his own carried against him and his expenses having been very great in supporting for years his possession he found himself reduced from an estate of near three thousand pounds a year to little more than five hundred he had six children four sons and two daughters his eldest son died of grief in two months after the loss of the cause the second now the eldest is a melancholy man the third is a cornet of horse the fourth is unprovided for but all three are men of worthy minds and deserve better fortune  the daughters are remarkable for their piety patience good economy and prudence they are the most dutiful of children and most affectionate of sisters they were for three years the support of their fathers spirits and have always been the consolation of their mother they lost their father about four years ago and it is even edifying to observe how elegantly they support the family reputation in their fine old mansion house by the prudent management of their little income for the matter leaves every household care to them and they make it a rule to conclude the year with discharging every demand that can be made upon them and to commence the new year absolutely clear of the world and with some cash in hand yet were brought up in affluence and to the expectation of handsome fortunes for besides that they could have no thought of losing their cause they had very great and reasonable prospects from mr calvert an uncle by their mothers side who was rich in money and had besides an estate in land of   00 l a year he always declared that for the sake of his sisters children he would continue a single man and kept his word till he was upwards of seventy when being very infirm in health and defective even to dotage in his understanding bolton his steward who had always stood in the way of his inclination to have his eldest niece for his companion and manager at lest contrived to get him married to a young creature under twenty one of the servants in the house who brought him a child in seven months and was with child again at the old mans death which happened in eighteen months after his marriage and then a will was provided in which he gave all he had to his wife and her children born and to be born within a year after his demise this steward and woman now live together as man and wife  a worthy clergyman who hoped it might be in my power to procure them redress either in the one case or in the other gave me the above particulars and upon enquiry finding everything to be as represented i made myself acquainted with the widow lady and her sons and it was impossible to see them at their own house and not respect the daughters for their amiable qualities  i desired them when i was last down to put into my hands their titles deeds and papers which they have done and they have been laid before counsel who gie a very hopeful account of them  being fully authorized by my lord i took leave of him overnight and set out early in the morning directly for mansfieldhouse i arrived there soon after their breakfast was over and was received by lady mansfield her sons who happened to be all at home and her two daughters with politeness  after some general conversation i took lady mansfield aside and making an apology for my freedom asked her if miss mansfield were to her knowledge engaged in her affections  she answered she was sure she was not ah sir said she a man of your observation must know that the daughters of a decayed family of some note in the world do not easily get husbands men of great fortunes look higher men of small must look out for wives to enlarge them and men of genteel businesses are afraid of young women better born than portioned everybody knows not that my girls can bend to their condition and they must be contented to live single all their lives and so they will choose to do rather than not marry creditably and with some prospect  i then opened my mind fully to her she was agreeably surprised but who sir said she would expect such a proposal from the next heir to lord w  i made known to her how much in earnest i was in this proposal as well for my lords sake as for the young ladys i will take care madam said i that miss mansfield if she will consent to make lord w happy shall have very handsome settlements and such an allowance for pinmoney as shall enable her to gratify every moderate every reasonable wish of her heart  was it possible she asked for such an affair to be brought about would my lord  there she stopped  i said i would be answerable for him and desired her to break the matter to her daughter directly  i left lady mansfield and joined the brothers who were with their two sisters and soon after miss mansfield was sent for by her mother  after they had been a little while together my lady mansfield sent to speak with me they were both silent when i came in the mother was at a loss what to say the daughter was in still greater confusion  i addressed myself to the mother you have i perceive madam acquainted miss mansfield with the proposal i made to you i am fully authorized to make it propitious be your silence there never was proceeded i a treaty of marriage set on foot that had not its conveniences and inconveniences my lord is greatly afflicted with the gout there is too great a disparity in years these are the inconveniences which are to be considered of for the lady  on the other hand if miss mansfield can give into the proposal she will be received by my lord as a blessing as one whose acceptance of him will lay him under an obligation to her if this proposal could not have been made with dignity and honor to the lady it had not come from me  the conveniences to yourselves will more properly fall under the consideration of yourselves and family one thing only i will suggest that an alliance with so rich a man as lord w will make perhaps some people tremble who now think themselves secure  but madam to the still silent daughter let not a regard for me bias you your family may be sure of my best services whether my proposal be received or rejected  my lord i must deal sincerely with you has lived a life of error he thinks so himself i am earnest to have him see the difference and to have an opportunity to rejoice with him upon it  i stopped but both being still silent the mother looking on the daughter the dau hter glancing nowandthen her conscious eye on the mother if madam said i you can give your hand to lord w i will take care that settlements shall exceed your expectation what i have observed as well as heard of miss mansfields temper and goodness is the principal motive of my application to her in preference to all the women i know  but permit me to say that were your affections engaged to the lowest honest man on earth i would not wish for your favor to my lord w and farther if madam you think you should have but the shadow of a hope to induce your compliance that my lords death would be more agreeable to you than his life then would i not for your moralitys sake wish you to engage in a word i address myself to you miss mansfield as to a woman of honor and conscience if your conscience bids you doubt reject the proposal and this not only for my lords sake but for your own  consider if without too great a force upon your inclinations you can behave with that condescension and indulgence to a man who has hastened advanced age upon himself which i have thought from your temper i might hope  i have said a great deal because you ladies were silent and because explicitness in every case becomes the proposer give me leave to withdraw for a few moments  i withdrew accordingly to the brothers and sister i did not think i ought to mention to them the proposal i had made it might perhaps have engaged them all in its favor as it was of such evident advantage to the whole family and that might have imposed a difficulty on the lady that neither for her own sake nor my lords it would have been just to lay upon her  lady mansfield came out to me and said i presume sir as we are a family which misfortune as well as love has closely bound together you will allow it to be mentioned   to the whole family madam  by all means i wanted only first to know whether miss mansfields affections were disengaged and now you shall give me leave to attend miss mansfield i am a party for my lord w miss mansfield is a party your debates will be the more free in our absence if i find her averse believe me madam i will not endeavor to persuade her on the contrary if she declare against accepting the proposal i will be her advocate though every one else would vote in its favor  the brothers and sister looked upon one another i left the mother to propose it to them and stepped into the inner parlour to miss mansfield  she was sitting with her back to the door in a meditating posture she started at my entrance  i talked of indifferent subjects in order to divert her from the important one that had taken up her whole attention  it would have been a degree of oppression to her to have entered with her upon a subject of so much consequence to her while we were alone and when her not having given a negative was to be taken as a modest affirmative  lady mansfield soon joined us  my dear daughter said she we are all unanimous we have agreed to leave every thing to sir charles grandison and we hope you will  she was silent i will only ask you madam said i to her if you have any wish to take time to consider of the matter do you think you sh ll be easier in your mind if you take time  she was silent  i will not at this time my good miss mansfield urge you farther i will make my report to lord w and you shall be sure of his joyful approbation of the steps i have taken before your final consent shall be asked for but that i may not be employed in a doubtful cause let me be commissioned to tell my lord that you are disengaged and that you wholly resign yourself to your mothers advice  she bowed her head  and that you madam to lady mansfield are not averse to enter into treaty upon this important subject  averse sir said the mother bowing and gratefully smiling  i will write the particulars of our conversation to lord w and my opinion of settlements and advise him if i am not forbid to make a visit at mansfieldhouse i stopped they were both silent if possible i will attend my lord in his first visit i hope madam to miss mansfield you will not dislike him i am sure he will be charmed with you he is far from being disagreeable in his person his temper is not bad your goodness will make him good i dare say that he will engage your gratitude and i defy a good mind to separate love from gratitude  we returned to company i had all their blessings pronounced at once as from one mouth the melancholy brother was enlivened who knows but the consequence of this alliance may illuminate his mind i could see by the pleasure they all had in beholding him capable of joy on the occasion that they hoped it would the unhappy situation of the family affairs as it broke the heart of the eldest brother fixed a gloom on the temper of this gentleman  i was prevailed upon to dine with them in the conversation we had at and after dinner their minds opened and their characters rose upon me lord w will be charmed with miss mansfield i am delighted to think that my mothers brother will be happy in the latter part of his life with a wife of so much prudence and goodness as i am sure this lady will make him on one instance of her very obliging behavior to me i whispered her sister pray miss fanny tell miss mansfield but not till i am gone that she knows not the inconveniences she is bringing upon herself i may perhaps hereafter have the boldness to look for the same favor from my aunt that i meet with from miss mansfield  if my sister returned she should ever misbehave to her benefactor i will deny my relation to her  i promised to write to lady mansfield as soon as i heard from my lord and parted with them followed by the blessings of them all  you will soon have another letter from me with an account of the success of my visit to sir harry beauchamp and his lady we must have our beauchamp among us my dear friend i should rather say you must among you for i shall not be long in england he will supply to you my dear dr bartlett the absence it will not i hope be a long one of  your charles grandison   sir charles i remember as the doctor read mentions getting leave for his beauchamp to come over who he says will supply his absence to him  but ah lucy who let me have the boldness to ask shall supply it to your harriet time my dear will do nothing for me except i could hear something very much amiss of this man  i have a great suspicion that the first part of the letter enclosed was about me the doctor looked so earnestly at me when he skipt two sides of it and as i thought with so much compassion  to be sure it was about me what would i give to know as much of his mind as dr bartlett knows if i thought he pitied the poor harriet  i should scorn myself i am i will be above his pity lucy in this believe  your harriet byron  letter iii miss byron in continuation sunday night april   dr bartlett has received from sir charles an account of what passed last friday between him and sir harry and lady beauchamp by the doctors allowance i enclose it to you  in this letter lucy you will see him in a new light and as a man whom there is no resisting when he resolves to carry a point but it absolutely convinces me of what indeed i before suspected that he has not an high opinion of our sex in general and this i will put down as a blot in his character he treats us in lady beauchamp as perverse humoursome babies loving power yet not knowing how to use it see him so delicate in his behavior and address to miss mansfield and carry in your thoughts his gaiety and adroit management to lady beauchamp as in this letter and you will hardly think him the same man could he be anything to me i should be more than half afraid of him yet this may be said in his behalf  he but accommodates himself to the persons he has to deal with  he can be a man of gay wit when he pleases to descend as indeed his sister charlotte has as often found as she has given occasion for the exercise of that talent in him  and that virtue for its own sake is his choice since had he been a freeliver he would have been a dangerous man but i will not anticipate too much read it here if you please  letter iv sir charles grandison to dr bartlett inclosed in the preceding  grandisonhall friday night march    i arrived at sir harry beauchamps about twelve this day he and his lady expected me from the letter which i wrote and showed you before i left the town in which you know i acquainted sir harry with his sons earnest desire to throw himself at his feet and to pay his duty to his mother in england and engaged to call myself either this day or tomorrow for an answer  sir harry received me with great civility and even affection lady beauchamp said he will be with us in a moment i am afraid you will not meet with all the civility from her on the errand you are come upon that a man of sir charles grandisons character deserves to meet with from all the world we have been unhappy together ever since we had your letter i long to see my son your friendship for him establishes him in my heart but  and then he cursed the apronstring tenure by which he said he held his peace  you will allow me sir harry said i to address myself in my own way to my lady you give me pleasure in letting me know that the difficulty is not with you you have indeed sir one of the most prudent young men in the world for your son his heart is in your hand you may form it as you please  she is coming she is coming interrupted he we are all in pieces we were in the midst of a feud when you arrived if she is not civil to    in swam the lady her complexion raised displeasure in her looks to me and indignation in her air to sir harry as if they had not had their contention out and she was ready to renew it  with as obliging an air as i could assume i paid my compliments to her she received them with great stiffness swelling at sir harry who sidled to the door in a moody and sullen manner and then slipped out  you are sir charles grandison i suppose sir said she i never saw you before i have heard much talk of you  but pray sir are good men always officious men cannot they perform the obligations of friendship without discomposing families  you see me now madam in an evil moment if you are displeased with me but i am not used to the displeasure of ladies i do my utmost not to deserve it and let me tell you madam that i will not suffer you to be displeased with me  i took her halfreluctant hand and led her to a chair and seated myself in another near her  i see sir you have your arts  she took the firescreen that hung by the side of the chimney and held it before her face now glancing at me now turning away her eye as resolved to be displeased  you come upon a hateful errand sir i have been unhappy ever since your officious letter came  i am sorry for it madam while you are warm with the remembrance of a past misunderstanding i will not offer to reason with you but let me madam see less discomposure in your looks i want to take my impressions of you from more placid features i am a painter madam i love to draw ladys pictures will you have this pass for a first sitting  she knew not what to do with her anger she was loath to part with it  you are impertinent sir charles  excuse me  you are impertinent   i do excuse you lady beauchamp and the rather as i am sure you do not think me so your freedom is a mark of your favor and i thank you for it  you treat me as a child sir   i treat all angry people as children i love to humor them indeed lady beauchamp you must not be angry with me can i be mistaken dont i see in your aspect the woman of sense and reason  i never blame a lady for her humoursomeness so much as in my mind i blame her mother  sir said she i smiled she bit her lip to avoid returning a smile  her character my dear friend is not you know that of an illtemperd woman though haughty and a lover of power  i have heard much of you sir charles grandison but i am quite mistaken in you i expected to see a grave formal young man his prim mouth set in plaits but you are a joker and a free man a very free man i do assure you  i would be thought decently free madam but not impertinent i see with pleasure a returning smile o that ladies knew how much smiles become their features  very few causes can justify a womans anger  your sex madam was given to delight not to torment us  torment you sir pray has sir harry   sir harry cannot look pleased when his lady is displeased i saw that you were madam the moment i beheld you i hope i am not an un welcome visitor to sir harry for one hour i intend to stay no longer that he received me with so disturbed a countenance and has now withdrawn himself as if to avoid me  to tell you the truth sir harry and i have had a dispute but he always speaks of sir charles grandison with pleasure  is he not offended with me madam for the contents of the letter   no sir and i suppose you hardly think he is  but i am   dear madam let me beg your interest in favor of the contents of it  she took fire  rose up   i besought her patience  why should you wish to keep abroad a young man who is a credit to his family and who ought to be if he is not the joy of his father let him owe to your generosity madam that recall which he sollicits it will become your character he cannot be always kept abroad be it your own generous work   what sir  pray sir  with an angry brow   you must not be angry with me madam  i took her hand  you cannot be angry in earnest   sir charles grandison  you are  she withdrew her hand you are repeated she  and seemed ready to call names   i am the grandison you call me and i honor the maternal character you must permit me to honor you madam  i wonder sir   i will not be denied the world reports misunderstandings between you and mr beauchamp that busy world that will be meddling knows your power and his dependence you must not let it charge you with an ill use of that power if you do you will have its blame when you might have its praise he will have its pity  what sir do you think your fine letters and smooth words will avail in favor of a young fellow who has treated me with disrespect  you are misinformed madam  i am willing to have a greater dependence upon your justice upon your good nature than upon anything i can urge either by letter or speech dont let it be said that you are not to be prevailed on  a woman not to be prevailed on to join in an act of justice of kindness for the honor of the sex let it not be said  honor of the sex sir  fine talking  dont i know that were i to consent to hs comi g over the first thing would be to have his annuity augmented out of my fortune he and his father would be in a party against me am i not already a sufferer through him in his fathers love  you dont know sir what has passed between sir harry and me within this halfhour  but dont talk to me i will not hear of it the young man hates me i hate him and ever will  she made a motion to go  with a respectful air i told her she must not leave me my motive deserved not i said that both she and sir harry should leave me in displeasure  you know but too well resumed she how acceptable your officiousness i must call it so is to sir harry  and does sir harry madam favor his sons suit you rejoice me let not mr beauchamp know that he does and do you my dear lady beauchamp take the whole merit of it to yourself how will he revere you for your goodness to him and what an obligation if as you say sir harry is inclined to favor him will you by your generous first motion lay upon sir harry  obligation upon sir harry yes sir charles grandison i have laid too many obligations already upon him for his gratitude  lay this one more you own you have had a misunderstanding this morning sir harry is withdrawn i suppose with his heart full let me i beseech you make up the misunderstanding i have been happy in this way  thus we will order it  we will desire him to walk in i will beg your interest with him in favor of the contents of the letter i sent his compliance will follow as an act of obligingness to you the grace of the action will be yours i will be answerable for mr beauchamps gratitude  dear madam hesitate not the young gentleman must come over one day let the favor of its being an early one be owing entirely to you  you are a strange man sir i dont like you at all you would persuade me out of my reason  let us madam as mr beauchamp and i are already the dearest of friends begin a family understanding let st jamess square and berkley square when you come to town be a nextdoor neighborhood give me the consideration of being the bondsman for the duty of mr beauchamp to you as well as to his father  she was silent but looked vexed and irresolute  my sisters madam are amiable women you will be pleased with them lord l is a man worthy of sir harrys acquaintance we shall want nothing if you would think so but mr beauchamps presence among us  what i suppose you design your maiden sister for the young fellow  but if you do sir you must ask me for  there she stopped  indeed i do not he is not at present disposed to marry he never will without his fathers approbation and let me say  yours my sister is addressed to by lord g and i hope will soon be married to him  and do you say so sir charles grandison  why then you are a more disinterested man than i thought you in this application to sir harry i had no doubt but the young fellow was to be brought over to marry miss grandison and that he was to be made worthy of her at my expense  she enjoyed as it seemed by her manner of pronouncing the words young fellow that designed contempt which was a tacit confession of the consequence he once was of to her  i do assure you madam that i know not his heart if he has at present any thoughts of marriage  she seemed pleased at this assurance  i repeated my wishes that she would take to herself the merit of allowing mr beauchamp to return to his native country and that she would let me see her hand in sir harrys before i left them  and pray sir as to his place of residence were he to come do you think he should live under the same roof with me  you shall govern that point madam as you approve or disapprove of his behavior to you  his behavior to me sir  one house cannot shall not hold him and me  i think madam that you should direct in this article i hope after a little while so to order my affairs as constantly to reside in england i should think myself very happy if i could prevail upon mr beauchamp to live with me  but i must see him i suppose  not madam unless you shall think it right for the sake of the worlds opinion that you should  i cannot consent   you can madam you do  i cannot allow lady beauchamp to be one of those women who having insisted upon a wrong point can be convinced yet not know how to recede with a grace  be so kind to yourself as to let sir harry know that you think it right for mr beauchamp to return but that it must be upon your own conditions then madam make those conditions generous ones and how will sir harry adore you how will mr beauchamp revere you how shall i esteem you  what a strange impertinent have i before me  i love to be called names by a lady if undeservedly she lays herself by them under obligation to me which she cannot be generous if she resolves not to repay shall i endeavor to find out sir harry or will you madam  was you ever sir charles grandison denied by any woman to whom you sued for favor  i think madam i hardly ever was but it was because i never sued for a favor that it was not for a ladys honor to grant this is the case now and this makes me determine that i will not be denied the grant of my present request come come madam how can a woman of your ladyships good sense taking her hand and leading her to the door seem to want to be persuaded to do a thing she knows in her heart to be right let us find sir harry  strange man  unhand me  he has used me unkindly   overcome him then by your generosity but dear lady beauchamp taking both her hands and smiling confidently in her face i could my dear dr bartlett do so to lady beauchamp will you make me believe that a woman of your spirit you have a charming spirit lady beacuhamp did not give sir harry as much reason to complain as he gave you  i am sure by his disturbed countenance   now sir charles grandison you are downright affronting unhand me   this misunderstanding is owing to my officious letter i should have waited on you in person i should from the first have put it in your power to do a graceful and obliging thing i ask your pardon i am not used to make differences between man and wife  i touched first one hand then the other of the perverse baby with my lips  now am i forgiven now is my friend beauchamp permitted to return to his native country now are sir harry and his lady reconciled  come come madam it must be so  what foolish things are the quarrels of married people  they must come to an agreement again and the sooner the better before hard blows are struck that will leave marks  let us dear madam find out sir harry   and then with an air of vivacity that women whether in courtship or out of it dislike not i was leading her once more to the door and as i intended to sir harry where ever he could be found  hold hold sir resisting but with features far more placid than she had suffered to be before visible  if i must be compelled  you are a strange man sir charles grandison  if i must be compelled to see sir harry  but you are a strange man  and she rang the bell  lady beauchamp dr bartlett is one of those who would be more ready to forgive an innocent freedom than to be gratified by a profound respect otherwise i had not treated her with so little ceremony such women are formidable only to those who are afraid of their anger or who make it a serious thing  but when the servant appeared she not knowing how to condescend i said go to your master sir and tell him that your lady requests the favor  requests the favor repeated she but in a low voice which was no bad sign  the servant went with a message worded with more civility than perhaps he was used to carry to his master from his lady  now dear lady beauchamp for your own sake for sir harrys sake make happy and be happy are there not dear madam unhappinesses enough in life that we must wilfully add to them  sir harry came in fight he stalked toward us with a parade like that of a young officer wanting to look martial at the head of his company  could i have seen him before he entered my work would have been easier but his hostile air disposed my lady to renew hostilities  she turned her face aside then her person and the cloudy indignation with which she entered at first again overspread her features ought wrath dr bartlett to be so ready to attend a female will  surely thought i my ladys present airs after what has passed between her and me can be only owing to the fear of making a precedent and being thought too easily persuaded  sir harry said i addressing myself to him i have obtained lady beauchamps pardon for the officious letter   pardon sir charles grandison you are a good man and it was kindly intended   he was going on anger from his eyes flashed upon his cheekbones and made them shine my ladys eyes struck fire at sir harry and showed that she was not afraid of him  better intended than done interrupted i since my lady tells me that it was the occasion of a misunderstanding  but sir all will be right my lady assures me that you are not disinclined to comply with the contents and she has the goodness   pray sir charles interrupted the lady   to give me hopes that she   pray sir charles   will use her interest to confirm you in your favorable sentiments   sir harry cleared up at once  may i hope madam  and offered to take her hand  she withdrew it with an air o dr bartlett i must have been thought an unpolite husband had she been my wife  i took her hand excuse this freedom sir harry  for heavens sake madam whispering do what i know you will do with a grace  shall there be a misunderstanding and the husband court a refused hand  i then forced her half unwillig hand into his with an air that i intended should have both freedom and respect in it  what a man have we got here sir harry this cannot be the modest man that you have praised to me  i thought a good man must of necessity be bashful if not sheepish and here your visitor is the boldest man in england  the righteous lady beauchamp said sir harry with an aspect but half conceding is hold as a lion  and must i be compelled thus and by such a man to forgive you sir harry  indeed you were very unkind  and you lady beauchamp were very cruel  i did not think sir when i laid my fortune at your feet   o lady beauchamp you said cutting things very cutting things  and did not you sir harry say it should be so  so very peremptorily  not madam till you as peremptorily   a little recrimination thought i there must be to keep each in countenance on their past folly  ah sir charles  you may rejoice that you are not married said sir harry  dear sir harry said i we must bear with ladies they are meek good creatures  they   meek sir charles repeated sir harry with an halfangry smile and shrugging as if his shoulder had been hurt with his wifes meekness  i say meek  now sir charles grandison said my lady with an air of threatening   i was desirous either of turning the ladys displeasure into a jest or of diverting it from the first object in order to make her play with it till she had lost it  women are of gentle natures pursued i and being accustomed to be humoured opposition sits not easy upon them are they not kind to us sir harry when they allow of our superiority by expecting us to bear with their pretty perversenesses  o sir charles grandison said my lady both her hands lifted up  let us be contented proceeded i with such their kind acknowlegements and in pity to them and in compliment to ourselves bear with their foibles  see n adam i ever was an advocate for the ladies  sir charles i have no patience with you   what can a poor woman do continued i when opposed she can only be a little violent in words and when she has said as much as she chooses to say be perhaps a little sullen for my part were i so happy as to call a woman mine and she happened to be in the wrong i would endeavor to be in the right and trust to her good sense to recover her temper arguments only beget arguments  those reconciliations are the most durable in which the lady makes the advances  what doctrine is this sir charles you are not the man i took you for  i believe in my conscience that you are not near so good a man as the world reports you  what madam because i pretend to know a little of the sex surely lady beauchamp a man of common penetration may see to the bottom of a womans heart a cunning woman cannot hide it a good woman will not you are not madam such mysteries as some of us think you whenever you know your own minds we need not be long doubtful that is all the difficulty and i will vindicate you as to that   as how pray sir   women madam were designed to be dependent as well as gentle creatures and of consequence when left to their own wills they know not what to resolve upon  i was hoping sir charles just now that you would stay to dinner but if you talk at this rate i believe i shall be ready to wish you out of the house  sir harry looked as if he were halfwilling to be diverted at what passed between his lady and me it was better for me to say what he could not but subscribe to by his feeling than for him to say it though reproof seldom amends a determined spirit such a one as this ladys yet a man who suffers by it cannot but have some joy when he hears his sentiments spoken by a bystander this freedom of mine seemed to save the married pair a good deal of recrimination  you remind me madam that i must be gone rising and looking at my watch  you must not leave us sir charles said sir harry  i beg excuse sir harry  yours also madam smiling  lady beauchamp must not twice wish me out of the house  i will not excuse you sir replied she  if you have a desire to see the matter completed  she stopped  you must stay to dinner be that as it will  be that as it will madam  you shall not recede  recede i have not yet complied   o these women they are so used to courtship that they know not how to do right things without it  and pardon me madam not always with it  bold man  have i consented   have you not madam given a ladys consent that we men expect not to be very explicit very gracious  it is from such non negative consents that we men make silence answer all we wish  i leave sir charles grandison to manage this point said sir harry in my conscience i think the common observation just a standerby sees more of the game than he that plays  it ever will be so sir harry  but i will tell you my lady and i have as good as agreed the matter   i have agreed to nothing sir harry   hush madam  i am doing you credit  lady beauchamp speaks aside sometimes sir harry you are not to hear anything she says that you dont like  then i am afraid i must stop my ears for eight hours out of twelve  that was aside lady beauchamp  you are not to hear that  to sit like a fool and hear myself abused  a pretty figure i make sir charles grandison let me tell you that you are the first man that ever treated me like a fool  excuse madam a little innocent raillery  i met you both with a discomposure on your countenances i was the occasion of it by the letter i sent to sir harry i will not leave you discomposed i think you a woman of sense and my request is of such a nature that the granting of it will confirm to me that you are so  but you have granted it   i have not  that is charmingly said  my lady will not undervalue the compliment she is inclined to make you sir harry the moment you ask for her compliance she will not refuse to your affection what she makes a difficulty to grant to the entreaty of an almost stanger  let it let it be so lady beauchamp said sir harry and he clasped his arms about her as she sat   there never was such a man as this sir charles grandison in the world  it is a contrivance between you sir harry   dear lady beauchamp resumed i depreciate not your compliment to sir harry there wanted not contrivance i dare to hope if there did it had it not to induce lady beauchamp to do a right a kind an obliging thing  let me my dearest lady beauchamp said sir harry  let me request   at your request sir harry  but not at sir charless  this is noble said i i thank you madam for the absent youth both husband and son will think themselves favored by you and the more as i am sure that you will by the cheerful welcome which you will give the young man show that it is a sincere compliment that you have made to sir harry  this man has a strange way of flattering one into acts of  of  what shall i call them  but sir harry mr beauchamp must not i believe live with us   sir harry hesitated  i was afraid of opening the wound i have a request to make to you both said i it is this that mr beauchamp may be permitted to live with me and attend you madam and his father as a visitor at your own command my sister i believe will be very soon married to lord g  that is to be certainly so interrupted the lady  it is madam  but what shall we say my dear resumed sir harry  dont fly out again  as to the provision for my son  two hundred a year  what is two hundred a year   why then let it be three answered she  i have an handsome and improveable estate said i i have no demands but those of reason upon me i would not offer a plea for his coming to england and i am sure he would not have come if i had without his fathers consent in which madam he hoped for yours you shall not sir allow him either the two or three hundred a year see him with love with indulgence he will deserve both and think not of any thing else for my beauchamp  there is no bearing this my dear said sir harry leaning upon his ladys shoulder as be sat tears in his eyes  my son is already as i have heard greatly obliged to this his true friend  do you do you madam answer for me and for yourself  she was overcome yet pride had its share with generosity you are said she the grandison i have heard of but i will not be under obligations to you  not pecuniary ones however no sir harry recall your son i will trust to your love do for him what you please let him be independent on this insolent man she said this with a smile that made it obligeing and if we are to be visitors friends neighbors let it be on an equal foot and let him have nothing to reproach us with  i was agreeably surprised at this emanation shall i call it of goodness she is really not a bad woman but a perverse one in short one of those whose passions when rightly touched are liable to sudden and surprising turn   generous charming lady beauchamp said i now are you the woman whom i have so often heard praised for many good qualities now will the portrait be a just one  sir harry was in raptures but had like to have spoiled all by making me a compliment on the force of example  be this said i the result  mr beauchamp comes over he will be pleased with whatever you do at your feet madam he shall acknowledge your favor my home shall be his if you permit it on me he shall confer obligations from you he shall receive them if any considerations of family prudence there are such and very just ones restrain you from allowing him at present what your generosity would wish to do   lady beauchamps color was heightened she interrupted me  we are not sir charles so scanty in our fortune   well my dear lady beauchamp be all that as you will not one retrospect of the past   yes sir charles but there shall his allowance has been lessened for some years not from considerations of family prudence  but  well it is all at an end proceeded she  when the young man returns you sir harry for my sake and for the sake of this strange anaccountable creature shall pay him the whole arrear  now my dear lady beauchamp said i lifting her hand to my lips permit me to give you joy all doubts and misgivings so triumphantly got over so solid a foundation laid for family harmony  what was the moment of your nuptials to this sir harry i congratulate you you may and i believe you have been as happy as most men but now you will be still happier  indeed sir harry said she you provoked me in the morning i should not else   sir harry owned himself to blame and thus the ladys pride was set down softly  she desired sir harry to write before the day concluded the invitation of return to mr beauchamp and to do her all the credit in it that she might claim from the last part of the conversation but not to mention anything of the first  she afterward abated a little of this right spirit by saying i think sir harry you need not mention anything of the arrears as i may call them  but only the future  00 l a year one would surprise him a little you know and be twice thanked   surprises of such a nature as this my dear dr bartlett pecuniary surprises  i dont love them  they are double taxes upon the gratitude of a worthy heart is it not enough for a generous mind to labor under a sense of obligation  pride vainglory must be the motive of such narrowminded benefactors a truly beneficent spirit cannot take delight in beholding the quivering lip indicating the palpitating heart in seeing the downcast countenance the uplifted hands and working muscles of a fellow creature who but for unfortunate accidents would perhaps himself have had the will with the power of showing a more graceful benevolence  i was so much afraid of hearing farther abatements of lady beauchamps goodness so willing to depart with favorable impressions of her for her own sake and at the same time so desirous to reach the hall that night that i got myself excused though with difficulty staying to dine and accepting of a dish of chocolate i parted with sir harry and my lady both in equal good humor with themselves and me  could you have thought my dear friend that i should have succeeded so very happily as i have done in this affair and at one meeting  i think that the father and stepmother should have the full merit with our beauchamp of a turn so unexpected let him not therefore ever see this letter that he may take his impression of the favor done him from that which sir harry will write to him  my cousin grandison whom i hoped to find here left the hall on tuesday last though he knew of my intention to be down i am sorry for it poor everard he has been a great while pretty good i am afraid he will get among his old acquaintance and then we shall not hear of him for some months perhaps if you see him in town try to engage him till i return i should be glad of his company to paris if his going with me will keep him out of harms way as it is called  saturday april   i have had compliments sent me by many of my neighbors who had hoped i was come to reside among them they professed themselves disappointed on my acquainting them that i must go up early on monday morning i have invited myself to their saturday assembly at the bowling greenhouse  our reverend friend mr dobson has been so good as to leave with me the sermon he is to preach tomorrow on the opening of the church it is a very good discourse i have only exceptions to three or four compliments he makes to the patron in as many different places of it i doubt not but he will have the goodness to omit them  i have already looked into all that has been done in the church and all that is doing in the house and gardens when both have had the direction and inspection of my dear dr bartlett need i say that nothing could have been better  halden is just arrived from my lord with a letter which has enabled me to write to lady mansfield his lordships high approbation of all our proceedings and that he intends some one early day in next week to pay to her and miss mansfield his personal compliments  he has left to me the article of settlements declaring that his regard for my future interest is all that he wishes may be attended to  i have therefore written as from himself that he proposes a jointure of   00 l a year penyrents and  00 guineas a year for her private purse and that his lordship desires that miss mansfield will make a present to her sister of whatever she may be entitled to in her own right something was mentioned to me at mansfieldhouse of a thousand pounds left to her by a godmother  halden being very desirous to see his future lady i shall at his request send the letter i have written to lady mansfield by him early in the morning with a line recommending him to the notice of that lady as lord ws principal steward  adieu my dear dr bartlett i have joy in the joy of all these good people if providence graciously makes me instrumental to it i look upon myself but as its instrument i hope ostentation has no share in what draws on me more thanks and praises than i love to hear  lord w has a right to be made happy by his next relation if his next relation can make him so is he not my mothers brother would not her enlarged soul have rejoiced on the occasion and blessed her son for an instance of duty to her paid by his disinterested regard for her brother who my dear dr bartlett is so happy yet who in some cases so unhappy as  your charles grandison   letter v miss byron to miss selby monday april   the countess of d and the earl her son have but just left us the countess sent last night to let my cousin reeves know of their intended morning visit and they came together as the visit was made to my cousin i did not think myself obliged to be in waiting for them below i was therefore in my closet comforting myself with my own agreeable reflections they were there a quarter of an hour before i was sent to  their talk was of me i am used to recite my own praises you know and what signifies making a parade of apologies for continuing the use i dont value myself so much as i once did on peoples favorable opinions if i had a heart in my own keeping i should be glad it was thought a good one that is all yet though it has littlenesses in it that i knew nothing of formerly i hope it is not a bad one  my lord d by the whole turn of the partial conversation was led to expect a very extraordinary young woman the lady declared that she would have her talk out and hear all my two cousins were inclined to say of me before i was sent up to as i was not below when they came  i was therefore to be seen only as a subject of curiosity my lord had declared it seems that he would not be denied an introduction to me by his mother but there were no thoughts of making any application to a girl whose heart was acknowleged not to be her own my lords honor would not allow of such an intention nor ought it  his impatience however hastened the message to me the countess met me halfway and embraced me my lovely girl how do you  my lord said she turning to the earl i need not say this is miss byron  he bowed low and made me a very high compliment but it had sense in it though high and above my merits girls writing of themselves on these occasions must be disclaimers you know but my dear uncle what care i now for compliments the man from whose mouth only they could be acceptable is not at liberty to make me any  the countess engaged me in an easy general conversat on part of which turned upon lord and lady l miss grandison and miss jervois and how i had passed my time at colnebrooke in this wintry season when there were so many diversions in town but said she you had a man with you who is the admiration of every man and woman where ever he goes  is there no making an acquaintance said my lord with sir charles grandison what i hear said of him every time he is mentioned in company is enough to fire a young man with emulation i should be happy did i deserve to be thought of as a second or third man to sir charles grandison  i dare say returned i your lordships acquaintance would be highly acceptable to him he is easy of access men of rank if men of merit must be of kindred and recognize one another the moment they meet but sir charles will soon leave england  the fool sighed it was you may believe involuntarily i felt myself blush and was the more silly for that  the countess took my hand  one word with you my dear  and led me out into the next room and sitting down made me sit on the same settee with her  o that i could call you daughter began she at once and turning half round to me put one arm about me with her other hand taking one of mine and earnestly looking in my downcast face  i was silent  ah lucy had lady d been the mother of sir charles grandison with what pleasure could i have listened to her  you said my dear that sir charles grandison will soon leave england and then you sighed  will you be quite openhearted  may i ask you a question in hope that you will  i was silent yet the word yes was on my lips  you have caused it to be told me that your affections are engaged this has been a cruel blow upon us my lord nevertheless has heard so much of you he is real a good young man my dear that against my advice i own he would have me introduce him into your company i see by his looks that he could admire you above all women he never was in love i should be sorry if he were disappointed in his first love i hope his promised prudence will be his guard if there be no prospect of his succeeding with you  she paused  i was still silent   it will be a mark of your frankness of heart my dear if when you take my full meaning you prevent me speaking more than i need i would not oppress you my sweet love  such a delicacy and such a frankness mingled have i never seen in young woman  but tell me my dear has sir charles grandison made his addresses to you  it was a grievous question for me to answer  but why was it so my lucy when all the hopes i ever had proceeded from my own presumption confirmed that is true of late by his sisters partiality in my favor and when his unhappy clementina has such a a preferable claim  what says miss byron  she says madam that she reveres lady d and will answer any questions that she puts to her however affecting  sir charles grandison has not  once i thought proceeded she that i never would make a second motion were the woman a princess who had confessed a prior love or even liking but the man is sir charles grandison whom all women must esteem and the woman is miss byron whom all men must love let me ask you my dear  have you any expectation that the first of men i will call him so and the loveliest and most amiableminded of women can come together  you sighed you know when you mentioned that sir charles was soon to leave england and you own that he has not made addresses to you  dont be uneasy my love  we women in these tender cases see into each others hearts from small openings  look upon me as your mother  what say you love  your ladyship compliments me with delicacy and frankness  it is too hard a question if i have any of the first to answer without blushes a young woman to be supposed to have an esteem for a man who has made no declarations and whose behavior to her is such only as shows a politeness to which he is accustomed and only the same kind of tenderness as he shows to his sister  and whom sometimes he calls sister  as if  ah madam how can one answer  you have answered my dear and with that delicacy and frankness too which make a principal part of your character if my son and he shall not be encouraged in his hopes if he sees you not mind as well as person with his mothers eyes should not be able to check himself by the apprehensions he has had reason for of being but a second man in the favor of the object of his wishes we my dear have our delicacies could you not allow him a second place in your favor that might in time as he should merit and as you should subdue your prepossessions give him a first  hush  my dear for one moment  your honor your piety are my just dependence and will be his  and now speak it is to me my dear speak your whole heart let not any apprehended difficulty  i am a woman as well as you and prepared to indulge   your goodness madam and nothing else interrupted i gives me difficulty  my lord d seems to me to be a man of merit and not a disagreeable man in his person and manners what he said of sir charles grandison and of his emulation being fired by his example gave him additional merit with me he must have a good mind i wish him acquainted with sir charles for his own sake and for the sake of the world which might be benefited by his large power so happily directed  but as to myself i should forfeit the character of frankness of heart which your ladyships goodness ascribes to me if i did not declare that although i cannot and i think ought not to entertain an hope with regard to sir charles grandison since there is a lady who deserved him by severe sufferings before i knew him yet is my heart so wholly attached that i cannot think it just to give the least encouragement to any other proposal  you are an excellent young woman but my dear if charles grandison is engaged  your mind will it must change few women marry their first loves your heart   o madam it is already a wedded heart it is wedded to his merits his merits will be always the object of my esteem i can never think of any other as i ought to think of the man to whom i give my hand  like merits my dear as person is not the principal motive may produce like attachments my lord d will be in your hands another sir charles grandison  how good you are my dear lady d but allow me to repeat as the strongest expression i can use because i mean it to carry in it all the force that can be given it that my heart is already a wedded heart  you have spoken with great force god bless you my dear as i love you the matter shall take its course if my lord should happen to be a single man some time hence and i can tell you that your excellencies will make our choice difficult and if your mind from any accident or from persuasion of friends should then have received alteration you may still be happy in each other i will therefore only thank you for that openness of heart which must set free the heart of my son  had you had the least lurking inclination to coquetry and could have taken pride in conquests he might have been an undone man  we will return to the company  but spare him my dear you must not talk much he will love you if you do too fervently for his own peace try to be a little awkward  i am afraid for him indeed i am o that you had never seen sir charles grandison  i could not answer one word she took my hand and led me into the company  had i been silent when my lord directed his discourse to me or answered only no or yes the countess would have thought me very vain and that i ascribed to myself the consequence she so generously gave me with respect to my lord i therefore behaved and answered unaffectedly but avoided such a promptness of speech as would have looked like making pretensions to knowledge and opinion though some of my lords questions were apparently designed to engage me into freedom of discourse the countess observed me narrowly she whispered to me that she did and made me a very high compliment on my behavior how much lucy do i love and reverence her  my lord was spoken too slightly of by miss grandison in a former conversation he is really a fine gentleman any woman who is not engaged in her affections may think herself very happy with him his conversation was easy and polite and he said nothing that was low or trifling indeed lucy i think mr greville and mr fenwick are as greatly inferior to lord d as lord d is to sir charles grandison  at parting he requested of me to be allowed to repeat his visits  my lord said the countess before i could answer you must not expect a mere stiff maiden answer from miss byron she is above all vulgar forms she and her cousins have too much politeness and i will venture to say discernment not to be glad of your acquaintance as an acquaintance  but for the rest you must look to your heart  i shall be afraid said he turning to the countess to ask your lordship for an explanation miss byron i hope sir addressing himself to mr reeves will not refuse me her company when i pay you my compliments then turning to me i hope madam i shall not be punished for admiring you  my lord d replied i will be entitled to every civility i had said more had he not snatched my hand a little too eagerly and kissed it  and thus much for the visit of the countess of d and the earl  did i tell you in my former letter that emily is with me half her time she is a most engaging young creature her manners are so pure her heart is so sincere and open  o lucy you would dearly love her i wish i may be asked to carry her down with me yet she adores her guardian but her reverence for him will not allow of the innocent familiarity in thinking of him that  i dont know what i would say but to love with an ardor that would be dangerous to ones peace one must have more tenderness than reverence for the object dont you think so lucy  miss grandison made me one of her flying visits as she calls them soon after the countess and my lord went away  mr and mrs reeves told her all that had been said before them by the earl and countess as well before i went down to them as after they could not tell her what passed between that lady and me when she took me aside i had not had time to tell them they referred to me for that but besides that i was not in spirits and cared not to say much i was not willing to be thought by my refusal of so great an offer to seem to fasten myself upon her brother  she pitied who but must lady clementina she pitied her brother also and seeing me dejected she clasped her arms about me and wet my cheek with a sisterly tear  is it not very strange lucy that his father should keep him so long abroad these freeliving men what absurdities are they not guilty of what misfortunes to others do they not occasion one might with the excellent clementina ask what had mr grandison to do in italy or why if he must go abroad did he stay so long  traveling young men traveling i cannot my dear but think it a very nonsensical thing what can they see but the ruins of the gay once busy world of which they have read  to see a parcel of giddy boys under the direction of tutors or governors hunting after  what  nothing or at best but ruins of ruins for the imagination aided by reflection must be lest after all to make out the greater glories which the gravedigger time has buried too deep for discovery  and when this grand tour is completed the traveled youth returns and what is his boast why to be able to tell perhaps his bettertaught friend who has never been out of his native country that he has seen in ruins what the other has a juster idea of from reading and of which it is more than probable he can give a much better account than the traveiler  and are these petulant harriet methinks lucy you demand all the benefits that you will suppose sir charles grandison has reaped from his traveling  why no but then in turn i ask is every traveller a sir charles grandison  and does not even he confess to dr bartlett that he wished he had never seen italy and may not the poor clementina and all her family for her sake wish he never had  if an opportunity offers i dont know but i may ask sir charles whether in his conscience he thinks that taking in every consideration relating to time expense risques of life health morals this part of the fashionable education of youth of condition is such an indispensable one as some seem to suppose it if sir charles grandison give it not in favor of traveling i believe it will be concluded that six parts out of eight of the little masters who are sent abroad for improvement might as well be kept at home if especially they would be orderly and let their fathers and mothers know what to do with them  o my uncle i am afraid of you but spare the poor girl she acknowleges her petulance her presumption the occasion you know and will pity her for it however neither petulance nor presumption shall make her declare as her sentiments what really are not so in her unprejudiced hours and she hopes to have her heart always open to conviction  for the present adieu my lucy p s dr bartlett tells me that mr beauchamp is at calais waiting the pleasure of his father and that sir harry has sent express for him as at his ladys motion    letter vi miss byron in continuation tuesday april   sir charles grandison came to town last night he was so polite as to send to enquire after my health and to let mr reeves know that he would do himself the honor as he called it of breakfasting with him this morning very ceremonious either for his own sake or for mine  perhaps for both  so i am in expectation of seeing within this halfhour the noble clementinas future  ah lucy  the compliment you see is to mr reeves  shall i stay above and see if he will ask for me he owes me something for the emotion he gave me in lord ls library very little of him since have i seen  honor forbids me said he then yet honor bids me  but i cannot be ungenerous selfish  these words are still in my ear  what could he mean by them  honor forbids me  what to explain himself he had been telling me a tender tale he had ended it what did honor forbid him to do  yet honor bids me why then did he not follow the dictates of honor  but i cannot be unjust  to clementina he means who wished him to be so  unjust i hope not it is a diminution to your glory sir charles grandison to have the word unjust in this way of speaking in your thoughts as if a good man had lain under a temptation to be unjust and had but just recollected himself  i cannot be ungenerous to the noble lady i suppose he must take compassion on her and did he think himself under an obligation to my forwardness to make this declaration to me as to one who wished him to be ungenerous to such a lady for my sake  i cannot bear the thought of this is it not as if he had said fond harriet i see what you expect from me  but i must have compassion for i cannot be ungenerous to clementina  but what a poor word is compassion noble clementina i grieve for you though the man be indeed a generous man  o defend me my better genius from wanting the compassion even of a sir charles grandison  but what means he by the word selfish he cannot be selfish  i comprehend not the meaning of this word  clementina has a very high fortune  harriet but a very middling one he cannot be unjust ungenerous to clementina  nor yet selfish  this word confounds me from a man that says nothing at random  well but breakfasttime is come while i am busy in selfdebatings i will go down that i may not seem to affect parade i will endeavor to see with indifference him that we have all been admiring and studying for this last fortnight in such a variety of lights the christian the hero the friend  ah lucy the lover of clementina the generous kinsman of lord w the modest and delicate benefactor of the mansfields the free gay raillier of lady beauchamp and in her of all our sexs foibles  but he is come while i am prating to you with my pen he is come  why lucy would you detain me now must the fool go down in a kind of hurry yet stay till she is sent for  and that is now  letter vii miss byron in continuation o lucy i have such a conversation to relate to you  but let me lead to it  sir charles met me at the opening of the door he was all himself such an unaffected modesty and politeness yet such an ease and freedom  i thought by his address that he would have taken my hand and both hands were so emulatively passive  how does he manage it to be so free in a first address yet so respectful that a princess could not blame him  after breakfast my cousins being sent for out to attend sir john allestree and his niece sir charles and i were left alone and then with an air equally solemn and free he addressed himself to me  the last time i had the honor of being alone with my good miss byron i told her a very tender tale i was sure it would raise in such a heart as hers generous compassion for the noblest lady on the continent and i presumed as my difficulties were not owing either to rashness or indiscretion that she would also pity the relator  the story did indeed affect you yet for my own sake as well as yours i referred you to dr bartlett for the particulars of some parts of it upon which i could not expatiate  the doctor madam has let me know the particulars which he communicated to you i remember with pain the pain i gave to your generous heart in lord ls study i am sure you must have suffered still more from the same compassionate goodness on the communications he made you may i madam however add a few particulars to the same subject which he then could not give you now you have been let into so considerable a part of my story i am desirous to acquaint you and that rather than any woman in the world with all that i know myself of this arduous affair  he ceased speaking i was in tremors sir sir  the story i must own is a most affecting one how much is the unhappy lady to be pitied you will do me honor in acquainting me with farther particulars of it  dr bartlett has told you madam that the bishop of nocera second brother to lady clementina his very lately written to me requesting that i will make one more visit to bologna  i have the letter you read italian madam shall i  or will you  he held it to me  i took it these lucy are the contents  the bishop acquaints him with the very melancholy way they are in the father and mother declining in their healths signor jeronymo worse than when sir charles lest them his sister also declining in her health yet earnest still to see him  he says that she is at present at urbino but is soon to go to naples to the generals he urges him to make them one visit more yet owns that his family are not unanimous in the request but that he and father marescotti and the marchioness are extremely earnest that this indulgence should be granted to the wishes of his dear sister  he offers to meet him at his own appointment and conduct him to bologna where he tells him his presence will rejoice every heart and procure an unanimous consent to the enterview so much desired and says that if this measure which he is sorry he has so long withstood answers not his hopes he will advise the shutting up of their clementina in a nunnery or to consign her to private hands where she shall be treated kindly but as persons in her unhappy circumstances are accustomed to be treated  sir charles then showed me a letter from signor jeronymo in which he acquaints him with the dangerous way he is in he tells him that his life is a burden to him he wishes it was brought to its period he does not think himself in skilful hands he complains most of the wound which is in his hipjoint and which has hitherto bassled the art both of the italian and french surgeons who have been consulted he wishes that himself and sir charles had been of one country he says since the greatest felicity he now has to wish for is to yield up his life to the giver of it in the arms of his grandison  he mentions not one word in this melancholy letter of his unhappy sister which sir charles accounted for by supposing that she not being at bologna they kept from him in his deplorable way everything relating to her that was likely to disturb him  he then read part of a letter written in english by the admired mrs beaumont some of the contents of which were as you shall hear extremely affecting  mrs beaumont gives him in it an account of the situation of the unhappy young lady and excuses herself for not having done it before in answer to his request by reason of an indisposition under which she had for some time labored which had hindered her from making the necessary enquiries  she mentions that the lady had received no benefit from her journeyings from place to place and from her voyage from leghorn to naples and back again and blames her attendants who to quiet her unknown to their principals for some time kept her in expectation of seeing her chevalier at the end of each for her more prudent camilla she says had been hindered by illness from attending her in several of the excursions  they had a second time at her own request put her into a nunnery she at first was so sedate in it as gave them hopes but the novelty going off and one of the sisters to try her having officiously asked her to go with her into the parlour where she said she would be allowed to converse through the grate with a certain english gentleman her impatience on her disappointment made her more ungovernable than they had ever known her for she had been for two hours before meditating what she would say to him  for a week together she was vehemently intent upon being allowed to visit england and had engaged her cousins sebastiano and juliano to promise to escort her thither if she could obtain leave  her mother brought her off this when nobody else could only by entreating her for her sake never to think of it more  the marchioness then encouraged by this instance of her obedience took her under her own care but the young lady going on from flight to flight and the way she was in visibly affecting the health of her indulgent mother a doctor was found who was absolutely of opinion that nothing but harsh methods would avail and in this advice lady sforza and her daughter laurana and the general concurring she was told that she must prepare to go to milan she was so earnest to be excused from going thither and to be permitted to go to florence to mrs beaumont that they gave way to her entreaties and the marquis himself accompanying her to florence prevailed on mrs beaumont to take her under her care  with her she staid three weeks she was tolerably sedate in that space of time but most so when she was talking of england and of the chevalier grandison and his sisters with whom she wished to be acquainted she delighted to speak english and to talk of the tenderness and goodness of her tutor and of what he had said to her upon such and such a subject  at the three weeks end the general made her a visit in company of lady sforza and her talk being all on this subject they were both highly displeased and hinted that she was too much indulged in it and unhappily she repeating some tender passages that passed in the interview her mother had permitted her to hold with the chevalier the general would have it that mr grandison had designedly from the first sought to give himself consequence with her and expressed himself on the occasion with great violence against him  he carried his displeasure to extremity and obliged her to go away with his aunt and him that very day to her great regret and as much to the regret of mrs beaumont and of the ladies her friends who tenderly loved the innocent visionary as sometimes they called her and mrs beaumont is sure that the gentle treatment she met with from them would in time though perhaps slowly have greatly helped her  mrs beaumont then gives an account of the harsh treatment the poor young lady met with  sir charles grandison would have stopped reading here he said he could not read it to me without such a change of voice as would add to my pain as well as to his own  tears often stole down my cheeks when i read the letters of the bishop and signor jeronymo and as sir charles read a part of mrs beaumonts letter and i doubted not but what was to follow would make them flow yet i said be pleased sir to let me read on i am not a stranger to distress i can pity others or i should not deserve pity myself  he pointed to the place and withdrew to the window  mrs beaumont says that the poor mother was prevailed upon to resign her child wholly to the management of lady sforza and her daughter laurana who took her with them to their palace in milan  the tender parent however besought them to spare all unnecessary severity which they promised but laurana objected to camillas attendance she was thought too indulgent and her servant laura as a more manageable person was taken in her place and o how cruelly as you shall hear did they treat her  father marescotti being obliged to visit a dying relation at milan was desired by the marchioness to inform himself of the way her beloved daughter was in and of the methods taken with her lady laurana having in her letters boasted of both the good father acquainted mrs beaumont with the following particulars  he was surprised to find a difficulty made of his seeing the lady but insisting on it he found her to be wholly spiritless and in terror afraid to speak afraid to look before her cousin laurana yet seeming to want to complain to him he took notice of this to laurana  o father said she we are in the right way i assure you when we had her first her chevalier and an interview with him were ever in her mouth but now she is in such order that she never speaks a word of him but what asked the compassionate father must she have suffered to be brought to this dont you father trouble yourself about that replied the cruel laurana the doctors have given their opinion that some severity was necessary it is all for her good  the poor lady expressed herself to him with earnestness after the veil a subject on which it seems they indulged her urging that the only way to secure her health of mind if it could be restored was to yield to her wishes lady sforza said that it was not a point that she herself would press but it was her opinion that her family sinned in opposing a divine dedication and perhaps their daughters malady might be a judgment upon them for it  the father in his letter to mrs beaumont ascribes to lady sforza selfinterested motives for her conduct to laurana envy on account of lady clementinas superior qualities but nobody he says till now doubted lauranas love of her  father marescotti then gives a shocking instance of the barbarous lauranas treatment of the noble sufferer  all for her good  wretch how my heart rises against her her servant laura under pretense of consessing to her bologna father in tears acquainted him with it it was perpetrated but the day before  when any severity was to be exercised upon the unhappy lady laura was always shut out of her apartment her lady had said something that she was to be chidden for lady sforza who was not altogether so severe as her daughter was not at home laura listened in tears she heard laurana in great wrath with lady clementina and threaten her  and her young lady break out to this effect  what have i done to you laurana to be so used  you are not the cousin laurana you used to be you know i am not able to help myself why do you call me crazy and frantic laurana vile upbraider lucy if the almighty has laid his upon me should i not be pitied   it is all for your good it is all for your good clementina you could not always have spoken so sensibly cousin  cruel laurana you loved me once i have no mother as you have my mother was a good mother but she is gone or i am gone i know not which  she threatened her then with the strait waistcoat a punishment which the unhappy lady was always greatly terrified at laura heard her beg and pray but laurana coming out she was forced to retire  the poor young lady apprehending her cruel cousins return with the threatened waistcoat and with the woman that used to be brought in when they were disposed to terrify her went down and hid herself uuder a staircase where she was soon discovered by her clothes which she had not been careful to draw in after her  o lucy how i wept how insupportable to me said sir charles would have been my reflections had my conscience told me that i had been the wilful cause of the noble clementinas calamity  after i had a little recovered i read to myself the next paragraph which related that the cruel laurana dragged the sweet sufferer by her gown from her hiding place inveighing against her threatening her she all patient resigned her hands crossed on her bosom praying for mercy not by speech but by her eyes which however wept not and causing her to be carried up to her chamber there punished her with the strait waistcoat as she had threatened  father marescotti was greatly affected with lauras relation as well as with what he had himself observed but on his return to bologna dreading to acquaint her mother for her own sake with the treatment her clementina met with he only said he did not quite approve of it and advised her not to oppose the young ladys being brought home if the bishop and the general came into it but he laid the whole matter before the bishop who wrote to the general to join with him out of hand to release their sister from her present bondage and the general meeting the bishop on a set day at milan for that purpose the lady was accordingly released  a breach ensued upon it with lady sforza and her daughter who would have it that clementina was much better for their management they had by terror broke her spirit and her passiveness was reckoned upon as an indication of amendment  the marchioness being much indisposed the young lady attended by her camilla was carried to naples where it is supposed she now is poor young lady how has she been hurried about  but who can think of her cousin laurana without extreme indignation  mrs beaumont writes that the bishop would fain have prevailed upon his brother the general to join with him in an invitation to sir charles grandison to come over as a last expedient before they locked her up either in a nunnery or in some private house but the general would by no means come into it  he asked what was proposed to be the end of sir charless visit were all that was wished from it to follow in his sisters restored mind  he never he said would give his consent that she should be the wife of an english protestant  the bishop declared that he was far from wishing her to be so but he was for leaving that to afterconsideration could they but restore his sister to her reason that reason cooperating with her principles might answer all their hopes  he might try his expedient the general said with all his heart but he looked upon the chevalier grandison to be a man of art and he was sure he must have entangled his sister by methods imperceptible to her and to them but yet more efficacious to his ends than an open declaration had he not he asked found means to fascinate olivia and as many women as he came into company with  for his part he loved not the chevalier he had forced him by his intrepidity to be civil to him but forced civility was but a temporary one it was his way to judge of causes by the effects and this he knew that he had lost a sister who would have been a jewel in the crown of a prince and would not be answerable for consequences if he and sir charles grandison were once more to meet be it where it would  father marescotti however joining as the bishop writes with him and the marchioness in a desire to try this expedient and being sure that the marquis quis and signor jeronymo would not be averse to it he took a resolution to write over to him as has been related  this lucy is the state of the unhappy case as briefly and as clearly as my memory will serve to give it and what a rememberer if i may make a word is the heart  not a circumstance escapes it  and now it remained for me to know of sir charles what answer he had returned  was not my situation critical my dear had sir charles asked my opinion before he had taken his resolutions i should have given it with my whole heart that he should fly to the comfort of the poor lady but then he would have shown a suspense unworthy of clementina and a compliment to me which a good man so circumstanced ought not to make  my regard for him yet what a poor affected word is regard was nevertheless as strong as ever generosity or rather justice to clementina and that so often avowed regard to him pulled my heart two ways  i wanted to consider with myself for a few moments i was desirous to clear the conduct that i was to show on this trying occasion as well of precipitance as of affectation and my cousin reeves just then coming in for something she wanted i took the opportunity while he made a compliment to her to say as to both i will return immediately and withdrew  i went up to my own apartment i traversed my antechamber three or four times harriet byron said i to myself be not mean have thou not the example of a clementina before thee her religion and her love combating together have overturned the noble creatures reason thou can not be called to such a trial but can thou not show that if thou were thou could have acted greatly if not so greatly  sir charles grandison is just he ought to prefer to thee the excellent clementina priority of claim compassion for the noble sufferer merits so superior  i love him for his merits shall i not love merits nearly as great in one of my own sex the struggle will cost thee something but go down and try to be above thyself  down i went not displeased with myself for having been able to resolve upon such an effort banished to thy retirement to thy pillow thought i be all the girl often have i contended for the dignity of my sex let me now be an example to myself and not unworthy in my own eyes when i come to reflect of an union could it have been effected with a man whom a clementina looked up to with hope  my cousin withdrew when i came in sir charles met me at the door i hope he saw dignity in my aspect without pride  i spoke while spirit was high in me and to keep myself up to it  my heart bleeds sir for the distresses of your clementina yes lucy i said your clementina i could not but withdraw for a few moments to contemplate her great behavior and i most sincerely lament her distresses what that is in the power of man cannot sir charles grandison do you have honored me sir with the title of sister in the tenderness of that relation permit me to say that i dread the effects of the generals petulance i feel next for you the pain that it must give to your humane heart to be once more personally present to the woes of the inimitable clementina but i am sure you did not hesitate a moment about leaving all your friends here in england and resolving to hasten over to try at least what can be done for the noble sufferer  had he praised me highly for this my address to him it would have looked such was the situation on both sides as if he had thought this disinterested behavior in me an extraordinary piece of magnanimity and selfdenial and of consequence as if he had supposed i had views upon him which he wondered i could give up his is the most delicate of human minds  he led me to my seat and taking his by me still holding my passive hand  ever since i have had the honor of miss byrons acquaintance i have considered her as one of the most excellent of women my heart demands alliance with hers and hopes to be allowed its claim though such are the delicacies of situation that i scarcely dare to trust myself to speak upon the subject from the first i called miss byron my sister but she is more to me than the dearest sister and there is a more tender friendship that i aspire to hold with her whatever may be the accidents on either side to bar a farther wish and this i must hope that she will not deny me so long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments  he paused i made an effort to speak but speech was denied me my face as i felt glowed like the fire before me  my heart resumed he is ever on my lips it is tortured when i cannot speak all that is in it professions i am not accustomed to make as i am not conscious of being unworthy of your friendship i will suppose it and farther talk to you of my affairs and engagements as that tender friendship may warrant  sir you do me honor was all i could say  i had a letter from the faithful camilla i hold not a correspondence with her but the treatment that her young lady met with of which she had got some general intimations and some words that the bishop said to her which expressed his wishes that i would make them one more visit at bologna urged her to write begging of me for heavens sake to go over but unless one of the family had written to me and by consent of others of it what hope had i of a welcome after i had been as often refused as i had requested while i was in italy to be admitted to the presence of the lady who was so desirous of one interview more  especially as mrs beaumont gave me no encouragement to go but the contrary from what she observed of the inclinations of the family  mrs beaumont is still of opinion as in the conclusion of the letter before you that i should not go unless the general and the marquis join their requests to those of the marchioness the bishop and father marescotti but i had no sooner perused the bishops letter than i wrote that i would most cheerfully comply with his wishes but that i should be glad that i might not be under any obligation to go farther than bologna where i might have the happiness to attend my jeronymo as well as well as his sister  i had a little twitch at my heart lucy i was sorry for it but my judgment was entirely with him  and now madam you will wonder that you see not any preparations for my departure all is prepared i only wait for the company of one gentleman who is settling his affairs with all expedition to go with me he is an able a skilful surgeon who has had great practice abroad and in the armies and having acquired an casy fortune is come to settle in his native country my jeronymo expresses himself dissatisfied with his surgeons if mr lowther can be of service to him how happy shall i think myself and if my presence can be a means to restore the noble clementina  but how dare i hope it  and yet i am persuaded that in her case and with such a temper of mind unused to hardship and opposition as she had been the only way to recover her would have been by complying with her in everything that her heart or head was earnestly set upon for what control was necessary to a young lady who never even in the height of her malady uttered a wish or thought that was contrary to her duty either to god or her parents nor yet to the honor of her name and allow me madam to say the pride of her sex  i am under an obligation to go to paris proceeded he from the will of my late friend mr danby i shall stop there for a day or two only in order to put things in a way for my last hand on my return from italy  when i am in italy i shall perhaps be enabled to adjust two or three accounts that stand out in relation to the affairs of my ward  this day at dinner i shall see mrs oldham and her sons and in the afternoon at tea mrs ohara and her husband and captain salmonet  tomorrow i hope for the honor of your company madam and mr and mrs reeves at dinner and be so good as to engage them for the rest of the day you must not deny me because i shall want your influence upon charlotte to make her fix lord gs happy day that i may be able to see their hands united before i set out as my return will be uncertain   ah lucy more twitches just then   thursday next is the day fixed for the triple marriage of the danbys i have promised to give miss danby to mr galliard and to dine with them and their friends at enfield  if i can see my lord w and charlotte happy before i go i shall be highly gratified  it is another of my wishes to see my friend beauchamp in england first and to leave him in possession of his fathers love and of his motherinlaws civility dr bartlet and he will be happy in each other i shall correspond with the doctor he greatly admires you madam and will communicate to you all you shall think worthy of your notice relating to the proceedings of a man who will always think himself honored by your enquiries after him  ah lucy sir charles grandison then sighed he seemed to look more than he spoke i will not promise for my heart if he treats me with more than the tenderness of friendship if he gives me room to think that he wishes  but what can he wish he ought to be he must be clementinas and i will endeavor to make myself happy if i can maintain the second place in his friendship and when he offers me this shall i lucy be so little as to be displeased with the man who cannot be to me all that i had once hoped he could be  no  he shall be the same glorious creature in my eyes i will admire his goodness of heart and greatness of mind and i will think him entitled to my utmost gratitude for the protection he gave me from a man of violence and for the kindness he has already shown me is not friendship the basis of my love and does he not tender me that  nevertheless at the time do what i could i found a tear ready to start my heart was very untoward lucy and i was guilty of a little female turn when i found the twinkling of my eyes would not disperse the too ready drop and felt it stealing down my cheek i wiped it off  the poor emily said i  she will be grieved at parting with you emily loves her guardian  and i love my ward i once had a thought madam of begging your protection of emily but as i have two sisters i think she will be happy under their wings and in the protection of my good lord l and the rather as i have no doubt of overcoming her unhappy mother by making her husbands interest a guaranty for her tolerable if not good behavior to her child  i was glad to carry my thoughts out of myself as i may say and from my own concerns we all sir said i look upon mr beauchamp as a future   husband for emily madam interrupted he  it must not be at my motion my friend shall be entitled to share with me my whole estate but i will never seck to lead the choice of my ward let emily some time hence find out the husband she can be happy with beauchamp the wife he can love emily if i can help it shall not be the wife of any mans convenience beauchamp is nice and i will be as nice for my ward and the more so as i hope she herself wants not delicacy there is a cruelty in persuasion where the heart rejects the person proposed whether the urger be parent or guardian  lord bless me thought i what a man is this  do you expect mr beauchamp soon sir  every day madam  and is it possible sir that you can bring all these things to bear before you leave england and go so soon  i fear nothing but charlottes whimsies have you madam any reason to apprehend that she is averse to an alliance with lord g his father and aunt are very importunate for an early celebration  none at all sir  then i shall depend much upon yours and lord and lady ls influence over her  he besought my excuse for detaining my attention so long upon his motion to go my two cousins came in he took even a solemn leave of me and a very respectful one of them  i had kept up my spirits to their utmost stretch i besought my cousins to excuse me for a few minutes his departure from me was too solemn and i hurried up to my closet and after a few involuntary sobs a flood of tears relieved me i besought on my knees peace to the disturbed mind of the excellent clementina calmness and resignation to my own and safety to sir charles and then drying my eyes at the glass i went down stairs to my cousins and on their enquiries with looks of deep concern after the occasion of my red eyes i said all is over all is over my dear cousins i cannot blame him he is all that is noble and good  i can say no more just now the particulars you shall have from my pen  i went up stairs to write and except for one half hour at dinner and another at tea i stopped not till i had done  and here quite tired uneasy vexed with myself yet hardly knowing why i lay down my pen  take what i have written cousin reeves if you can read it do and then dispatch it to my lucy  but on second thoughts i will show it to the two ladies and lord l before it is sent away they will be curious to know what passed in a conversation where the critical circumstances both of us were in required a delicacy which i am not sure was so well observed on my side as on his  i shall i know have their pity but let nobody who pities not the noble clementina show any for  harriet byron  letter viii miss byron in continuation tuesday night april   miss grandison came to me just as we had supped she longed she said to see me but was prevented coming before and desired to know what had passed between her brother and me this morning i gave her the letter which i had but a little while before concluded he had owned she said that he had breakfasted with me and spoke of me to her and lord and lady l with an ardor that gave them pleasure she put my letter into her bosom i may i hope harriet  if you please madam said i  if you please madam repeated she and with that dolorous accent too my hariet  my sister and i have been in tears this morning lord l had much ado to forbear sir charles will soon leave us  it cannot be helped charlotte did you dine to day in st jamess square  no indeed  my brother had a certain tribe with him and the woman also it is very difficult i believe harriet for good people to forbear doing sometimes more than goodness requires of them  could you not charlotte have sat at table with them for one hour or two  my brother did not ask me he did not expect it he gives everybody their choice you know he told me last night who were to dine with him today and supposed i would choose to dine with lady l or with you he was so free as to say  he did us an honor which you thought too great a one but if he had asked you charlotte   then i should have bridled indeed i asked him if he did not overdo it  what was his answer  perhaps he might  but i said he may never see mrs oldham again i want to inform myself of her future intentions with a view overdo it again charlotte to make her easy and happy for life her children are in the world i want to give her a credit that will make her remembered by them as they grow up with duty i hope i am superior to forms she is conscious i can pity her she is a gentlewoman and entitled to a place at any mans table to whom she never was a servant she never was mine  and what miss grandison could you say in answer asked i  what  why i put up my lip  ungracious girl  i cannot help it that may become a man to do in such cases as this that would not a woman  sir charles wants not delicacy my dear said i  he must suppose that i should have sat swelling and been reserved he was right not to ask me  so be quiet harriet  and yet perhaps you would be as tame to a husbands mistress as you seem favorable to a fathers  she then put on one of her arch looks   the cases differ charlotte  but do you know what passed between the generous man and the mortified woman and her children mortified as they must be by his goodness  yes yes i had curiosity enough to ask dr bartlett about it all  pray charlotte   dr bartlett is favorable to everybody sinners as well as saints  he began with praising the modesty of her dress the humility of her behavior he said that she trembled and looked down till she was reassured by sir charles such creatures have all their tricks harriet  you charlotte are not favorable to sinners and hardly to saints but pray proceed  why he reassured the woman as i told you and then proceeded to ask many questions of the elder oldham  i pitied that young fellow  to have a mother in his eye whose very tenderness to the young ones kept alive the sense of her guilt and yet what would she have been had she not been doubly tender to the innocents who were born to shame from her fault the young man acknowleged a military genius and sir charles told him that he would on his return from a journey he was going to take consider whether he could not do him service in the way he chose he gave him it seems a brief lecture on what he should aim to be and what avoid to qualify himself for a man of true honor and spoke very handsomely of such gentlemen of the army as are real gentlemen the young fellow continued miss granddison may look upon himself to be as good as provided for since my brother never gives the most distant hope that is not followed by absolute certainty the first opportunity not that offers but which he can make  he took great notice of the little boys he dilated their hearts and set them a prating and was pleased with their prate the doctor who had never seen him before in the company of children applauded him for his vivacity and condescending talk to them the tenderest father in the world he said could not have behaved more tenderly or showed himself more delighted with his own children than he did with those brats of mrs oldham  ah charlotte and is it out of doubt that you are the daughter of lady grandison and sister of sir charles grandison  well but i believe you are  some children take after the father some after the mother  forgive me my dear  but i will not i have a great mind to quarrel with you harriet  pray dont because i could neither help nor can be sorry for what i said but pray proceed  why he made presents to the children i dont know what they were nor could the doctor tell me i suppose very handsome ones for he has the spirit of a prince he enquired very particularly after the circumstances of the mother and was more kind to her than many people would be to their own mothers  he can account for this i suppose  though i cannot the woman it is true is of a good family and so forth but that enhances her crime natural children abound in the present age keeping is fashionable good men should not countenance such wretches  but my brother and you are charitable creatures  with all my heart child virtue however has at least as much to say on one side of the question as on the other  when the poor children are in the world as your brother said  when the poor women are penitents true penitents  your brothers treatment of mrs giffard was different he is in both instances an imitator of the almighty an humbler of the impenitent and an encourager of those who repent  well well he is undoubtedly a good sort of young man and harriet you are a good sort of young woman where much is given much is required but i have not given me such a large quantity of charity as either of you may bost and how can i help it  but however the woman went away blessing and praising him and that the doctor says more with her eyes than she was able to do in words the elder youth departed in rapturous reverence the children hung about his knees on theirs the doctor will have it that it was without bidding  perhaps so  he raised them by turns to his arms and kissed them  why harriet your eyes glisten child they would have run over i suppose had you been there is it that your heart is weakened with your present situation i hope not no you are a good creature and i see that the mention of a behavior greatly generous however slightly made will have its force upon a heart so truly benevolent as yours you must be lady grandison my dear indeed you must  well but i must be gone you dine with us tomorrow my brother says  he did ask me and desired me to engage my cousins but he repeated not the invitation when he went away  he depends upon your coming and so do we he is to tlk to me before you it seems i cannot tell about what but by his hurrying on everything it is plain he is preparing to leave us  he is madam  he is madam and with that dejected air and mendicant voice  speak up like a woman  the sooner he sets out if he must go the sooner he will return come come harriet you shall be lady grandison still  ay and that sigh too these lovesick folks have a language that no body else can talk to them in and then she affectedly sighed  is that right harriet  she sighed again  no it is not i never knew what a sigh was but when my father vexed my sister and that wa more for fear he should one day be as cruel to me than for her sake we can be very generous for others harriet when we apprehend that one day we may want the same pity ourselves our best passion my dear have their mixtures of selflove  you have drawn a picture of human nature charlotte that i dont like  it is a likeness for all that  she arose snatched my hand hurried to the door  be with us harriet and cousin reeves and cousin reeves as soon as you can tomorrow i want to talk to you my dear to me of an hundred thousand things before dinner remember we dine early  away she fluttered  happy miss grandison what charming spirits she has  letter ix miss byron in continuation wednesday april   miss jervois came to me this morning by six impatient as she said to communicate good news to me i was in my closet writing i could not sleep  i have seen my mother said she and we are good friends was she ever unkind to me madam  dear creature said i and clasped her to my bosom you are a sweet girl oblige me with the particulars  let me lucy give you as near as i can recollect the amiable young creatures words and actions on this occasion  sit down my love said i  what when i am talking of a reconciled mother and to dear miss byron  no indeed  she often held out one open hand while the forefinger of the other in full action patted it as at other times both were spread with pretty wonder and delight and thus she began  why you must know it was about six oclock yesterday afternoon that my mother and her husband and captain salmonet came i was told of their visit but two hours before and when the coach stopped and i at the window saw them alight i thought i should have fainted away i would have given half i was worth in the world to have been an hundred miles off  dr bartlett was there and received them my guardian was unexpectedly engaged in answering a letter sent him by lord w for which a gentleman waited but they had not been there a quarter of an hour when he entered and made apology to them in his usual gracious manner never the doctor says did any body look so respectful as the major and the captain and they would have made apologies to my guardian for their last behavior to him but he would not let them and my mother the doctor says from the very first behaved prettily  the moment she asked for me my guardian himself condescended to come up to me and took my hand  was not that very good of him  my dear said he as he led me down stairs and spoke so kindly dont tremble so am i not with you  your mother is very calm and composed you must ask her blessing i shall ease your tender heart of every pang i shall hint to you what to do and how to behave to the gentlemen as occasions arise  he had no sooner said the words but the drawingroomdoor gave way to his hand and i was in the room with him  down on my knees dropped i  as i now do to you but i could not speak thus i did and she kissed my hand and bowed her face upon it and my mother raised me  you must raise me madam  yes just so  and she kissed me too and wept on my neck and called me pretty names and encouraged me and said she loved me as she loved her own soul  and i was encouraged  my guardian then with the air and manner of a gracious prince took my hand and presented it first to the major then to the captain and they each kissed my hand and spoke in my praise i cannot tell how many fine things  major said my guardian when he presented me to him you must excuse the dear childs weakness of spirits she wishes you all happiness on your nuptials she has let me know that she is very desirous to do you service for her mothers sake  the major swore by his soul i was an angel  captain salmonet said that by his salvation i was a charming young lady  my mother wept  o sir said she to my guardian and dropping down in a chair by the window not a word more could she speak  i ran to her and clasped my arms about her she wept the more i wiped her eyes with her own handkerchief i told her it went to my heart to see her cry i begged she would spare me this grief  she clasped her arms then about me and kissed my cheek and my forehead o thought i it is very good of you my dear mother  then came my guardian to us and he kindly took my mothers hand and conducted her to the fireside and he led me and placed me by her at the teatable and he made the major and the captain sit down by him so much graciousness in his countenance o madam i shall be an idolater i am afraid and he said emily my dear you will make tea for us my sister dined abroad madam to my mother  yes sir i will said i and i was as lively as a bird  but before the servants came in let me tell you madam said he what miss jervois has proposed to me  they were in silent expectation  she has desired that you major will accept from her for your mutual ease of an additional  00 l a year which i shall order to be paid you quarterly during mrs oharas life not doubting but you will make her as happy as it is in your power to make her  my mother bowed colored with gratitude and looked obliged  and she begs of you madam turning to my mother that you will accept as from the major another  00 l a year for pinmoney which he or which you madam will draw upon me for also quarterly if you choose not to trouble him to do it for this  00 l a year must be appropriated to your sole and separate use madam and not be subject to your control major ohara  good god sir said the major  what a wretch was i the last time i was here  there is no bearing of this  he got up and went to the window and the captain said blessed jesu and something else which i could not mind for i was weeping like a baby  what sir said my mother  00 l a year do you mean so  i do madam  and sir to be so generously paid me my  00 l of it as if i received it not from my child but from my husband  good god how you overpower me sir what shame what remorse do you strike into my heart  and my poor mothers tears ran down as fast as mine  o madam said the dear girl to me clasping her arms about me how your tender heart is touched  it is well you were not there  dr bartlett came in to tea my guardian would not permit antony who offered himself to wait antony had been my own papas servant when my mother was not so good  nothing but blessings nothing but looks and words of admiration and gratitude passed all the teatime how their hearts rejoiced i warrant  is it not a charming thing madam to make peoples hearts glad  to be sure it is how many hearts has my guardian rejoiced you must bid him be cross to me or i shall not know what to do with myself  but then if he was i should only get by myself and cry and be angry with myself and think he could not be to blame  o my love my emily said i take care of your gratitude that drew in your true friend  well but how can it be helped madam can a right heart be ungrateful dr bartlett says there is no such thing as true happiness in this life and is it not better to be unhappy from good men and women than from bad  dear madam why you have often made me unhappy because of your goodness to me and because i knew that i neither could deserve nor return it  the dear prater went on  my guardian called me aside when tea was over my emily said he  i do love he should call me his emily  but all the world is his emily i think let me see what you will do with these two notes giving me two banknotes of    l each  present pinmoney and cash may be wanted we will suppose that your mother has been married a quarter of a year her pinmoney and the additional annuity may commence from the   th of december last let me emily when they go away see the graceful mannner in which you will dispose of the notes and from mr oharas behavior upon it we shall observe whether he is a man with whom your mother if it be not her own fault now you have made it their interest to be kind to each other may live well but the motion be all your own  how good this was i could have kissed the hand that gave me the notes if i thought it would not have looked too free  i understand you sir said i  and when they went away pouring out their very hearts in grateful joy i addressed myself to mr ohara sir said i it is proper that the payment of the additional annuity should have a commencement let it be from christmas last accept of the first payment from my own hands  and i gave him one    l note and looking at my mother with a look of duty for fear he should mistake and discredit himself in the eyes of the deepest discerner in the world gave him the other  he looked upon first one then upon the other note with surprise  and then bowing to the ground to me and to my guardian he stepped to my mother and presented them both to her you madam said he must speak i cannot as i ought god send me with a whole heart out of this house he hurried out and when he was in the hall wiped his eyes and sobbed like a child as one of the servants told my anne  my mother looked upon one note as her husband had done and upon the other and lifting up her eyes embraced me  and would have said something to my guardian but he prevented her by saying  emily will be always dutiful to you madam and respectful to mr ohara may you be happy together  and he led her out  was ever such a condescension he led her out to her husband who being a little recovered was just about to give some money to the servant who was retiring from the offer  nobody said my guardian graciously smiling pays my servants but myself mr ohara they are good people and merit my favor  and he went to the very door with my mother i could not i ran back crying for joy into the drawing room when they went out of it i could not bear myself how could i you know madam  captain salmonet all the time wiped his eyes shrugged his shoulders lifted up his hands and cried out upon jesu and once or twice he crossed himself but all the time my guardian looked and acted as if those actions and praises were nothing to be proud of  when he came in to me i arose and threw myself at his feet but could only say thank you sir for your goodness to my mother he raised me he sat down by me see child said he and he took my hand my heart was sensible of the favor and throbbed with joy what it is in the power of people of fortune to do you have a great one now your mother is married i have hopes of her they will at least keep up appearances to each other and to the world they neither of them want sense you have done an act of duty and benevolence both in one the man who would grudge them this additional  00 l a year out of your fortune to make your parent happy shall not have my emily  shall he  your emily your happy emily sir has not cannot have a heart that is worth notice if it be not implicitly guided by you  this i said madam and it is true  and did he not said i clasp his emily to his generous bosom when you said so  no madam that would have been too great an honor but he called me good child and said you shall never be put to pay me an implicit regard your own reason and he called me child again shall always be the judge of my conduct to you and direct your observances of my advice something like this he said but in a better manner than i can say it  he calls me oftener child madam than anything else when we are alone together and is not quite so free i think at such times in his behavior to me yet is vastly gracious i dont know how as when we are in company  why is that i am sure i equally respect him at one time as at another  do you think madam there is anything in the observation is there any reason for it  i do love to study him and to find out the meaning of his very looks as well as words sir charles grandisons heart is the book of heaven  may i not study it  study it my love while you have an opportunity but he will soon leave us he will soon leave engalnd  so i fear and i will love and pity the poor clementina whose heart is so much wounded and oppressed but my guardian shall be no bodys but yours i have prayed night and day the first thing and the last thing ever since i have heard of lady clementina that you and nobody but you may be lady grandison and i will continue my prayers  but will you forgive me i always conclude them with praying that you will both consent to let the poor emily live with you  sweet girl the poor emily said she  i embraced her and we mingled tears both our hearts full each for the other and each perhaps for herself  she hurried away i resumed my pen  run off what had passed almost as swift as thought i quit it to prepare to attend my cousins to st jamess square  letter x miss byron in continuation wednesday night april   miss grandison as i told you took with her my letter of yesterday as soon as my cousin reeves and i entered sir charless house the two sisters conducted us into the drawing room adjoining to the diningparlour and congratulated me on the high compliment their brother had made me though in preference to themselves and his communicativeness and tender behavior to me lord l joined us and he having read the letter congratulated me also  on what lucy  why on the possibility that if the unhappy clementina should die or if she should be buried for life in a nunnery or if she should be otherwise disposed of why then that your harriet may have room given her to hope for a civil husband in sir charles grandison and half a heart is not this the sum of these humbling congratulations  sir charles when we came was in his study with mr lowther the surgeon whom he had engaged to go abroad with him but he just came out to welcome us and then returned  he had also with him two physicians eminent for their knowledge in disorders of the head to whom he had before communicated the case of the unhappy clementina and who brought to him in writing their opinions of the manner in which she ought to be treated according to the various symptoms of her disorder  when he joined us he told us this and said very high things at the same time in praise of the english surgeons and particularly of this gentleman and added that as nervous disorders were more frequent in england than in any country in the world he was willing to hope that the english physicians were more skilful than those of any other country in the management of persons afflicted with such maladies and as he was now invited over he was determined to furnish himself with all the means he could think of that were likely to be useful in restoring and healing friends so dear to him  miss grandison told him that we were all in some apprehensions on his going to italy of that fierce and wrongheaded man the general miss byron said she has told us that mrs beaumont advises not your going over  the young marquis della porretta said he is hasty but he is a gallant man and loves his sister his grief on the unhappy situation they are in demands allowance it is natural in an heavy calamity to look out of ourselves for the occasion i have not any apprehensions from him or from any body else the call upon me is a proper one the issue must be left where it ought to be left if my visit will give comfort to any one of the family i shall be rewarded if to more than one happy  and whatever be the event shall be easier in myself than i could be were i not to comply with the request of the bishop were he only to have made it  lord l asked sir charles whether he had fixed the day of his setting out  i have said he within this half hour mr lowther has told me that he should be ready by the beginning of next week and on saturday sevennight i hope to be at dover on my way  we looked upon one another miss grandison told me afterward that my color went and came several times and that she was afraid for me my heart was indeed a little affected i believe i must not think of taking leave of him when he sets out ah lucy nine days hence  yet in less than nine days after that i shall be embraced by the tenderest relations that ever creature had to boast of  sir charles taking his sister aside i want said he to say a few words to you charlotte they were about half an hour together and then returning i am encouraged to think said he that charlotte will give her hand to lord g she is a woman of honor and her heart must therefore go with it  i have a request to make to her before all you our common friends  the earl of g lady gertrude lord g all join in one suit it is that i may be allowed to give my sister to lord g before i leave england  i have told you brother that it is impossible if you go away in nine or ten days time  sir charles particularly requested my influence i could have no doubt i said but miss grandison would oblige her brother  she vehemently opposed so early a day  in a most affectionate manner yet with an air of seriousness he urged his request he said that it was very proper for him to make some dispositions of his affairs before he went abroad he should leave england with much more pleasure if he saw his charlotte the wife of a man so worthy as lord g lord g said he adores you you intend to be his resolve to oblige your brother who though he cannot be happy himself wishes to see you so  o sir charles  you ruin me by your solemnity and by your goodness  the subject is not a light one i am greatly in earnest charlotte i have many affairs on my hands my heart is in this company yet my engagements will permit me but few opportunities to enjoy it between this and tuesday next if you deny me now i must acquiesce if you have more than punctilio to plead say you have and i will not urge you farther  and so this is the last time of asking sir a little archly   not the last time of my lord gs  but of mine  but i will not allow you now to answer me lightly  if you can name a day before tuesday you will greatly oblige me i will leave you to consider of it and he withdrew  everyone then urged her to oblige her brother lady l very particularly she told her that he was entitled to her compliance and that he had spoken to her on this subject in a still more earnest manner she should hardly be able to excuse her she said if the serious hint he had given about settling his affairs before he went abroad had not weight with her you know charlotte continued she that he can have no motive but your good and you have told me that you intend to have lord g and that you esteem his father his aunt and every one of his family whom you have seen and they are highly pleased with you settlements are ready drawn that my brother told you last night nothing is wanting but your day  i wish he was in half the hurry to be married himself  so he would be i dare say if marriage were as much in his power as it is in yours  what a duce to be married to a man in a weeks time with whom i have quarreled every day for a fortnight past  pride and petulance must go down by degrees sister a month at least is necessary to bring my features to such a placidness with him as to allow him to smile in my face  your brother has hinted charlotte said i that he loves you for your vivacity and should still more if you consulted time and occasion  he has withdrawn sister said lord l with a resolution if you deny him to urge you no farther  i hate his peremptoriness  has he not told you charlotte said i and that in a manner so serious as to affect every body that there is a kind of necessity for it  i dont love this clementina harriet all this is owing to her  just then a rapping at the door signified visitors and emily ran in  lord g the earl and lady gertrude believe me  miss grandison changed color a contrivance of my brothers  ah lord now shall i be beset  i will be sullen that i may not be saucy  sullen you cannot be charlotte said lady l bnt saucy you can remember however my brothers earnestness and spare lord g before his father and aunt or you will give me and everybody pain  how can i our last quarrel is not made up but advise him not to be either impertinent or secure  immediately entered sir charles introducing the earl and lady gertrude after the first compliments pray sir charles said miss grandison drawing him aside toward me and whispering tell me truly did you not know of this visit  i invited them charlotte whispered he i meant not however to surprise you if you comply you will give me great pleasure if you do not i will not be displeased with my sister  what can i do either be less good to me sir or less hurrying  you have sacrificed enough to female punctilio charlotte lord g has been a zealous courtier you have no doubt of the ardor of his passion nor of your own power leave the day to me let it be tuesday next  good heaven i cannot bear you after such a  and she gasped as if for breath and he turning from her to me she went to lady gertrude who rising took her hand and withdrew with her into the next room  they staid out till they were told dinner was served and when they returned i thought i never saw miss grandison look so lovely a charming flush had overspread her cheeks a sweet consciousness in her eyes gave a female grace to her whole aspect and softened as i may say the natural majesty of her fine features  lord g looked delighted as if his heart were filled with happy presages the earl seemed no less pleased  miss grandison was unusually thoughtful all dinnertime she gave me great joy to see her so in the hope that when the lover becomes the husband the overlively mistress will be sunk in the obliging wife  and yet now and then as the joy in my lords heart overflowed at his lips i could observe that archness rising to her eye that makes one both love and fear her  after dinner the earl of g and lady gertrude desired a conference with sir charles and lady l they were not long absent when sir charles came in and carried out miss grandison to them lord gs complexion varied often  sir charles left them together and joined us we were standing and he singled me out  i hope madam said he that charlotte may be prevailed upon for tuesday next but i will not urge it farther  i thought that he was framing himself to say something particular to me when lady l came in and desired him and me to step to her sister who had retired from the earl and lady gertrude by consent  ah my harriet said she pity me my dear  debasement is the child of pride  then turning to sir charles i acknowledge myself overcome said she by your earnestness as you are so soon to leave us and by the importunities of the earl of g lady gertrude and by sister  unprepared in mind in clothes i am resolved to oblige the best of brothers do you sir dispose of me as you think fit  my sister consents sir said lady l for next tuesday  cheerfully i hope if charlotte balances whether if she took more time she should have lord g at all let her take it lord l in my absence will be to her all that i wish to be when she shall determine  i balance not sir but i thought to have had a months time at least to look about me and having treated lord g too slippantly to give him by degrees some fairer prospects of happiness with me than hitherto he has had  sir charles embraced her she was all his sister he said let the alteration now begin lord g would rejoice in it and consider all that had passed as trials only of his love for her the obliging wife would banish from his remembrance the petulant mistress and now allow me my dear sister to present you to the earl and lady gertrude  he led her in to them lady l took my hand and led me in also  charlotte my lord yields to yours and lady gertrudes importunities next tuesday will give the two families a near and tender relation to each other  the earl saluted her in a very affectionate manner so did lady gertrude who afterward run out for her nephewand leading him in presented him to miss grandison  she had just time to whisper me as he approached her ah harriet now comes the worst part of the show  he kneeled on one knee kissed her hand but was too much overjoyed to speak for lady gertrude had told him as she led him in that tuesday was to be his happy day  it is impossible lucy but sir charles grandison must carry every point he sets his heart upon when he shall appear before the family of porretta in italy who will be able to withstand him  is not his consequence doubled more than doubled since he was with them the man whose absence they requested they now invite to come among them they have tried every experiment to restore their clementina he has a noble estate now in possession the fame of his goodness is gone out to distant countries o my dear all opposition must fly before him and if it be the will of heaven to restore clementina all her friends must concur in giving her to him upon the terms he has proposed and from which having himself proposed them sir charles grandison cannot recede  his heart it is evident is at bologna well and so it ought to be and yet i could not forbear being sensibly touched by the following words which i overheard him say to lord l in answer to something my lord said to him  i am impatient to be abroad had i not waited for mr lowther the last letters i received from italy should have been  in person  but as honor compasion love friendship still nobler than love have demands upon him let him obey the call he has set me high in his esteem let me be worthy of his friendship pangs i shall occasionally feel but who that values one person above the rest of the world does not  sir charles as we sat at tea mentioned his cousin grandison to lord l it is strange my lord said he that we hear nothing of our cousin everard since he was seen at whites but whenever he emerges charlotte if i am absent receive him without reproaches yet i should be glad that he could have rejoiced with us must i leave england and not see him  it has been it seems the way of this unhappy man to shut himself up with some woman in private lodgings for fear his cousin should find him out and in two or three months when he has been tired of his wicked companion emerge as sir charles called it to notice and then seek for his cousins favor and company and live for as many more months in a state of contrition and sir charles in his great charity believes that till some new temptation arises he is in earnest in his penitence and hopes that in time he will see his errors  oh lucy what a poor creeping mean wretch is a libertine when one looks down upon him and up to such a glorious creature as sir charles grandison  sir charles was led to talk of his engagement for tomorrow on the triple marriage in the danby family we all gave him joy of the happy success that had rewarded his beneficient spirit with regard to that family he gave us the characters of the three couples greatly to their advantage and praised the families on both sides which were to be so closely united on the morrow not forgetting to mention k ndly honest mr sylvester the attorney  he told us that he should set out on friday early for windsor in order to attend lord w in his first visit to mansfieldhouse you lady l will have the trouble given you said he of procuring to be newset the jewels of the late lady w for a present to the future bride my lord showed them to me among a great number of other valuable trinkets of his late wifes in my last return from the hall they are rich and will do credit to his quality you my lord l you my sisters will be charmed with your new aunt and her whole family i have joy on the happiness in prospect that will gild the latter days of my mothers brother and at the same time be a means of freeing from oppression an ancient and worthy family  our eyes all round offered as i may say to keep in countenance each others sensibility for they all glistened there now thought i sits this princely man rejoicing every one who sees him and hears him speak but where will he be nine days hence and whose this daytwelve month  he talked with particular pleasure of the expected arrival of his beauchamp he pleased himself that he should leave behind him a man who would delight everybody and supply to his friends his absence  what a character did he give and dr bartlett confirm of that amiable friend of his  how did the earl and lady gertrude dwell upon all he said they prided themselves on the relation they were likely so soon to stand in to so valuable a man  in your last letter you tell me lucy that mr greville has the confidence to throw out menaces against this excellent man  sorry wretch  how my heart rises against him  he  but no more of such an earthborn creature  letter xi miss byron in continuation thursday morning april   miss grandison accompanied by miss jervois has just left us lady l has undertaken she says to set all hands at work to have things in tolerable order early as the day is for tuesday next miss grandison would you believe it owns that she wants spirits to order anything what must be the solemnity of that circumstance when near that shall make charlotte grandison want spirits  she withdrew with me to my apartment she threw herself into a chair it is a folly to deny it harriet but i am very low and very silly i dont like next tuesday by any means  is your objection only to the day my dear  i do not like the man  is there any man whom you like better  i cannot say that neither but this brother of mine makes me think contemptibly of all other men i would compound for a man but half so good tender kind humane polite and even cheerful in affliction  o harriet where is there such another man  nowhere  but you dont by marriage lose on the contrary you farther engage and secure the affection of this brother you will have a goodnatured worthy man for your husband a man who loves you and you will have your brother besides  do you think i can be happy with lord g  i am sure you may if it be not your own fault  that is the thing i may perhaps bear with the man but i cannot honor him  then dont vow to honor him dont meet him at the altar  yet i must but i believe i think too much and consideration is no friend to wedlock  would to heaven that the same hour that my hand and lord gs were joined yours and my brothers were also united  ah miss grandison if you love me try to wean me and not to encourage hopes of what never never can be  dear creature you will be greater than clementina and that is greater than the greatest if you can conquer a passion that overturned her reason  do not my charlotte make comparisons in which the conscience of your harriet tells her she must be a sufferer there is no occasion for me to despise myself in order to hold myself inferior to clementina  well you are a noble creature  but the approaching tuesday  i cannot bear to think of it  dear charlotte  and dear harriet too  but the officiousness the assiduities of this trifling man are disgustful to me  you dont hate him   hate him  true  i dont hate him  but i have been so much accustomed to treat him like a fool that i cannot help thinking him one he should not have been so tame to such a spirit as mine he should have been angry when i played upon him i have got a knack of it and shall never leave it off that is certain  then i hope he will be angry with you i hope that he will resent your ill treatment of him  too late too late to begin harriet i will not take it of him now he has never let me see that his face can become two sorts of features the poor man can look sorrowful that i know full well but i shall always laugh when he attempts to look angry  you know better charlotte you may give him so much cause for anger that you may make it habitual to him and then would be glad to see him pleased men have an hundred ways that women have not to divert themselves abroad when they cannot be happy at home this i have heard observed by   by your grandmother harriet good old lady in her reign it might be so but you will find that women now have as many ways to divert themselves abroad as the men have you not observed this yourself in one of your letters to lucy ah my dear we can every hour of the twentyfour be up with our monarchs if they are undutiful  but charlotte grandison will not cannot   why that is true my dear  but i shall not then be a grandison yet the man will have some security from my brothers goodness he is not only good himself but he makes every one related to him either from fear or shame good likewise but i think that when one week or fortnight is happily over and my spirits are got up again from the depression into which this abominable hurry puts them i could fall upon some inventions that would make everyone laugh except the person who might take it into his head that he may be a sufferer by them and who can laugh and be angry in the same moment  you should not marry charlotte till this wicked vein of humor and raillery is stopped  i hope it will hold me till fifty  dont say so charlotte  say rather that you hope it will hold you so long only as it may be thought innocent or inossensive by the man whom it will be your duty to oblige and so long as it will bring no discredit to yourself  your servant goody gravity  but what must be must the man is bound to see it it will be all his own seeking he will sin with his eyes open i think he has seen enough of me to take warning all that i am concerned about is for the next week or fortnight he will be king all that time  yet perhaps not quite all neither and i shall be his sovereign ever after or i am mistaken what a duce shall a woman marry a man of talents not superior to her own and forget to reward herself for her condescension  but highho  there is a sigh harriet were i at home i would either sing you a song or play you a tune in order to raise my own heart  she besought me then with great earnestness to give her my company till the day arrived and on the day you see said she that my brother has engagements till monday dear creature support comfort me  dont you see my heart beat through my stays  if you love me come to me tomorrow to breakfast and leave me not for the whole time  are you not my sister and the friend of my heart i will give you a month for it upon demand come let us go down i will ask the consent of both your cousins  she did and they with their usual goodness to me cheerfully complied  sir charles set out this morning to attend the triple marriages dressed charmingly his sister says i have made miss grandison promise to give me an account of such particulars as by the help of saunders and sir charless own relation she can pick up all we single girls i believe are pretty attentive to such subjects as these as what one day may be our own concern  letter xii miss grandison to miss byron thursday night unreasonable wicked cruel byron to expect a poor creature so near her execution to write an account of other peoples behavior in the same tremendous circumstances the matrimonial noose has hung over my head for some time past and now it is actually fitted to my devoted neck  almost choked my dear  this moment done hearing read the firsts seconds thirds fourths to near a dozen of them  lord be merciful to us  and the villainous lawyer rearing up to me his spectaclednose as if to see how i bore it lord g insulting me as i thought by his odious leers lady gertrude simpering little emily ready to bless herself  how will the dear harriet bear these abominable recitatives  but i am now up stairs from them all in order to recover my breath and obey my byron  well but what am i now to say about the danbys richard has made his report sir charles has told us some things yet i will only give you heads make out the rest  in the first place my brother went to mrs harringtons miss danbys aunt she did everything but worship him she had with her two young ladies relations of her late husband dainty damsels of the city who had procured themselves to be invited that they might see the man whom they called a wonder of generosity and goodness richard heard one of them say to the other ah sister this is a king of a man what pity there are not many such but harriet if there were an hundred of them we would not let one of them go into the city for a wife would we my dear  sir charles praised miss danby she was full of gratitude and of humility i suppose meek modest and humble are qualities of which men are mighty fond in women but matrimony and a sense of obligation are equally great humblers even of spirits prouder than that of miss danby as your poor charlotte can testify  the young gentlemen with the rest were to meet sir charles the bride and these ladies at st helens i think the church is called  as if wedlock were an honor the danby girl in respect to sir charles was to be first yoked he gave her away to the son galliard the father galliard gave his daughter to edward danby but first mr hervey gave his niece to the elder  one of the brides i forget which fainted away another halffainted  saved by timely salts the third poor soul wept heartily  as i suppose i shall do on tuesday  never surely was there such a matrimonypromoter as my brother god give me soon my revenge upon him in the same way  the procession afterward was triumphant  six coaches four silly souls in each and to mr poussins at enfield they all drove there they found another large company my brother was all cheerfulness and both men and women seemed to contend for his notice but they were much disappointed at finding he meant to leave them early in the evening  one married lady the wife of sir  somebody i am very bad at remembering the names of cityknights was resolved she said since they could not have sir charles to open the ball to have one dance before dinner with the handsomest man in england the music was accordingly called in and he made no scruple to oblige the company on a day so happy  do you know harriet that sir charles is supposed to be one of the finest dancers in england remember my dear that on tuesday  lord help me i shall be then stupid and remember nothing you take him out yourself and then you will judge for yourself of his excellence in this science  may we not call dancing a science if we judge by the few who perform gracefully in it i am sure we may and a difficult one too  sir charles it seems so much delighted everybody that they would not be denied his dancing with the bride that was so lately galliard who was known to be a fine dancer and when he had so done he took out the other two brides in turn  o  and remember harriet that you get somebody to call upon him to sing  you shall play  i believe i shall frget in that only agreeable moment of the day for you have a sweet finger my love that i am the principal fool in the play of the evening  o harriet i  how can i in the circumstances i am in write any more about these soft souls and silly come to me my love by day dawn and leave me not till  i dont know when come and take my part my dear i shall hate this man he does nothing but hop skip and dance about me grin and make mouths and everybody upholds him in it must this i hope not be the last time that i write myself to you  charlotte grandison  letter xiii miss byron to miss selby st jamesssquare friday morn april   sir charles grandison set out early this morning for lord ws in his way to lady mansfields i am here with this whimsical charlotte  lady l miss jervois myself and every female of the family or who do business for both sisters out of it are busy in some way or other preparatory to the approaching tuesday  miss grandison is the only idle person i tell her she is affectedly so  the earl has presented her in his sons name with some very rich trinkets very valuable jewels are also bespoke by lord g who takes lady ls advice in everything as one well read in the fashions new equipages are bespoke and gay ones they will be  miss grandison confounded me this morning by an instance of her generosity she was extremely urgent with me to accept as her third sister of her share of her mothers jewels you may believe that i absolutely refused such a present i was angry with her and told her she had but one way of making up with me and that was that since she would be so completely set out from her lord she would unite the two halves by presenting hers to lady l who had refused jewels from her lord on her marriage and who then would make an appearance occasionally as brilliant as her own  she was pleased with the hint and has actually given them unknown to anybody but me to her jeweller who is to dispose them in such figures as shall answer those she herself is to have which lady l has not and by this contrivance which will make them in a manner useless to herself she thinks she shall oblige her sister however reluctant to accept of them  lady gertrude is also preparing some fine presents for her niece elect but neither the delighted approbation of the family she is entering into nor the satisfaction expressed by her own friends give the perverse charlotte any visible joy nor procure for lord g the distinction which she ought to think of beginning to pay him but for his part never was man so happy he would however perhaps fare better from her if he could be more moderate in the outward expression of his joy which she has taken it into her head to call an insult upon her  she does not however give the scope she did before the day was fixed to her playful captiousness she is not quite so arch as she was thoughtfulness and a seeming carelessness of what we are all about for her appear in her countenance she saunters about and affects to be diverted by her harpsichord only what a whimsical thing is charlotte grandison but still she keeps lord g at distance i told her an hour ago that she knows not how to condescend to him with that grace which is so natural to her in her whole behavior to every body else  i have been talking to dr bartlett about sir charless journey to italy nobody knows he says what a bleeding heart is covered by a countenance so benign and cheerful sir charles grandison said he has a prudence beyond that of most young men but he has great sensiblities  i take it for granted sir that he will for the future be more an italian than englishman  impossible madam a prudent youth by traveling reaps this advantage  from what he sees of other countries he learns to prefer his own an imprudent one the contrary sir charless country is endeared to him by his long absence from it italy in particular is called the garden of europe but it is rather to be valued for what it was and might he than what it is i need not tell a lady who has read and conversed as you have done to what that incomparable difference is owing sir charles grandison is greatly sensible of it he loves his country with the judgment of a wise man and wants not the partiality of a patriot  but doctor he has offered you know to reside  there i stopped  true madam  and he will not recede from his offers if they are claimed but this uncertainty it is that disturbs him  i pity my patron i have often told you he is not happy what has indiscretion to expect when discretion has so much to suffer his only consolation is that he has nothing to reproach himself with inevitable evils he bears as a man should he makes no ostentation of his piety but madam sir charles grandison is a christian  you need not sir say more to me to exalt him and let me add that i have no small pleasure in knowing that clementina is a lady of strict piety though a roman catholic  and let me assure you madam that sir charless regard for miss byron his more than regard for her why should i not say since everybody sees it is founded upon her piety and upon the amiable qualities of her mind beauty madam is an accidental and transient good no man better knows how to distinguish between admiration and love than my patron his virtue is virtue upon full proof and against sensibilities that it is heroic to overcome lady olivia knows this and here i must acknowledge myself a debtor to you for three articles out of your ten i hope soon to discharge the obligation  your own time doctor but i must say that whenever you give me lady olivias story i shall be pained if i find that a clementina is considered by a beauty of an unhappier turn as her rival in the love of sir charles grandison  lady olivia madam admires him for his virtue but she cannot as he has made it his study to do divide admiration from love what offers has she not refused  but she declares that she had rather be the friend of sir charles grandison than the wife of the greatest prince on earth  this struck me have not i said something like it but surely with innocence of heart but here the doctor suggests that olivia has put his virtue to the proof yet i hope not  the friend dr bartlett  i hope that no woman who is not quite given up to dishonor will pollute the sacred word by affixing ideas to it that cannot be connected with it a friend is one of the highest characters that one human creature can shine in to another there may be love that though it has no view but to honor yet even in wedlock ripens not into friendship how poor are all such attachments how much beneath the exalted notion i have of that noblest that most delicate union of souls you wonder at me dr bartlett let me repeat to you sir i have it by heart sir charles grandisonss tender of friendship to the poor harriet byron which has given me such exalted ideas of this disinterested passion but you must not take notice that i have i repeated those words beginning my heart demands alliance with hers  and ending with these  so long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments see p    of this volume   the doctor was silent for a few moments at last what a delicacy is there in the mind of this excellent man yet how consistent with the exactest truth the friendship he offers you madam is indeed friendship what you have repeated can want no explanation yet it is expressive of his uncertain situation it is   he stopped of a sudden  pray doctor proceed i love to hear you talk  my good young ladymdashi may say too much sir charles in these nice points must be lest to himself it is impossible for anybody to express his thoughts as he can express them but let me say that he justly as well as greatly admires miss byron  my heart rose against myself bold harriet thought i how dare thou thus urge a good man to say more than he has a mind to say of the secrets of a friend which are committed to his keeping content thyself with the hopes that the worthiest man in the world would wish to call thee his were it not for an invincible obstacle and noble thrice noble clementina be thine the preference even in the heart of harriet byron because justice gives it to thee for harriet have thou not been taught to prefer right and justice to every other consideration and would thou abhor the thought of a common theft yet steal an heart that is the property and that by the dearest purchase of another  letter xiv miss byron in continuation friday evening we have had a great debate about the place in which the nuptial ceremony is to be performed charlotte the perverse charlotte insisted upon not going to church lord g dared not to give his opinion though his father and lady gertrude as well as every other person were against her  lord l said that if fine ladies thought so slightly of the office as that it might be performed anywhere it would be no wonder if fine gentlemen thought still more slightly of the obligation it laid them under  being appealed to i said that i thought of marriage as one of the most solemn acts of a womans life  and if of a womans of a mans surely interrupted lady l if your whimsey charlotte added she arises from modesty you reflect upon your sister and what is worse upon your mother  charlotte put up her pretty lip and was uncomvinced  lady gertrude laid an heavy hand upon the affectatation yet admires her niece elect she distinguished between chambervows and churchvows she mentioned the word decency she spoke plainer on charlottes unfeeling perverseness if a bride meant a compliment by it to the bridegroom o dear o dear said mrs eleanor grandison and looked as if she thought she blushed that was another thing but then let her declare as much and that she was in an hurry to oblige him  charlotte attempted to kill her by a look  she gave a worse to lord g  and why whispered she to him as he sat next her must thou show all thy teeth man  as lady gertrude meant to shame her i thought i could as soon forgive that lady as her who was the occasion of the freedom of speech  but still the was perverse she would not be married at all she said if she were not complied with  i whispered her as i sat on the other side of her i wish charlotte the knot were tied till then you will not do even right things but in a wrong manner  dr bartlett was not persent he was making a kind visit to my cousin reevess when he came in the debate was referred to him he entered into it with her with so much modesty good sense propriety and steadiness that at last the perverse creature gave way but hardly would neither had he not assured her that her brother would be entirely against her and that he himself must be excused performing the sacred office but in a sacred place she has set her heart on the doctors marrying her  the earl of g and lady gertrude as also lord and lady l went away not dissatisfied with charlottes compliance she is the most ungraciously graceful young woman i ever knew in her compliances but lord g was to pay for all she and i had got together in the study in bolted lord g perhaps with too little ceremony she colored  heyday sir who expected you his countenance immediately fell he withdrew precipitately fie charlotte said i recollect yourself  and rising stepped to the door my lord  calling after him  he came back but in a little ferment  i hoped i hoped madam as you were not in your own apartment that i might that i might have been   where ever ladies are by themselves it is a ladys apartment my lord said she with an haughtiness that sat better on her features than they would upon almost any other womans  he looked as if he knew not whether he should stay or go sit down my lord said i we are not particularly engaged he came nearer his hat under his arm bowing to her who sat as stately as a princess on her throne but yet looked disobliged you gave yourself pretty airs my lord  dont you  pretty airs madam  pretty airs  by my soul i think madam  and with such a glow in your face madam  taking his laced hat from under his arm and with an earnest motion swinging it backwards and forwards as unknowing what he did   what sir am i to be buffetted sir   he put his hat under his arm again  buffeted madam  would to heaven   what has heaven to do with your odd ways lord g  i beg pardon for intruding madam  but i thought   that you had a privilege sir  but marriage itself sir shall not give you a privilege to break into my retirements you thought sir  you could not think  so much the worse if you did   if i have really offended  i will be more circumspect for the future  i beg pardon madam  miss byron i hope will forgive me too  he was going in great discomposure and with an air of angry humility  charlotte whispered i  dont be silly   come come now you have broke in upon us you may stay  but another time when you know me to be retired with a friend so dear to me let it enter into your head that no third person unsent for can be welcome  poor man  how he loves her  his countenance changed at once to the humble placid he looked as if he had rather be in fault than she  oh how little did she make him look  but he has often as well as in this instance let her see her power over him i am afraid she will use it i now see it is and will be his misfortune that she can vex him without being vexed herself and what may he expect who can be treated with feigned displeasure which while it seems to be in earnest to him will be a jest to his wife  i was very angry with her when we were alone and told her that she would be an enemy i was afraid of her own happiness but she only laughed at me happiness my dear said she that only is happiness which we think so if i can be as happy in my way as you can be in yours shall i not pursue it your happiness child is in the still life i love not a dead calm now a tempest now a refreshing breeze i shall know how to enjoy the difference  my brother will not be here to turn jest into earnest as might perhaps be the effect of his mediation  but highho harriet that the first week were over and i had got into my throne  she ended with an italian air contrasted with another highho and left me for a few moments  poor lord g said i looking after her  she returned soon poor lord g repeated she those were the piteous words you threw after me  but if i should provoke him do you think he would not give me a cuff or so  you know he cannot return joke for joke and he must revenge himself some way  if that should be the case poor charlotte i hope you would say   not if you deserved it  deserve a cuff harriet  well but i am afraid i shall  remember next tuesday charlotte  you must vow obedience  will you break your vow  this is not a jesting matter  true harriet and that it is not was perhaps one of the reasons that made me disinclined to go to so solemn a place as the church with lord g  dont you think it one with those who insist upon being married in their own chamber  i believe great people said i think they must not do right things in the common way that seems to me to be one of their fantastic reasons but the vow is the vow charlotte god is everywhere  now you are so serious harriet it is time to have done with the subject  i have no sleep in my eyes and must go on what keeps me more wakeful is my real concern for this naughty miss grandison and my pity for lord g for the instance i have given you of her petulance is nothing to what i have seen but i thought so near the day she would have changed her behavior to him surely the situation her brother is in without any fault of his own might convince her that she need not go out of her path to pick up subjects for unhappiness  such a kittenish disposition in her i called it for it is not so much the love of power that predominates in her mind as the love of playfulness and when the fit is upon her she regards not whether it is a china cup or a cork that she pats and tosses about but her sport will certainly be the death of lord gs happiness pity that sir charles who only has power over her is obliged to go abroad so soon but she has principles lady grandisons daughter sir charles grandisons sister must have principles the solemnity of the occasion the office the church the altar  must strike her the vow  will she not regard the vow she makes in circumstances so awful could but my lord g assume dignity and mingle raillery with it and be able to laugh with her and sometimes at her she would not make him her sport she would find somebody else a butt she must have to shoot at but i am afraid he will be too sensible of her smartness and she will have her jest let who will suffer by it  some of the contents of your last are very agreeable to me lucy i will begin in earnest to think of leaving london dont let me look silly in your eyes my dear when i come it was not so very presumptuous in me was it to hope  when all his relations  when he himself  yet what room for hope did he could he give me he was honest and i cheated myself but then all you my dearest friends encouraged the cheat nay pointed my wishes and my hopes by yours before i had dared shall i say o condescended to own them to myself  you may let that greville know if your please that there is no room for his ifs nor of consequence any for his menaces you may own that i shall soon be in northamptonshire this may prevent his and fenwicks threatened journey to town  but lucy though my heart has been ever dutifully as i may say open to the venerable domestic circle though it would not have been an honest heart could it circumstanced as i was have concealed itself from lady d and must have been an impenetrable one indeed if it could have been disguised to the two sisters here  yet i beseech you my dear almost on my knees i beseech you let not the audacious the insulting greville have ground given him to suspect a weakness in your harriet which indelicate minds know not how to judge of delicately for sexsake for examplesake lucy let it not be known to any but the partial friendly few that our grandmamma shirleys child and aunt selbys niece has been a volunteer in her affections how many still more forward girls would plead mrs shirleys approbation of the hasty affection without considering the circumstances and the object so the next girl that run away to a dancing master or an ensign would reckon herself one of harriets school  poor mr orme i am sorry he is not well it is cruel in you lucy at this time to say so undoubtingly that his illness is owing to his love of me you knew that such a suggestion would pain me heaven restore mr orme  but i am vexed as it cannot be to purpose that sir charles grandison and i have been named together and talked of in your neighborhood  he will be gone abroad i shall return to northamptonshire and shall look so silly so like a refused girl  everybody gives me to him you say  so much the worse i wonder what business this everybody has to trouble itself about me  one consolation however i shall have in my return and that is in my nancys recovered health which was so precarious when i set out for london  but i shall have nothing to entertain you with when i am with you sir charles grandison lord and lady l lady g as now in three or four days she will be my dear miss jervois dr bartlett will be all my subject and have i not exhausted that by pen and ink o no the doctor promises to correspond with me and he makes no doubt but sir charles will correspond with him as usual  what can the unusually tender friendship be called which he professed for me and as i may say claimed in return from me i know that he has no notion of the love called platonic nor have i i think it in general a dangerous allowance and with regard to our sex a very unequal one since while the man has nothing to fear the woman has everything from the privileges that may be claimed in an acknowleged confidence especially in presence miss grandison thus interprets what he said and strengthens her opinion by some of dr bartletts late intimations that he really loves me but not being at liberty to avow his love he knew not what to say and so went as near to a declaration as was possible to do in his circumstances  but might i not expect from such a profession of friendship in sir charles an offer of correspondence in absence and if he made the offer ought i to decline it would it not indicate too much on my side were i to do so  and does it not on his if he make not the offer he corresponds with mrs beaumont nobody thinks that anything can be meant by that correspondence on either side because mrs beaumount must be at least forty sir charles but six or seven and twenty but if he makes not the request to harriet who is but little more than twenty what after such professions of a friendship so tender will be inferred from his forbearance  but i shall puzzle myself and you too lucy if i go on with this sort of reasoning because i shall not know how to put all i mean into words have i not already puzzled you i think my expression is weak and perplexed  but this offered and accepted friendship between two persons not indelicate must be perplexing since he is the only young man in the world from whom a woman has no dishonor to fear  ah lucy  it would be vanity in me would it not to suppose that he had more to fear from harriet than she has from him  as the virtue of either i hope is not questionable but the event of his italian visit will explain and reconcile everthing  i will encourage a drowsy fit that seems to be stealing upon me if i have not written with the perspicuity i always aim at allow lucy for the time of night for spirits not high and for the subject that having its delicacies as well as uncertainties i am not able to write clearly upon it  letter xv miss byron in continuation saturday night april   sir charles is already returned he arrived at windsor on friday morning but found that lord w had fet out the afternoon of the day before for the house of his friend sir joseph lawrance which is but fifteen miles from mansfieldhouse  upon this intelligence sir charles wanting to return to town as soon as he could followed him to the knights and having time enough himself to reach mansfieldhouse that night he by his uncles consent pursued his journey thither to the great joy of the family who wished for his personal introduction of my lord to miss mansfield  my lord arrived by breakfasttime unfatigued and in high spirits staid at mansfieldhouse all day and promised so to manage as to be in town tomorrow in order to be present at his nieces nuptials on tuesday  as for sir charles he made the mansfield family happy in his company the whole friday evening enquiring into their affairs relating to the oppression they lay under pointing out measures for redress encouraging miss mansfield and informing the brothers that the lawyers he had consulted on their deeds told him that a new trial might be hoped for the result of which probably would be a means to do them justice so powerfully protected and assisted as they would now be for new lights had broke in upon them and they wanted but to recover a deed which they understood was in the hands of two gentlemen named hartley who were but lately returned from the indies thus prepared the mansfields also were in high spirits the next morning and looked sir charles said on each other when they met as if they wanted to tell each other their agreeable dreams  sir charles in his way to sir joseph lawrances had looked in upon sir harry beauchamp and his lady he found sir harry in high spirits expecting the arrival of his son who was actually landed from calais having met there his fathers letter allowing him to return to england and wishing in his own and in lady beauchamps name his speedy arrival  sir charless impatience to see his friend permitted him only to breakfast with my lord and the mansfields and to know the opinion each party formed of the other on this first interview and then he set out to sir harry beauchamps what an activity  heaven reward him with the grant of his own wishes whatever they be and make him the happiest of men  my lord is greatly taken with the lady and her whole family well be may sir charles says he blessed him and called himself blessed in his sisters son for his recommendation of each to the other the lady thinks better of him as her mother owned to sir charles than she thought she should from report  i begin to think lucy that those who set out for happiness are most likely to find it when they live single till the age of fancy is over those who marry while it lasts are often disappointed of that which they propose so largely to themselves while those who wed for convenience and deal with tolerable honesty by each other are at a greater certainty tolerable i repeat since it seems we are not to expect that both parties will turn the best side of the old garment outward hence arises consolation to old maidens and cautions against precipitation  expatiate my dear on this fruitful subject i would were i at leisure  sir charles says that he doubts not but lord w will be as happy a man as he wishes to be in less than a month  the duce is in this brother of mine whispered miss grandison to me for huddling up of marriages he dont consider that ther ay be two chances for one  honest  n half a years time bles  conti  sir charles told us that he had desired lord w to give out everywhere that the adversaries of the mansfield family might know it his intended alliance and that he and his nephew were both determined to procure a retrospection of all former proceedings  sir charles got to sir harry beauchamps a little before his friend arrived sir harry took him aside at his alighting and told him that lady beauchamp had had clouds on her brow all the day and he was afraid would not receive his son with the graciousness that once he hoped for from her but that he left him to manage with her she never said he had so high an opinion either of man or woman as she has of you  sir charles addressed himself to her as not doubting her goodness upon the foot of their former conversation and praised her for the graces that however appeared but faintly in her countenance till his compliments lighted them up and made them shine full out in it he told her that his sister and lord g were to be married on the following tuesday he himself he said should set out for paris on friday after but hoped to see a family intimacy begun between his sisters and lady beauchamp and between their lords and sir harry and mr beauchamp he applauded her on the generosity of her intentions as declared to him in their former conference and congratulated her on the power she had of which she made so noble an use of laying at the same time an obligation on the tenderest of husbands and the most deserving of sons whose duty to her he engaged for  all this set her in high good humor and she took to herself and bridled upon it to express myself in charlottes manner the praises and graces this adroit manager gave her as if they were her unquestionable due  this agreeable way they were all in sir harry transported with his ladys goodness when mr beauchamp arrived  the young gentleman bent his knee to his stepmother as well as to his father and thanked her for the high favors his father had signified to him by letter that he owed to her goodness she confirmed them but sir charles observed with an ostentation that showed she thought very highly of her own generosity  they had a very cheerful evening not one could would hang on lady beauchamps brow though once or twice it seemed a little overshadowed as mr beauchamp displayed qualities for which his father was too ready to admire him sir charles thought it necessary to caution sir harry on this subject putting it in this light that lady beauchamp loved her husband so well that she would be too likely to dread a rivalry in his affections from a son so very accomplished sir harry took the hint kindly  mr beauchamp was under a good deal of concern at sir charless engagements to leave england so soon after his arrival and asked his fathers leave to attend him sir harry declared that he could not part with him sir charles chid his friend and said it was not quite so handsome a return to the joyful reception he had met with from lady beauchamp and his father as might have been expected from his beauchamp bowing to the lady but she excused the young gentleman and said she wondered not that anybody who was favored with his friendship should be unwilling to be separated from him  sir charles expresses great satisfaction in mr beauchamps being arrived before his departure that he may present to us himself a man with whom he is sure we shall all be delighted and leave him happy in that beloved society which he himself is obliged to quit  a repining temper lucy would consider only the hardship of meeting a longabsent friend just to feel the uneasiness of a second parting but this man views everything in a right light when his own happiness is not to be attained he lays it out of his thoughts and as i have heretofore observed rejoices in that of others it is a pleasure to see how sir charles seems to enjoy the love which dr bartlett expresses for his friend of them both  sir charles addressed himself to him on several occasions in so polite in so tender a manner that every one told me afterward they are sure he loves me dr bartlett at the time as he sat next me whispered on the regret expressed by all on losing him so soon  ah madam  i know and pity my patrons struggles  struggles lucy what could the doctor mean by this whisper to me but i hope he guesses not at mine if he does would he have whispered his pity of sir charles to me  come lucy this is some comfort however and i will endeavor to be brave upon it that i may not by my weakness lessen myself in the doctors good opinion  it was agreed for charlotte whose assent was given in these words  do as you will  or rather as my brother will  what signifies opposing him that the nuptials shall be solemnized as privately as possible at st georges church the company is to drop in at different doors and with as few attendants as may be lord w the earl of g and lady gertrude lord and lady l miss jervois and your harriet are to be present at the ceremony i was very earnest to be excused till miss grandison when we were alone dropped down on one knee and held up her hands to beg me to accompany her mr everard grandison if he can be found is to be also there at sir charless desire  dr bartlett as i before hinted at her earnest request is to perform the ceremony sir charles wished it to be at his own parish church but miss grandison thought it too near to be private he was indifferent as to the place he said  so it was at church for he had been told of the difficulty we had to get charlotte to desist from having it performed in her chamber and seemed surprised  fie charlotte said be  an office so solemn  vows to reeive and ay as in the divine presence   she was glad she told me that she had not left that battle to be fought with him  monday april  0 lord w is come lord and lady l are here they and miss grandison received him with great respect he embraced his nieces in a very affectionate manner sir charles was absent lord w is in person and behavior a much more agreeable man than i expected him to be nor is he so decrepit with the gout as i had supposed he is very careful of himself it seems this world has been kind to him and i fancy he makes a great deal of a little pain for want of stronger exercises to his patience and so is a sufferer by selfindulgence had i not been made acquainted with his free living and with the insults he bore from mrs giffard with a spirit so poor and so low i should have believed i saw not only the man of quality but the man of sense in his countenance i endeavored however as much as i could to look upon him as the brother of the late lady grandison had he been worthy of that relation how should i have reverenced him  but whatever i thought of him he was highly taken with me he particularly praised me for the modesty which he said was visible in my countenance free livers lucy taken with that grace in a woman which they make it their pride to destroy but all men good and bad admire modesty in a woman and i am sometimes out of humor with our sex that they do not as generally like modesty in men i am sure that this grace in sir charles grandison is one of his principal glories with me it emboldens ones heart and permits one to behave before him with ease and as i may say with security in the consciousness of a right intention  but what were lord ws praises of his nephew he called him the glory of his sex and of human nature how the cheeks of the dear emily glowed at the praises given to her guardian  she was the taller for them when she moved it was on tiptoe stealing as it were cross the floor lest she should lose anything that was said on a subject to delightful to her  my lord was greatly pleased with her too he complimented her as the beloved ward of the best of guardians he lamented with us the occasion that called his nephew abroad he was full of his own engagements with miss mansfield and declared that his nephew should guide and govern him as he pleased in every material case respecting either the conduct of his future life or the management and disposition of his estate declaring that he had made his will and reserving only his ladys jointure and a few legacies had left everything to him  how right a thing even in policy is it my dear to be a good and a generous man  i must not forget that my lord wished with all his soul that was his expression that he might have the honor of giving to his nephew my hand in marriage  i could feel myself blush i halfsuppressed a sigh i would have wholly suppressed it if i could i recovered the little confusion his too plainly expressed wish gave me by repeating to myself the word clementina  this charlotte is a great coward but i dare not tell her so for fear of a retort i believe i should be as great a one in her circumstances so few hours to one of the greatest events of ones life but i pretend not to bravery yet hope that in the cause of virtue or honor i should be found to have a soul  i write now at my cousins i came hither to make an alteration in my dress i have promised to be with the sweet bully early in the morning of her important day   letter xvi miss byron in continuation tuesday night wednesday morning april       miss grandison is no longer to be called by that name she is lady g may she make lord g as happy as i dare say he will make her if it be not her own fault  i was early with her according to promise i found her more affected than she was even last night with her approaching change of condition her brother had been talking to her she said and had laid down the duties of the state she was about to enter into in such a serious manner and made the performance of them of so much importance to her happiness both here and hereafter that she was terrified at the thoughts of what she was about to undertake she had never considered matrimony in that formidable light before he had told her that he was afraid of her vivacity yet was loath to discourage her cheerfulness or to say anything that should lower her spirits all he besought of her was to regard times tempers and occasions and then it would be impossible but her lively humor must give delight not only to the man whom she favored with her hand but to every one who had the pleasure of approaching her if charlotte said he you would have the world around you respect your husband you must set the example while the wife gives the least room to suspect that she despises her husband she will find that she subjects him to double contempt if he resents it not and if he does can you be happy aggressors lay themselves open to severe reprisals if you differ you will be apt to make bystanders judges over you they will remember when you are willing to forget and your fame will be the sport of those beneath you as well in understanding as degree  she believed she told me that lord g had been making some complaints of her if he had   hush my dear said i  not one word of threatening are you more solicitous to conceal your fault than to mend it  no  but you know harriet for a man before he has experienced what sort of a wife i shall make to complain against me for foibles in courtship when he can help himself if he will has something so very little   your conscience charlotte tells you that he had reason for complaint and therefore you think he has complained think the best of lord g for your own reputations sake since you thought fit to go thus far with him you have borne nothing from him he has borne a great deal from you  i am fretful harriet i will not be chidden i will be comforted by you you shall sooth me are you not my sister she threw her arms round me and kissed my check  i ventured to railly her though i was afraid of her retort and met with it but i thought it would divert her i am glad my dear said i that you are capable of this tenderness of temper you blustering girls  but fear i believe will make cowards loving  harriet said she and flung from me to the window remember this may i soon see you in the same situation i will then have no mercy upon you  the subject which sir charles led to at breakfast was the three weddings of thursday last he spoke honorably of marriage and made some just compliments to lord and lady l concluding them with wishes that his sister charlotte and lord g might be neither more nor less happy than they were then turning to lord w he said he questioned not his lordships happiness with the lady he had so lately seen for i cannot doubt said he of your lordships affectionate gratitude to her if she behaves as i am sure she will  my lord had tears in his eyes never man had such a nephew as i have said he said he all the joy of my present prospects all the comforts of my future life are and will be owing to you  here had he stopped it would have been well but turning to me he unexpectedly said would to god madam that you could reward him i cannot and nobody else can  all were alarmed for me every eye was upon me a sickishness came came over my heart  i know not how to describe it my head sunk upon my bosom i could hardly sit yet was less able to rise  sir charless face was overspread with blushes he bowed to my lord may the man said he who shall have the honor to call miss byron his be if possible as deserving as she is then will they live together the life of angels  he gracefully looked down not at me and i got a little courage to look up yet lady l was concerned for me so was lord l emilys eye dropped a tear upon her blushing cheek  was it not lucy a severe trial  indeed it was  my lord to mend the matter lamented very pathetically that sir charles was under an obligation to go abroad and still more that he could not stay to be present at the celebration of his nuptials with miss mansfield  the earl lord g lady gertrude and the doctor were to meet the bride and us at church lord and lady l sir charles and emily went in one coach miss grandison and i in another  as we went i dont like this affair at all harriet said she my brother has long made all other men indifferent to me such an infinite difference  can anybody be happier than lord and lady l charlotte yet lady l admires her brother as much as you can do  they happy  and so they are but lady l soft soul fell in love with lord l before my brother came over so the foundation was laid and it being a first flame with her she in compliment to herself could not but persevere but the sorry creature anderson proving a sorry creature made me despise the sex and my brothers perfections contributed to my contempt of all other men  indeed my dear you are wrong lord g loves you but were sir charles not your brother it is not very certain that he would have returned your love  why that is true i believe he would not in that case have chosen me i am sure he would not if he had known you but for the man one loves one can do anything be everything that he would wish one to be  do you think you cannot love lord g  for heavens sake charlotte though you are now almost within sight of the church do not think of giving your hand if you cannot resolve to make lord g as happy as i have no doubt he will make you if it be not your own fault  what will my brother say what will   leave that to me i will engage sir charles and dr bartlett to lend me their ear in the vestry and i am sure your brother if he knows that you have an antipathy to lord g or that you think you caonot be happy with him will undertake your cause and bring you off  antipathy that is a strong word harriet the man is a good natured silly man   silly charlotte  silly then he must be for loving you so well who really have never yet given him an opportunity to show his importance with you  i do pity him sometimes  the coach stopped  ah lord harriet the church the church  say charlotte before you step out  shall i speak to your brother and dr bartlett in the vestry  i shall look like a fool either way  dont act like one charlotte on this solemn occasion say you will deserve that you will try to deserve lord gs love  lord help me  my brother  i will try i will try what can be done  sir charles appeared he gave each his hand in turn in we flew the people began to gather about us lord g all rapture received her at the entrance sir charles led me and the earl and lady gertrude received us with joy in their countenances i overheard the naughty one say as lord g led her up to the altar you dont know what you are about man i expect to have all my way remember that is one of my articles before marriage  he returned her an answer of fond assent to her condition i am afraid thought i poor lord g you will be more than once reminded of this previous article  when she was led to the altar and lord g and she stood together she trembled leave me not harriet said the  brother lady l  i am sure she looked silier than lord g at that instant  the good doctor began the office no dearly belaveds harriet whispered she as i had said on a really terrible occasion i was offended with her in my heart again she whispered something against the office as the doctor proceeded to give the reasons for the institution her levity did not forsake her even at that solemn moment  when the service was over every one sir charles in a solemn and most affectionate manner wished her happy my lord g kissed her hand with a bent knee  she took my hand ah lord what have i done  and am i married whispered she  and can it never be undone  and is that the man to whom i am to be obedient  is he to be my lord and master  ah lady g said i it is a solemn office you have vowed he has vowed  it is a solemn office  lord g led her to the first coach sir charles led me into the same the people to my great confusion whispered that is the bride what a charming couple sir charles handed miss emily next lord g came in as he was entering harkee friend said charlotte and put out her hand you mistake the coach you are not of our company  the whole world replied my lord shall not now divide us and took his seat on the same side with emily  the mans a rogue harriet whispered she see he gives himself airs already  this said lord g as the coach drove on taking one hand and eagerly kissing it is the hand that blessed me  and that said she pushing him from her with the other is the hand that repulses your forwardness what came you in here for  dont be silly  he was in raptures all the way  when he came home everyone embraced and wished joy to the bride the earl and lady gertrude were in high spirits the lady resaluted her niece as her dear niece the earl recognized his beloved daughter  but prepare to hear a noble action of lord w  when he came up to compliment her  my dearest niece said he i wish you joy with all my soul i have not been a kind uncle there is no fastening anything on your brother accept of this and he put a little paper into her hand  it was a banknote of  000 l my sisters daughter and your brothers sister merits more than this  was not this handsomely presented lucy  he then in a manner becoming lady grandisons brother stepped to lady l my niece charlotte is not my only niece i wish you my dear as if this was your day of marriage all happiness accept these two papers the one lucy was a note for  000 l and the other for  00 l and he said the lesser note is due to you for interest on the greater  when the ladies opened their notes and saw what they were they were at first at a loss what to say  it was most gracefully done but see lucy the example of a good and generous man can sometimes alter natures and covetous men i have heard it observed when their hearts are opened often act nobly  as soon as lady g so now i must call her recovered herself from the surprise into which my lords present and address had put her she went to him allow me my lord said she and bent one knee to him to crave your blessing and at the same time to thank you for your paternal present to your ever obliged charlotte  god bless you my dear saluting her  but thank your noble brother you delight me with your graceful acceptance  lady l came up my lord you overcome me by your bounty  how shall i   your brothers princely spirit lady l said he makes this present look mean forgive me only that it was not done before and he saluted her  lord l came up lady l showed him the opened notes  see here my lord said she what lord w has done and he calls this the interest due on that  your lordship oppresses me with your goodness to your niece said lord l may health longlife and happiness attend you in your own nuptials  there there said lord w pointing to sir charles who had withdrawn and then entered make your acknowlegement his noble spirit has awakened mine it was only asleep my late sisters brother wanted but the force of such an example that son is all his mother  sir charles joining them having heard only the last words  if i am thought a son not unworthy of the most excellent of mothers said he and by her brother i am happy  then you are happy replied my lord  her memory resumed sir charles i cherish and when i have been tempted to forget myself that memory has been a means of keeping me steady in my duty her precepts my lord were the guide of my early youth had i not kept them in mind how much more blameable than most young men had i been  my charlotte have that mother in your memory on this great change of your condition you will not be called to her trials  his eyes glistend tender be our remembrance of my father  charlotte be worthy of your mother  he withdrew with an air so noble  but soon returning with a cheerful look he was told what lord w had done  your lordship was before said he entitled to our duty by the ties of blood but what is the relation of body to that of mind you have bound me for my sisters and that still more by the manner than by the act in a bond of gratitude that never can be broken  thank yourself thank yourself my noble nephew  encourage my lord a family intimacy between your lady and her nieces and nephews you will be delighted my sisters with miss mansfield but when she obliges my lord with her hand you will reverence your aunt i shall have a pleasure when i am far distant in contemplating the family union your lordship must let me know your day in time and i will be joyful upon it whatever of a contrary nature i may have to struggle with on my own account  my lord wept  my lord wept did i say  not one of us had a dry eye  this was a solemn scene you will say for a wedding day but how delightfully do such scenes dilate the heart  the day however was not forgotten as a day of festivity sir charles himself by his vivacity and openness of countenance made every one joyful and except that nowandthen a sigh which could not be checked stole from some of us to think that he would so soon be in another country far distant from the friends he now made happy and engaged in difficulties perhaps in dangers every heart was present to the occasion of the day  o charlotte dear lady g hitherto it is in your power to make every future day worthy of this  have your mother your noble mother in your memory my dear and give credit to the approtion of such a brother  i should have told you that my cousin reevess came about two and were received with the utmost politeness by everybody  sir charles was called out just before dinner and returned introducing a young gentleman dressed as if for the day  this is an earlier favor than i had hoped for said sir charles and leading him to lady g this sir is the queen of the day my dear lady g welcome the house is yours  welcome the man i love welcome my beauchamp  every one except emily and me crowded about mr beauchamp as sir charless avowedly beloved friend and bid him cordially welcome sir charles presented him to each by name  then leading him to me  i am half ashamed lucy to repeat  but take it as he spoke it  revere said he my dear friend that excellent young lady but let not your admiration stop at her face and person she has a mind as exalted my beauchamp as your own miss byron in honor to my sister and of us all has gilded this day by her presence  mr beauchamp respectfully took my hand forgive me madam bowing upon it  i do revere you the lady whom sir charles grandison admires as he does you must be the first of women  i might have said that he who was so eminently distinguished as the friend of sir charles grandison must be a most valuable man but my spirits were not high i courtesied to his compliment and was silent  sir charles presented emily to him  my emily beauchamp i hope to live to see her happily married the man whose heart is but half so worthy as hers must be an excellent man  modesty might look up and be sensible to compliments from the lips of such a man emily looked at me with pleasure as if she had said do you hear madam what a fine thing my guardian has said of me  sir charles asked mr beauchamp how he stood with my lady beauchamp  very well answered he after such an introduction as you had given me to her i must have been to blame had i not she is my fathers wife i must respect her were she ever so unkind to me she is not without good qualities were every family so happy as to have sir charles grandison for a mediator when misunderstandings happened there would be very few lasting differences among relations my father and mother tell me that they never sit down to table together but they bless you and to me they have talked of nobody else but lady beauchamp depends upon your promise of making her acquainted with the ladies of your family  my sisters and their lords will do honor to my promise in my absence lady l lady g let me recommend to you lady beauchamp as more than a common visiting acquaintance do you sir to mr beauchamp see it cultivated  mr beauchamp is an agreeable and when sir charles grandison is not in company handsome and genteel man i think my dear that i do but the same justice that every body would do in this exception he is cheerful lively yet modest and not too full of words one sees both love and respect in every look he casts upon his friend and that he is delighted when he hears him speak be the subject what it will he once said to lord w who praised his nephew to him as he does to everybody near him the universal voice my lord is in his favor wherever he goes every one joins almost in the same words in different countries allowing for the different languages that for sweetness of manners and manly dignity he hardly ever had his equal  sir charles was then engaged in talk with his emily she before him he standing in an easy genteel attitude leaning against the wainscot listening smiling to her prattle with looks of indulgent love as a father might do to a child he was fond of while she looked back every nowandthen toward me so proud poor dear of being singled out by her guardian  she tript to me afterward and leaning over my shoulder as i sat whispered  i have been begging of my guardian to use his interest with you madam to take me down with you to northamptonshire  and what is the result  she paused  has he denied your request  no madam  has he allowed you to go my dear if i comply turning half round to her with pleasure  she paused and seemed at a loss i repeated my question  why no he has not consented neither  but he said such charming things so obliging so kind both of you and of me that i forgot my question though it was so near my heart but i will ask him again  and thus lucy can he decline complying and yet send away a requester so much delighted with him as to forget what her request was  miss grandison  lady g i would say  singled me out soon after  this beauchamp is really a very pretty fellow harriet  he is an agreeable man answered i  so i think she said no more of him at that time  between dinner and tea at lady ls motion they made me play on the harpsichord and after one lesson they besought sir charles to sing to my playing he would not he said deny any request that was made him on that day  he sung he has a mellow manly voice and great command of it  this introduced a little concert mr beauchamp took the violin lord l the bassviol lord g the germanflute lord w sung base lady l lady g and the earl joined in the chorus the song was from alexanders feast the words happy happy happy pair none but the good deserves the fair sir charles though himself equally brave and good preserring the latter word to the former  lady l had always insisted upon dancing at her sisters wedding we were not company enough for country dances but music having been ordered and the performers come it was insisted upon that we should have a dance though we were engaged in a conversation that i thought infinitely more agreeable  lord g began with dancing a minuet with his bride she danced charmingly but on my telling her so afterward she whispered me that she should have performed better had she danced with her brother lord g danced extremely well  lord l and lady gertrude mr beauchamp and mrs reeves mr reeves and lady l danced all of them very agreeably  the earl took me out but we had hardly done when asking pardon for disgracing me as he too modestly expressed himself he and all but my cousins and emily called out for sir charles to dance with me  i was abashed at the general voice calling upon us both but it was obeyed  he deserved all the praises that miss gran  lady g i would say gave him in her letter to me and had every ones silent applause while we danced so silent that a whisper must have been heard and when he lead me to my seat every one clapped their hands as at some wellperformed part or fine sentiment in a play  lord bless me my dear this man is everything but his conversation has ever been among the politest people of different nations  lord w wished himself able from his gout to take out miss jervois the bridegroom was called upon by sir charles and he took out the good girl who danced very prettily i fansied that he chose to call out lord g rather than mr beauchamp he is the most delicate and considerate of men  sir charles was afterward called upon by the bride herself and she danced then with a grace indeed i was pleased that she could perform so well at her own wedding  once more he and i were called upon he whisperingly as if all the approbation so loudly given before when we danced together was due to me and none to himself conditioned for me with every one that no notice should be taken of my performance for he saw that i could hardly stand the applauses given on our dancing before  sir charles when we had done called me inimitable the word was caught by every mouth and i sat down with reason enough for pride if their praises could have elevated me but i was not proud my spirits were not high  i fansy lucy that lady clementina is a fine dancer  supper was not ready till twelve mr reevess coach came about that hour but we got not away till two perhaps the company would not have broke up so soon had not the bride been perverse and refused to retire was she not at home she asked lady l who was put upon urging her and should she leave her company  she would make me retire with her she took a very affectionate leave of me  marriage lucy is an awful rite it is supposed to be a joyful solemnity but on the womans side it can be only so when she is given to the man she loves above all the men in the world and even to her the anniversary day when doubt is turned into certainty must be much happier than the day itself what a victim must that woman look upon herself to be who is compelled or even overpersuaded to give her hand to a man who has no share in her heart ought not a parent or guardian in such a circumstance especially if the child has a delicate an honest mind to be chargeable with all the unhappy consequences that may follow from such a cruel compulsion  but this is not the case with miss grandison early she cast her eye on an improper object her pride convinced her in time of the impropriety and this as she owns gave her an difference to all men she hates not lord g there is no man whom she prefers to him and in this respect may perhaps be upon a par with eight women out of twelve who marry and yet make not bad wives as she played with her passion till she lost it she may be happy if she will and since she intended to be some time or other lady g her brother was kind in persuading her to shorten her days of coquetting and teazing and allow him to give her to lord g before he went abroad  letter xvii miss byron in continuation wednesday april    dr bardett was so good as to breakfast with my cousins and me this morning he talks of setting out for grandisonhall on saturday or monday next we have settled a correspondence and he gives me hope that he will make me a visit in northamptonshire i know you will all rejoice to see him  emily came in before the doctor went she brought me the compliments of the bride and lord w with their earnest request that i would dine with them sir charles was gone she said to make a farewell visit to the danby set but would be at home at dinner  it would be better for me i think lucy to avoid all opportunities of seeing him dont you think so  there is no such thing as seeing him with indifference but so earnestly invited how could i deny  my cousins were also invited but having engaged to be at home in the afternoon they excused themselves  miss jervois whispered me at parting i never before said she had an opportunity to observe the behavior of a newmarried couple to each other but is it customary madam for the bride to be more snappish as the bridegroom is more obliging  lady g is very naughty my dear if she so behaves as to give you reason to ask this question  she does and upon my word i see more obedience where it was not promised than where it was dear madam is not what is said at church to be thought of afterward but why did not the doctor make her speak out what signified bowing except a woman was so bashful that she could not speak  the bowing my dear is an assent it is as efficacious as words lord g only bowed you know could you like to be called upon emily to speak out  why no but then i would be very civil and goodnatured to my husband if it were but for fear he should be cross to me but i should think it my duty as well  sweet innocent  she went away and left the doctor with me  when our hearts are set upon a particular subject how impertinent how much beside the purpose do we think every other i wanted the doctor to talk of sir charles grandison but as he fell not into the subject and as i was afraid he would think me to be always leading him into it if i began it i suffered him to go away at his first motion i never knew him so shy upon it however  sir charles returned to dinner he has told lady l who afterward told us that he had a hint from mr galhard senior that if he were not engaged in his affections he was commissioned to make him a very great proposal in behalf of one of the young ladies he had seen the thursday before and that from her father  surely lucy we may pronounce without doubt that we live in an age in which there is a great dearth of good men that so many offers sall to the lot of one but i am thinking it is no small advantage to sir charles that his time is so taken up that he cannot stay long enough in any company to suffer them to cast their eyes on other objects with distinction he left the numerous assembly at enfield while they were in the height of their admiration of him attention love admiration cannot be always kept at the stretch you will observe lucy that on the return of a longabsent dear friend the rapture lasts not more than an hour gladdened as the heart is the friend received and the friend receiving perhaps in less than that time can sit down quietly together to hear and to tell stories of what has happened to either in the ongregretted absence it will be so with us lucy when i return to the arms of my kind friends and now does not sir charless proposed journey to italy endear his company to us  the earl of g lady gertrude and two agreeable nieces of that noblemans were here at dinner lady g behaved pretty well to her lord before them but i who understood the language of her eyes saw them talk very saucily to him on several occasions my lord is a little officious in his obligingness which takes off from that graceful and polite frankess which so charmingly on all occasions distinguishes one happy man who was then present lord g will perhaps appear more to advantage in that persons absence  mr beauchamp was also present he is indeed an agreeable a modest young man he appeared to great advantage as well in his conversation as by his behavior and not the less for subscribing in both to the superiority of his friend who nevertheless endeavored to dr him out as the first man  after dinner lady l lady g and i found an opportunity to be by ourselves for one halfhour lady g asked lady l what she intended to do with the thousand poun with which lord w had so generously presented her  do with it my dear  what do you think i inend to do with it  it is already disposed of  i will be hanged said lady g if this good creature has not given it to her husband  indeed charlotte i have i gave it to him before i slept  i thought so she laughed  and lord l took it did he  to be sure he did i should otherwise have been displeased with him  dear good soul  and so you gave him a thousand pounds to take part of it back from him by four or five paltry guineas at a time at his pleasure  lord l and i charlotte have but one purse you may perhaps know how we manage it  pray good meek dependent creature how do you manage it  thus charlotte my lord knows that his wife and he have but one interest and from the first of our happy marriage he would make me take one key as he has another of the private drawer where his money and moneybills lie there is a little memorandumbook in the drawer in which he enters on one page the money he receives on the opposite the money he takes out and when i want money i have recourse to my key if i see but little in the drawer i am the more moderate or perhaps if my want is not urgent defer the supplying of it till my lord is richer but little or much i minute down the sum as he himself does and so we know what we are about and i never put it out of my lords power by my unseasonable expenses to preserve that custom of his for which he is as much respected as well served not to suffer a demand to be twice made upon him where he is a debtor  good soul  and pray dont you minute down too the use to which you put the money you take out  indeed i often do always indeed when i take out more than five guineas at one time i found my lord did so and i followed the example of my own accord  happy pair said i  o lady g what a charming example is this  i hope you will follow it  thank you harriet for your advice why i cannot but say that this is one pretty way of coaxing each other into frugality but dont you think that where an honest pair are so tender of disobliging and so studious of obliging each other that they seem to confess that the matrimonial good understanding hangs by very slender threads  and do not the tenderest friendships said i hang by as slender can delicate minds be united to each other but by delicate observances  why thou art a good soul too harriet  and so you would both have me make a present to lord g of my thousand pounds before we have chosen our private drawer before he has got two keys made to it  let him know charlotte what lord l and i do if you think the example worth following  and then   ay and then give him my thousand pounds for a beginning lady l  but see you not that this proposal should come from him not from me  and should we not let each other see a little of each others merits first  see first the merits of the man you have married charlotte  yes lady l  but yesterday married you know can there be a greater difference between any two men in the world than there often is between the same man a lover and an hustand  and now my generous advisers be pleased to continue silent you cannot answer me fairly and besides wot ye not the indelicacy of an early present which you are not obliged to make  we were both silent each expecting the other to answer the strange creature  she laughed at us both soft souls and tender said she let me tell you that there is more in delicacy than you very delicate people are aware of  you charlotte said lady l have odder notions than any body else had you been a man you would have been a sad rake  a rake perhaps i might have been but not a sad one lady l  lady g cannot help being witty said i it is sometimes her misfortune sometimes ours that she cannot however i highly approve of the example set by lord l and followed by lady l  and so do i harriet and when lord g sets the example i shall  consider of it i am not a bad oeconomist had i ten thousand pounds in my hands i would not be extravagant had i but one hundred i would not be mean i value not money but as it enables me to lay an obligation instead of being under the necessity of receiving one i am my mothers daughter and brothers sister and yours lady l in this particular and yours too harriet different means may be taken to arrive at the same end lord g will have no reason to be dissatisfied with my prudence in moneymatters although i should not make him one of my best courtesies as if  as if  and she laughed but checking herself i were conscious  again she laughed  that i had signed and sealed to my absolute dependence on his bounty  what a mad creature said lady l but my harriet dont you think that she behaved pretty well to lord g at table  yes answered i as those would think who observe not her arch looks but she gave me pain for her several times and i believe her brother was not without his apprehensions  he had his eyes upon you harriet replied lady g more earnestly than he had upon me or anybody else  that is true said lady l i looked upon both him and you my dear with pity my tears were ready to start more than once to reflect how happy you two might be in each other and how greatly you would love each other were it not   not one word more on this subject dear lady l i cannot bear it i thought my self that he often cast an eye of tenderness upon me i cannot bear it i am afraid of myself of my justice   his tender looks did not escape me said lady g nor yet did my dear harriets but we will not touch this string it is too tender a one i for my part was forced in order to divert myself to turn my eyes on lord g he got nothing by that the most officious   nay lady g interupted i you shall not change the discourse at the expense of the man you have vowed to honor i will be pained myself by the continuation of the former subject rather than that shall be  charming harriet said lady l i hope your generosity will be rewarded yet tell me my dear can you wish lady clementina may be his i have no doubt but you wish her recovery but can you wish her to be his  i have debated the matter my dear lady l with myself i am sorry it has admitted of debate so excellent a creature such an honor to her sex so nobly sincere so pious  but i will confess the truth i have called upon justice to support me in my determination i have supposed myself in her situation her unhappy malady excepted i have supposed her in mine and ought i then to have hesitated to which to give the preference  yet   what yet most frank and most generous of women said lady l clasping her arms about me what yet   why yet  ah ladies  why yet i have many a pang many a twitch as i may call it  why is your brother so tenderhearted so modest so faultless  why did he not insult me with his pity why does he on every occasion show a tenderness for me that is more affecting than pity and why does he give me a consequence that exalts while it depresses me  i turned my head aside to hide my emotion  lady g snatched my handkerchief from me and wiped away a starting tear and called me by very tender names  am i dear continued i to the heart of such a man you think i am allow me to say that he is indeed dear to mine yet i have not a wish but for his happiness whatever becomes of me  emily appeared at the door  may i come in ladies  i will come in  my dear miss byron affected my dear miss byron in tears  her pity without knowing the cause sprung to her eyes she took my hand in both hers and repeatedly kissed it  my guardian asks for you o with what tenderness of voice  where is your miss byron love he calls every one by gentle names when he speaks of you  his voice then is the voice of love  love said he to me through you madam he will love his ward  and on your love will i build all my merit but you sigh dear miss byron you sigh  forgive your prating girl  you must not be grieved  i embraced her grief my dear reaches not my heart at this time it is the merit of your guardian that affects me  god bless you madam for your gratitude to my guardian  a clementina and an harriet said lady l two women so excellent what a sat is his how must his heart be divided  divided say you lady l resumed lady g the man who loves virtue for virtues sake loves it wherever he finds it such a man may distinguish more virtuous women than one and if he be of a gentle and beneficent nature there will be tenderness in his distinction to every one varying only according to the difference of her circumstances  let me embrace you my charlotte resumed lady l for that thought dont let me hear for a month to come one word from the same lips that may be unworthy of it  you have lord g in your head lady l but never mind us he must nowandthen be made to look about him i will take care to keep up my consequence with him never fear nor shall he have reason to doubt the virtue of his wife  virtue my dear said i what is virtue only she who will not be virtuous for virtues sake is not worthy to be called a woman but she must be something more than virtuous for her husbands nay for her vows sake complacency obligingness   obedience too i warrant  hush hush my sweet harriet putting her hand before my mouth we will behave as well as we can and that will be very well if nobody minds us and now let ns go down together  letter xviii miss byron in continuation thursday april    we played at cards last night till suppertime when that was over every one sought to engage sir charles in discourse i will give you some particulars of our conversation as i did of one before  lord w began it with a complaint of the insolence and profligateness of servants what he said was only answered by sir charles with the word example example my good lord repeated  you sir charles replied my lord may indeed insist upon the force of example for i cannot but observe that all those of yours whom i have seen are entitled to regard they have the looks of men at ease and of men grateful for that ease they know their duty and need not a reminding look a servant of yours sir charles looks as if he would one day make a figure as a master how do you manage it  perhaps i have been peculiarly fortunate in worthy servants there is nothing in my management deserving the attention of this company  i am going to begin the world anew nephew hitherto servants have been a continual plague to me i must know how you treat them  i treat them my lord as necessary parts of my family i have no secrets the keeping or disclosing of which might give them selfimportance i endeavor to set them no bad example i am never angry with them but for wilful faults if there are not habitual i shame them into amendment by gentle expostulation and forgiveness if they are not capable of a generous shame and the faults grow habitual i part with them but with such kindness as makes their fellow servants blame them and take warning i am fond of seeking occasions to praise them and even when they mistake if it be with a good intention they have my approbation of the intention and my endeavors to set them right as to the act sobriety is an indispensable qualification for my service and for the rest if we receive them not quite good we make them better than they were before generally speaking a master may make a servant what he pleases servants judge by example rather than precept and almost always by their seelings one thing more permit me to add i always insist upon my servants being kind and compassionate to one another a compassionate heart cannot habitually be an unjust one and thus do i make their goodnature contribute to my security as well as quiet  my lord was greatly pleased with what his nephew said  upon some occasion lady g reflected upon a lady for prudery and was going on when sir charles interrupting her said take care lady g  you ladies take care for i am afraid that modesty under this name will become ignominious and be banished the hearts at least the behavior and conversation of all those whose fortunes or inclinations carry them often to places of public resort  talk of places of public resort said lord l it is vexatious to observe at such how men of real merit are neglected by the fine ladies of the age while every distinction is shown to fops and foplings  but who my lord said sir charles are those women are they not generally of a class with those men flippant women love empty men because they cannot reproach them with a superiority of understanding but keep their solly in countenance they are afraid of a wise man but i would by no means have such a one turn sool to please them for they will despise the wise mans folly more than the silly mans and with reason because being uncharacteristic it must sit more aukwardly upon him than the others can do  yet wisdom itself and the truest wisdom goodness said mrs reeves is sometimes thought to sit ungracefully when it is uncharacteristic not to the man but to the times she then named a person who was branded as an hypocrite for performing all his duties publicly  he will be worse spoken of if he declines doing so said dr bartlett his enemies will add the charge of cowardice and not acquit him of the other  lady gertrude being withdrawn it was mentioned as a wonder that so agreeable a woman as she must have been in her youth and still was for her years should remain single lord g said that she had had many offers and once before she was twenty had like to have stolen a wedding but her fears he said since that had kept her single  the longer said sir charles a woman remains unmarried the more apprehensive she will be of entering into the state at seventeen or eighteen a girl will plunge into it sometimes without either fear or wit at twenty she will begin to think at twentyfour will weigh and discriminate at twentyeight will be afraid of venturing at thirty will turn about and look down the hill she has ascended and as occasions offer and instances are given will sometimes repent sometimes rejoice that she has gained that summit sola  indeed said mrs reeves i believe in england many a poor girl goes up the hill with a companion she would little care for if the state of a single woman were not here so peculiarly unprovided and helpless for girls of slender fortunes if they have been genteelly brought up how can they when familyconnexions are dissolved support themselves a man can rise in a profession and if he acquires wealth in a trade can get above it and be respected a woman is looked upon as demeaning herself if she gains a maintenance by her needle or by domestic attendance on a superior and without them where has she a retreat  you speak good mrs reeves said sir charles as if you would join with dr bartlett and me in wishing the establishment of a scheme we have often talked over though the name of it would make many a lady start we want to see estabilished in every county protestant nunneries in which single women of small or no fortunes might live with all manner of freedom under such regulations as it would be a disgrace for a modest or good woman not to comply with were she absolutely on her own hands and to be allowed to quit it whenever they pleased  well brother said lady g and why could you not have got all this settled a fortnight ago you that can carry every point and have made poor me a lady abbess  you are still better provided for my sister but let the doctor and me proceed with our scheme the governesses or matrons of the society i would have to be women of family of unblameable characters from infancy and noted equally for their prudence goodnature and gentleness of manners the attendants for the slighter services should be the hopeful female children of the honest industrious poor  do you not ladies imagine said dr bartlett that such a society as this all women of unblemished reputation employing themselves as each consulting her own genius at her admission shall undertake to employ herself and supported genteelly some at more some at less expense to the foundation according to their circumstances might become a national good and particularly a seminary for good wives and the institution a stand for virtue in an age given up to luxury extravagance and amusements little less than riotous  how could it be supported said lord w  many of the persons of which each community would consist would be i imagine replied sir charles no expense to it at all as numbers of young women joining their small fortunes might be able in such a society to maintain themselves genteelly on their own income though each singly in the world would be distressed besides liberty might be given for wives in the absence of their husbands in this maritime country and for widows who on the deaths of theirs might wish to retire from the noise and hurry of the world for three six or twelve months more or less to reside in this wellregulated society and such persons we may suppose would be glad according to their respective abilities to be benesactresses to it no doubt but it would have besides the countenance of the welldisposed of both sexes since every family in britain in their connexions and relations near or distant might be benefited by so reputable and useful an institution to say nothing of the works of the ladies in it the profits of which perhaps will be thought proper to be carried toward the support of a foundation that so genteelly supports them yet i would have a number of hours in each day for the encouragement of industry that should be called their own and what was produced in them to be solely appropriated to their own use  a truly worthy divine at the appointment of the bishop of the diocese to direct and animate the devotion of such a society and to guard it from that superstition and enthusiasm which soars to wild heights in almost all nunneries would confirm it a blessing to the kingdom  i have another scheme my lord proceeded sir charles  an hospital for female penitents for such unhappy women as having been once drawn in and betrayed by the perfidy of men find themselves by the cruelty of the world and principally by that of their own sex unable to recover the path of virtue when perhaps convinced of the wickedness of the men in whose honor they confided they would willingly make their first departure from it the last  these continued he are the poor creatures who are eminently entitled to our pity though they seldom meet with it goodnature and credulity the child of good nature are generally as i have the charity to believe rather than viciousness the foundation of their crime those men who pretend they would not be the first destroyers of a womans innocence look upon these as fair prize but what a wretch is he who seeing a poor creature exposed on the summit of a dangerous precipice and unable without an assisting hand to find her way down would rather push her into the gulf below than convey her down in safety  speaking of the force put upon a daughters inclinations in wedlock tyranny and ingratitude said sir charles from a man beloved will be more supportable to a woman of strong passions than even kindness from a man she loves not shall not parents then who hope to see their children happy avoid compelling them to give their hands to a man who has no share in their hearts  but would you allow young ladies to be their own choosers sir charles said mr reeves  daughters replied he who are earnest to choose for themselves should be doubly careful that prudence justifies their choice every widow who marries imprudently and very many there are who do furnishes a strong argument in favor of a parents authority over a maiden daughter a designing man looks out for a woman who has an independent fortune and has no questions to ask he seems assured of findin indiscretion and rashness in such a one to befriend him but ought not she to think herself affronted and resolve to disappoint him  but how said lady g shall a young creature be able to judge   by his application to her rather than to her natural friends and relations by his endeavoring to alienate her affections from them by wishing her to favor private and clandestine meetings conscious that his petensions will not stand discussion by the inequality of his fortune to hers and has not our excellent miss byron in the letters to her lucy bowing to me which she has had the goodness to allow us to read helped us to a criterion men in their addresses to young women she very happily observes forget not to set forward the advantages by which they are distinguished whether hereditary or acquired while love love is all the cry of him who has no other to boast of  and by that means said lady gertrude setting the silly creature at variance with all her friends he makes her fight his battles for him and become herself the cats paw to help him to the readyroasted chestnuts  but dear brother said lady g do you think love is such a stayed deliberate passion as to allow a young creature to take time to ponder and weigh all the merits of the cause  love at first sight answered sir charles must indicate a mind prepared for impression and a sudden gust of passion and that of the least noble kind since there could be no opportunity of knowing the merit of the object what woman would have herself supposed capable of such a tinderyfit in a man it is an indelicate paroxysm but in a woman who expects protection and instruction from a man much more so love at first may be only fancy such a young love may be easily given up and ought to a parents judgment nor is the conquest so difficult as some young creatures think it one thing my good emily let me say to you as a rule of some consequence in the world you are just entering into  young persons on arduous occasions especially in lovecases should not presume to advise young persons because they seldom can divest themselves of passion partiality or prejudice that is indeed of youth and forbear to mix their own concerns and byasses with the question referred to them it should not be put from young friend to young friend what would you do in such a case but what ought to be done  how the dear girl blushed and how pleased she looked to be particularly addressed by her guardian  lady gertrude spoke of a certain father who for interested views obliged his daughter to marry at fifteen when she was not only indifferent to the man but had formed no right notions of the state  and are they not unhappy asked sir charles  they are replied she  i knew such an instance returned he the lady was handsome and had her full share of vanity she believed every man who said civil things to her was in love with her and had she been single that he would have made his addresses to her she supposed that she might have had this great man or that had she not been precipitated and this brought her to slight the man who had as she concluded deprived her of better offers they were unhappy to the end of their lives had the lady lived single long enough to find out the difference between compliment and sincerity and that the man who flattered her vanity meant no more than to take advantage of her folly she would have thought herself not unhappy with the very man with whom she was so dissatisfied  lady l speaking afterward of a certain nobleman who is continually railing against matrimony and who makes a very indifferent husband to an obliging wife i have known more men than one said sir charles inveigh against matrimony when the invective would have proceeded with a much better grace from their wives lips than from theirs but let us enquire would this complainer have been or deserved to be happier in any state than he now is  a state of suffering said lady l had probably humbled the spirits of the poor wives into perfect meekness and patience  you observe rightly replied sir charles and surely a most kind disposition of providence it is that adversity so painful in itself should conduce so peculiarly to the improvement of the human mind it teaches modesty humility and compassion  you speak feelingly brother said lady l with a sigh do you think lucy nobody sighed but she  i do said he i speak with a sense of gratitude i am naturally of an imperious spirit but i have reaped advantages from the early stroke of a mothers death being for years against my wishes obliged to submit to a kind of exile from my native country which i considered as a heavy evil though i thought it my duty to acquiesce i was determined as much as my capacity would allow to make my advantage of the compulsion by qualifying myself to do credit rather than discredit to my father my friends and my country and let me add that if i have in any tolerable manner succeeded i owe much to the example and precepts of my dear dr bartlett  the doctor blushed and bowed and was going to disclaim the merit which his patron had ascribed to him but sir charles confirmed it in still stronger terms you my dear dr bartlett said he as i have told miss byron was a second conscience to me in my earlier youth your precepts your excellent life your pure manners your sweetness of temper could not but open and enlarge my mind the soil i hope i may say was not barren but you my dear paternal friend was the cultivator i shall ever acknowledge it  and he bowed to the good man who was covered with modest confusion and could not look up  and think you lucy that this acknowlegement lessened the excellent man with any one present no it raised him in every eye and i was the more pleased with it as it helped me to account for that deep observation which otherwise one should have been at a loss to account for in so young a man and yet i am convinced that there is hardly a greater difference in intellect between angel and man than there is between man and man  letter xix lady g to miss byron thursday april    for heavens sake my dearest harriet dine with us today for two reasons one relates to myself the other you shall hear by andby to myself first as is most fit  this silly creature has offended me and presumed to be sullen upon my resentment married but two days and show his airs  were i in fault my dear which upon my honor i am not for the man to lose his patience with me to forget his obligations to me in two days  what an ungrateful wretch is he what a poor powerless creature your charlotte  nobody knows of the matter except he has complained to my brother  if he has  but what if he has  alas my dear i am married and cannot help myself  we seem however to be drawing up our forces on both sides  one struggle for my dying liberty my dear  the success of one pitched battle will determine which is to be the general which the subaltern for the rest of the campaign to dare to be sullen already  as i hope to live my dear i was in high good humor within myself and when he was foolish only intended a little play with him and he takes it in earnest he worships you so i shall railly him before you but i charge you as the man by his sullenness has taken upon him to fight his own battle either to be on my side or be silent i shall take it very ill of my harriet if she strengthen his hands  well but enough of this husband  husband what a word  who do you think is arrived from abroad  you cannot guess for your life  lady olivia  true as you are alive accompanied it seems by an aunt of hers a widow whose years and character are to keep the niece in countenance in this excursion the pretense is making the tour of europe and england was not to be left out of the scheme my brother is excessively disturbed at her arrival she came to town but last night he had notice of it but this morning he took emily with him to visit her emily was known to her at florence she and her aunt are to be here at dinner as she is come sir charles says he must bring her acquainted with his sisters and their lords in order to be at liberty to pursue the measures he has unalterably resolved upon and this harriet is my second reason for urging you to dine with us  now do i wish we had known her history at large dr bartlett shall tell it us unwelcome as she is to my brother i long to see her i hope i shall not hear something in her story that will make me pity her  will you come  i wonder whether she speaks english or not i dont think i can converse in italian  i will not forgive you if you refuse to come  lady l and her good man will be here we shall therefore if you come be our whole family together  my brother has presented this house to me till his return he calls himself lord gs guest and mine so you can have no punctilio about it besides lord w will set out tomorrow morning for windsor he dotes upon you and perhaps it is in your power to make a newmarried man penitent and polite  so you must come  hang me if i sign by any other name while this man is in fits than that of  charlotte grandison  letter xx miss byron to miss selby thursday april    i send you enclosed a letter i received this morning from lady g i will suppose you have read it  emily says that the meeting between sir charles and the lady mentioned in it was very polite on both sides but more cold on his than on hers she made some difficulty however of dining at his house and her aunt lady massei more but on sir charless telling them that he would bring his eldest sister to attend them thither they complied  when i went to st jamess square sir charles and lady l were gone in his coach to bring the two ladies  lady g met me on the stairshead leading into her dressing room not a word said she of the mans sullens he repents a fine figure as i told him of a bridegroom would he make in the eyes of foreign ladies at dinner were he to retain his gloomy airs he has begged my pardon as good as promised amendment and i have forgiven him  poor lord g said i  hush hush he is within he will hear you and then perhaps repent of his repentance  she led me in my lord had a glow in his cheeks and looked as if he had been nettled and was but just recovering a smile to help to carry off the petulance o how saucily did her eyes look well my lord said she i hope  but you say i misunderstood   no more madam no more i beseech you   well sir not a word more since you are   pray madam   well well give me your hand  you must leave harrier and me together  she humorously courtesied to him as he bowed to me taking the compliment as to herself she nodded her head to him as he turned back his when he was at the door and when he was gone if i can but make this man orderly said she i shall not quarrel with my brother for hurrving me as he has done  you are wrong excessively wrong charlotte you call my lord a silly man but can have no proof that he is so but by his bearing this treatment from you  none of your grave airs my dear the man is a good sort of man and will be so if you and lady l dont spoil him i have a vast deal of roguery but no ill nature in my heart there is luxury in jesting with a solemn man who wants to assume airs of privilege and thinks he has a right to be impertinent i will tell you how i will manage  i believe i shall often try his patience and when i am conscious that i have gone too far i will be patient if he is angry with me so we shall be quits then i will begin again he will resent and if i find his aspect very solemn  come come no glouting friend i will say and perhaps smile in his face i will play you a tune or sing you a song  which which speak in a moment or the humor will be off  if he was ready to cry before he will laugh then though against his will and as he admires my finger and my voice shall we not be instantly friends  it signified nothing to rave at her she will have her way poor lord g  at my first knowledge of her i thought her very lively but imagined not that she was indiscreetly so  lord gs fondness for his saucy bride was as i have reason to believe his fault i dare not to ask for particulars of their quarrel and if i had and found it so could not with such a raillying creature have entered into his defense or censured her  i went down a few moments before her lord g whispered me that he should be the happiest man in the world if i who had such an influence over her would stand his friend  i hope my lord said i that you will not want any influence but your own she has a thousand good qualities she has charming spirits you will have nothing to bear with but from them they will not last always think only that she can mean nothing by the exertion of them but innocent gaiety and she will every day love your lordship the better for bearing with her you know she is generous and noble  i see madam said she she has let you into   she has not acquainted me with the particulars of the little misunderstanding only has said that there had been a slight one which was quite made up  i am ashamed replied he to have it thought by miss byron that there could have been a misunderstanding between us especially so early she knows her power over me i am afraid she despises me  impossible my lord have you not observed that she spares nobody when she is in a lively humor  true  but here she comes  not a word madam  i bowed assenting silence lord g said she approaching him in a low voice i shall be jealous of your conversations with miss byron  would to heaven my dearest life snatching at her withdrawn hand that   i were half as good as miss byron i understand you  but time and patience sir nodding to him and passing him  admirable creature said he how i adore her  i hinted to her afterward his fear of her despising him harriet answered she with a serious air i will do my duty by him i will abhor my own heart if i ever find in it the shadow of a regard for any man in the world inconsistent with that which he has a right to expect from me  i was pleased with her and found an opportunity to communicate what she said in confidence to my lord and had his blessings for it  but now for some account of lady olivia with which i will begin a new letter  letter xxi miss byron in continuation sir charles returned with the ladies he presented to lady olivia and her aunt lady g lord l and lord w i was in another apartment talking with dr bartlett lady olivia asked for the doctor he left me to pay his respects to her sir charles being informed that i was in the house told lady olivia that he hoped he should have the honor of presenting to her one of our english beauties desiring lady g to request my company  lady g came to me  a lovely woman i assure you harriet let me lead you to her sir charles met me at the entrance of the drawing room excuse me madam said he taking my hand with profound respect and allow me to introduce to a very amiable italian lady one of the loveliest women in britain leading me up to her she advancing toward me miss byron madam addressing himself to her salutes you her beauty engages every eye but that is her least perfection  her face glowed miss byron said she in french is all loveliness a relation sir in italian he bowed but answered not her question  her aunt saluting me expressed herself in my favor  i would sooner forgive you here whispered lady olivia to sir charles in italian looking at me than at bologna  i heard her and by my confusion showed that i understood her she was in confusion too  mademoiselle said she in french understands italian  i am ashamed monsieur  miss byron does answered sir charles and french too  i must have the honor said she in french to be better known to you mademoiselle  i answered her as politely as i could in the same language  lady olivia is really a lovely woman her complexion is fine her face oval every feature of it is delicate her hair is black and i think i never saw brighter black eyes in my life if possible they are brighter and shine with a more piercing luster than even sir charles grandisons but yet i give his the preference for we see in them a benignity that hers though a womans have not and a thoughtfulness as if something lay upon his mind which nothing but patience could overcome yet mingled with an air that shows him to be equal to anything that can be undertaken by man while olivias eves show more fire and impetuosity than sweetness had i not been toll it i should have been sure that she has a violent spirit but on the whole she is a very fine figure of a woman  she talked of taking a house and staying in england a year at least and was determined she said to perfect herself in the language and to become an englishwoman but when sir charles in the way of discourse mentioned his obligation to leave england as on next saturday morning how did she and her aunt look upon each other and how was the  that gilded her fine countenance shi surely sir said her aunt you are not in earnest  after dinner the two ladies retired with sir charles at his motion dr bartlett at lady gs request then gave us this short sketch of her history he said she had a vast fortune she had had indiscretions but none that had affected her character as to virtue but her spirit could not bear control she had shown herself to be vindictive even to a criminal degree lord bless me my dear the doctor has mentioned to me in confidence that she always carries a poniard about her and that once she used it had the person died she would have been called to public account for it the man it seems was of rank and offered some slight affront to her she now comes over the doctor said as he had reason to believe with a resolution to sacrifice even her religion if it were insisted upon to the passion she had so long in vain endeavored to conquer  she has he says an utter hatred to lady clementina and will not be able to govern her passion he is sure when sir charles shall acquaint her that he is going to attend that lady and her family for he has only mentioned his obligation to go abroad but not said whither  lord w praised the person of the lady and her majestic air lord l and lord g wished to be within hearing of the conference between her and sir charles so did lady g and while they were thus wishing in came sir charles his face all in a glow lady l said he be so good as to attend lady olivia  she went to her sir charles staid not with us yet went not to the lady but into his study dr bartlett attended him there the doctor returned soon after to us his noble heart is vexed said he lady olivia has greatly disturbed him he chooses to be alone  lady l afterward told us that she found the lady in violent anguish of spirit her aunt endeavoring to calm her she however politely addressed herself to lady l and begging her aunt to withdraw for a few moments she owned to her in french her passion for her brother she was not she said ashamed to own it to his sister who must know that his merit would dignify the passion of the noblest woman she had endeavored she said to conquer hers she had been willing to give way to the prior attachments that he had pleaded for a lady of her own country signora clementina della porretta whom she allowed to have had great merit but who having irrecoverably been put out of her right mind was shut up at naples by a brother who vowed eternal enmity to sir charles and from whom his life would be in the utmost hazard if he went over she owned that her chief motive for coming to england was to cast her fortune at her brothers feet and as she knew him to be a man of honor to comply with any terms he should propose to her he had offered to the family della porretta to allow their daughter her religion and her confessor and to live with her every other year in italy she herself not inferior in birth in person in mind as she said she presumed and superior in fortune the riches of three branches of her family all rich having centred in her insisted not now upon such conditions her aunt she said knew not that she proposed on conviction a change of her religion but she was resolved not to conceal anything from lady l she left her to judge how much she must be affected when he declared his obligation to leave england and especial when he owned that it was to go to bologna and that so suddenly as if as she apprehended at first it was to avoid her she had been in tears she said and even would have kneeled to him to induce him to  end his journey for one month and then to have taken her over with him and seen her safe in her own palace if he would go upon so hated and so fruitless as well as so hazardous an errand but he had denied her this poor favor  this refusal she owned had put her out of all patience she was unhappily passionate but was the most placable of her sex what madam said she can affect a woman if slight indignity and repulse from a favored person is not able to do it a woman of my condition to come over to england to solicit  how can i support the thought  and to be refused the protection of the man she prefers to all men and her request to see her safe back again though but as the fool she came over  you may blame me madam  but you must pity me even were you to have a heart the sisterheart of your inflexible brothers  in vain did lady l plead to her lady clementinas deplorable situation the reluctance of his own relations to part with him and the magnanimity of his selfdenial in an hundred instances on the bare possibility of being an instrument to restore her she could not bear to hear her speak highly of the unhappy lady she charged clementina with the pride of her family to which she attributed their deserved calamity deserved cruel lady how could her pitiless heart allow her lips to utter such a word and imputed meanness to the noblest of human minds for yielding to the entreaties of a family some of the principals of which she said had treated him with an arrogance that a man of his spirit ought not to bear  lady maffei came in she seems dependent upon her niece she is her aunt by marriage only and lady l speaks very favorably of her from the advice she  and her remonstrances to her kinswoman lady maffei besought her to compose herself and return to the company  she could not bear she said to return to the company the slighted the contemned object she must appear to be to every one in it i am an intruder said she haughtily a beggar with a fortune that would purchase a sovereignty in some countries make my excuses to your sister to the rest of the company  and to that fine young lady  whose eyes by their officious withdrawing from his and by the consciousness that glowed in her face whenever he addressed her betrayed at least to a jealous eye more than she would wish to have seen  but tell her that all lovely and blooming as she is she must have no hope while clementina lives  i hope lucy it is only to a jealous eye that my heart is so discoverable  i thank her for her caution but i can say what she cannot that from my heart cost me what it may i do subscribe to a preference in favor of a lady who has acted in the most arduous trials in a greater manner than i fear either olivia or i could have acted in the same circumstances we see that her reason but not her piety deserted her in the noble struggle between her love and her religion in the most affecting absences of her reason the soul of the man she loved was the object of her passion however hard it is to prefer another to ones self in such a case as this yet if my judgment is convinced my acknowlegement shall follow it heaven will enable me to be reconciled to the event because i pursue the dictates of that judgment against the biasses of my more partial heart let that heaven which only can restore clementina and dispose as it pleases of olivia and harriet we cannot either of us i humbly hope be so unhappy as the lady has been whom i rank among the first of women and whose whole family deserves almost equal compassion  lady olivia ask lady l if her brother had not a very tender regard for me he had lady l answered and told her that he had rescued me from a very great distress and that mine was the most grateful of human hearts  she called me sweet young creature supposing me i doubt not youger than i am but said that the graces of my person and mind alarmed her not as they would have done had not his attachment to clementina mentina been what now she saw but never could have believed it was having supposed that compassion only was the tie that bound him to her  but compassion lucy from such a heart as his the merit so great in the lady must be love a love of the nobler kind  and if it were not it would be unworthy of clementinas  lady maffei called upon her dignity her birth to carry her above a passion that met not with a grateful return she advised her to dispose herself to stay in england some months now she was here and as her friends in italy would suppose what her view was in coming to england their censures would be obviated by here continuing here for some time while sir charles was abroad and in italy and that she should divert herself with visiting the court the public places and in seeing the principal curiosities of this kingdom as she had done those of others in order to give credit to an excursion that might otherwise be freely spoken of in her own country  she seemed to listen to this advice she bespoke and was promised the friendship of the two sisters and included in her request through their interests mine and lady g was called in by her sister to join in the promise  she desired that sir charles might be requested to walk in but would not suffer the sisters to withdraw as they would have done when he returned he could not but be polite but it seems looked still disturbed i beg you to excuse sir said she my behavior to you it was passionate it was unbecoming but in compliment to your own consequence you ought to excuse it i have only to request one favor of you that you will suspend for one week in regard to me your proposed journey but for one week and i will now i am in england stay some months perhaps till your return  excuse me madam  i will not excuse you  but one week sir give me so much importance with myself as for one weeks suspension you will you must  indeed i cannot my soul i own to you is in the distrestes of the family of porretta why should i repeat what i said to you before  i have bespoken sir the civilities of your sisters of your family you forbid them not  you expect not an answer madam to that question my sisters will be glad and so will their lords to attend you wherever you please with a hope to make england agreeable to you  how long do you propose to stay in italy sir  it is not possible for me to determine  are you not apprehensive of danger to your person  i am not  you ought to be  no danger shall deter me from doing what i think to be right if my motives justify me i cannot fear  do you wish me sir to stay in england till your return  a question so home put disturbed him was it a prudent one in the lady it must either subject her to a repulse or him by a polite answer to give her hope that her stay in england might not be fruitless as to the view she had in coming he reddened it is fit answered he that your own pleasure should determine you it did pardon me madam in your journey hither  she reddened to her very ears your brother ladies has the reputation of being a polite man bear witness to this instance of it i am ashamed of myself  if i am unpolite madam my sincerity will be my excuse at least to my own heart  o that inflexible heart but ladies if the inhospitable englishman refuse his protection in his own country to a foreign woman of no mean quality do not you his sisters despise her  they madam and their lords will render you every cheerful service let me request you my sisters to make england as agreeable as possible to this lady she is of the first consideration in her own country she will be of such wherever she goes my lady maffei deserves likewise your utmost respect then addressing himself to them ladies said he encourage my sisters they will think themselves honored by your commands  the two sisters confirmed in an obliging manner what their brother had said and both ladies acknowleged themselves indebted to them for their offered friendship but lady olivia seemed not at all satisfied with her brother and it was with some difficulty he prevailed on her to return to the company and drink coffee  i could not help reflecting on occasion of this ladys conduct that fathers and mothers are great blessings to daughters in particular even when women grown it is not every woman that will shine in a state of independency great fortunes are snares if independent women escape the machinations of men which they have often a difficulty to do they will frequently be hurried by their own imaginations which are said to be livelier than those of men though their judgments are supposed less into inconveniences had lady olivias parents or uncles lived she hardly would have been permitted to make the tour of europe and not having so great a fortune to support vagaries would have shone as she is well qualified to do in a dependent state in italy and made some worthy man and herself haappy  had she a mind great enough to induce her to pity clementina i should have been apt to pity her for i saw her soul was disturbed i saw that the man she loved was not able to return her love a pitiable case i saw a starting tear nowandthen with difficulty disperted once she rubbed her eye and being conscious of observation said something had got into it so it had the something was a tear yet she looked with haughtiness and her besom swelled with indignation ill concealed  sir charles repeated his recommendation of her to lord l and lord g they offered their best services lord w invited her and all of us to windsor different parties of pleasure were talked of but still the enlivener of every party was not to be in any one of them she tried to look pleased but did not always succeed in the trial an eye of love and anger mingled was often cast upon the man whom everybody loved her bosom heaved as it seemed sometimes with indignation against herself that was the construction which i made of some of her looks  lady maffei however seemed pleased with the parties of pleasure talked of she often directed herself to me in italian i answered her in it as well as i could i do not talk it well but as i am not an italian and little more than booklearned in it for it is a long time ago since i lost my grandpappa who used to converse with me in it and in french i was not scrupulous to answer in it to have forborne because i did not excel in what i had no opportunity to excel in would have been false modesty nearly bordering upon pride were any lady to laugh at me for not speaking well her native tongue i would not return the smile were she to be less perfect in mine than i am in hers but lady olivia made me a compliment on my faulty accent when i acknowleged it to be so signora said she you show us that a pretty mouth can give beauty to a defect a master teaching you added she would perhaps find some fault but a friend conversing with you must be in love with you for the very imperfection  sir charles was generously pleased with the compliment and made her a fine one on her observation  he attended the two ladies to their lodgings in his coach he owned to dr bartlett that lady olivia was in tears all the way lamenting her disgrace in coming to england just as he was quitting it and wishing she had stayed at florence she would have engaged him to correspond with her he excused himself it was a very afflicting thing to him he told the doctor to deny any request that was made to him especially by a lady but he thought he ought in conscience and honor to forbear giving the shadow of an expectation that might be improved into hope where none was intended to be given heaven he said had for laudable ends implanted such a regard in the sexes toward each other that both man and woman who hoped to be innocent could not be too circumspect in relation to the friendships they were so ready to contract with each other he thought he had gone a great way in recommending an intimacy between her and his sisters considering her views her spirit her preservance and the free avowal of her regard for him and her menaces on his supposed neglect of her and yet as she had come over and he was obliged to leave england so soon after her arrival he thought he could not do less and he hoped his sisters from whose examples she might be benefited would while she behaved prudently cultivate her acquaintance  the doctor tells me that now lady olivia is so unexpectedly come hither in person he thinks it best to decline giving me as he had once intended her history at large but will leave so much of it as may satisfy my curiosity to be gathered from my own observation and not only from the violence and haughtiness of her temper but from the freedom of her declarations he is sure he said that his patron will be best pleased that a veil should be thrown over the weaker part of her conduct which were it known would indeed be glorious to sir charles but not so to the lady who however never was suspected even by her enemies of giving any other man reason to tax her with a thought that was not strictly virtuous and she had engaged his piety and esteem for the sake of her other fine qualities though she could not his love before she saw him which it seems was at the opera at florence for the first time when he had an opportunity to pay her some slight civilities she set all men at defiance  tomorrow morning sir charles is to breakfast with me my cousins and i are to dine at lord ls the earl and lady gertrude are also to be there lord w has been prevailed upon to stay and be there also as it is his nephews last day in england  last day in england o my lucy what words are those  lady l has invited lady olivia and her aunt at her own motion sir charles his time being so short not disapproving  i thank my grandmamma and aunt for their kind summons i will soon set may day i will my dear soon set my day  letter xxii miss byron in continuation friday noon apr    not five hours in bed not one hours rest for many uneasy nights before i was stupid till sir charles came i then was better he enquired with tender looks and voice after my health as if he thought i did not look well  we had some talk about lord and lady g he was anxious for their happiness he complimented me with hopes from my advice to her lord g he said was a goodnatured honest man if he thought his sister would make him unhappy he should himself be so  i told him that i dared to answer for her heart my lord must bear with some innocent foibles and all would be well  we then talked of lady olivia he began the subject by asking me my opinion of her i said she was a very fine woman in her person and that she had an air of grandeur in her mien  and she has good qualities said he but she is violent in her passions i am frequently grieved for her she is a fine creature in danger of being lost by being made too soon her own mistress  he said not one word of his departure tomorrow morning i could nor begin it my heart would not let me my spirits were not high and i am afraid if that key had been touched i should have been too visibly affected my cousins forbore upon the same apprehension  he was excessively tender and soothing to me in his air his voice his manner i thought of what emily said that his voice when he spoke of me was the voice of love dear flattering girl  but why did she flatter me  we talked of her next he spoke of her with the tenderness of a father he besought me to love her he praised her heart  emily said i venerates her guardian she never will do anything contrary to his advice  she is very young replied he she will be happy madam in yours she both loves and reverences you  i greatly love the dear emily sir she and i shall be always sisters  how happy am i in your goodness to her permit me madam to enumerate to you my own felicities in that of my dearest friends  mr beauchamp is now in the agreeable situation i have long wished him to be in his prudence and obliging behavior to his motherinlaw have won her his father grants him everything throgh her and she by this means finds that power enlarged which she was afraid would be lessened it the s n were allowed to come over how just is this reward of his filial duty  thus lucy did he give up the merit to his beauchamp which was solely due to himself  lord w he hoped would be soon one of the happiest men in england and the whole mansfield family had now fair prospects opening before them  emily not be you see had made it the interest of her mother to be quiet  lord and lady l gave him pleasure whenever he saw them or thought of them  dr bartlett was in heaven while on earth he would retire to his beloved grandisonhall and employ himself in distributing as objects offered at least a thousand pounds of the three thousand bequeathed to charitable uses by his late friend mr danby his sisters fortune was paid his estates in both kingdoms were improving  see madam said he how like the friend of my soul i claim your attention to affairs that are of consequence to myself and in some of which your generosity of heart has interested you  i bowed had i spoken i had burst into tears i had something arose in my throat i know not what still thought i excellent man you are not yourself happy  o pity pity yet lucy he plainly had been enumerating all these things to take off from my mind that impression which i am afraid he too well knows it is affected with from his difficult situation  and now madam resumed he how are all my dear and good friends whom you more particularly call yours  i hope to have the honor of a personal knowledge of them when heard you from our good mr deane he is well i hope  very well sir  your grandmamma shirley that ornament of advanced years  i bowed i dared not trust to my voice  your excellent aunt selby  i bowed again  your uncle your lucy your nancy happy family all harmony all love  how do they  i wiped my eyes  is there any service in my power to do them or any of them command me good miss byron if there be my lord w and i are one our influence is not small  make me still more happy in the power of serving any one favored by you  you oppress me sir by your goodness  i cannot speak my grateful sensibilities  will you my dear mr reeves will you madam to my cousin employ me in any way that i can be of use to you either abroad or at home your acquaintance has given me great pleasure to what a family of worthies has this excellent young lady introduced me  o sir said mrs reeves tears running down her cheeks that you were not to leave people whom you have made so happy in the knowledge of the best of men  indispensable calls must be obeyed my dear mrs reeves if we cannot be as happy as we wish we will rejoice in the happiness we can have we must not be our own carvers  but i make you all serious i was enumerating as i told you my present felicities i was rejoicing in your friendships i have joy and i presume to say i will have joy there is a bright side in every event i will not lose sight of it and there is a dark one but i will endeavor to see it only with the eye of prudence that i may not be involved by it at unawares who that is not reproached by his own heart and is blessed with health can grieve for inevitable evils evils that can be only evils as we make them so forgive my seriousness my dear friends you make me grave favor me i beseech you my good miss byron with one lesson we shall be too much engaged perhaps byandby  he led me i thought it was with a cheerful air but my cousins both say his eyes glistened to the harpsichord he sung unasked but with a low voice and my mind was calmed o lucy how can i part with such a man how can i take my leave of him  but perhaps he has taken his leave of me already as to the solemnity of it in the manner i have recited  letter xxiii miss byron in continuation saturday morning apr    o lucy sir charles grandison is gone gone indeed he sat out at three this morning on purpose no doubt to spare his sisters and the two brothersinlaw and lord w as well as himself concern we broke not up till after two were i in the writing humor which i have never known to fail me till now i could dwell upon an hundred things some of which i can now only briefly mention  dinnertime yesterday passed with tolerable cheerfulness every one tried to be cheerful o what pain attends loving too well and being too well beloved he must have pain as well as we  lady olivia was the most thoughtful at dinnertime yet pr emily ah the poor emily she went out four or five times to weep though only i perceived it  nobody was cheerful after dinner but sir charles he seemed to exert himself to be so he prevailed on me to give them a lesson on the harpsichord lady l played lady g played we tried to play i should rather say he himself took the violin and afterward sat down to the harpsichord for one short lesson he was not known to be such a master but he was long in italy lady olivia indeed knew him to be so she was induced to play upon the harpsichord she surpassed everybody italy is the land of harmony  about seven at night he singled me out and surprised me greatly by what he said he told me that lady d had made him a visit i was before low i was then ready to sink she has asked me questions madam  sir sir was all i could say  he himself trembled as he spoke  alas my dear he surely loves me hear how solemnly he spoke  god almighty be your director my dear miss byron i wish not more happiness to my own soul than i do to you  in discharge of a promise made i mention this visit to you i might otherwise have spared you and myself   he stopped there  then resumed for i was silent  i could not speak  your friends will be entreated for a man that loves you a very worthy young nobleman  i give you emotion madam  forgive me  i have performed my promise he turned from me with a seeming cheerful air how could he appear to be cheerful  we made parties at cards i knew not what i played emily sighed and tears stole down her cheeks as she played o how she loves her guardian emily i say  i dont know what i write  at supper we were all very melancholy mr beauchamp was urgent to go abroad with him he changed the subject and gave him an indirect denial as i may call it by recommending the two italian ladies to his best services  sir charles kind good excellent wished to lord l to have seen mr grandison  unworthy as that man has made himself of his attention  he was a few moments in private with lady olivia she returned to company with red eyes  poor emily watched an opportunity to be spoken to by him alone  so diligently he led her to the window  about one of clock it was  he held both her hands he called her she says his emily he charged her to write to him  she could not speak she could only sob yet thought she had a thousand things to say to him  he contradicted not the hope his sisters and their lords had of his breakfasting with them they invited me they invited the italian ladies lady l lord l did go in expectation but lady g when she found him gone sent me and the italian ladies word that he was it would have been cruel if she had not how could he steal away so i find that he intended that his morning visit to me as indeed i half suspected should be a taking leave of my cousins and your harriet how many things did he say then  how many questions ask  in tender woe  he wanted to do us all service  he seemed not to know what to say  surely he hates not your poor harriet  what struggles in his noble bosom  but a man cannot complain a man cannot ask for compassion as a woman can but surely his is the gentlest of manly minds  when we broke up he handed my cousin reeves into her coach he handed me mr reeves said we see you again sir charles in the morning he bowed at handing me in he sighed  he pressed my hand  i think he did  that was all  he saluted nobody  he will not meet his clementina as he parted with us  but i doubt not dr bartlet was in the secret  he was he has just been here he found my eyes swelled i had had no rest yet knew not till seven oclock that he was gone  it was very good of the doctor to come his visit soothed me yet he took no notice of my red eyes nay for that matter mrs reevess eyes were swelled as well as mine angel of a man how is he beloved  the doctor says that his sisters their lords lord w are in as much grief as if he were departed for ever  and who knows  but i will not torment my self with supposing the worst i will endeavor to bear in mind what he said yesterday morning to us no doubt for an instruction that he would have joy  and did he then think that i should be so much grieved as to want such an instruction  and therefore did he vouchsafe to give it  but vanity be quiet  lie down hope  hopelesness take place  clementina shall be his he shall be hers  yet his emotion lucy at mentioning lady ds visit  o but that was only owing to his humanity he saw my emotion and acknowleged the tenderest friendship for me ought i not to be satisfied with that i am i will be satisfied does he not love me with the love of mind the poor olivia has not this to comfort herself with the poor olivia if i see her sad and afflicted how i shall pity her all her expectations frustrated the expectations that engaged her to combat difficulties to travel to cross many waters and to come to england  to come just time enough to take leave of him he hastening on the wings of love and compassion to a dearer a deservedly dearer object in the country she had quitted on purpose to visit him in his  is not hers a more grievous situation than mine  it is why then do i lament  but here lucy let me in confidence hint what i have gathered from several intimations from dr bartlett though as tenderly made by him as possible that had sir charles grandison been a man capable of taking advantage of the violence of a ladys passion for him the unhappy olivia would not have scrupled great haughty and noble as she is by birth and fortune to have been his without conditions if she could not have been so with the italian world is of this opinion at least had sir charles been a rinaldo olivia had been an armida  o that i could hope for the honor of the sex and of the lady who is so fine a woman that the italian world is mistaken  i will presume that it is  my good dr bartlett will you allow me to accuse you of a virtue too rigorous that is sometimes the fault of very good people you own that sir charles has not even to you revealed a secret so disgraceful to her you own that he has only blamed her for having too little regard for her reputation and for the violence of her temper yet how patiently for one of such a temper has she taken his departure almost on the day of her arrival he could not have given her an opportunity to indicate to him a concession so criminal she could not if he had have made the overture wicked wicked world i will not believe you and the less credit shall you have with me italian world as i have seen the lady the innocent heart will be a charitable one lady olivia is only too intrepid prosperity as sir charles observed has been a snare to her and set her above a proper regard to her reputation  merciless world i do not love you dear dr bartlett you are not yet absolutely perfect these hints of yours against olivia gathered from the malevolence of the envious are proofs the first indeed that i have ever met with of your imperfection  excuse me lucy how have i run on disappointment has mortified me and made me goodnatured  i will welcome adversity if it enlarge my charity  the doctor tells me that emily with her halfbroken heart will be here presently if i can be of comfort to her  but i want it myself from the same cause we shall only weep over each other  as i told you the doctor and the doctor only knew of his setting out so early he took leave of him happy dr bartlett  yet i see by his eyes that this parting cost him some paternal tears  never father better loved a son than this good man loves sir charles grandison  sir charles it seems had settled all his affairs three days before his servants were appointed richard saunders is one of the three he has taken with him happy servants to be every day in the presence of such a master  the doctor tells me that he had last week presented the elder mr oldham with a pair of colors which he had purchased for him nobody had heard of this  lord w he says is preparing for windsor mr beauchamp for hampshire for a few days and then he returns to attend the commands of the noble italians lady olivia will soon have her equipage ready she will make a great appearance but sir charles grandison will not be with her what is grandeur to a disturbed heart the earl of g and lady gertrude are setting out for hertfordshire lord and lady l talk of retiring for a few weeks to colnebrooke the doctor is preparing for grandisonhall your poor harriet for northamptonshire  bless me my dear what a dispersion  but lord ws nuptials will collect some of them together at windsor  emily the dear weeping girl is just come she is with my cousins she expects my permission for coming up to me imagine us weeping over each other praying for blessing the guardian of us both your imagination cannot form a scene too tender adieu my lucy  letter xxiv miss byron in continuation sunday april    o what a blank my dear  but i need not say what i was going to say poor emily  but to mention her grief is to paint my own  lord w went to windsor yesterday  a very odd behavior of lady olivia mr beauchamp went yesterday and offered to attend her to any of the public places at her pleasure in pursuance of sir charless reference to him to do all in his power to make england agreeable to her and she thought fit to tell him before her aunt that she thanked him for his civility but she should not trouble him during her stay in england she had gentlemen in her train and one of them had been in england before  he left her in disgust  lady l making her a visit in the evening she told her of mr beauchamps offer and of her answer the gentleman said she is a polite and very agreeable man and this made me treat his kind offer with abruptness for i can hardly doubt your brothers view in it i scorn his view and if i were sure of it perhaps i should find a way to make him repent of the indignity lady l was sure she said that neither her brother nor mr beauchamp had any other views than to make england as agreeable to her as possible  be this as it may madam said she i have no service for mr beauchamp but if your ladyship your sister and your two lords will allow me to cultivate your friendship you will do me honor dr bartletts company will be very agreeable to me likewise as often as he will give it me to miss jervois i lay some little claim i would have had her for my companion in italy but your cruel brother  no more however of him your english beauty too i admire her but poor young creature i admire her the more because i can pity her i should think myself very happy to be better acquainted with her  lady l made her a very polite answer for herself and her sister and their lords but told her that i was very soon to set out for my own abode in northamptonshire and that dr bartlett had some commissions which would oblige him in a day or two to go to sir charless seat in the country she herself offered to attend her to windsor and to every other place at her command  lady l took notice of her wrist being bound round with a broad black ribband and asked if it were hurt a kind of sprain said she but you little imagine how it came and must not ask  this made lady l curious and olivia requesting that emily might be allowed to breakfast with her as this morning she has bid the dear girl endeavor to know how it came if it fell in her way for olivia reddened and looked up with a kind of consciousness to lady l when she told her that she must not ask questions about it  lady g is very earnest with me to give into the towndiversions for a month to come but i have now no desire in my heart so strong as to throw myself at the feet of my grandmamma and aunt and to be embraced by my lucy and nancy and all my northamptonshire loves i am only afraid of my uncle he will railly his harriet yet only i know in hopes to divert her and us all but my jesting days are over my situation will not bear it yet if it will divert himself let him railly  i shall be so much importuned to stay longer than i ought or will stay that i may as well fix a peremptory day at once will you my ever indulgent friends allow me to set out for selbyhouse on friday next not on a sunday as lady betty williams advises for fear of the odious wagons but i have been in a different school sir charles grandison i find makes it a tacit rule with him never to begin a journey on a sunday nor except when in pursuit of works of mercy or necessity to travel in time of divine service and this rule he observed last sunday though he reached us here in the evening o my grandmamma how much is he what you all are and ever have been  but he is now pursuing a work of mercy god succeed to him the end of his pursuit  but why tacit you will ask is sir charles grandison ashamed to make an open appearance in behalf of his christian duties he is not for instance i have never seen him sit down at his own table in the absence of dr bartlett or some other clergyman but he himself says grace and that with such an easy dignity as commands every ones reverence and which is succeeded by a cheerfulness that looks as if he were the better pleased for having shown a thankful heart  dr bartlett has also told me that he begins and ends every day either in his chamber or in his study in a manner worthy of one who is in earnest in his christian profession but he never frights gay company with grave maxims i remember one day mr grandison asked him in his absurd way why he did not preach to his company nowandthen faith sir charles said he if you did you would reform many a poor ignorant sinner of us since you could do it with more weight and more certainty of attention than any parson in christendom  it would be an affront said sir charles to the understanding as well as education of a man who took rank above a peasant in such a country as this to seem to question whether he knew his general duties or not and the necessity of practicing what he knew of them if he should be at a loss he may once a week be reminded and his heart kept warm let you and me cousin everard show our conviction by our practice and not invade the clergymans province  i remember that mr grandison showed his conviction by his blushes and by repeating the three little words you and me sir charles  sunday evening o my dear friends i have a strange a shocking piece of intelligence to give you emily has just been with me in tears she begged to speak with me in private when we were alone she threw her arms about my neck ah madam said she i am come to tell you that there is a person in the world that i hate and must and will hate as long as i live it is lady olivia  take me down with you into northamptonshire and never let me see her more  i was surprised  o madam i have found out that she would on thursday last have killed my guardian  i was astonished lucy  they retired together you know madam my guardian came from her his face in a glow and he sent in his sister to her and went not in himself till afterward she would have had him put off his journey she was enraged because he would not and they were high together and at last she pulled out of her stays in fury a poniard and vowed to plunge it into his heart he should never she said see his clementina more he went to her her heart failed her well it might you know madam he seized her hand he took it from her she struggled and in struggling her wrist was hurt that is the meaning of the broad black ribband  wicked creature to have such a thought in her heart  he only said when he had got it from her unhappy violent woman i return not this instrument of mischief you will have no use for it in england  and would not let her have it again  i shuddered o my dear said i he has been a sufferer we are told by good women but this is not a good woman but can it be true who informed you of it  lady maffei herself she thought that sir charles must have spoken of it and when she found he had not she was sorry she had and begged i would not tell anybody but i could not keep it from you and she says that lady olivia is grieved on the remembrance of it and arraigns herself and her wicked passion and the more for his noble forgiveness of her on the spot and recommending her afterward to the civilities of his sisters and their lords but i hate her for all that  poor unhappy olivia said i but what my emily are we women who should be the meekest and tenderest of the whole animal creation when we give way to passion but if she is so penitent let not the shocking attempt be known to his sisters or their lords i may take the liberty of mentioning it in strict confidence observe that lucy to those from whom i keep not any secret but let it not be divulged to any of the relations of sir charles their detestation of her which must follow would not be concealed and the unhappy creature made desperate might  who knows what she might do  the dear girl ran on upon what might have been the consequence and what a loss the world would have had if the horrid fact had been perpetrated lady maffci told her however that had not her heart relented she might have done him mischief for he was too rash in approaching her she fell down on her knees to him as soon as he had wrested the poniard from her i forgive and pity you madam said he with an air that had as olivia and he aunt have recollected since both majesty and company a in it but he would withdraw yet at her request sent in lady l to her and going into his study told not even dr bartlett of it though he went to him there immediately  from the consciousness of this violence perhaps the lady was more temperate afterward even to the very time of his departure  lord bless me what shall i do lady d has sent a card to let me know that she will wait upon mrs reeves and me tomorrow to breakfast she comes no doubt to tell me that sir charles having no thoughts of harriet byron lord d may have hopes of succeeding with her and perhaps her ladyship will plead sir charless recommendation and interest in lord ds favor but should this plea be made good heaven give me patience i am afraid i shall be uncivil to this excellent woman   letter xxv miss byron in continuatin monday april    the countess is just gone  mr reeves was engaged before to breakfast with lady betty williams and we were only mrs reeves lady d and i  my heart aked at her entrance and every moment still more as we were at breakfast her looks i thought had such particular kindness and meaning in them as seemed to express you have no hopes miss byron anywhere else and i will have you to be mine  but my suspense was over the moment the teatable was removed i see your confusion my dear said the countess mrs reeves you must not leave us and i have sat in pain for you as i saw it increase by this i know that sir charles grandison has been as good as his word indeed i doubted not but he would i dont wonder my dear that you love him he is the finest man in his manners as well as person that i ever saw a woman of virtue and honor cannot but love him but i need not praise him to you nor to you neither mrs reeves i see that  now you must know proceeded she that there is an alliance proposed for my son of which i think very well but still should have thought better had i never seen you my dear i have talked to my lord about it you know i am very desirous to have him married his answer was i never can think of any proposal of this nature while i have any hope that i can make myself acceptable to miss byron  what think you my lord said i if i should directly apply to sir charles grandison to know his intentions and whether he has any hopes of obtaining her favor he is said to be the most unreserved of men he knows our characters to be as unexceptionable as his own and that our alliance cannot be thought a discredit to the first family in the kingdom it is a free question i own as i am unacquainted with him by person but he is such a man that methinks i can take pleasure in addressing myself to him on any subject  my lord smiled at the freedom of my motion but not disapproving it i directly went to sir charles and after due compliments told him my business  the countess stopped she is very penctrating she looked at us both  well madam said my cousin with an air of curiosity  pray your ladyship   i could not speak for very impatience   i never heard in my life said the countess such a fine character of any mortal as he gave you he told me of his engagements to go abroad as the very next day he highly extolled the lady for whose sake principally he was obliged to go abroad and he spoke as highly of a brother of hers whom he loved as if he were his own brother and mentioned very affectionately the young ladys whole family  god only knows said he what may be my destiny  as generosity as justice or rather as providence leads i will follow  after he had generously opened his heart proceeded the countess i asked him if he had any hope should the foreign lady recover her health of her being his  i can promise myself nothing said he i go over without one selfish hope if the lady recover her health and her brother can be amended in his by the assistance i shall carry over with me i shall have joy inexpressible to providence i leave the rest the result cannot be in my own power  then sir proceeded the countess you cannot in honor be under any engagements to miss byron  i arose from my seat whither my dear  i have done if i oppress you i moved my chair behind hers but so close to hers that i leaned on the back of it my face hid and my eyes running over she stood up sit down again madam said i and proceed  pray proceed you have excited my curiosity only let me sit here unheeded behind you  pray madam said mrs reeves burning also with curiosity as she has since owned go on and indulge my cousin in her present seat what answer did sir charles return  my dear love said the countess sitting down as i had requested let me first be answered one question i would not do mischief  you cannot do mischief madam replied i what is your ladyships question  has sir charles grandison ever directly made his addresses to you my dear  never madam  it is not for want of love i dare aver that he has not but thus he answered my question i should have thought myself the unworthiest of men knowing the difficulties of my own situation how great soever were the temptation from miss byrons merit if i had sought to engage her affections  o lucy how nobly is his whole conduct toward me justified  she has madam proceeded the countess in his words a prudence that i never knew equalled in a woman so young with a frankness of mind to which hardly ever young lady before her had pretensions she has such a command of her affections that no man i dare say will ever have a share in them till he has courted her favor by assiduities which shall convince her that he has no heart but for her  o my lucy what an honor to me would these sentiments be if i deserved them and can sir charles grandison think i do i hope so but if he does how much am i indebted to his favorable his generous opinion i who knows but i have reason to rejoice rather than to regret as i used to do his frequent absences from colnebrooke  the countess proceeded  then sir you will not take it amiss if my son by his assiduities can prevail upon miss byron to think that he has merit and that his heart is wholly devoted to her  amiss madam  no  in justice in honor i cannot may miss byron be as she deserves to be one of the happiest women on earth in her nuptials i have heard a great character of lord d he has a very large estate he may boast of his mother  god forbid that i a man divided in myself not knowing what i can do hardly sometimes what i ought to do should seek to involve in my own uncertainties the friend i revere the woman i so greatly admire her beauty so attracting so proper therefore for her to engage a generous protector in the married state  generous man thought i o how my tears ran down my cheeks as i hid my face behind the countesss chair  but will you allow me sir proceeded the countess to ask you were you freed from all your uncertainties   permit me madam interrupted he to spare you the question you were going to put miss byron may come to hear the substance of a conversation that is of a very delicate nature  as i know not what will be the result of my journey abroad i should think myself a very selfish man and a very dishonorable one to two ladies of equal delicacy and worthiness if i sought to involve as i hinted before in my own uncertainties a young lady whose prudence and great qualities must make herself and any man happy whom she shall favor with her hand  to be still more explicit proceeded he with what face could i look up to a woman of honor and delicacy such a one as the lady before whom i now stand if i could own a wish that while my honor has laid me under obligation to one lady if she shall be permitted to accept of me i should presume to hope that another no less worthy would hold her favor for me suspended till she saw what would be the issue of the first obligation no madam i could sooner die than offer such indignity to both i am fettered added he but miss byron is free and so is the lady abroad my attendance on her at this time is indispensable but i make not any conditions for myself  my reward will be in the consciousness of having discharged the obligations that i think myself under as a man of honor  the countesss voice changed in repeating this speech of his and she stopped to praise him and then went on  you are the man indeed sir  but then give me leave to ask you as i think it very likely that you will be married before you return to england whether now that you have been so good as to speak favorably of my son and that you call miss byron sister you will oblige him with a recommendation to that sister  the countess of d shows by this request her value for a young lady who deserves it and the more for its being i think excuse me madam a pretty extraordinary one but what a presumption would it be in me to suppose that i had such an interest with miss byron when she has relations as worthy of her as she is of them  you may guess my dear said the countess that i should not have put this question but as a trial of his heart however i asked his pardon and told him that i would not believe he gave it me except he would promise to mention to miss byron that i had made him a visit on this subject methinks lucy i should have been glad that he had not let me know that he was so forgiving  and now my dear said the lady let me turn about  she did and put one arm round my neck and with my own handkerchief wiped my eyes and kissed my cheek and when she saw me a little recovered she addressed me as follows  now my good young creature o that you would let me call you daughter in my own way for i think i must always call you so whether you do or not let me ask you as if i were your real mother have you any expectation that sir charles grandison will be yours  dear madam is not this as hard a question to be put to me as that which you put to him  yes my dear  full as hard and i am as ready to ask your pardon as i was his if you are really displeased with me for putting it are you miss byron excuse me mrs reeves for thus urging your lovely cousin i am at least entitled to the excuse sir charles grandison made for me that it is a demonstration of my value for her  i have declared madam returned i and it is from my heart that i think he ought to be the husband of the lady abroad and though i prefer him to all the men i ever saw yet i have resolved if possible to conquer the particular regard i have for him he has in a very noble manner offered me his friendship so long as it may be accepted without interfering with any other attachments on my part and i will be satisfied with that  a friendship so pure replied the countess as that of such a man is consistent with any other attachments my lord d will with his whole soul contribute all in his power to strengthen it he admires sir charles grandison he would think it a double honor to be acquainted with him through you dearest miss byron take another worthy young man into your friendship but with a tenderer name i shall then claim a fourth place in it for myself o my dear what a quadruple knot will you tie  your ladyship does me too much honor was all i could just then reply  i must have an answer my dear i will not take up with a compliment  this then madam is my answer  i hope i am an honest creature i have not a heart to give  then you have expectations my dear  well i will call you mine if i can never did i think that i could have made the proposal that i am going to make you but in my eyes as well as in my lords you are an incomparable young woman  this is it  we will not think of the alliance proposed to us it is yet but a proposal and to which we have not returned any answer till we see what turn the affair sir charles is gone upon takes you once said you could prefer my son to any of the men that had hitherto applied to you for your favor your affections to sir charles were engaged before you knew us will you allow my son this preference which will be the first preference if sir charles engages himself abroad  your ladyship surprises me shall i not improve by the example you have just now set before me who was it that said and a man too with what face could i look up to a woman of honor and delicacy such a one as the lady before whom i now stand if i could own a wish that whil my heart leaned to one person i should think of keeping another in suspense till i saw whether i could or could not be the others no madam i would sooner die as sir charles said than offer such an indignity to both but i know madam that you only made this proposal as you did another to sir charles grandison as a trial of my heart  upon my word my dear i should i think be glad to be entitled to such an excuse but i was really in earnest and now take a little shame to myself  what charming ingenuousness in this lady  she clasped her arms about me and kissed my cheek again i have but one plea to make for myself i could not have fallen into such an error the example so recently given to the contrary had i not wished you to be before any woman in the world countess of d  noble creature no title can give you dignity may your own wishes be granted  my cousins eyes ran over with pleasure  the countess asked when i returned to northhamptonshire i told her my intention she charged me to see her first but i can tell you said she my lord shall not be present when you come not once more will i trust him in your company and if he should steal a visit unknown to me let not your cousin see him mrs reeves he does indeed admire you love looking at me  i acknowleged with a grateful heart her goodness to me she engaged me to correspond with her when i got home her commands were an honor done me that i could not refuse myself her son she smilingly told me should no more see my letters than my person  at her going away  i will tell you one thing said she i never before in a business which my heart was set upon was so effectually silenced by a precedent produced by myself in the same conversation i came with an assurance of success when our hearts are engaged in a hope we are apt to think every step we take for the promoting it reasonable our passions my dear will evermore run away with our judgment but now i think of it i must when i say our make two exceptions one for you and one for sir charles grandison  but lucy tell me  may i do you think explain the meaning of the word selfish used by sir charles in the conclusion of the libraryconference at colnebrooke and which puzzled me then to make out by his disclaiming of selfishness in the conversation with the countess above recited if i may what an opening of his heart does that word give in my favor were he at liberty does it not look my dear as if hs honor checked him when his love would have prompted him to wish me to preserve my heart disengaged till his return from abroad nor let it be said that it was dishonorable in him to have such a thought as it was checked and overcome and as it was succeeded by such an emotion that he was obliged to depart abruptly from me  let me repeat the words  you may not have my letter at hand which relates that affecting address to me and it is impossible for me while i have memory to forget them he had just concluded his brief history of clementina  and now madam what can i say  honor forbids me  yet honor bids me  yet i cannot be unjust ungenerous selfish  if i may flatter myself lucy that he did love me when he said this and that he had a conflict in his noble heart between the love on one side so hopeless for i could not forgive him if he did not love as well as pity clementina and on the other not so hopeless were there to have been no bar between  shall we not pity him for the arduous struggle shall we not see that honor carried it even in favor of the hopeless against the hopeful and applaud him the more for being able to overcome how shall we call virtue by its name if it be not tried and if it has no contest with inclination  if i am a vain selfflatterer tell me chide me lucy but allow me however at the same time this praise if i can make good my claim to it that my conquest of my passion is at least as glorious for me as his is for him were he to love me ever so well since i can most sincerely however painfully subscribe to the preference which honor love compassion unitedly give to clementina  letter xxvi miss byron in continuation monday night my cousins and i by invitation supped with lady g this afternoon lord and lady l were there lady olivia also and lady maffei  i have st them all into a consternation as they expressed themselves by my declaration of leaving london on my return home early on friday morning next i knew that were i to pass the whole summer here i must be peremptory at last the two sisters vow that i shall not go so soon they say that i have seen so few of the towndiversions  towndiversions lucy  i have had diversion enough of one sort  but in your arms my dear friends i shall have consolation  and i want it  i have great regrets and shall have hourly more as the day approaches on the leaving of such dear and obliging friends but i am determined  my cousins coach will convey me to dunstable and there i know i shall meet with my indulgent uncle or your brother i would not have it publicly known because of the officious gentlemen in the neighborhood  dr bartlett intended to set out for grandisonhall tomorrow but from the natural kindness of his heart he has suspended his journey to thursday next no consideration therefore shall detain me if i am well  my cousins are grieved they did not expect that i would be a word and a blow as they phrase it  lady olivia expressed herself concerned that she in particular was to lose me she had proposed great pleasure she said in the parties she should make in my company but after what emily told me she appears to me as a medusa and were i to be thought by her a formidable rival i might have as much reason to be afraid of the potion as the man she loves of the poniard emily has kept the secret from everybody but me and i rely on the inviolable secrecy of all you my friends  lord and lady l had designed to go to colnebrooke tomorrow or at my day having hopes of getting me with them but now they say they will stay in town till they can see whether i am to be prevailed upon or will be obdurate  lady olivia enquired after the distance of north hamptonshire she will make the tour of england she says and visit me there i was obliged to say i should take her visit as an honor  wicked politeness of how many falsehoods do thou make the people who are called polite guilty  but there is one man in the world who is remarkable for his truth yet is unquestionably polite he censures not others for complying with fashions established by custom but he gives not in to them he never perverts the meaning of words he never for instance suffers his servants to deny him when he is at home if he is busy he just finds time to say he is to unexpected visiters and if they will stay he turns them over to his sisters to dr bartlett to emily till he can attend them but then he has always done so every one knows that he lives to his own heart and they expect it of him and when they can have his company they have double joy in the ease and cheerfulness that attend his leisure they then have him wholly and he can be the more polite as the company then is all his business  sir charles might the better do so as he came over so few months ago after so long an absence and his reputation for politeness was so well established that people rather looked for rules from him than a conformity to theirs  his denials of complimenting lady olivia though she was but just arrived in his native country where she never was before with the suspending of his departure for one week or but for one day  who but he could have given them but he was convinced that it was right to hasten away for the sake of clementina and his jeronymo and that it would have been wrong to show olivia even for her own sake that in such a compeition she had consequence with him and all her entreaties all her menaces the detested poniard in her hand could not shake his steady soul and make him delay his wellsettled purpose  letter xxvii miss byron in continuation tuesday morning april    this

signifies your astonishment  when you have scared everybody out of the house  i madam  you sir yes you  did you not lord it over me in my dressing room  to be easy and quiet did i not fly to our company in the drawing room did you not follow me there  with looks  very pretty looks for a newmarried man i assure you then did you not want to take me aside  would not anybody have supposed it was to express your sorrow for your odd behavior was i not all obedience  did you not with very mannish airs slight me for my compliance and fly out of the room all the company could witness the calmness with which i returned to them that they might not be grieved for me nor think our misunderstanding a deep one well then when your stomach came down as i supposed you sent for me out no doubt thought i to express his concern now  i was all obedience again  and did i not beseech you madam   beseech me my lord  yes  but with such looks  i married sir let me tell you a man with another face  see see emily  he is gone again   my lord flew out of the room in a rage  o these men my dear said she to emily  i know said emily what i could have answered if i dared but it is ill meddling as i have heard say between man and wife  emily says the quarrel was not made up but was carried higher still in the morning  she had but just finished her tale when the following billet was brought me from lady g  tuesday morning harriet if you love me if you pity me come hither this instant i have great need of your counsel i am resolved to be unmarried and therefore subscribe myself by the beloved name of  charlotte grandison   i instantly dispatched the following  i know no such person as charlotte grandison i love lady g but can pity only her lord i will not come near you i have no counsel to give you but that you will not jest away your own happiness  harriet byron   in half an hour after came a servant from lady g with the following letter  so then i have made a blessed hand of wedlock my brother gone my man excessive unruly lord and lady l on his side without enquiring into merits or demerits lectured by dr bartletts grave face emily standing aloof her finger in her eye and now my harriet renouncing me and all in one week  what can i do  war seems to be declared and will you not turn mediatrix  you will not you say let it alone nevertheless i will lay the whole matter before you  it was last night the week from the wedding day not completed that lord g thought fit to break into my retirement without my leave  by the way he was a little impertinent at dinnertime but that i passed over   what boldness is this said i  pray sir begone  why leave you your company below  i come my dearest life to make a request to you  the man began with civility enough had he had a little less of his odious rapture for he flung his arms about me jenny in presence a husbands fondness is enough to ruin these girls dont you think harriet that there is an immorality in it before them  i refuse your request be it what it will how dare you invade me in my retirement  you may believe that i intended not to stay long above my sister below does the ceremony so lately past authorize want of breeding  want of breeding madam  and he did so stare  leave me this instant  i looked goodnatured i suppose in my anger for he declared he would not and again throwing his arms about me as i sat joined his sharp face to mine and presumed to kiss me jenny still in the room  now harriet you never will desert me in a point of delicacy i am sure you cannot defend these odious freedoms in a matrimony so young unless you would be willing to be served so yourself  you may suppose that then i let loose my indignation upon him and he stole out daring to mutter and be displeased the word devil was in his mouth  did he call me devil jenny  no indeed madam said the wench  and harriet see the ill example of such a free behavior before her she presumed to prate in favor of the mans fit of fondness yet at other times is a prude of a girl  before my anger was gone down in again it is truth harriet came the bold wretch i will not said he as you are not particularly employed leave you  upon my soul madam you dont use me well but if you will oblige me with your company tomorrow morning   nowhere sir   only to breakfast with miss byron my dear  as a mark of your obligingness i request it  his dear  now i hate a hypocrite of all things i knew that he had a design to make a show of his bride as his property at another place and seeing me angry thought he would name a visit agreeable to me and which at the same time would give him a merit with you and preserve to himself the consequence of being obliged by his obedient wife at the word of authority  from this foolish beginning arose our mighty quarrel what vexed me was the art of the man and the evident design he had to get you of his side he in the course of it threatened me with appealing to you  to intend to ruin me in the love of my dearest friend who that valued that friend could forgive it you may believe that if he had not proposed it and after such accumulated offenses it was the very visit that i should have been delighted with  indeed sir  upon my word my lord  i do assure you sir  with a moderate degree of haughtiness  was what the quarrel arose to on my side  and at last to a declaration of rebellion  i will not  on his side upon my soul madam  let me perish if  and then hesitating  you use me ill madam i have not deserved  and give me leave to say  i insist upon being obliged madam  there was no bearing of this harriet  it was a cool evening but i took up my fan  heyday said i what language is this  you insist upon it my lord  i think i am married am i not  and i took my watch half an hour after ten on monday night  the  what day of the month is this  please the lord i will note down this beginning moment of your authoritative demeanor  my dear lady g the wretch called me by his own name perhaps farther to insult me if i could bear this treatment it is impossible for me to love you as i do  so it is in love to me that you are to put on already all the husband  jenny do you see my lord affecting a whisper how you dash the poor wench how like a fool she looks at our folly remember jenny that tomorrow morning you carry my weddingsuits to mrs arnold and tell her she has forgot the hangingsleeves to the gowns let her put them on out of hand  i was proceeding  but he rudely gravely and even with an air of scorn there was no bearing that you know admonished me a little less wit madam and a little more discretion would perhaps better become you  this was too true to be forgiven you will say it harriet if i dont and to come from a man that was not overburdened with either  but i had too great a command of myself to say so my dependence my lord this i did say is upon your judgment that will always be a balance to my wit and with the assistance of your reproving love will in time teach me discretion  now my dear was not this a high compliment to him ought he not to have taken it as such especially as i looked grave and dropped him a very fine courtesy but either his conscience or his ill nature perhaps you will say both made him take it as a reflection true as you are alive harriet he bit his lip jenny begone said he  jenny dont go said i  jenny knew not which to obey upon my word harriet i began to think the man would have cuffd me  and while he was in his ails of mockmajesty i stepped to the door and whipped down to my company  as married people are not to expose themselves to their friends who i once heard you sagely remark would remember disagreeable things when the honest pair had forgot them i was determined to be prudent you would have been charmed with me my dear for my discretion i will cheat bystanders thought i i will make my lord and lady l dr bartlett and emily whom i had before set in at cards think we are egregiously happy  and down i sat intending with a lamblike peaceableness to make observations on the play but soon after in whipped my indiscreet lord his color heightened his features working and though i cautioned him not to expose himself yet he assumed airs that were the occasion as you shall hear of frighting away my company he withdrew in consequence of those airs and after a little while repenting as i hoped he sent for me out some wives would have played the queen vashti on their tyrant and refused to go but i all obedience my vow so recently made in my head obeyed at the very first word yet you must think that i meek as i am naturally could not help recriminating he was too lordly to be expostulated with  there was i tell you madam and i will not be told sir and when i broke from the passionate creature and hoped to find my company behold they were all gone none but emily left and thus might poor lady l be sent home weeping perhaps for such an early marriagetyranny exerted on her meek sister  well and dont you think that we looked like a couple of fools at each other when we saw ourselves left alone as i may say to fight it out i did expostulate with him as mildly as i could he would have made it up with me afterward but no there was no doing that as a girl of your nice notions may believe after he had by his violent airs exposed us both before so many witnesses in decency therefore i was obliged to keep it up and now our misunderstanding blazes and is at such a comfortable height that if we meet by accident we run away from each other by design we have already made two breakfasttables yet i am meek he is fullen i make courtesies he returns not bows  sullen creature and a rustic  i go to my harpsichord melody enrages him he is worse than saul for saul could be gloomily pleased with the music even of the man he hated  i would have got you to come to us that i thought was tending to a compliance for it would have been condescending too much as he is so very perverse if i had accompanied him to you he has a great mind to appeal to you but i have half raillied him out of his purpose i sent to you what an answer did you return me  cruel harriet to deny your requested mediation in a difference that has arisen between man and wife  but let the fire glow if it spares the house and only blazes in the chimney i can bear it  cross creature adieu if you know not such a woman as grandison heaven grant that i may and that my wishes may be answered as to the person and then i will not know a byron  see lucy how high this dear flighty creature bribes but i will not be influenced by her bribery to take her part  letter xxviii miss byron in continuation tuesday night i am just returned from st jamess square  but first i should tell you that i had a visit from lady olivia and lady maffei our conversation was in italian and french lady olivia and i had a quarter of an hours discourse in private you may guess at our subject she is not without that tenderness of heart which is the indispensable characteristic of a woman she lamented the violence of her temper in a manner so affecting that i cannot help pitying her though at the instant i had in my head a certain attempt that makes me shudder whenever i think of it she regrets my going to northamptonshire so soon i have promised to return her visit tomorrow in the afternoon  she sets out on friday next for oxford she wished i could accompany her she resolves to see all that is worth seeing in the western circuit as i may call it she observes she says that sir charles grandisons sisters and their lords are very particularly engaged at present and are in expectation of a call to windsor to attend lord ws nuptials she will therefore having attendants enough and two men of consideration in her train one of whom is not unacquainted with england take cursory tours over the kingdom having a taste for traveling and finding it a great relief to her spirits and when lady l and lady g are more disengaged will review the seats and places which she shall think worthy of a second visit in their company  she professed to like the people here and the face of the country and talked favorably of the rel gion of it but poor woman she likes all those the better i doubt not for the sake of one englishman love lucy gilds every object which bears a relation to the person beloved  lady maffei was very free in blaming her niece for this excursion she took her chiding patiently but yet like a person that thought it too much in her power to gratify the person blaming her to pay much regard to what she said  i took a chair to lady gs emily ran to meet me in the hall she threw her arms about me i rejoice you are come said she did you not meet the house in the square  what means my emily  why it has been flung out of the windows as the saying is ah madam we are all to pieces one so careless the other so passionate  but hush  here comes lady g   take lucy in the dialogueway particulars

subjects  but hush here comes the man  she ran to her harpsichord  is this it harriet and touched the keys  repeating  softly sweet in lydian measures soon she soothed   enter lord g lord g miss byron i am your most obedient servant the sight of you rejoices my soul  madam to his lady you have not been long enough together to begin a tune i know what this is for    lady g harmony harmony is a charming thing but i poor i know not any but what this simple instrument affords me   lord g lifting up his hands harmony madam god is my witness  but i will lay everything before miss byron   lady g

lord g and could you madam have the heart to write    lady g why my lord do you mince the matter for heart read courage you may speak as plain in miss byrons presence as you did before she came i know

fallen out   lord g if miss byron you know the truth and can blame me    harriet i blame you only my lord for being in a passion you see my lady is serene she keeps her temper she looks as if she wanted to be friends with you   lord g o that cursed serenity  when a soul is torn by a whirlwind    lady g a good tragedy rant  but harriet you are mistaken my lord g is a very passionate man so humble so  what shall i call it before marriage  did not the man see what a creature i was  to bear with me when he had no obligation to me and not now when he has the highest  a miserable sinking  o harriet harriet never never marry   harriet dear lady g you know in your own heart you are wrong  indeed you are wrong    lord g god for ever reward you madam  i will tell you how it began    lady g began she knows that already i tell you my lord but what has passed within these four hours she knows not you may entertain her with that if you pleose  it was just about the time this day is a week that we were all together mighty comfortably at st georges hanoversquare    lord g every tittle of what you promised there madam    lady g and i my lord could be your echo in this were i not resolved to keep my temper as you cannot but say i have done all along   lord g you could not madam if you did not despise me   lady g you are wrong my lord to think so but you dont believe yourself if you did the pride of your heart ought not to permit you to own it   lord g miss byron give me leave    lady g lord bless me that people are so fond of exposing themselves had you taken my advice when you pursued me out of my dressing room into company  my lord said i as mildly as i now speak dont expose your self but he was not at all the wiser for my advice   lord g miss byron you see  but i had not come down but to make my compliments to you he bowed and was about to withdraw  i took him by the sleeve  my lord you must not go lady g if your own heart justifies you for your part in this misunderstanding say so i challenge you to say so  she was silent   harriet if otherwise own your fault promise amendment  ask excuse   lady g heyday   harriet and my lord will ask yours for mistakeing you  for being too easily provoked    lord g too easily madam    harriet what generous man would not smile at the foibles of a woman whose heart is only gay with prosperity and lively youth but has not the least malice in it has not she made choice of your lordship in preference of any other man she raillies every one she cannot help it she is to blame  indeed lady g you are your brother felt your edge he once smarted by it and was angry with you  but afterward observing that it was her way my lord that it was a kind of constitutional gaiety of heart and exercised on those she loved best he forgave railled her again and turned her own weapons upon her and every one in company was delighted with the spirit of both  you love her my lord    lord g never man more loved a woman i am not an illnatured man    lady g but a captious a passionate one lord g  whod have thought it   lord g never was there my dear miss byron such a strangelyaggravating creature she could not be so if she did not despise me   lady g fiddlefaddle silly man and so you said before if you thought so you take the way dont you to mend the matter by dancing and capering about and putting yourself into all manner of disagreeable attitudes and even sometimes being ready to foam at the mouth  i told him miss byron there he stands let him deny it if he can that i married a man with another face would not any other man have taken this for a compliment to his natural undistorted face and instantly have pulled off the ugly mask of passion and shown his own    lord g you see you see the air miss byron  how ludicrously does she now even now    lady g see miss byron  how captious  lord g ought to have a termagant wife one who could return rage for rage meekness is my crime  i cannot be put out of temper  meekness was never before attributed to woman as a fault   lord g good god  meekness  good god   lady g but harriet do you judge on which side the grievance lies  lord g presents me with a face for his that i never saw him wear before marriage he has cheated me therefore i show him the same face that i ever wore and treat him pretty much in the same manner or i am mistaken that i ever did and what reason can he give that will not demonstrate him to be the most ungrateful of men for the airs he gives himself airs that he would not have presumed to put on eight days ago who then harriet has reason to complain of grievance my lord or i   lord g you see miss byron  can there be any arguing with a woman who knows herself to be in jest in all she says   harriet why then my lord make a jest of it what will not bear an argument will not be worth ones anger   lord g i leave it to miss byron lady g to decide between us as she pleases   lady g you would better leave it to me sir   harriet do my lord   lord g well madam  and what is your decree   lady g you miss byron had best be lady chancellor after all i should not bear to have my decree disputed after it is pronounced   harriet if i must my decree is this  you lady g shall own yourself in fault and promise amendment my lord shall forgive you and promise that he will for the future endeavor to distinguish between your good and your ill nature that he will sit down to jest with your jest and never be disturbed at what you say when he sees it accompanied with that archness of eye and lip which you put on to your brother and to every one whom you best love when you are disposed to be teizingly facetious   lady g why harriet you have given lord g a clue to find me out and spoil all my sport   harriet what say you my lord   lord g will lady g own herself in fault as you propose   lady g odious recrimination  i leave you together i never was in fault in my life am i not a woman if my lord will ask pardon for his froppishness as we say of children   she stopped and pretended to be going    harriet that my lord shall not do charlotte you have carried the jest too far already my lord shall preserve his dignity for his wifes sake my lord you will not permit lady g to leave us however  he took her hand and pressed it with his lips for gods sake madam let us be happy it is in your power to make us both so it ever shall be in your power if i have been in fault impute it to my love i cannot bear your contempt and i never will deserve it   lady g why could not this have been said some hours ago  why slighting my early caution would you expose yourself  i took her aside be generous lady g let not your husband be the only person to whom you are not so   lady g whispering our quarrel has not run half its length if we make up here we shall make up clumsily one of the silliest things in the world is a quarrel that ends not as a coachman after a journey comes in with spirit we shall certainly renew it   harriet take the caution you gave to my lord dont expose yourself and another that you cannot more effectually do so than by exposing your husband i am more than halfashamed of you you are not the charlotte i once thought you were let me see if you have any regard to my good opinion of you that you can own an error with some grace   lady g i am a meek humble docible creature she turned to me and made me a rustic courtesy her hands before her i will try for it tell me if i am right then stepping toward my lord who was with his back to us looking out at the window  and he turning about to her bowing  my lord said she miss byron has been telling me more than i knew before of my duty she proposes herself one day to make a wonderful obedient wife it would have been well for you perhaps had i had her example to walk by she seems to say that now i am married i must be grave sage and passive that smiles will hardly become me that i must be prim and formal and reverence my husband  if you think this behavior will become a married woman and expect it from me pray my lord put me right by your frowns whenever i shall be wrong for the future if i ever find myself disposed to be very lighthearted i will ask your leave before i give way to it and now what is next to be done humorously courtesying her hands before her  he clasped her in his arms dear provoking creature this this is next to be done  i ask you but to love me half as much as i love you and i shall be the happiest man on earth  my lord said i you ruin all by this condescension on a speech and air so ungracious if this is all you get by it never never my lord fall out again o charlotte if you are not generous you come off much much too easily  well now my lord said she holding out her hand as if threatening me let you and me man and wife like join against the interposer in our quarrels  harriet i will not forgive you for this last part of your lecture   and thus was this idle quarrel made up all that vexes me on the occasion is that it was not made up with dignity on my lords part his honest heart so overflowed with joy at his lips that the naughty creature by her arch leers every nowandthen showed that she was sensible of her consequence to his happiness but lucy dont let her sink too low in your esteem she has many fine qualities  they prevailed on me to stay supper emily rejoiced in the reconciliation her heart was as i may say visible in her joy can i love her better than i do if i could she would every time i see her give me reason forit  letter xxix miss byron in continuation wedn noon apr    it would puzzle you to guess at a visiter i had this morning  honest mr fowler i was very glad to see him he brought me a letter from his worthy uncle good sir rowland i had a joy that i thought i should not have had while i stayed in london on its being put in my hand though the contents gave me sensible pain i enclose it it is dated from caermarthen be pleased to read it here  caermarthen april    how shall i in fit manner inscribe my letter to the loveliest of women i dont mean because of your loveliness but whether as daughter or not as you did me the honor to call yourself really and truly i must say that i had rather call you by another name though a little more remote as to consanguinity lord have mercy upon me how have i talked of you how many of our fine caermarthen girls have i filled with envy of your peerless perfections  here am i settled to my hearts content could i but obtain  you know whom i mean  a town of gentry a fine country round us  a fine estate of our own esteemed nay for that matter beloved by all our neighbors and tenants who so happy as rowland meredith if his poor boy could be happy  ah madam  and cannot it be so i am afraid of asking yet i understand that notwithstandig all the jackadandies that have been fluttering about you you are what you were when i left town some whispers have gone out of a fine gentleman indeed who had a great kindness for you but yet that something was in the way between you the lord bless and prosper my dear daughter as i must then call you and not niece if you have any kindness for him and if as now you have it would be wonderfully gracious if you would but give half a hint of it to my nephew or if so be you will not to him to me your father you know under your own precious hand the lord be good unto me but i shall never see the she that will strike my fancy as you have done but what a dreadful thing would it be if you who are so much courted and admired by many fine gallants should at last be taken with a man who could not be yours god forbid that such a disastrous thing should happen i profess to you madam that a tear or two have strayed down my cheeks at the thoughts of it for why because you played no tricks with any man you never were a coquet as they call em you dealt plainly sincerely and tenderly too to all men of which my nephew and i can bear witness  well but what now is the end of my writing  lord love you cannot cannot you at last give comfort to two honest hearts honester you never knew and yet if you could i dare say you would well then and if you cannot we must sit down as contented as we can that is all we have for it  but poor young man look at him if you read this before him strangely altered poor young man  and if as how you cannot why then god bless my daughter that is all and i do assure you that you have our prayers every lords day from the bottom of our hearts  and now if you will keep a secret i will tell it you and yet when i began i did not intend it the poor youth must not know it it is done in the singleness of our hearts and if you think we mean to gain your love for us by it i do assure you that you wrong us my nephew declares that he never will marry if it be not somebody and he has made his will and so have i his uncle and let me tell you that if as how i cannot have a niece my daughter shall be the better for having known and treated as kindly as power was lent her  her true friend loving father and obedient servant rowland meredith   love and service to mr and mrs reeves and all friends who enquire after me farewell god bless you amen  have you could you lucy read this letter with dry eyes generous worthy honest men i read but half way before mr fowler  glad i was that i read no further i should not have been able to have kept his uncles secret if i had had it been but to disclaim the acceptance of the generous purpose the carrying it into effect would exceedingly distress me besides the pain the demise of the honest man would give me and the more as i bespoke the fatherly relation from him myself if such a thing were to be sir charles grandisons generosity to the danbys should be my example  do you know mr fowler said i the contents of the letter you have put into my hand  no farther than that my uncle told me it contained professions of fatherly love and with wishes only  but without so much as expressing his hopes  sir rowland is a good man said i i have not read above half his letter there seems to be too much of the father in it for me to read further before my brother god bless my brother fowler and reward the fatherly love of sir rowland to his daughter byron i must write to him  mr fowler poor man profoundly sighed bowed with such a look of respectful acquiescence  bless me my dear how am i to be distressed on all sides by good men too as sir charles could say by good women  is there nothing less than giving myself to either that i can do to show mr orme and mr fowler my true value for them  poor mr fowler  indeed he looks to be as sir rowland hints not well  such a modest such an humble such a silent lover  he cost me tears at parting i could not hide them he heaped praises and blessings upon me and hurried away at last to hide his emotion with a sentence unfinished  god preserve you dear and worthy sir was all i could try to say the last words stuck in my throat till he was out of hearing and then i prayed for blessings upon him and his uncle and repeated them with fresh tears on reading the rest of the affecting letter  mr fowler told mr reeves before i saw him that he is to go to caermarthen for the benefit of his native air in a week he let him know where he lodged in town he had been riding for his health and diversion about the country ever since his uncle went and has not been yet at caermarthen  i wish mr fowler had once if but once called me sister it would have been such a kind acquiescence as would have given me some little pleasure on recollection methinks i dont know how to have done writing of sir rowland and mr fowler  i sat down however while the uncle and nephew filled my thoughts and wrote to the former i have enclosed the copy of my letter adieu my lucy  letter xxx moss byron to sir rowland meredith wednesday april    it was with great pleasure that i received this day the kindest letter that ever was written by a real father to his dearest child i was resolved that i would not go to rest till i had acknowleged the favor  how sweet is the name of father to a young person who out of near oneandtwenty years of life has for more than half the time been bereaved of hers and who was also one of the best of men  you gave me an additional pleasure in causing this remembrance of your promised paternal goodness to be given me by mr fowler in person till i knew you and him i had no father no brother  how good you are in your apprehensions that there may be a man on whom your daughter has cast her eye and who cannot look upon her with the same distinction  o that i had been near you when you wrote that sweetly compassionating that indulgent passage i would have wiped the tears from your eyes myself and reverenced you as my true father  you demand of me as my father a hint or half a hint as you call it to be given to my brother fowler or if not to him to you to him whom i call father i mean all the duty of a child i call him not father nominally only i will irksome as the subject is own without reserve the truth to you in tenderness to my brother how could i to him  there is a man whom and whom only i could love as a good wife ought to love her husband he is the best of men o my good sir rowland meredith if you knew him you would love him yourself and own him for your son i will not conceal his name from my father sir charles grandison is the man enquire about him his character will rise upon you from every mouth he engaged first all your daughters gratitude by rescuing her from a great danger and oppression for he is as brave as he is good and how could she help suffering a tenderness to spring up from her gratitude of which she was never before sensible to any man in the world there is something in the way my good sir but not that proceeds from his slights or contempts your daughter could not live if it were so a glorious creature is in the way who has suffered for him who does suffer for him he ought to be hers and only hers and if she can be recovered from a fearful malady that has seized her mind he probably will my daily prayers are that god will restore her  but yet my dear sir my friend my father my esteem for this noblest of men is of such a nature that i cannot give my hand to any other my father meredith would not wish me to give a hand without a heart  this sir is the case let it i beseech you rest within your own breast and my brother fowlers how few minds are there delicate and candid enough to see circumstances of this kind in the light they ought to appear in and pray for me my good sir rowland not that the way may be smoothed to what once would have crowned my wishes as to this life but that sir charles grandison may be happy with the lady that is and ought to be dearest to his heart and that your daughter may be enabled to rejoice in their felicity what my good sir is this span of life that a passenger through it should seek to overturn the interests of others to establish her own and can the single life be a grievance can it be destitute of the noblest tendernesses no sir you that have lived to an advanced age in a fair same surrounded with comforts and as tender to a worthy nephew as the most indulgent father could be to the worthiest of sons can testify for me that it is not  but now sir one word  i disclaim but yet in all thankfulnes the acceptance of the favor signified to be intended me in the latter part of the paternal letter before me our acquaintance began with a hope on your side that i could not encourage as i could not shall i accept of the benefit from you to which i could only have been entitled and that as i had behaved had i been able to oblige you  no sir i will not in this case be benefited when i cannot benefit put me not therefore i beseech you sir if such an event deplored by me as it would be should happen upon the necessity of enquiring after your other relations and friends sir rowland meredith my father and mr fowler my brother are all to me of the family they distinguish by their relation that i know at present let me not be made known to the rest by a distinction that would be unjust to them and to yourself as it must deprive you of the grace of obliging those who have more than a strangers claim and must in the event lay them under the appearance of an obligation to that stranger for doing them common justice  i use the word stranger with reference to those of your family and friends to whom i must really appear in that light but laying these considerations aside in which i am determined not to interfere with them i am with the tenderest regard dear and good sir  your everdutiful and affectionate daughter harriet byron  letter xxxi miss byron to miss selby wedn april    i shall dispatch this by your gibson early in the morning it was kind in you to bid him call in his way down for now i shall be almost sure of meeting if not my uncle your brother and who knows but my lucy herself at dunstable where barring accidents i shall be on friday night  you will see some of the worthiest people in the world my dear if you come all prepared to love you but let not anybody be put to inconvenience to meet me at dunstable my noble friends here will proceed with me to stratford or even to northampton they say but they will see me safe in the protection of somebody i love and whom they must love for my sake  i dont wonder that sir charles grandison loves mr beauchamp he is a very worthy and sensible man he as every body else idolizes sir charles it is some pleasure to me lucy that i stand high in his esteem to be respected by the worthy is one of the greatest felicities in this life for it is to be ranked as one of them sir harry and his lady are come to town all it seems is harmony in that family they cannot bear mr beauchamps absence from them for three days together all the neighboring gentlemen are in love with him his manners are so gentle his temper so even so desirous to oblige so genteel in his person so pleasing in his address he must undoubtedly make a good woman very happy  but emily poor girl sees only sir charles grandison with eyes of love mr beauchamp is however greatly pleased with emily he told lady g that he thought her a fine young creature and that her mind was still more amiable than her person but his behavior to her is extremely prudent he says finer things of her than to her yet surely i am mistaken if he meditates not in her his future wife mr beauchamp will be one of my escorte  emily at her own request is to go to colnebrooke with lady l after i am gone  mr reeves will ride lord l and lord g will also oblige me with their company on horseback  in my cousins coach will be lady l lady g emily and i my cousin reeves is forbidden to venture  i shall take leave of lady olivia and lady maffei tomorrow morning when they will set out for their projected tour tomorrow we and the whole grandison family are to dine together at lord ls for the last time it will be a mournful diningtime on that account  lady betty williams her daughter and miss clements supped with us this night and took leave of me in the tenderest manner they greatly regret my going down so soon as they call it  as to the public diversions which they wish me to stay and give into to be sure i should have been glad to have been better qualified to have entertained you with the performances of this or that actor this or that musician and the like but frighted by the vile plot upon me at a masquerade i was thrown out of that course of diversion and indeed into more affecting more interesting engagements into the knowledge of a family that had no need to look out of itself for entertainments and besides are not all the company we see as visiters or guests full of these things i have seen the principal performers in every way often enough to give me a notion of their performances though i have not troubled you with such common things as revolve every season  you know i am far from slighting the innocent pleasures in which others delight  it would have been happier for me perhaps had i had more leisure to attend those amusements than i have found yet i am not sure neither for methinks with all the pangs that my suspenses have cost me i would not but have known sir charles grandison his sisters his emily and dr bartlett  i could only have wished to have been spared sir hargrave pollexfens vile attempt then if i had come acquainted with this family it would have been as i come acquainted with others my gratitude had not been engaged so deeply  well  but what signify all these ifs  what has been has what must be must only love me my dear friends as you used to love me if i was a good girl when i left you i hope i am not a bad one now that i am returning to you my morals i bless god are unhurt my heart is not corrupted by the vanities of the great town i have a little more experience than i had and if i have severely paid for it it is not at the price of my reputation and i hope if nobody has benefited by me since i have been in town that no one has suffered by me poor mr fowler  i could not help it you know had i by little snares follies coquetries sought to draw him on and entangle him his future welfare would with reason be more the subject of my solicitude than it is now necessary it should be though indeed i cannot help making it a good deal so  thursday morning dr bartlett has just now taken leave of me in my own dressing room the parting scene between us was tender  i have not given you my opinion of miss williams had i seen her at my first coming to town i should have taken as much notice of her in my letters to you as i did of the two miss brambers miss darlington miss cantillon miss allestree and others of my own sex and of mr somner mr allestree mr walden of the other who took my first notice as they fell early in my way and with whom it is possible as well as with the towndiversions i had been more intimate had not sir hargraves vile attempt carried me out of their acquaintance into a much higher which of necessity as well as choice entirely engrossed my attention but now how insipid would any new characters appear to you if they were but of a like cast with those i have mentioned were i to make such the subjects of my pen and had i time before me which i cannot have to write again before i embrace you all my dear my everdear and indulgent friends  i will only say that miss williams is a genteel girl but will hardly be more than one of the better sort of modern women of condition and that she is to be classed so high will be owing more to miss clementss lessons than i am afraid to her mothers example  is it lucy that i have more experience and discernment now or less charity and goodnature than when i first came town for then i thought well in the main of lady betty williams but though she is a goodnatured obliging woman she is so immersed in the love of public diversions so fond of routs drums hurricanes  bless me my dear how learned should i have been in all the gaieties of the modern life what a fine lady possibly had i not been carried into more rational however to me they have been more painful scenes and had i followed the lead of this lady as she kindly as to her intention had designed i should  in the afternoon mr beauchamp is to introduce sir harry and lady beauchamp on their first visit to the two sisters  i had almost forgot to tell you that my cousins and i are to attend the good countess of d for one half hour after we have taken leave of lady olivia and her aunt  and now my lucy do i shut up my correspondence with you from london my heart beats high with the hope of being as indulgently received by all you my dearest friends as i used to be after a shorter absence for i am and ever will be  the grateful dutiful and affectionate harriet byron   letter xxxii miss byron to lady g selbyhouse monday april    though the kind friends with whom i parted at dunstable were pleased one and all to allow that the correspondence which is to pass between my dear lady g and their harriet should answer the just expectations of each upon her in the writing way and though at your motion remember not at mine they promised to be contented with hearing read to them such parts of my letters as you should think proper to communicate yet cannot i dispense with my duty to lady l my emily my cousin reeves and dr bartlett accordingly i write to them by this post and i charge you my dear with my sincere and thankful compliments to your lord and to mr beauchamp for their favors  what an agreeable night in the main was friday night had we not been to separate next morning it would have been an agreeable one indeed  is not my aunt selby an excellent woman but you all admired her she admires you all i will tell you another time what she said of you my dear in particular  my cousin lucy too  is she not an amiable creature  indeed you all were delighted with her but i take pleasure in recollecting your approbations of one i so dearly love she is as prudent as lady l and now our nancy is so well recovered as cheerful as lady g you said you would provide a good husband for her dont forget the man whoever he be cannot be too good for my lucy nancy is such another good girl but so i told you  well and pray did you ever meet with so pleasant a man as my uncle selby what should we have done when we talked of your brother when we talked of our parting had it not been for him you looked upon me every nowandthen when he returned your smartness upon him as if you thought i had let him know some of your perversnesses to lord g  and do you think i did not indeed i did can you imagine that your frankhearted harriet who hides not from her friends her own faults should conceal yours  but what a particular character is yours everybody blames you that knows of your overlivelinesses yet everybody loves you  i think for your very faults had it not been so do you imagine i could ever have loved you after you had led lady l to join with you on a certain teazing occasion  my uncle dotes upon you  but dont tell emily that my cousin james selby is in love with her that he may not on the score of the dear girls fortune be thought presumptuous let me tell you that he is almost of age and when he is comes into possession of an handsome estate he has many good qualities i have in short a very great value for him but not enough though he is my relation to wish him my still more beloved emily dear creature methinks i still feel her parting tears on my cheek  you charge me to be as minute in the letters i write to you as i used to be to my friends here and you promised to be as circumstantial in yours i will set you the example do you be sure to follow it  we baited at stonystratford i was afraid how it would be there were the two bold creatures mr greville and mr fenwick ready to receive us a handsome collation as at our setting out so now bespoke by them was set on the table how they came by their intelligence nobody knows we were all concerned to see them they seemed halfmad for joy my cousin james had alighted to hand us out but mr greville was so earnest to offer his hand that though my cousin was equally ready i thought i could not deny to his solicitude for the poor favor such a mark of civility besides if i had it would have been distinguishing him for more than a common neighbor you know mr fenwick took the other hand when i had stepped out of the coach and then with so much pride as made me ashamed of myself they hurried me between them through the innyard and into the room they had engaged for us blessing themselves all the way for my coming down harriet byron  i looked about as if for the dear friends i had parted with at dunstable this is not thought i so delightful an inn as they made that  now they thought i are just got to barnet in their way to london as we are here in ours to northampton  but ah where where is sir charles grandison at this time and i sighed but dont read this and such strokes as this to any body but lord and lady l  you will not you say  thank you charlotte  i will call you charlotte when i think of it as you commanded me  the joy we had at dunstable was easy serene deep full as i may say it was the joy of sensible people but the joy here was made by the two gentlemen mad loud and even noisy they hardly were able to contain themselves and my uncle and cousin james were forced to be loud to be heard  mr orme good mr orme when we came near his park was on the highwayside perhaps near the very spot where he stood to see me pass to london so many weeks ago  poor man  when i first saw him which was before the coach came near for i looked out only as thinking i would mark the place where i last beheld him he looked with so disconsolate an air and so fixed that i compassionately said to myself surely the worthy man has not been there ever since  i twitched the string just in time the coach stopped mr orme said i how do you well i hope  how does miss orme  i had my hand on the coachdoor he snatched it it was not an unwilling hand he pressed it with his lips god be praised said he with a countenance o how altered for the better for permitting me once more to behold that face  that angelic face he said  god bless you mr orme said i i am glad to see you adieu  the coach drove on poor mr orme said my aunt  mr orme lucy said i dont look so ill as you wrote he was  his joy to see you said she  but mr orme is in a declining way  mr greville on the coach stopping rode back just as it was going on again  and with a loud laugh  how the d  l came orme to know of your coming madam  poor fellow it was very kind of you to stop your coach to speak to the statue and he laughed again  nonsensical at what  my grandmamma shirley dearest of parents her youth as she was pleased to say renewed by the expectation of so soon seeing her darling child came as my aunt told us you know on thursday night to selbyhouse to charge her and lucy with her blessing to me and resolving to stay there to receive me our beloved nancy was also to be there so were two other cousins kitty and patty holles good young creatures who in my absence had attended my grandmamma at every convenient opportunity and whom i also found here  when we came within sight of this house now harriet said lucy i see the same kind of emotions beginning to arise in your face and bosom as lady g told us you showed when you first saw your aunt at dunstable my grandmamma said i i am in sight of the dear house that holds her i hope she is here but i will not surprise her with my joy to see her lie still throbbing impatience speaking to my heart  but when the coach attended by many neighbors and friends who like a gathering snowball had got together within a few miles of selbyhouse set us down at the innergate there in the outwardhall sat my blessed grandmamma the moment i beheld her my intended caution forsook me i sprang by my aunt and before the foot step could be put down flew as it were out of the coach and threw myself at her feet wrapping my arms about her bless bless said i your harriet i could not at the moment say another word  great god said the pious parent her hands and eyes lifted up great god i thank thee then folding her arms about my neck she kissed my forehead my check my lips  god bless my love pride of my life the most precious of a hundred daughters how does my child  my harriet  o my love  after such dangers such trials such harassings  once more god be praised that i clasp to my  heart my harriet  separate them separate them said my facetious uncle yet he had tears in his eyes before they grow together  madam to my grandmamma she is our harriet as well as yours let us welcome the saucy girl on her reentrance into these doors  saucy i suppose i shall soon find her  my grandmamma withdrew her fond arms take her take her said she each in turn but i think i never can part with her again  my uncle saluted me and bid me very kindly welcome home so did my aunt so did lucy  my equallybeloved nancy  so did every one  how can i return the obligations which the love of all my friends lays upon me to be good to be grateful is not enough uce that one ought to be for ones own sake wht a sweet thing is it to be beloved by worthy neighbors i had several visiters last night and compliments without number on my arrival  compliments for what for having lost the better half of my heart dont you think i look silly to myself you bid me be free in my confessions you promise to look my letters over before you read them to anybody and to mark passages proper to be kept to yourself  pray do  mr greville and mr fenwick were here separately an hour ago i thanked them for their civility on the road and not ungraciously as mr greville told my uncle as to him he was not he said without hopes yet since i knew not how to be ungrateful mr greville builds as he always did a merit on his civility and by that means sinks in the narrower lover the claim he might otherwise make to the title of the generous neighbor  miss orme has just been here she could not help throwing in a word for her brother  you will guess my dear lady g at the subject of our conversations here and what they will be morning noon and night for a week to come my grandmamma is better in health than i have known her for a year or two past the health of people in years can mend but slowly and they are slow to acknowledge it in their own favor my grandmamma however allows that she is better within these few days past but attributes the amendment to her harriets return  how do they all bless revere extol your noble brother  how do they wish  and how do they regret  you know what  yet how ready are they to applaud your harriet if she can hold her magnanimity in preferring the happiness of clementina to her own  my grandmamma and aunt are of opinion that i should and they praise me for the generosity of my effort whether the superior merits of the man will or will not allow me to succeed in it but my uncle my lucy and my nancy from their unbounded love of me think a little and but a little narrower and believing it will go hard with me say it is hard my uncle in particular says the very pretension is slight and nonsense but however if the girl added he can parade away her passion for an object so worthy with all my heart it will be but just that the romancing evelations which so often drive headstrong girls into difficulties should nowandthen help a more discreet one out of them  adieu my beloved lady g repeated compliments love thanks to my lord and lady l to my emily to dr bartlett to mr beauchamp and particularly to my lord g dear dear charlotte be good let me beseech you be good if you are not you will have every one of my friends who met you at dunstable and from their report my grandmamma and nancy against you for they find but one fault in my lord it is that he seems too fond of a lady who by her archness of looks and halfsaucy turns upon him even before them evidently showed  shall i say what but i stand up for you my dear your gratitude your generosity your honor i say and why should i not add your duty will certainly make you one of the most obliging of wives to the most affectionate of husbands  my uncle says he hopes so but though he adores you for a friend and the companion of a lively hour yet he does not know but his dame selby is still the woman whom a man should prefer for a wife and she said he is full as saucy as a wife need to be though i think harriet that she has not been the less dutiful of late for your absence  once more adieu my dear lady g and continue to love  your harriet byron  letter xxxiii lady g to miss byron thursday april    every one of the dunstable party say that you are a grateful and good girl beauchamp can talk of nobody else of our sex i believe in my conscience he is in love with you i think all the unprovided for young women wherever you come must hate you was you never by surprise carried into the chamber of a friend laboring with the smallpox in the infectious stage of it  o but i think you once said you had had that distemper but your mind harriet were your face to be ruined would make you admirers the fellows who could think of preferring even such a face to such a heart may be turned over to the class of insignificants  is not your aunt selby you ask an excellent woman  she is i admire her but i am very angry with you for deferring to another time acquainting me with what she said of me when we are taken with anybody we love they should be taken with us teazing harriet you know what an immoderate quantity of curiosity i have never serve me so again  i am in love with your cousin lucy were either fenwick or greville good enough  but they are not i think she shall have mr orme nancy you say is such another good girl i dont doubt it is she not your cousin and lucys sister but i cannot undertake for every good girl who wants a husband i wish i had seen lucy a fortnight ago then nancy might have had mr orme and lucy should have had lord g he admires her greatly and do you think that a man who at that time professed for me so much love and service and all that would have scrupled to oblige me had i as i easily should proved to him that he would have been a much happier man than he could hope to be with somebody else  your uncle is a pleasant man but tell him i say that the man would be out of his wits that did not make the preference he does in favor of his dame selby as he calls her tell him also if you please in return for his plain dealing that i say he studies too much for his pleasantries he is continually hunting for occasions to be smart i have heard my father say that this was the fault of some wits of his acquaintance whom he ranked among the witlings for it if you think it will mortify him more you may tell him for i am very revengeful when i think myself affronted that were i at liberty which god help me i am not i would sooner choose for a husband the man i have poor soul as i now and then think him than such a teazing creature as himself were both in my power and both of an age and i should have this good reason for my preference your uncle and i should have been too much alike and so been jealous of each others wit whereas i can make my honest lord g look about him and admire me strangely whenever i please  but i am it seems a person of a particular character every one you say loves me yet blames me odd characters my dear are needful to make even characters shine you good girls would not be valued as you are if there were not bad ones have you not heard it said that all human excellence is but comparative pray allow of the contrast you i am sure ought you are an ungrateful creature if whenever you think of my overlivelinesses as you call em you dont drop a courtesy and say you are obliged to me  but still the attack made upon you in your dressingroom at colnebrooke by my sister and me sticks in your stomach  and why so we were willing to show you that we were not the silly people you must have thought us had we not been able to distinguish light from darkness you who ever were i believe one of the frankesthearted girls in britain and admired for the ease and dignity given you by that frankness were growing awkward nay dishonest your gratitude your gratitude was the dust you wanted to throw into our eyes that we might not see that you were governed by a stronger motive you called us your friends your sisters but treated us not as either and this man and that and the other you could refuse and why no reason given for it and we were to be popt off with your gratitude truly  we were to believe just what you said and no more nay not so much as you said but we were not so implicit nor would you in our case have been so  but you perhaps would not have violently broken in upon a poor thing who thought we were blind because she was not willing we should see  may be not but then in that case we were honester than you would have been that is all here said i lady l is this poor girl aukwardly struggling to conceal what every body sees and seeing applauds her for the men considered yes harriet the man considered be pleased to take that in let us in pity relieve her she is though to be frank openhearted communicative nay she passes herself upon in those characters she sees we keep nothing from her she has been acquainted with your love before wedlock with my folly in relation to anderson she has carried her head above a score or two of men not contemptible she sits enthroned among us while we make but common figures at her footstool she calls us sisters friends and twenty pretty names let us acquaint her that we see into her heart and why lord d and others are so indifferent with her if she is ingenuous let us spare her if not leave me to punish her  yet we will keep up her punctilio as to our brother we will leave him to make his own discoveries she may confide in his politeness and the result will be happier for her because she will then be under no restraint to us and her native freedom of heart may again take its course  agreed agreed said lady l  and arm in arm we entered your dressing room dismissed the maid and began the attack  and o harriet how you hesitated paraded fooled on with us before you came to confession indeed you deserved not the mercy we showed you  so child you had better to have let this part of your story sleep in peace  you bid me not tell emily that your cousin is in love with her but i think i will girls begin very early to look out for admirers it is better in order to stay her stomach to find out one for her than that she should find out one for herself especially when the man is among ourselves as i may say and both are in our own management and at distance from eath other emily is a good girl but she has susceptibilities already and though i would not encourage her as yet to look out of herself for happiness yet i would give her consequence with herself and at the same time let her see that there could be no mention made of any thing that related to her but what she should be acquainted with dear girl i love her as well as you and i pity her too i or she as well as somebody else will have difficulties to contend with which she will not know easily how to get over though she can in a flame so young generously prefer the interest of a more excellent woman to her own  there harriet is a grave paragraph you will like me for it  you are a very reflecting girl in mentioning to me so particularly your behavior to your grevilles fenwicks and ormes what is that but saying see charlotte i am a much more complaisant creature to the men no one of which i intend to have than you are to your husband  what a pious woman indeed must be your grandmamma that she could suspend her joy her longabsent darling at her feet till she had first thanked god for restoring her to her arms but in this instance we see the force of habitual piety though not so good as i should be myself i revere those who are so and that i hope you will own is no bad sign  well but now for ourselves and those about us  lady olivia has written lady l a letter from windsor it is in french extremely polite she promises to write to me from oxford  lady anne s made me a visit this morning she was more concerned than i wished to see her on my confirming the report she had heard of my brothers being gone abroad i railled her a little too freely as it was before lord g and lord l i never was better rebuked than by her for she took out her pencil and on the cover of a letter wrote these lines from shakespeare and slid them into my hand  and will you rend our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend it is not friendly it is not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury i never my dear told you how freely this lady and i had talked of love but freely as we had talked i was not aware that the matter lay so deep in her heart i knew not how to tell her that my brother had said it could not be i could have wept over her when i read this paper and i owned myself by a whisper justly rebuked she charged me not to let any man see this particularly not either of those present and do you harriet keep what i have written of lady anne to yourself  my aunt eleanor has written a congratulatory letter to me from york sir charles it seems had acquainted her with lord gs day not my day harriet that is not the phrase i hope as soon as he knew it himself and she writes supposing that i was actually offered on it women are victims on these occasions i hope you will allow me that my brother has made it a point of duty to acquaint his fathers sister with every matter of consequence to the family and now she says that both her nieces are so well disposed of she will come to town very quickly to see her new relations and us and desires we will make room for her and yet she owns that my brother has informed her of his being obliged to go abroad and she supposes him gone as he is the beloved of her heart i wonder she thinks of making this visit now he is absent but we shall all be glad to see my aunt nell she is a good creature though an old maid i hope the old lady has not utterly lost either her invention or memory and then between both i shall be entertained with a great number of lovestories of the last age and perhaps of some dangers and escapes which may serve for warnings for emily alas alas they will come too late for your charlotte  i have written already the longest letter that i ever wrote in my life yet it is prating and to you to whom i love to prate i have not near done  you bid me be good and you threaten me if i am not with the ill opinion of all your friends but i have such an unaccountable biass for roguery or what shall i call it that i believe it is impossible for me to take your advice i have been examining myself what a duce is the matter with me that i cannot see my honest man in the same advantageous light in which he appears to every body else yet i do not in my heart dislike him on the contrary i know not were i to look about me far and wide the man i would have wished to have called mine rather than him but he is so important about trifles so nimble yet so slow he is so sensible of his own intention to please and has so many antic motions in his obligingness that i cannot forbear laughing at the very time that i ought perhaps to reward him with a gracious approbation  i must fool on a little while longer i believe permit me harriet so to do as occasions arise  an instance an instance in point harriet let me laugh as i write i did it at the time  what do you laugh at charlotte  why this poor man or as i should rather say this lord and master of mine has just left me he has been making me both a compliment and a present and what do you think the compliment is why if i please he will give away to a virtuoso friend his collection of moths and butterflies i once he remembered raillied him upon them and by what study thought i will thou honest man supply their place if thou have a talent this way pursue it since perhaps thou will not shine in any other and the best anything you know harriet carries with it the appearance of excellence nay he would also part with his collection of shells if i had no objection  to whom my lord  he had not resolved  why then only as emily is too little of a child or you might give them to her too little of a child madam and a great deal of bustle and importance took possession of his features  let me tell you madam  i will not let you my lord and i laughed  well madam i hope here is something coming up that you will not disdain to accept of yourself  up came groaning under the weight or rather under the care two servants with baskets a fine set of old japan china with brown edges believe me they sat down their baskets and withdrew  would you not have been delighted harriet to see my lord busying himself with taking out and putting in the windows one at a time the cups plates jars and saucers rejoicing and parading over them and showing his connoisseurship to his motionless admiring wife in commending this and the other piece as a beauty and when he had done taking the liberty as he phrased it half fearful half resolute to salute his bride for his reward and then pacing backwards several steps with such a strut and a crow  i see him yet  indulge me harriet  i burst into a hearty laugh i could not help it and he reddening looked round himself and round himself to see if any thing was amiss in his garb the man the man honest friend i could have said but had too much reverence for my husband is the oddity nothing amiss in the garb  o harriet why did you beseech me to be good i think in my heart i have the stronger inclination to be bad for it you call me perverse if you think me so bid me be saucy bid me be bad and i may then like other good wives take the contrary course for the sake of dear contradiction  show not however i in turn beseech you to your grandmamma and aunt such parts of this letter as would make them despise me you say you stand up for me i have need of your advocateship never let me want it and do i not after all do a greater credit to my good man when i can so heartily laugh in the wedded state than if i were to sit down with my finger in my eye  i have taken your advice and presented my sister with my half of the jewels i desired her to accept them as they were my mothers and for her sake this gave them a value with her more than equal with their worth but lord l is uneasy and declares he will not suffer lady l long to lie under the obligation were every one of family in south britain and north britain to be as generous and disinterested as lord l and our family the union of the two parts of the island would be complete  lord help this poor obliging man i wish i dont love him at last he has taken my hint and has presented his collection of shells a very sine one he says it is to emily and they two are actually busied and will be for an hour or two i doubt not in admiring them the one strutting over the beauties in order to enhance the value of the present the other courtesying ten times in a minute to show her gratitude poor man when his virtuoso friend has got his butterflies and moths i am afraid he must set up a turners shop for employment if he loved reading i could when our visiting hours are over set him to read to me the new things that come out while i knot or work and is he loved writing to copy the letters which pass between you and me and those for you which i expect with so much impatience from my brother by means of dr bartlett i think he spells pretty well for a lord  i have no more to say at present but compliments without number or measure to all you so deservedly love and honor as well those i have not seen as those i have  one thing reveal to me all the secrets of your heart and how that heart is from time to time affected that i may know whether you are capable of that greatness of mind in a lovecase that you show in all others we will all allow you to love sir charles grandison those who do give honor to themselves if their eyes stop not at person his having so many advantages for the same reason i make no apologies and never did for praising my brother as any other lover of him might do  let me know every thing how and about your fellows too ah harriet you make not the use of power that i would have done in your situation i was halfsorry when my hurrying brother made me dismiss sir walter and yet to have but two danglers after one are poor doings for a fine lady poorer still to have but one  here is a letter as long as my arm adieu i was loath to come to the name but difer it ever so long i must subscribe at last  charlotte g  letter xxxiv miss jervois to miss byron the letter to which this is an answer as well as those written by miss byron to her cousin reeves lady l etc and theirs in return are omitted  monday may   o my dearest my honored miss byron how you have shamed your emily by sending a letter to her such a sweet letter too before i have paid my duty to you in a letter of thanks for all your love to me and for all your kind instructions but i began once twice and thrice and wrote a great deal each time but could not please myself you madam are such a writer and i am such a poor thing at my pen  but i know you will accept the heart and so my very dissidence shows pride since it cannot be expected from me to be a fine writer and yet this very letter i foresee will be the worse for my diffidence and not the better for i dont like this beginning neither  but come it shall go am i not used to your goodness and do you not bid me prattle to you in my letters as i used to do in your dressingroom o what sweet advice have you and do you return for my silly prate and so i will begin  and was you grieved at parting with your emily on saturday morning i am sure i was very much concerned at parting with you i could not help crying all the way to town and lady g shed tears as well as i and so did lady l several times and said you were the loveliest best young lady in the world and we all praised likewise your aunt your cousin lucy and young mr selby how good are all your relations they must be good and lord l and lord g for men were as much concerned as we at parting with you mr reeves was so dull all the way poor mr reeves he was very dull and mr beauchamp he praised you to the very skies and in such a pretty manner too next to my guardian i think mr beauchamp is a very agreeable man i fansy these noble sisters if the truth were known dont like him so well as their brother does perhaps that may be the reason out of jealousy as i may say if there be any thing in my observation but they are vastly civil to him nevertheless yet they never praise him when his back is turned as they do others who cannot say half the good things that he says  well but enough of mr beauchamp my guardian my gracious my  my indulgent guardian who that thinks of him can praise any body else  o madam where is he now god protect and guide my guardian wherever he goes this is my prayer first and last and i cannot tell how often in the day i look for him in every place i have seen him in and pray tell me madam did not you do so when he had left us and when i cannot find him i do so sigh  what a pleasure yet what a pain is there in sighing when i think of him yet i know i am an innocent girl and this i am sure of that i wish him to be the husband of but one woman in the whole world and that is you but then my next wish is  you know what  ah my miss byron you must let me live with you and my guardian if you should ever be lady grandison  but here madam are sad doings sometimes between lord and lady g i am very angry at her often in my heart yet i cannot help laughing nowand then at her outoftheway sayings is not her character a very new one or are there more such young wives i could not do as she does were i to be queen of the globe everybody blames her she will make my lord not love her at last dont you think so and then what will she get by her wit  just this moment she came into my closet  writing emily said she to whom  i told her  dont tell tales out of school emily  i was so afraid that she would have asked to see what i had written but she did not to be sure she is very polite and knows what belongs to herself and everybody else to be ungenerous as you once said to her husband only that is a very sad thing to think of  well and i would give anything to know if you think what i have written tolerable before i go any farther but i will go on in this way since i cannot do better bad is my best but you shall have quantity i warrant since you bid me write long letters  but i have seen my mother it was but yesterday she was in a mercers shop in covent garden i was in lord ls chariot only anne was with me anne saw her first i alighted and asked her blessing in the shop i am sure i did right she blessed me and called me dear love i stayed till she had bought what she wanted and then i slid down the money as if it were her own doing and glad i was i had so much about me it came but to four guineas i begged her speaking low to forgive me for so doing and finding she was to go home as far as soho and had thoughts of having a hackneycoach called i gave anne money for a coach for herself and waited on my mother to her own lodgings and it being lord ls chariot she was so good as to dispense with my alighting  she blessed my guardian all the way and blessed me she said she would not ask me to come to see her because it might not be thought proper as my guardian was abroad but she hoped she might be allowed to come and see me sometimes  was she not very good madam but my guardians goodness makes everybody good  o that my mamma had been always the same i should have been but too happy  god bless my guardian for putting me on enlarging her power to live handsomely only as a coach brings on other charges and people must live accordingly or be discredited instead of credited by it or i should hope the additional two hundred a year might afford them one yet one does not know but mr o hara may have been in debt before he married her and i fansy he has people who hang upon him but if it pleases god i will not when i am at age and have a coach of my own suffer my mother to walk on foot what a blessing is it to have a guardian that will second every good purpose of ones heart  lady olivia is rambling about and i suppose she will wait here in england till sir charless return but i am sure he never will have her a wicked wretch with her poniards yet it is pity she is a fine woman but i hate her for her expectation as well as for her poniard and a woman to leave her own country to seek for a husband i could die before i could do so though to such a man as my guardian yet once i thought i could have liked to have lived with her at florence she has some good qualities and is very generous and in the main well esteemed in her own country everybody knew she loved my guardian but i dont know how it is nobody blamed her for it vast as the difference in fortune then was but that is the glory of being a virtuous man to love him is a credit instead of a shame o madam who would not be virtuous and that not only for their own but for their friends sakes if they loved their friends and wished them to be well thought of  lord w is very desirous to hasten his wedding  mr beauchamp says that all the mansfields he knows them bless my guardian every day of their lives and their enemies tremble he has commissions from my guardian to enquire and act in their cause that no time may be lost to do them service against his return  we have had another visit from lady beauchamp and have returned it she is very much pleased with us you see i say us indeed my two dear ladies are very good to me but i have no merit it is all for their brothers sake  mr beauchamp tells us just now that his motherinlaw has joined with his father at her own motion to settle  000 l a year upon him i am glad of it with all my heart are not you he is all gratitude upon it he says that he will redouble his endeavors to oblige her and that his gratitude to her as well as his duty to his father will engage his utmost regard for her  mr beauchamp sir harry himself and my lady are continually blessing my guardian everybody in short blesses him  but ah madam where is he at this moment o that i were a bird that i might hover over his head and sometimes bring tidings to his friends of his motions and good deeds i would often flap my wings dear miss byron at your chamberwindow as a signal of his welfare and then fly back again and perch as near him as i could  i am very happy as i said before in the favor of lady and lord l and lady and lord g but i never shall be so happy as when i had the addition of your charming company i miss you and my guardian o how i miss you both but dearest miss byron love me not the less though now i have put pen to paper and you see what a poor creature i am in my writing many a one i believe may be thought tolerable in conversation but when they are so silly as to put pen to paper they expose themselves as i have done in this long piece of scribble but accept it nevertheless for the true love i bear you and truer love never flamed in any bosom to any one the most dearly beloved than does in mine for you  i am afraid i have written arrant nonsense because i knew not how to express half the love that is in the heart of  your everobliged and affectionate emily jervois  letter xxxv miss byron to lady g tuesday may   i have no patience with you lady g you are ungenerously playful thank heaven if this be wit that i have none of it but what signifies expostulating with one who knows herself to be faulty and will not amend how many stripes charlotte do you deserve  but you never spared anybody not even your brother when the humor was upon you so make haste and since you will lay in stores for repentance fill up your measure as fast as you can  reveal to you the state of my heart  ah my dear it is an unmanageable one greatness of mind  i dont know what it is  all his excellencies his greatness his goodness his modesty his cheerfulness under such afflictions as would weigh down every other heart that had but half the compassion in it with which his overflows  must not all other men appear little and less than little nothing in my eyes  it is an instance of patience in me that i can endure any of them who pretend to regard me out of my own family  i thought that when i got down to my dear friends here i should be better enabled by their prudent counsels to attain the desirable frame of mind which i had promised myself but i find myself mistaken my grandmamma and aunt are such admirers of him take such a share in the disappointment that their advice has not the effect i had hoped it would have lucy nancy are perpetually calling upon me to tell them something of sir charles grandison and when i begin i know not how to leave off my uncle raillies me laughs at me sometimes reminds me of what he calls my former brags i did not brag my dear i only hoped that respecting as i did every man according to his merit i should never be greatly taken with any one before duty added force to the inclination methinks the company of the friends i am with does not satisfy me yet they never were dearer to me than they now are i want to have lord and lady l lord and lady g dr bartlett my emily with me to lose you all at once  is hard there seems to be a stranger void in my heart  and so much at present for the state of that heart  i always had reason to think myself greatly obliged to my friends and neighbors all around us but never till my return after these few months absence knew how much so many kind visiters such unaffected expressions of joy on my return that had i not a very great counterbalance on my heart would be enough to make me proud  my grandmamma went to shirley manor on saturday on monday i was with her all day but she would have it that i should be melancholy if i staid with her and she is so selfdenyingly careful of her harriet there never was a more noble heart in woman but her solitary moments as my uncle calls them are her moments of joy and why because she then divests herself of all that is either painful or pleasurable to her in this life for she says that her cares for her harriet and especially now are at least a balance for the delights she takes in her  you command me to acquaint you with what passes between me and the gentlemen in my neighborhood in your style m fellows  mr fenwick invited himself to breakfast with my aunt selby yesterday morning i would not avoid him  i will not trouble you with the particulars you know well enough what men will say on the subject upon which you will suppose he wanted to talk to me he was extremely earnest i besought him to accept my thanks for his good opinion of me as all the return i could make him for it and this in so very serious a manner that my heart was fretted when he declared with warmth his determined perseverance  mr greville made us a teavisit in the afternoon my uncle and he joined to railly us poor women as usual i left the defense of the sex to my aunt and lucy how poor appears to me every conversation now with these men  but hold saucy harriet was not your uncle selby one of the railliers  but he does not believe all he says and therefore cannot wish to be so much regarded on this topic as he ought to be by me on others  after the run of raillery was over in which mr greville made exceptions favorable to the women present he applied to every one for their interest with me and to me to countenance his address he set forth his pretensions very pompously and mentioned a very considerable increase of his fortune which before was a very handsome one he offered our own terms he declared his love for me above all women and made his happiness in the next world as well as in this depend upon my favor to him  it was easy to answer all he said and is equally so for you to guess in what manner i answered him and he finding me determined began to grow vehement and even affrontive he hinted to me that he knew what had made me so very resolute he threw out threatenings against the man be he whom he would that should stand in the way of his success with me at the same time intimating saucily as i may say for his manner had insult in it that it was impossible a certain event could ever take place  my uncle was angry with him so was my aunt lucy was still more angry than they but i standing up said pray my dear friends take nothing amiss that mr greville has said  he once told me that he would set spies upon my conduct in town if sir your spies have been just i fear nothing they can say but the hints you have thrown out show such a total want of all delicacy of mind that you must not wonder if my heart rejects you yet i am not angry i reproach you not every one has his peculiar way all that is left me to say or to do is to thank you for your favorable opinion of me as i have thanked mr fenwick and to desire that you will allow me to look upon you as my neighbor and only as my neighbor  i courtesied to him and withdrew  but my great difficulty had been before with mr orme his sister had desired that i would see her brother he and she were invited by my aunt to dinner on tuesday they came poor man he is not well i am sorry for it poor mr orme is not well he made me such honest compliments as i may say his heart was too much in his civilities to raise them above the civilities that justice and truth might warrant in favor of a person highly esteemed mine was filled with compassion for him and that compassion would have shown itself in tokens of tenderness more than once had i not restrained myself for his sake how you my dear lady g can delight in giving pain to an honest heart i cannot imagine i would make all god almightys creatures happy if i could and so would your noble brother is he not crossing dangerous seas and ascending through almost perpetual snows those dreadful alps which i have heard described with such terror for the generous end of relieving distress  i made mr orme sit next me i was assiduous to help him and to do him all the little offices which i thought would light up pleasure in his modest countenance and he was quite another man it gave delight to his sister and to all my friends to see him smile and look happy i think my dear lady g that when mr orme looks pleasant and at ease he resembles a little the goodnatured lord g  o that you would take half the pains to oblige him that i do to relieve mr orme  half the pains did i say that you would not take pains to disoblige him and he would be of course obliged dont be afraid my dear that in such a world as this things will not happen to make you uneasy without your studying for them excuse my seriousness i am indeed too serious at times  but when mr orme requested a few minutes audience of me as he called it and i walked with him into the cedar parlour which you have heard me mention and with which i hope you will be one day acquainted he paid poor man for his too transient pleasure why would he urge a denial that he could not but know i must give  his sister and i had afterward a conference she pleaded too strongly her brothers health and even his life both which she would have it depended on my favor to him i was greatly affected and at last besought her if she valued my friendship as i did hers never more to mention to me a subject which gave me a pain too sensible for my peace  she requested me to assure her that neither mr greville nor mr fenwick might be the man they both took upon them she said to ridicule her brother for the profound respect even to reverence that he bore me which if he knew might be attended with consequences for that her brother mild and gentle as was his passion for me had courage to resent any indignities that might be cast upon him by spirits boisterous as were those of the two gentlemen she had named she never therefore told her brother of their scoffs but it would go to her heart if either of them should succeed or have reason but for a distant hope  i made her heart easy on that score  i have just now heard that sir hargrave pollexfen is come from abroad already what can be the meaning of it he is so lowminded so malicious a man and i have suffered so much from him  what can be the meaning of his sudden return i am told that he is actually in london pray my dear lady g inform yourself about him and whether he thinks of coming into these parts  mr greville when he met us at stonystratford threw out menaces against sir hargrave on my account and said it was well he was gone abroad i told him then that he had no business even were sir hargrave present to engage himself in my quarrels  mr greville is an impetuous man a man of rough manners and makes many people afraid of him he has i believe indeed had his spies about me for he seems to know everything that has befallen me in my absence from selbyhouse  he has dared also to threaten somebody else insolent wretch but he hinted to me yesterday that he was exceedingly pleased with the news that a certain gentleman was gone abroad in order to prosecute a former amor was the light wretchs as light expression if my indignant eyes could have killed him he would have fallen dead at my feet  let the constant and true respects of all my friends to you and yours and to my beloved emily be always for the future considered as very affectionately expressed whether the variety of other subjects leaves room for a particular expression of them or not by my dearest lady g  your faithful and everobliged harriet byron  letter xxxvi lady g to miss byron saturday may   i thank you harriet for yours what must your fellows think of you in this gross age your delicacy must astonish them there used to be more of it formerly but how should men know anything of it when women have forgot it lord be thanked we females since we have been admitted into so constant a share of the public diversions want not courage we can give the men stare for stare wherever we meet them the next age nay the rising generation must surely be all heroes and heroines but whither has this word delicacy carried me me who it seems have faults to be corrected for of another sort and who want not the courage for which i congratulate others  but to other subjects i could write a vast deal of stuff about my lord and self and lord and lady l who assume parts which i know not how to allow them and sometimes they threaten me with my brothers resentments sometimes with my harriets so that i must really have leadingstrings fastened to my shoulders o my dear a fond husband is a surfeiting thing and yet i believe most women love to be made monkeys of  but all other subjects must now give way we have heard of though not from my brother a particular friend of mr lowther was here with a letter from that gentleman acquainting us that sir charles and he were arrived at paris  mr beauchamp was with us when mr lowthers friend came he borrowed the letter on account of the extraordinary adventure mentioned in it  make your heart easy in the first place about sir hargrave he is indeed in town but very ill he was frighted into england and intends not ever again to quit it in all probability he owes it to my brother that he exists  mr beauchamp went directly to cavendish square and informed himself there of other particulars relating to the affair from the very servant who was present and acting in it and from those particulars and mr lowthers letter wrote one for dr bartlett mr beauchamp obliged me with the perusal of what he wrote whence i have extracted the following account for his letter is long and circumstantial and i did not ask his leave to take a copy as he seemed desirous to hasten it to the doctor  on wednesday the    0 of april in the evening as my brother was pursuing his journey to paris and was within two miles of that capital a servantman rode up in visible terror to his postchaise in which were mr lowther and himself and besought them to hear his dreadful tale the gentlemen stopped and he told them that his master who was an englishman and his friend of the same nation had been but a little while before attacked and forced out of the road in their postchaise as he doubted not to be murdered by no less than seven armed horsemen and he pointed to a hill at distance called mont martre behind which they were at that moment perpetrating their bloody purpose he had just before he said addressed himself to two other gentlemen and their retinue who drove on the faster for it  the servants great coat was open and sir charles observing his livery asked him if he were not a servant of sir hargrave pollexfen and was answered in the affirmative  there are it seems trees planted on each side the road from st denis to paris but which as france is an open and uninclosed country would not but for the hill have hindered the seeing a great way off the scuffling of so many men on horseback there is also a ditch on either hand but places left for owners to come at their grounds with their carts and other carriages sir charles ordered the postboy to drive to one of those pass ges saying he could not forgive himself if he did not endeavor to save sir hargrave and his friend whose name the man told him was merceda  his own servants were three in number besides one of mr lowther my brother made mr lowthers servant dismount and getting himself on his horse ordered the others to follow him he begged mr lowther to continue in the chaise bidding the dismounted servant stay and attend his master and galloped a way toward the hill his ears were soon pierced with the cries of the poor wretches and presently he saw two men on horseback holding the horses of four others who had under them the two gentlemen struggling groaning and crying out for mercy  on the approach of sir charles who was a good way ahead of his servants he calling out to spare the gentlemen and bending his course to relieve the prostrate sufferers two of the four quitted their prey and mounting joined the other two horsemen and advanced to meet sir charles with a show of supporting the two men on foot in their violence who continued laying on the wretches with the butends of their whips unmercifully  as the assailants offered not to fly and as they had more than time enough to execute their purpose had it been obbery and murder sir charles concluded it was likely that these men were actuated by a private revenge he was confirmed in this surmise when the our men on horseback though each had his pistol ready drawn as sir charles also had his demanded a conference warning sir charles how he provoked his fate by his rashness and declaring that he was a dead man if he fired  forbear then said sir charles all further violences to the gentlemen and i will hear what you have to say  he then put his pistol into his holster and one of his servants being come up and the two others at hand to whom he called out not to fire till they had his orders he gave him his horses reins bidding him have an eye to the holsters of both and leapt down and drawing his sword made toward the two men who were so cruelly exercising their whips and who on his approach retired to some little distance drawing their hangers  the four men on horseback joined the two on foot just as they were quitting the objects of their fury and one of them said forbear for the present further violence brother the gentleman shall be told the cause of all this  murder sir said he is not intended nor are we robbers the men whom you are solicitous to save from our vengeance are villains  be the cause what it will answered sir charles you are in a country noted for doing spee justice upon proper application to the magistrates in the same instant he raised first one groaning man then the other their heads were all over bloody and they were so much bruised that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and hats which ly near them nor put them on without sir charless help  the men on foot by this time had mounted their horses and all fix stood upon their defense but one of them was so furious crying out that his vengeance should be yet more complete that two of the others could hardly restrain him  sir charles asked sir hargrave and mr merceda whether they had reason to look upon themselves as injured men or injurers one of the assailants answered that they both knew themselves to be villains  either from consciousness or terror perhaps from both they could not speak for themselves but by groans nor could either of them stand or sit upright  just then came up in the chaise mr lowther and his servant each a pistol in his hand he quitted the chaise when he came near the suffering men and sir charles desired him instantly to examine whether the gentlemen were dangerously hurt or not  the most enraged of the assailants having slipped by the two who were earnest to restrain him would again have attacked mr merceda offering a stroke at him with his hanger but sir charles his drawn sword still in his hand caugt hold of his hand and turning his horses head aside diverted a  which in all probability would otherwise have been a finishing one  they all came about sir charles bidding him at his peril use his sword upon their friend and sir charless servants were coming up to their masters support had there b en occasion at that instant mr lowther assisted by his own servant was examining the wounds and bruises of the two terrified men who had yet no reason to think themselves safe from further violence  sir charles repeatedly commanded his servants not to fire nor approach nearer without his orders the persons said he to the assailants whom you have so cruelly used are englishmen of condition i will protect them be the provocation what it will you must know that your attempt upon them is a criminal one and if my friend last come up who is a very skilful surgeon shall pronounce them in danger you shall find it so still he held the horse of the furious one and three of them who seemed to be principals were beginning to express some resentment at this cavalier treatment when mr lowther gave his opinion that there was no apparent danger of death and then sir charles quitting the mans bridle and putting himself between the assailants and sufferers said that as they had not either offered to fly or to be guilty of violence to himself his friend or servants he was afraid they had some reason to think themselves ill used by the gentlemen but however as they could not suppose they were at liberty in a civilized country to take their revenge on the persons of those who were entitled to the protection of that country he should expect that they would hold themselves to be personally answerable for their conduct at a proper tribunal  the villains one of the men said knew who they were and what the provocation was which had merited a worse treatment than they had hitherto met with you sir proceeded he seem to be a man of honor and temper we are men of honor as well as you our design as we told you was not to kill the miscreants but to give them reason to remember their villainy as long as they lived and to put it out of their power ever to be guilty of the like they have made a vile attempt continued he on a ladys honor at abbeville and finding themselves detected and in danger had taken roundabout ways and shifted from one vehicle to another to escape the vengeance of her friends the gentleman whose horse you held and who has reason to be in a passion is the husband of the lady a spanish husband surely harriet not a french one according to our notions that gentleman and that are her brothers we have been in pursuit of them two days for they gave out in order no doubt to put us on a wrong scent that they were to go to antwerp  and it seems my dear that sir hargrave and his colleague had actually sent some of their servants that way which was the reason that they were themselves attended but by one  the gentleman told sir charles that there was a third villain in their plot they had hopes he said that he would not escape the close pursuit of a manufacturer at abbeville whose daughter a lovely young creature he had seduced under promises of marriage their government he observed were great countenancers of the manufacturers at abbeville and he would have reason if he were laid hold of to think himself happy if he came off with being obliged to perform his promises  this third wretch must be mr bagenhall the lord grant say i that he may be laid hold of and obliged to make a ruined girl an honest woman as they phrase it in lancashire dont you wish so my dear and let me add that had the relations of the injured lady completed their intended vengeance on those two libertines a very proper punishment i ween for all libertines it might have helped them to pass the rest of their lives with great tranquillity and honest girls might for any contrivances of theirs have passed to and from masquerades without molestation  sir hargrave and his companion intended it seems at first to make some resistance four only of the seven stopping the chaise but when the other three came up and they saw who they were and knew their own guilt their courage failed them  the seventh man was set over the postboy whom he had led about half a mile from the spot they had chosen as a convenient one for their purpose  sir hargraves servant was secured by them at their first attack but after they had disarmed him and his masters he found an opportunity to slip from them and made the best of his way to the road in hopes of procuring assistance for them  while sir charles was busy in helping the bruised wretches on their feet the seventh man came up to the others followed by sir hargraves chaise the assailants had retired to some distance and after a consultation together they all advanced toward sir charles who binding his servants be on their guard leapt on his horse with that agility and presence of mind for which mr beauchamp says he excels most men and leading toward them do you advance gentlemen said he as friends or otherwise  mr lowther took a pistol in each hand and held himself ready to support him and the servants disposed themselves to obey their masters orders  our enmity answered one of them is only to these two inhospitable villains murder as we told you was not our design they know where we are to be found and that they are the vilest of men and have not been punished equal to their demerits let them on their knees asks this gentlemans pardon pointing to the husband of the insulted lady we insist upon this satisfaction and upon their promise that they never more will come within two leagues of abbeville and we will leave them to your protection  i fancy harriet that these womenfrightening heroes needed not to have been urged to make this promise  sir charles turning toward them said if you have done wrong gentlemen you ought not to scruple asking pardon if you know yourselves to be innocent though i should be loath to risque the lives of my friend and servants yet shall not my countrymen make so undue a submission  the wretches kneeled and the seven men civilly saluting sir charles and mr lowther rode off to the joy of the two delinquents who kneeled again to their deliverer and poured forth blessings upon the man whose life so lately one of them sought and whose preservation he had now so much reason to rejoice in for the sake of his own safety  my brother himself could not but be well pleased that he was not obliged to come to extremities which might have ended fatally on both sides  by this time sir hargraves postchaise was come up he and his colleague were with difficulty lifted into it my brother and mr lowther went into theirs and being but a small distance from paris they proceeded thither in company the poor wretches blessing them all the way and at paris found their other servants waiting for them  sir charles and mr lowther saw them in bed in the lodgings that had been taken for them they were so stiff with the bastinado they had met with that they were unable to help themselves mr merceda had been more severely i cannot call it more cruelly treated than the other for he it seems was the greatest malefactor in the attempt made upon the lady and he had besides two or three gashes which but for his struggles would have been but one  as you my dear always turn pale when the word masquerade is mentioned so i warrant will abbeville be a word of terror to these wretches as long as they live  their enemies it seems carried off their arms perhaps in the true spirit of french chivalry with a view to lay them as so many trophies at the feet of the insulted lady  mr lowther writes that my brother and he are lodged in the hotel of a man of quality a dear friend of the late mr danby and one of the three whom he has remembered in his will and that sir charles is extremely busy in relation to the executorship and having not a moment to spare desired mr lowther to engage his friend to whom he wrote to let us know as much and that he was hastening everything for his journey onwards  mr beauchamps narrative of this affair is as i told you very circumstantial i thought to have shortened it more than i have done i wish i have not made my abstract confused in several material places but i have not time to clear it up adieu my dear  charlotte g  letter xxxvii lady g to miss byron sunday may   i believe i shall become as arrant a scribbler as somebody else i begin to like writing a great compliment to you i assure you i see one may bring ones mind to anything  i thought i must have had recourse when you and my brother left us and when i was married to the public amusements to fill up my leisure and as i have seen everything worth seeing of those many times over masquerades excepted and them i despise time you know in that case would have passed a little heavily after having shown myself and by seeing who and who were together laid in a little store of the right sort of conversation for the teatable for you know harriet that among us modern fine people the company and not the entertainment is the principal part of the rareeshow pretty enough to make the entertainment and pay for it too to the honest fellows who have nothing to do but to project schemes to get us together  i dont know what to do with this man i little thought that i was to be considered as such a doll such a toy as he would make me i want to drive him out of the house without me were it but to purvey for me news and scandal what are your fine gentlemen sit for else you know that with all my faults i have a domestic and managing turn a man should encourage that in a wife and not be perpetually teazing her for her company abroad unless he did it with a view to keep her at home our sex dont love to be prescribed to even in the things to which they are not naturally averse and for this very reason perhaps because it becomes us to submit to prescription human nature harriet is a perverse thing i believe if my good man wished me to stay at home i should torture my brain as other good wives do for inventions to go abroad  it was but yesterday that in order to give him a hint i pinned my apron to his coat without considering who was likely to be a sufferer by it and be getting up in his usual nimble way gave it a rent and then looked behind him with so much apprehension  hands folded eyes goggling bag in motion from shoulder to shoulder i was vexed too much to make the use of the trick which i had designed and huffed him he made excuses and looked pitifully bringing in his soul to testify that he knew not how it could be  how it could be wretch when you are always squatting upon ones clothes in defiance of hoop or distance  he went out directly and brought me in two aprons either of which was worth twenty of that he so carelessly rent who could be angry with him  i was indeed thinking to chide him for this  as if i were not to be trusted to buy my own clothes and it was just at my tongues end to ask him what the milaner could think of a man buying linen for a woman but he looked at me with so goodnatured an eye that i relented and accepted with a bow of graciousness his present only calling him an odd creature  and that he is you know my dear  we live very whimsically in the mean not above four quarrels however and as many more chidings in a day what does the man stay at home for then so much when i am at home married people by frequent absences may have a chance for a little happiness how many debatings if not direct quarrels are saved by the good mans and his meek wifes seeing each other but once or twice a week in what can men and women who are much together employ themselves but in proving and defending quarrelling and makingup especially if they both chance to marry for love which thank heaven is not altogether my case for then both honest souls having promised more happiness to each other than they can possibly meet with have nothing to do but reproach each other at least tacitly for their disappointment  a great deal of freemasonry in love my dear believe me the secret like that when found out is hardly worth the knowing  well but what silly rattle is this charlotte methinks you say and put on one of your wisest looks  no matter harriet there may be some wisdom in much folly every one speaks not out so plainly as i do but when the novelty of an accuisition or change of condition is over be the change or the acquisition what it will the principal pleasure is over and other novelties are hunted after to keep the pool of life from stagnating  this is a serious truth my dear and i expect you to praise me for it you are very sparing of your praise to poor me and yet i had rather have your good word than any womans in the world or mans either i was going to say but i should then have forgot my brother as for lord g were i to accustom him to obligingness i should destroy my own consequence for then it would be no novelty and he would be hunting after a new folly  very true harriet  well but we have had a good serious fallingout and it still subsists it began on friday night present lord and lady l and emily i was very angry with him for bringing it on before them the man has no discretion my dear none at all and what about why we have not made our appearance at court forsooth  a very confident thing this same appearance i think a compliment made to fine clothes and jewels at the expense of modesty lord g pleads decorum  decorum against modesty my dear  but if by decorum is meant fashion i have in a hundred instances found decorum beat modesty out of the house and as my brother who would have been our principal honor on such an occasion is gone abroad and as ours is an elderly novelty as i may say our fineries were not ready you know before my brother went i was servent against it  i was the only woman of condition in england who would be against it  i told my lord that was a reflection on my sex but lord and lady l who had been spoken to i believe by lady gertrude were both on his side i shall have this man utterly ruined for a husband among you  when there were three to one it would have looked cowardly to yield you know i was brave but it being proposed for sunday and that being at a little distance it was not doubted but i would comply so the night past off with prayings hopings and a little mutteration allow me that word or find me a better the entreaty was renewed in the morning but no  i was ashamed of him he said i asked him if he really thought so  he should think so if i refused him heaven forbid my lord that i who contend for the liberty of acting should hinder you from the liberty of thinking only one piece of advice honest friend said i dont imagine the worst against yourself and another if you have a mind to carry a point with me dont bring on the cause before anybody else for that would be to doubt either my duty or your own reasonableness  as sure as you are alive harriet the man made an exception against being called honest friend as if as i told him either of the words were incompatible with quality so once he was as froppish as a child on my calling him the man a higher distinction i think than if i had called him a king or a prince the man  strange creature to except to a distinction that implies that he is the man of men  you see what a captious mortal i have been forced to call my lord but lord and master do not always go together though they do too often for the happiness of many a meek soul of our sex  well this debate seemed suspended by my telling him that if i were presented at court i would not have either the earl or lady gertrude go with us the very people who were most desirous to be there   but i might not think of that at the time you know  i would not be thought very perverse only a little whimsical or so and i wanted not an excellent reason for excluding them  are their consents to our past affair doubted my lord said i that you think it necessary for them to appear to justify us  he could say nothing to this you know and i should never forgive the husband as i told him on another occasion who would pretend to argue when he had nothing to say  then for the baby will be always craving something he wanted me to go abroad with him  i forget whither  but to some place that he supposed poor man i should like to visit i told him i dared to say he wished to be thought a modern husband and a fashionable man and he would get a bad name if he could never stir out without his wife neither could he answer that you i now  well we went on mutter mutter grumble grumble the thunder rolling at a distance a little impatience nowandthen however portending that it would come nearer but as yet it was only pray my dear oblige me and pray my lord excuse me till this morning when he had the assurance to be pretty peremptory hinting that the lord in waiting had been spoke to a fine time of it would a wife have if she were not at liberty to dress herself as she pleases were i to choose again i do assure you my dear it should not be a man who by his taste for moths and butterflies shells china and such like trifles would give me warning that he would presume to dress his baby and when he had done would perhaps admire his own fancy more than her person i believe my harriet i shall make you afraid of matrimony but i will pursue my subject for all that   when the insolent saw that i did not dress as he would have had me he drew out his face glouting to half the length of my arm but was silent soon after lady l sending to know whether her lord and she were to attend as to the drawing room and i returning for answer that i should be glad of their company at dinner he was in violent wrath true as you are alive and dressing himself in a great hurry left the house without saying by your leave with your leave or whether he would return to dinner or not very pretty doings harriet  lord and lady l came to dinner however i thought they were very kind and till they opened their lips was going to thank them for then it was all elder sister and insolent brotherinlaw i do assure you upon my word harriet they took upon them  lady l told me i might be the happiest creature in the world if  and there was so good as to stop  one of the happiest only lady l who can be happier than you  but i said she should neither be so nor deserve to be so if  good of her again to stop at if  we cannot be all of one mind replied i i shall be wiser in time  where was poor lord g gone  poor lord g is gone to seek his fortune i believe  what did i mean  i told them the airs he had given himself and that he was gone without leave or notice of return  he had served me right absolutely right lord l said  i believed so myself lord g was a very good sort of man and ought not to bear with me so much as he had done but it would be kind in them not to tell him what i had owned  the earl lifted up one hand the countess both they had not come to dine with me they said after the answer i had returned but as they were afraid something was wrong between us  mediators are not to be of one side only i said and as they had been so kindly free in blaming me i hoped they would be as free with him when they saw him  and then it was for gods sake charlotte and let me entreat you lady g and let me too beseech you madam said emily with tears stealing down her cheeks  you are both very good you are a sweet girl emily i have a tooplayful heart it will give me some pain and some pleasure but if i had not more pleasure than pain from my play i should not be so silly  my lord not coming in and the dinner being ready i ordered it to be served  will not you wait a little longer for lord g  no i hope he is safe and well he is his own master as well as mine i sighed i believe and no doubt has a paramount pleasure in pursuing his own choice  they raved i begged that they would let us eat our dinner with comfort my lord i hoped would come in with a keen appetite and nelthorpe should get a supper for him that he liked  when we had dined and retired into the adjoining drawing room i had another schoolingbout emily was even saucy but i took it all yet in my heart was vexed at lord gs perverseness  at last in came the honest man he does not read this and so cannot take exceptions and i hope you will not at the word honest  so lordly so stiff so solemn  upon my word  had it not been sunday i would have gone to my harpsichord directly he bowed to lord and lady l and to emily very obligingly to me he nodded  i nodded again but like a goodnatured fool smiled he stalked to the chimney turned his back toward it buttoned up his mouth held up his glowing face as if he were disposed to crow yet had not won the battle  one hand in his bosom the other under the skirt of his waistcoat and his posture firmer than his mind  yet was my heart so devoid of malice that i thought his attitude very genteel and had we not been man and wife agreeable  we hoped to have found your lordship at home said lord l or we should not have dined here  if lord g is as polite a husband as a man said i he will not thank your lordship for this compliment to his wife  lord g swelled and reared himself up his complexion which was before in a glow was heightened  poor man thought i  but why should my tender heart pity obstinate people  yet i could not help being dutiful  have you dined my lord said i with a sweet smile and very courteous  he stalked to the window and never a word answered he  pray lady l be so good as to ask my lord g if he has dined was not this very condescending on such a behavior  lady l asked him and as gentlyvoiced as if she were asking the same question of her own lord lady l is a kindhearted soul harriet she is my sister  i have not madam to lady l turning rudely from me and not very civilly from her ah thought i these men the more they are courted  wretches to find their consequence in a womans meekness  yet i could not forbear showing mine  nature harriet who can resist constitution  what stiff airs are these approaching him  i do assure you my lord i shall not take this behavior well and put my hand on his arm  i was served right would you believe it the man shook off my condescending hand by raising his elbow scornfully he really did  nay then  i left him and retired to my former seat i was vexed that it was sunday i wanted a little harmony  lord and lady l both blamed me by their looks and my lady took my hand and was leading me

to him fearing he had not dined and might be sick for want of eating was i not forced to apply to lady l for an answer to my careful question on his scornfully turning from me in silence  might we not

now for a cuff thought i i was half afraid of it but out of the room again capered he  lord bless me said i what a passionate creature is this  lord and lady l both turned from me with indignation but no wonder if one that they both did they are a silly pair and i believe have agreed to keep each other in countenance in all they do  but emily affected me she sat before in one corner of the room

let us be happy and he kissed my hand but not so cordially as it became him to do and in came lord and lady l with countenances a little ungracious  i took my seat next my own man with an air of officiousness hoping to oblige him by it and he was obliged and another day not yet quite agreed upon this parade is to be made  and thus began proceeded and ended this doughty quarrel and who knows but before the day is absolutely resolved upon we may have half a score more four five six days as it may happen is a great space of time for people to agree who are so much together and one of whom is playful and the other will not be played with but these kembo and oons airs harriet stick a little in my stomach and the man seems not to be quite come to neither he is fullen and gloomy and dont prate away as he used to do when we have made up before  but i will sing him a song tomorrow i will please the honest man if i can but he really should not have had for a wife a woman of so sweet a temper as  your charlotte g  letter xxxviii lady g to miss byron monday may   my lord and i have had another little  tiff shall i call it it came not up to a quarrel married people would have enough to do if they were to trouble their friends every time they misunderstood one another and now a word or two of other people not always scribbling of ourselves  we have just heard that our cousin everard has added another fool of our sex to the number of the weak ones who disgrace it a sorry fellow he has been seen with her by one whom he would not know at cupers gardens dressed like a seaofficer and skulking like a thief into the privatest walks of the place when he is tired of the poor wretch he will want to accommodate with us by promises of penitence and reformation as once or twice before rakes are not only odious but they are despicable fellows you will the more clearly see this when i assure you from those who know that this silly creature our cousin is looked upon among his brother libertines and smarts as a man of first consideration  he has also been seen in a gayer habit at a certain gamingtable near covent garden where he did not content himself with being an idle spectator colonel winwood our informant shook his head but made no other answer to some of our enquiries may he suffer say i  a sorry fellow   preparations are going on all sofast at windsor we are all invited god grant that miss mansfield may be as happy a lady w as we all conclude she will be but i never was fond of matches between sober young women and battered old rakes much good may do the adventurers drawn in by gewgaw and title  poor things  but convenience when that is the motive whatever foolish girls think will hold out its comforts while a gratified love quickly evaporates  beauchamp who is acquainted with the mansfields is entrusted by my brother in his absence with the management of the lawaffairs he hopes he says to give a good account of them the base steward of the uncle calvert who lived as a husband with the woman who had been forced upon his superannuated master in a doting fit has been brought by the death of one of the children born in mr calverts lifetime and by the precarious health of the posthumous one to make overtures of accommodation a new hearing of the cause between them and the keelings is granted and great things are expected from it in their favor from some new lights thrown in upon that suit the keelings are frighted out of their wits it seems and are applying to sir john lambton a disinterested neighbor to offer himself as a mediator between them the mansfields will so soon be related to us that i make no apology for interesting you in their affairs  be sure you chide me for my whimsical behavior to lord g i know you will but dont blame my heart my head only is wrong  a little more from fresh informations of this sorry varlet everard i wished him to suffer but i wished him not to be so very great a sufferer as it seems he is sharpers have bit his head off quite close to his shoulders they have not left it him to carry under his arm as the honest patron of france did his they lend it him however nowandthen to repent with and curse himself the creature he attended to cupers gardens instead of a country innocent as he expected her to be comes out to be a cast mistress experienced in all the arts of such and acting under the secret influences of a man of quality who wanting to get rid of her supports her in a prosecution commenced against him poor devil for performance of covenants he was extremely mortified on finding my brother gone abroad he intends to apply to him for his pity and help sorry fellow he boasted to us on our expectation of our brothers arrival from abroad that he would enter his cousin charles into the ways of the town now he wants to avail himself against the practices of the sons of that town by his cousins character and consequence  a combination of sharpers it seems had long set him as a man of fortune but on his taking refuge with my brother gave over for a time their designs upon him till he threw himself again in their way  the worthless fellow had been often liberal of his promises of marriage to young creatures of more innocence than this and thinks it very hard that he should be prosecuted for a crime which he had so frequently committed with impunity can you pity him i cannot i assure you the man who can betray and ruin an innocent woman who loves him ought to be abhorred by men would he scruple to betray and ruin them if he were not afraid of the law  yet there are women who can forgive such wretches and herd with them   my aunt eleanor is arrived a good plump bonnyfaced old virgin she has chosen her apartment at present we are most prodigiously civil to each other but already i suspect she likes lord g better than i would have her she will perhaps if a party should be formed against your poor charlotte make one of it  will you think it time thrown away to read a further account of what is come to hand about the wretches who lately in the double sense of the word were overtaken between st denis and paris  sir hargrave pollexfen it seems still keeps his chamber he is thought not to be out of danger from some inward hurt which often makes him bring up blood in quantities he is miserably oppressed by lowness of spirits and when he is a little better in that respect his impatience makes his friends apprehensive for his head but has he intellects strong enough to give apprehensions of that nature fool and madman we often join as terms of reproach but i believe fools seldom run really mad  merceda is in a still more dangerous way besides his bruises and a fractured skull he has it seems a wound in his thigh which in the delirium he was thrown into by the fracture was not duly attended to and which but for his valiant struggles against the knife which gave the wound was designed for a still greater mischief his recovery is despaired of and the poor wretch is continually offering up vows of penitence and reformation if his life may be spared  bagenhall was the person who had seduced by promises of marriage and fled for it the manufacturers daughter of abbeville he was overtaken by his pursuers at douay the incensed father and friends of the young woman would not be otherwise pacified than by his performing his promise which with infinite reluctance he complied with principally through the threats of the brother who is noted for his fierceness and resolution and who once made the sorry creature feel an argument which greatly terrified him bagenhall is at present at abbeville living as well as he can with his new wife cursing his fate no doubt in secret he is obliged to appear fond of her before her brother and father the latter being also a four man a gascon always boasting of his family and valuing himself upon a de affixed by himself to his name and jealous of indignity offered to it the fierce brother is resolved to accompany his sister to england when bagenhall goes thither in order as he declares to secure to her good usage and see her owned and visited by all bagenhalls friends and relations and thus much of these fine gentlemen  how different a man is beauchamp but it is injuring him to think of those wretches and him at the same time he certainly has an eye to emily but behaves with great prudence toward her yet everybody but she sees his regard for her nobody but her guardian runs in her head and the more as the really thinks it is a glory to love him because of his goodness everybody she says has the same admiration of him that she has  mrs reeves desires me to acquaint you that miss clements having by the death of her mother and aunt come into a pretty fortune is addressed to by a yorkshire gentleman of easy circumstances and is preparing to go down thither to reside but that she intends to write to you before she goes and to beg you to favor her with nowandthen a letter  i think miss clements is a good sort of young woman but i imagined she would have been one of those nuns at large who need not make vows of living and dying aunt eleanors or lady gertrudes all three of them good honest souls chaste pious and plain it is a charming situation when a woman is arrived at such a height of perfection as to be above giving or receiving temptation sweet innocents they have my reverence if not my love how would they be affronted if i were to say pity  i think only of my two good aunts at the present writing miss clements you know is a youngish woman and i respect her much one would not jest upon the unsightliness of person or plainness of feature but think you she will not be one of those who twenty years hence may put in a boast of her quondam beauty  how i run on i think i ought to be ashamed of myself  very true charlotte  and so it is harriet i have done  adieu  lord g will be silly again i doubt but i am prepared i wish he had half my patience  be quiet lord g what a fool you are  the man my dear under pretense of being friends run his sharp nose in my eye no bearing his fondness it is worse than insolence how my eye waters  i can tell him  but i will tell him and not you  adieu once more  charlotte g  letter xxxix mr lowther to john arnold esquire his brotherinlaw in london bologna may       i will now my dear brother give you a circumstantial account of our short but flying journey the  0th of april o s early in the morning we left paris and reached lions the   th at night  resting but a few hours we set out for pont beauvoisin where we arrived the following evening there we bid adieu to france and found ourselves in savoy equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains indeed it was a total change of the scene we had left behind us a blooming spring which enlivened with its verdure the trees and hedges on the road we passed and the meadows already smiled with flowers the cheerful inhabitants were busy in adjusting their limits lopping their trees pruning their vines tilling their fields but when we entered savoy nature wore a very different face and i must own that my spirits were great sufferers by the change here we began to view on the nearer mountains covered with ice and snow notwithstanding the advanced season the rigid winter in frozen majesty still preserving its domains and arriving at st jean de maurienne the night of the   th the snow seemed as if it would dispute with us our passage and horrible was the force of the boistrous winds which sat full in our faces  overpowered by the fatigues i had undergone in he expedition we had made the unseasonable coldness of the weather and the sight of one of the worst countries under heaven still clothed in snow and deformed by continual hurricanes i was here taken ill sir charles was greatly concerned for my indisposition which was increased by a great lowness of spirits he attended upon me in person and never had man a more kind and indulgent friend here we stayed two days and then my illness being principally owing to fatigue i found myself enabled to proceed at two of the clock in the morning of the   th we prosecuted our journey in palpable darkness and dismal weather though the winds were somewhat laid and reaching the foot of mount cenis by break of day arrived at lanebourg a poor little village so environed by high mountains that for three months in the twelve it is hardly visited by the chearing rays of the sun every object which here presents itself is excessively miserable the people are generally of an olive complexion with wens under their chins some so monstrous especially women as quite disfigure them  here it is usual to unscrew and take in pieces the chaises in order to carry them on mules over the mountain and to put them together on the other side for the savoy side of the mountain is much more difficult to pass than the other but sir charles chose not to lose time and therefore left the chaise to the care of the innkeeper proceeding with all expedition to gain the top of the hill  the way we were carried was as follows a kind of horse as it is called with you with two poles like those of chairmen was the vehicle on which is secured a sort of elbow chair in which the traveller sits a man before another behind carry this open machine with so much swiftness that they are continually running and skipping like wild goats from rock to rock the four miles of that ascent if a traveller were not prepossessed that these mountaineers are the surestfooted carriers in the universe he would be in continual apprehensions of being overturned i who never undertook this journey before must own that i could not be so fearless on this occasion as sir charles was though he had very exactly described to me how everything would be then though the sky was clear when we passed this mountain yet the cold wind blew quantities of frozen snow in our faces insomuch that it seemed to me just as if people were employed all the time we were passing to wound us with the sharpest needles they indeed call the wind that brings this sharppointed snow the tormenta  an adventure which anywhere else might have appeared ridiculous i was afraid would have proved fatal to one of our chairmen as i will call them i had slapt down my hat to screen my eyes from the fury of that deluge of sharppointed frozen snow and it was blown off my head by a sudden gust down the precipices i gave it for lost and was about to bind a handkerchief over the woollen cap which those people provide to tie under the chin when one of the assistant carriers for they are always six in number to every chair in order to relieve one another undertook to recover it i thought it impossible to be done the passage being as i imagined only practicable for birds however i promised him a crown reward if he did never could the leaps of the most dextrous of ropedancers be compared to those of this daring fellow i saw him sometimes jumping from rock to rock sometimes rolling down a declivity of snow like a ninepin sometimes running sometimes hopping skipping in short he descended like lightning to the verge of a torrent where he sound the hat he came up almost as quick and appeared as little fatigued as if he had never left us  we arrived as the top in two hours from lanebourg and the sun was pretty high above the horizon out of a hut halfburied in snow came some mountaineers with two poor sledges drawn by mules to carry as through the plain of mount cenis as it is called which is about four italian miles in length to the descent of the italian side of the mountain these sledges are not much different from the chairs or sedans or horse we then quitted only the two underpoles are flat and not so long as the others and turning up a little at the end to hinder them from sticking fast in the snow to the foreends of the poles are fixed two round sticks about two feet and a half long which serve for a support and help to the man who guides the mule who running on the snow between the mule and the sledge holds the sticks with eaeh hand  it was diverting to see the two sledgemen striving to outrun each other encouraged by sir charless generosity we arrived at the other end of the plain in less than two hours the man who walked or rather run between the sledge and the mule made a continual noise halloowing and beating the stubborn beast with his fists which otherwise would be very slow in its motion  at the end of this plain we found such another hut as that on the lanebourg side here they took off the smoking mules from the sledges to give them rest  and now began the most extraordinary way of traveling that can be imagined the descent of the mountain from the top of this side to a small village called novalesa is four italian miles when the show has filled up all the inequalities of the mountain it looks in many parts as smooth and equal as a sugar loaf it is on the brink of this rapid descent that they put the sledge the man who is to guide it sits between the seet of the traveller who is seated in the elbow chair with his legs at the outside of the sticks fixed at the foreends of the flat poles and holds the two sticks with his hands and when the sledge has gained the declivity its own weight carries it down with surprising celerity but as the immense irregular rocks under the snow make nowandthen some edges in the declivity which if not avoided would overturn the sledge the guide who foresees the danger by putting his foot strongly and dexterously in the snow next to the precipice turns the machine by help of the abovementioned sticks the contrary way and by way of zigzag goes to the bottom such was the velocity of this motion that we dispatched these four miles in less than five minutes and when we arrived at novalesa hearing that the snow was very deep most of the way to susa and being pleased with our way of traveling we had some mules put again to the sledges and ran all the way to the very gates of that city which is seven miles distant from mount cenis  in our way we had a cursory view of the impregnable fortress of brunetta the greatest part of which is cut out of the solid rock and commands that important pass  we rested all night at susa and having bought a very commodious postchaise we proceeded to turin where we dined and from thence the evening of may   o s got to parma by way of alexandria and placentia having purposely avoided the high road through milan as it would have cost us a few hours more time  sir charles observed to me when we were on the plain or flat top of mount cenis that had not the winter been particularly long and severe we should have had instead of this terrible appearance of snow there flowers starting up as it were under our feet of various kinds which are hardly to be met with anywhere else one of the greatest dangers he told me in passing this mount in winter arises from a ball of snow which is blown down from the top by the wind or falls down by some other accident which gathering all the way in its descent becomes instantly of such a prodigious bigness that there is hardly any avoiding being carried away with it man and beast and smothered in it one of these balls we saw rolling down but as it took another course than ours we had no apprehensions of danger from it  at parma we found expecting us the bishop of nocera and a very reverend father marescotti by name who expressed the utmost joy at the arrival of sir charles grandison and received me at his recommendation with a politeness which seems natural to them i will not repeat what i have written before of this excellent young gentleman intrepidity bravery discretion as well as generosity are conspicuous parts of his character he is studious to avoid danger but is unappalled in it for humanity benevolence providence for others to his very servants i never met with his equal  my reception from the noble family to which he has introduced me the patients case a very unhappy one and a description of this noble city and the fine country about it shall be the subject of my next assure all my friends of my health and good wishes for them and my dear arnold believe me to be  ever yours etc  letter xl sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna wednesday may  0   i told you my dear and reverend friend that i should hardly write to you till i arrived in this city  the affair of my executorship obliged me to stay a day longer at paris than i intended but i have put every thing relating to that trust in such a way as to answer all my wishes  mr lowther wrote to mr arnold a friend of his in london the particulars of the extraordinary affair we were engaged in between st denis and paris with desire that he would inform my friends of our arrival at that capital  we were obliged to stop two days at st jean de maurienne the expedition we traveled with was too much for mr lowther and i expected and was not disappointed from the unusual backwardness of the season to find the passage over mount cenis less agreeable than it usually is in the beginning of may  the bishop of nocera had offered to meet me any where on his side of the mountains i wrote to him from lions that i hoped to see him at parma on or about the very day that i was so fortunate as to reach the palace of the count of belvedere in that city where i found that he and father marescotti had arrived the evening before they as well as the count expressed great joy to see me and when i presented mr lowther to them with the praises due to his skill and let them know the consultations i had had with eminent physicians of my own country on lady clementinas case they invoked blessings upon us both and would not be interrupted in them by my eager questions after the health and state of mind of the two dearest persons of their family  unhappy very unhappy said the bishop let us give you some refreshment before we come to particulars  to my repeated enquiries jeronymo poor jeronymo said the bishop is living and that is all we can say  the sight of you will be a cordial to his heart clementina is on her journey to bologna from naples you desired to find her with us and not at naples she is weak is obliged to travel slowly she will rest at urbino two or three days dear creature what has she not suffered from the cruelty of her cousin laurana as well as from her malady the general has been and is indulgent to her he is married to a lady of great merit quality and fortune he has at length consented that we shall try this last experiment as the hearts of my mother and now lately of my father as well as mine are in it his lady would not be denied accompanying my sister and as my brother could not bear being absent from her he travels with them i wish he had stayed at naples i hope however he will be as ready as you will find us all to acknowledge the favor of this visit and the fatigue and trouble you have given yourself on our account  as to my sisters bodily health proceeded he it is greatly impaired we are almost hopeless with regard to the state of her mind she speaks not she answers not any questions camilla is with her she seems regardless of anybody else she has been told that the general is married his lady makes great court to her but she heeds her not we are in hopes that my mother on her return to bologna will engage her attention she never yet was so bad as to forget her duty either to god or her parents sometimes camilla thinks she pays some little attention to your name but then she instantly starts as in terror looks round her with fear puts her finger to her lips as if she dreaded her cruel cousin laurana should be told of her having heard it mentioned  the bishop and father both regretted that she had been denied the requested interview they were now they said convinced that if that had been granted and she had been left to mrs beaumonts friendly care a happy issue might have been hoped for but now said the bishop  then sighed and was silent  i dispatched saunders early the next morning to bologna to procure convenient lodgings for me and mr lowther  in the afternoon we set out for that city the count of belvedere found an opportunity to let me know his unabated passion for clementina and that he had lately made overtures to marry her notwithstanding her malady having been advised he said by proper persons that as it was not an hereditary but an accidental disorder it might be in time cureable he accompanied us about half way in our journey and at parting remember chevalier whispered he that clementina is the soul of my hope i cannot forego that hope no other woman will i ever call mine  i heard him in silence i admired him for his attachment i pitied him he said he would tell me more of his mind at bologna  we reached bologna on the   th n s saunders had engaged for me the lodgings i had before  our conversation on the road turned chiefly on the case of signor jeronymo the bishop and father were highly pleased with the skill founded on practice which evidently appeared in all that mr lowther said on the subject and the bishop once intimated that be the event what it would his journey to italy should be made the most beneficial affair to him he had ever engaged in mr lowther replied that as he was neither a necessitous nor a meanspirited man and had reason to be entirely satisfied with the terms i had already secured to him he should take it unkindly if any other reward were offered him  think my dear dr bartlett what emotions i must have on entering once more the gates of the porretta palace though clementina was not there  i hastened up to my jeronymo who had been apprized of my arrival the moment he saw me do i once more said he behold my friend my grandison let me embrace the dearest of men now now have i lived long enough he bowed his head upon his pillow and meditated me his countenance shining with pleasure in defiance of pain  the bishop entered he could not be present at our first interview  my lord said jeronymo make it your care that my dear friend be treated by every soul of our family with the gratitude and respect which are due to his goodness methinks i am easier and happier this moment than i have been for the tedious space of time since i last saw him he named that space of time to the day and to the very hour of the day  the marquis and marchioness signifying their pleasure to see me the bishop led me to them my reception from the marquis was kind from his lady it was as that of a mother to a longabsent son i had ever been she was pleased to say a fourth son in her eye and now that she had been informed that i had brought over with me a surgeon of experience and the advice in writing of eminent physicians of my country the obligations i had laid on their whole family whatever were the success were unreturnable  i asked leave to introduce mr lowther to them they received him with great politeness and recommended their jeronymo to his best skill mr lowthers honest heart was engaged by a reception so kind he never he told me afterward beheld so much pleasure and pain struggling in the same countenance as in that of the lady so fixed a melancholy as in that of the marquis mr lowther is a man of spirit though a modest man he is as on every proper occasion i found a man of piety and has a heart tender as manly such a man heart and hand is qualified for a profession which is the most useful and certain in the art of healing he is a man of sense and learning out of his profession and happy in his address  the two surgeons who now attend signor jeronymo are both of this country they were sent for with the approbation and at the request of the family i presented mr lowther to them but first gave them his character as a modest man as a man of skill and experience and told them that he had quitted business and wanted not either fame or fortune  they acquainted him with the case and their methods of proceeding mr lowther assisted in the dressings that very evening jeronymo would have me to be present mr lowther suggested an alteration in their method but in so easy and gentle a manner as if he doubted not but such was their intention when the state of the wounds would admit of that method of treatment that the gentlemen came readily into it a great deal of matter had been collected by means of the wrong methods pursued and he proposed if the patients strength would bear it to make an aperture below the principal wound in order to discharge the matter downward and he suggested the dressing with hollow tents and bandage and to dismiss the large tents with which they had been accustomed to distend the wound to the extreme anguish of the patient on pretense of keeping it open to assist the discharge  let me now give you my dear friend a brief history of my jeronymos case and of the circumstances which have attended it by which you will be able to account for the difficulties of it and how it has happened that in such a space of time either the cure was not effected or that the patient yielded not to the common destiny  in lingering cases patients or their friends are sometimes too apt to blame their physicians and to listen to new recommendations the surgeons attending this unhappy case had been more than once changed signor jeronymo it seems was unskilfully treated by the young surgeon of cremona who was first engaged he neglected the most dangerous wound and when he attended to it managed it wrong for want of experience he was therefore very properly dismissed  the unhappy man had at first three wounds one in his breast which had been for some time healed one in his shoulder which through his own impatience having been too suddenly healed up was obliged to be laid open again the other which is the most dangerous in the hipjoint  a surgeon of this place and another of padua were next employed the cure not advancing a surgeon of eminence from paris was sent for  mr lowther tells me that this mans method was by far the most eligible but that he undertook too much since from the first there could not be any hope from the nature of the wound in the hipjoint that the patient could ever walk without sticks or crutches and of this opinion were the other two surgeons but the french gentleman was so very pragmatical that he would neither draw with them nor give reasons for what he did regarding them only as his assistants they could not long bear this usage and gave up to him in disgust  how cruel is punctilio among men of this science in cases of difficulty and danger  the present operators when the two others had given up were not but by leave of the french gentleman called in he valuing himself on his practice in the royal hospital of invalids at paris looked upon them as theorists only and treated them with as little ceremony as he had shown the others so that at last from their frequent differences it became necessary to part with either him or them his pride when he knew that this question was a subject of debate would not allow him to leave the family an option he made his demand it was complied with and he returned to paris  from what this gentleman threw out at parting to the disparagement of the two others signor jeronymo suspected their skill and from a hint of this suspicion as soon as i knew i should be welcome myself i procured the favor of mr lowthers attendance  all mr lowthers fear is that signor jeronymo has been kept too long in hand by the different managements of the several operators and that he will sink under the necessary process through weakness of habit but however he is of opinion that it is requisite to confine him to a strict dict and to deny him wine and fermented liquors in which he has hitherto been indulged against the opinion of his own operators who have been too complaisant to his appetite  an operation somewhat severe was performed on his shoulder yesterday morning the italian surgeons complimented mr lowther with the lancet they both praised his dexterity and signor jeronymo who will be consulted on everything that he is to suffer blessed his gentle hand  at mr lowthers request a physician was yesterday consulted who advised some gentle aperitives as his strength will bear it and some balsamics to sweeten the blood and juices  mr lowther told me just now that the fault of the gentlemen who have now the care of him has not been want of skill but of critical courage and a too great solicitude to oblige their patient which by their own account had made them forego several opportunities which had offered to assist nature in short sir said he your friend knows too much of his own case to be ruled and too little to qualify him to direct what is to be done especially as symptoms must have been frequently changing  mr lowther doubts not he says but he shall soon convince jeronymo that he merits his confidence and then he will exact it from him and in so doing shall not only give weight to his own endeavors to serve him but rid the other two gentlemen of embarrasments which have often given them diffidencies when resolution was necessary  mean time the marquis his lady the bishop and father marescotti are delighted with mr lowther they will flatter themselves they say with hopes of their jeronymos recovery which however mr lowther for fear of disappointment does not encourage jeronymo himself owns that his spirits are much revived and we all know the power that the mind has over the body  thus have i given you my reverend friend a general notion of jeronymos case as i understand it from mr lowthers as general representation of it  the family have prevailed upon him to accept of an apartment adjoining to that of his patient jeronymo said that when he knows he has so skilful a friend near him he shall go to rest with confidence and good rest is of the highest consequence to him  what a happiness my dear dr bartlett will fall to my share if i may be an humble instrument in the hand of providence to heal this brother and if his recovery shall lead the way to the restoration of his sister each so known a lover of the other that the world is more ready to attribute her malady to his misfortune and danger than to any other cause but how early days are these on which my love and my compassion for persons so meritorious embolden me to build hopes so forward  lady clementina is now impatiently expected by every one she is at urbino the general and his lady are with her his haughty spirit cannot bear to think she should see me or that my attendance on her should be thought of so much importance to her  the marchioness in a conversation that i have just now had with her hinted this to me and besought me to keep my temper if his high notion of family and female honor should carry him out of his usual politeness  i will give you my dear friend the particulars of this conversation  she began with saying that she did not for her part now think that her beloved daughter whom once she believed hardly any private man could deserve was worthy of me even were she to recover her reason  i could not but guess the meaning of so high a compliment what answer could i return that would not on one hand be capable of being thought cool on the other of being supposed interested and as if i were looking forward to a reward that some of the family still think too high but while i knew my own motives i could not be displeased with a lady who was not at liberty to act in this point according to her own will  i only said and it was with truth that the calamity of the le lady had endeared her to me more than it was possible the most prosperous fortune could have done  i my good chevalier may say anything to you we are undetermined about everything we know not what to propose what to consent to your journey on the first motion though but from some of us the dear creature continuing ill you in possession of a considerable estate exercising yourself in doing good in your native country you must think we took all opportunities of enquiring aster the man once so likely to be one of us the first fortune in italy olivia though she is not a clementina pursuing you in hopes of calling herself yours for to england we hear she went and there you own she is what obligations have you laid upon us  what can we determine upon what can we wish  providence and you madam shall direct my steps i am in yours and your lords power the same uncertainty from the same unhappy cause leaves me not the thought because not the power of determination the recovery of lady clementina and her brother without a view to my own interest fills up at present all the wishes of my heart  let me ask said the lady it is for my own private satisfaction were such a happy event as to clementina to take place could you would you think yourself bound by your former offers  when i made those offers madam the situation on your side was the same that it is now lady clementina was unhappy in her mind my fortune it is true is higher it is indeed as high as i wish it to be i then declared that if you would give me your clementina without insisting on one hard on one indispensable article i would renounce her fortune and trust to my fathers goodness to me for a provision shall my accession to the estate of my ancestors alter me  no madam i never yet made an offer that i receded from the circumstances ontinuing the same if in the article of residence the marquis and you and clementina would relax i would acknowledge myself indebted to your goodness but without conditioning for it  i told you said she that i put this question only for my own private satisfaction and i told you truth i never will deceive or mislead you whenever i speak to you it shall be as if even in your own concerns i spoke to a third person and i shall not doubt but you will have the generosity to advise as such though against yourself  may i be enabled to act worthy of your good opinion i madam look upon myself as bound you and yours are free  what a pleasure is it my dear dr bartlett to the proud heart of your friend that i could say this  had i sought in pursuance of my own inations to engage the affections of the admirable miss byron as i might with honor have endeavored to do had not the woes of this noble family and the unhappy state of mind of their clementina so deeply affected me i might have involved myself and that loveliest of women in difficulties which would have made such a heart as mine still more unhappy than it is  let me know my dear dr bartlett that miss byron is happy i rejoice whatever be my own destiny that i have not involved her in my uncertainties the countess of d is a worthy woman the earl her son is a good young man miss byron merits such a mother the countess such a daughter how dear how important is her welfare to me  you know your grandison my good dr bartlett her friendship i presumed to ask i dared not to wish to correspond with her i rejoice for her sake that i trusted not my heart with such a proposal what difficulties my dear friend have i had to encounter with  god be praised that i have nothing with regard to these two incomparable women to reproach myself with i am persuaded that our prudence if rashly we throw not ourselves into difficulties and if we will exert it and make a reliance on the proper assistance is generally proportioned to our trials  i asked the marchioness after lady sforza and her daughter laurana and whether they were at milan  you have heard no doubt answered she the cruel treatment that my poor child met with from her cousin laurana lady sforza justifies her in it we are upon extrame bad terms on that account they are both at milan the general has vowed that he never will see them more if he can avoid it the bishop only as a christian can forgive them you chevalier know the reason why we cannot allow our clementina to take the veil  the particular reasons i have not madam been inquisitive about but have always understood them to be family ones grounded on the dying request of one of her grandfathers  our daughter sir is entitled to a considerable estate which joins to our own domains it was purchased for her by her two grandfathers who vied with each other in demonstrating their love of her by solid effects one of them my father was in his youth deeply in love with a young lady of great merit and she was thought to love him but in a fit of pious bravery as he used to call it when everything between themselves and between the friends on both sides was concluded on she threw herself into a convent and passing steadily through the probationary forms took the veil but afterward repented and took pains to let it be known that she was unhappy this gave him a disgust against the sequestered life though he was in other respects a zealous catholic and clementina having always a serious turn in order to deter her from embracing it both grandfathers being desirous of strengthening their house as well in the female as male line they inserted a clause in each of their wills by which they gave the estate designed for her in case she took the veil to laurana and her descendants laurana to enter into possession of it on the day that clementina should be professed but if clementina married laurana was then to be entitled only to a handsome legacy that she might not be entirely disppointed for the reversion in case clementina had no children was to go to our eldest son who however has been always generously folicitous to have his sister marry  both grandfathers were rich our son giacomo on my fathers death as he had willed entered upon a considerable estate in the kingdom of naples which had for ages been in my family he is therefore and will be greatly provided for our second son has great prospects before him in the church but you know he cannot marry poor jeronymo we had not before his misfortune any great hopes of strengthening the family by his means he alas as you well know who took such laudable pains to reclaim him before we knew you with great qualities imbibed free notions from bad company and declared himself a despiser of marriage this the two grandfathers knew and often deplored for jeronymo and clementina were equally their favorites to him and the bishop they bequeathed great legacies  we suspected not till very lately that laurana was deeply in love with the count of belvedere and that her mother and she had views to drive our sweet child into a convent that laurana might enjoy the estate which they hoped would be an inducement to the count to marry her cruel laurana cruel lady sforza so much love as they both pretended to our child and i believe had till the temptation strengthened by power became too strong for them unhappy the day that we put her into their hands  besides the estate so bequeathed to clementina we can do great things for her few italian families are so rich as ours her brothers forget their own interest when it comes into competition with hers she is as generous as they our four children never knew what a contention was but who should give up an advantage to the other this child this sweet child was ever the delight of us all and likewise of our brother the conte della porretta what joy would her recovery and nuptials give us  dear creature we have sometimes thought that she is the fonder of the sequestered life as it is that which we wish her not to embrace  but can clementina be perverse she cannot yet that was the life of her choice when she had a choice her grandfathers wishes notwithstanding  will you now wonder chevalier that neither our sons nor we can allow clementina to take the veil can we so reward laurana for her cruelty especially now that we suspect the motives for her barbarity could i have thought that my sister sforza  but what will not love and avarice do their powers united to compass the same end the one reigning in the bosom of the mother the other in that of the daughter alas alas they have between them broken the spirit of my clementina the very name of laurana gives her terror  so far is she sensible but o sir her sensibility appears only when she is harshly treated to tenderness she had been too much accustomed to make her think an indulgent treatment now r unusual  i dread my dear dr bartlet yet am impatient to see the unhappy lady i wish the general were not to accompany her i am afraid i shall want temper if he forget his my own heart when it tells me that i have not deserved ill usage from my equals and superiors in rank especially bids me not bear it i am ashamed to own to you my reverend friend that pride of spirit which knowing it to be my fault i ought long ago to have subdued  make my compliments to every one i love mr and mrs reeves are of the number  charlotte i hope is happy if she is not it must be her own fault let her know that i will not allow when my love to both sisters is equal that she shall give me cause to say that lady l is my best sister  lady olivin gives me uneasiness i am ashamed my dear dr bartlett that a woman  a rnk so considerable and who his some great qualities should lay herself under obligation to the complion of a man who can only pity her when a woman gets over that delicacy which is the test or bulwark as i may say of modesty  modesty itself may soon lie at the mercy of an enemy  tell my emily that she is never out of my mind and that among the other excellent examples she has before her miss byrons must never be out of hers  lord l and lord g are in full possession of my brotherly love  i shall not at present write to my beauchamp in writing to you i write to him  you know all my heart if in this or my future letters anything should sall from my pen that would possibly in your opinion affect or give uneasiness to any one i love and honor were it to be communicated i depend upon your known and unquestionable discretion to keep it to yourself  i shall be glad you will enable yourself to inform me of the way sir hargrave and his friends are in they were very ill at paris and it was thought too weak and too much bruised to be soon carried over to england men englishmen thus to disgrace themselves and their country  i am concern d for them  i expect large pacquets by the next mails from my friends england which was always dear to me never was half so dear as now to  your everaffectionate grandison  letter xli sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna may      the bishop set out yesterday for urbino in order to inform himself of his sisters state of health and perhaps to qualify the general to meet me with temper and politeness were i sure the good prelate thought this necessary my pride would be excited  the count of belvedere arrived here yesterday he made it his first business to see me he acquainted me but in confidence that proposals of marriage with lady laurana had actually been made him to which he had returned answer that his heart however hopelesly was engaged and that he never could think of any other woman than lady clementina  he made no scruple he said of returning so short an answer because he had been apprised of the cruelty with which one of the noblest young women in italy had been treated by the proposers and with their motives for it  you see chevalier said he that i am open and unreserved to you you will oblige me if you will let me know what it is you propose to your self in the present situation  but first i should be glad to hear from your own mouth what passed between you and clementina and the family before you quitted italy the last time i have had their account  i gave him a very faithful relation of it he was pleased with it exactly as it has been represented to me said he were clementina and you of one reigion there could have been no hope for any other man i adore her for her piety and for her attachment to hers and am not so narrowminded a man but i can admire you for yours as her malady is accidental i never w old think of any other woman could i flatter myself that she would not if restored be unhappy with me  but now tell me i am earnest to know are you come over to us i know you are invited with an expectation to call her yours in case of her recovery  i answered him as i had done the marchioness  he seemed as much pleased with me as i am with him he is gone back to parma  friday may      the bishop is returned lady clementina has been very ill a fever how has she been hurried about he tells me that the general and his lady and also the conte della porretta acknowledge themselves and their whole family obliged to me for the trouble i have been at to serve their jeronymo  the fever having left lady clementina the will set out in a day or two the count and signor sebastiano as well as the general and his lady will attend her i am impatient to see her yet how greatly will the sight of her afflict me the bishop says she is the picture of silent woe yet though greatly emaciated looks herself were his words they told her that jeronymo was better than he had been your dear jeronymo said the general to her the sweet echo repeated  jeronymo  and was again silent  they afterwars proposed to name me to her they did she looked quick about her as if for somebody laura her maid was occasionally called upon she started and threw her arms about camilla as terrified looking wildly camilla doubts not but by the name laura she apprehended the savage laurana to be at hand  how must she have suffered from her barbarity  sweet innocent she who even in her sveries thought not but of good to the soul of the man whom she honored with her regard  she who bore offense without resentment and by meekness only sought to calm the violence for which she had not given the least cause  but when camilla and she had retired she spoke to her the bishop gave me the following dialogue between them as he had it from camilla  did they not name to me the chevalier grandison said she  they did madam  see see said she before i name him again if my cruel cousin hearken not at the door  your cruel cousin madam is at many miles distance  she may hear what i say for all that  my dear lady clementina she cannot hear she shall never more come near you  so you say  did i ever deceive you madam  i cannot remember my memory is gone quite gone camilla  she then looked earnestly at camilla and screamed  what ails you my dearest young lady  recovering herself  ah my own camilla it is you i thought by the cast of your eye you were become laurana  do not do not give me such another look  camilla was not sensible of any particularity in her looks  here you have me again upon a journey camilla but how do i know that i am not to be carried to my cruel cousin  you are really going to your fathers palace at bologna madam  is my mother there  she is  who else  the chevalier madam  what chevalier  grandison  impossible is he not in proud england  he is come over madam  what for  with a skilful english surgeon in hopes to cure signor jeronymo   poor jeronymo  and to pay his compliments to you madam  flatterer how many hundred times have i been told so  should you wish to see him madam  see whom  the chevalier grandison  once i should and sighed  and not now madam  no i have lost all i had to say to him yet i wish i were allowed to go to that england we poor women are not suffered to go anywhither while men   there she stopped and camilla could not make her say any more  the bishop was fond of repeating these particulars as she had not for some time talked so much and so sensibly   friday evening i pass more than half my time with signor jeronymo but that i may not fatigue his spirits at different hours of the day the italian surgeons and mr lowther happily agree in all their measures they applaud him when his back is turned and he speaks well of them in their absence this mutual return of good offices which they hear of unites them the patient declares that he had not for months been so easy as now everybody attributes a great deal to his hearts being revived by my frequent visits tomorrow it is proposed to make an opening below the most difficult wound mr lowther says he will not flatter us till he sees the success of this operation  the marquis and his lady are inexpressibly obliging to me i had yesterday a visit from both on an indisposition that confined me to my chamber occasioned i believe by a hurry of spirits by fatigue by my apprehensions for jeronymo my concern for clementina and by my too great anxiety for the dear friends i had so lately left in england  you know dr bartlett that i have a heart too susceptible for my own peace though i endeavor to conceal from others those painful sensibilities which they cannot relieve the poor olivia was ever to be my disturbance miss byron must be happy in the rectitude of her own heart i am ready to think that she will not be able to resist the warm instances of the countess of d in favor of her son who is certainly one of the best young men among the nobility she will be the happiest woman in the world as she is one of the most deserving if she be as happy as i wish her  emily takes up a large portion of my thoughts  our beauchamp i know must be happy so must my lord w my sisters and their lords  why then shall i not think myself so god restore jeronymo and his sister and i must i will for you my dear dr bartlett are so and then i will subscribe myself a partaker of the happiness of all my friends and particularly  your everaffectionate grandison   letter xlii sir charles grandison to dr bartlett bologna monday may      last night arrived lady clementina the general his lady the count and signor sebastiano  i had left jeronymo about an hour he had had in the morning the intended opening made by mr lowther he would have me present  the operation was happily performed but through weakness of body he was several times in the day troubled with faintings  i left him tolerably cheerful in the evening and rejoicing in expectation of his sisters arrival and as the bishop had assured him of the generals grateful disposition he longed he said to see that affectionate brother and his lady once more he had never but once seen her before and then was so ill that he could hardly compliment her on the honor she had done their family  the bishop sent to tell me that his sister was arrived but that being fatigued and unhappy camilla should acquaint me in the morning with the way in which she should then be  i slept not half an hour the whole night you my dear friend will easily account for my restlesness  i sent as usual early in the morning to know how jeronymo rested the answer was favorable returned by mr lowther who sat up with him that night at his own motion he knew not but something critical might happen  camilla came the good woman was so full of her own joy to see me once more in italy that i could not presently get a word from her of what my heart throbbed with impatience to know  at last you will said she have the general and the bishop with you ah sir my poor young lady what has she suffered since you left us you will not know her we are not sure she will know you who shall be able to bear the first interview she has now but few intervals it is all one gloomy confusion with her she cares not to speak to anybody every stranger she sees terrifies her o the vile thrice vile lady laurana   in this manner ran on camilla nor would she enter into any other particulars than the unhappy ones she left me to collect from the broken hints and exclamations thus thrown out alas thought i the calamities of clementina have affected the head of the poor camilla she hurried away lest she should be wanted and lest the general should find her with me  the two brothers came soon after the general took my hand with a kind of forced politeness we are all obliged to you sir said he for your mr lowther are the surgeons of england so famous but the people of your nation have been accustomed to give wounds they should therefore furnish operators to heal them we are obliged to you also for the trouble you have given yourself in coming over to us in person jeronymo has found a revival of spirits upon it god grant they may not subside but alas our sister  poor clementina  she is lost  would to god said the bishop we had left her to the care of mrs beaumont  the general himself having taken her from florence would not join in this wish there was a middle course he said that ought to have been taken but laurana is a daughter of the devil said he and lady sforza ought to be detested for upholding her  the general expressed himself with coldness on my coming over but said that now i was on the spot and as his sister had been formerly desirous of seeing me an interview might be permitted in order to satisfy those of the family who had given me the invitation which it was very good of me to accept especially as i had the lady olivia in england attending my motions but otherwise he had no opinion  there he stopped  i looked upon him with indignation mingled with contempt and directing myself to the bishop you remember my lord said i the story of naaman the syrian   kings v   what is that my lord said he to the bishop  far be it from me continued i still directing myself to the bishop to presume upon my own consequence in the application of the story but your lordship will judge how far the comparison will hold would to god it might throughout  a happy allusion said the bishop i say amen  i know not who this naaman is said the general nor what is meant by your allusion chevalier but by your looks i should imagine that you mean me contempt  my looks my lord generally indicate my heart you may make light of my intention and so will i of the trouble i have been at if your lordship make not light of me but were i my lord in your own palace at naples i would tell you that you seem not to know in my case what graciousness is yet i ask not for favor from you but as much for your own sake as mine  dear grandison said the bishop  my lord to his brother  did you not promise me  why did you mention olivia to the chevalier  does that disturb you sir said the general to me i cannot make light of a man of your consequence especially with ladies sir  in a scornful manner  the general you see my lord said i turning to the bishop has an insuperable ill will to me i found when i attended him at naples that he had harbored surmises that were as injurious to his sister as to me i was in hopes that i had obviated them but a rooted malevolence will recur however satisfied as i am with my own  he shall for many sakes find it very difficult to provoke me  for my own sake among the rest chevalier with an air of drollery  you are at liberty returned i to make your own constructions allow me my lords to attend you to signor jeronymo  not till you are cordial friends said the bishop  brother give me your hand offering to take it  chevalier yours   dispose of mine as you please my lord said i holding it out  he took it and the generals at the same time and would have joined them  come my lord said i to the general and snatched his reluctant hand accept of a friendly offer from a heart as friendly let me honor you from my own knowledge for those great qualities which the world gives you i demand your favor from a consciousness that i deserve it and that i could not were i to submit to be treated with indignity by any man i should be sorry to look little in your eyes but i will not in my own  who can bear the superiority this man assumes brother  you oblige me my lord to assert myself  the chevalier speaks nobly my lord his character is well known let me lead you both friends to our jeronymo but say brother  say chevalier that you are so  i cannot bear said the general that the chevalier grandison should imagine himself of so much consequence to my sister as some of you seem to think him  you know me not my lord i have at present no wish but for the recovery of your sister and signor jeronymo were i able to be of service to them that service would be my reward but my lord if it will make you easy and induce you to treat me as my own heart tells me i ought to be treated i will give you my honor and let me say that it never yet was forfeited that whatever turn your sisters malady may take i will not accept of the heighest favor that can be done me but with the joint consent of the three brothers as well as of your father and mother permit me to add that i will not enter into any family that shall think meanly of me nor subject the woman i love to the contempt of her own relations  this indeed is nobly said replied the general give me your hand upon it and i am your friend for ever  proud man he could not bear to think that a sumple english gentleman as he looks upon me to be should ally with their family improbable as it is in his own opinion that the unhappy lady should ever recover her reason but he greatly loves the count of belvedere and all the family was fond of an alliance with that deserving nobleman  the bishop rejoiced to find us at last in a better way of understanding each other than we had hitherto been in and it was easier for me to allow for this haughty man as mrs beaumont had let me know what the behavior was that i had to expect from him and indeed his father mother and two brothers were very apprehensive of it it will therefore be a pleasure to them that i have so easily overcome his prejudices  they both advised me to suspend my visit to their brother till the afternoon that they might have the more time to consult with one another and to prepare and dispose their sister to see me  at taking leave the general snatched my hand and with an air of pleasantry said i have a wife grandison i wished him joy you need not said he for i have it one of the best of women she longs to see you i think i need not be apprehensive because she is generous and i ever must be grateful but take care take care grandison i shall watch every turn of your eye admire her if you will you will not be able to help it but i am glad she saw you not before she was mine  i rejoice said the bishop that a meeting which notwithstanding your promises brother gave me apprehensions as we came is followed by so pleasant a parting henceforth we are four brothers again  ay and remember chevalier that my sister has also four brothers  may the number four not be lessened by the death of my jeronymo and may clementina be restored and providence dispose as it pleases of me i am now going to the palace of porretta with what agitations of mind you dr bartlett can better imagine than i describe  end of the fourth volume
