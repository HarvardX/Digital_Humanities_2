a new analysis of the bristol waters together with the cause of the diabetes and hectic  and their cure as it results from those waters experimantally considered  by john shebbeare chemist  front sub adversa scopulis pendentibus antrum intus aquae dulces  virg aeneis london printed for tho cox at the lamb under the royal exchange mdccxl price one shilling  to the physicians of the city of bristol gentlemen the reason of my undertaking the following analysis will be plainly enough seen in the introduction but whether i have succeeded or failed in my account of the diabetes and it is cure as it arises from the bristol waters is left entirely to your determination  it has never once entered into my imagination that those waters will more effectually cure a diabetes and hectic now than heretofore or any great advantage accrue to mankind from this account yet it has ever been agreeable to find the theory of any science corresponding to the facts arising from the practice of it  you will excuse me if through this account of the diabetes etc i incline to my profession every man has some bias and the business in which he is most engaged is naturally most apt to draw him  there was a time you perfectly well know when almost every thing in physic was accounted for from chemical principles there was also when every disease and the cure of it was reduced to mathematical and hydrostatical accounts and all these in their different turns have disappeared and observation and the history of diseases have again succeeded  but methinks there is a degree of truth annexed to every manner of accounting for disorders though not an absolute one and they seem to be mostly false only when they deny a truth to each other anatomy will discover to us that the arteries and veins contain what we call blood but what that fluid is and what alterations arise in it from different degrees of heat and the addition of different medicines chemistry alone can inform us it informs us also experimentally whether our secretions some of them are perfectly secernd or not and though we cannot venture to ascertain that because such and such phenomenon arise from the mixture of different medicines with the animal fluids apart from the body that they will be similar there to when within the laws of circulation yet we must not altogether despise the experimental and analogical manner of reasoning since we very often see that very fatal consequences are brought on by medicine and very probably too in the same manner within us as without in the experiments it would be as ridiculous just as if we should contemn the advantages accruing from numbers because we cannot attain to infinity  whatever has been said here in the chemical hypothesis may be said with equal truth in another view of the mathematical and hydrostatical account  it may perhaps seem at first sight that the situation of the well is too poetically described for any thing in which physic is concerned but i imagine when it is considered that it was designed as a picture and as it relieves the mind from the dryness of the experiments such a liberty may be allowed me especially since when the description ends that kind of style is no longer continued  if this essay should have the good fortune of being liked by you it will amply reward the care i took in the experimental part where to be just was my strictest endeavor as it shall always be in preparing those medicines which may come under your administration and for those reasons that every physician may receive the due honor of a just prescription and every patient the true effect of a good medicine  i am gentlemen your most obedient servantj shebbeare  the introduction it is more than a year since i began a course of experiments on the bristol waters but upon knowing that dr keir had undertaken the analysis i immediately stopped my enquiry and awaited his publication in expectation of something quite accurate and satisfactory upon perusal of his book i found my self disappointed and continued my experiments for these reasons  first because i see no account for the heat and other phenomenon of the waters  next i apprehend the conclusions drawn from his experiments are not just  and lastly if the waters do contain what the doctor affirms they will ever be irreconcilable with the cure of a diabetes  i think then there needs no apology for an enquiry of this kind it rather becomes necessary that some other should be made which may bring the rationale and practice of those waters to coincide and satisfy the patient of the truth of some principles upon which he may ground his expectation of a cure now let us suppose they contain nitre and limestone powder with an exceeding subtle spirit is there in this city any physician that would heartily prescribe these waters or any distant physician that would send a patient to a mineral either trifling inefficacious or of a nature quite opposite the cure if then this should be the event which is not unlikely it will be fatal to the health if not lives of great numbers  as the following experiments are of my own making i can the better answer for the truth of the facts there has been no accuracy wanting in discovering the contents of the waters and ascertaining them from phenomenon quite definitive i have produced also analogous appearances by different experiments with conjectures of their causes then having considered the source of a diabetes i show the effects of those contents on animal solids and fluids as they produce the cure  whatever contradictions may be found in this analysis to that of dr keir they must not be understood to arise from any inclination i have to contradict but from the truth of the examination and where that is the supposition every man will be satisfied with it however contrary to his sentiments  the situation of the hotwell the situation of the hotwell is as picturesque perhaps as can be imagined it lies on the side of the river avon about a mile and half distant from the city of bristol the stream issues from a very high clift of lime rock perhaps two hundred feet below the summit and ten above the level of low water but as the water rises here in the lowest tides thirty feet and in the spring much more it was of necessity rendered inaccessible some hours every day till mr padmore a man well known for his genius in mechanics enclosed it with a cistern and affixed pumps to the spring by means of these the stream is elevated almost thirty feet in all its native heat purity and perfection notwithstanding this care the river water when it rises above the spring mixes with the medicinal and renders it unfit for use this is perfectly well known by those that pump at the well and consequently as soon as perceived they abstain till it recovers its former purity  the river avon flows here till it falls into the severn sea between two cliffs in some places vastly high craggy and overhanging in others perpendicular or gently sloping here covered with woods and flowering shrubs of all the different shades of green filled with music of our singing birds there gloomy and obscure contrasted by strong lights and various colors of the marble rocks which are as variegated as the foreign and admit as beautiful a polish add to this the flowing of the tide which enhanses the beauty by bringing vessels of every kind close to the windows of the waterroom and compleats as agreeable landscape as can be seen any where and as the mind and body reciprocally affect each other how proper an entertainment is it for the imaginations of men indisposed and how salutary an avocation to those thoughts which every valetudinarian is too apt to indulge hence it is in some greater degree conducive to health than places altogether void of these amusements  on the summit of the rocks there formerly stood a chapel dedicated to st vincent it is equally uncertain whether he was canonized for the discovery of the medicinal spring and the cures thence resulting to mankind or from clearing the river of huge rocks that distressed the sailors in their navigation near this place whatever was the cause he constantly received their vows for fafety as their tutelar saint and was of no small distinction  the downs which are on a level with the cliffs are of a dry healthy soil and much frequented by company they are open to the reviving breezes of the sea which refresh them every summers day here too you may adapt your prospects and situation to every humor whither you choose to be concealed beneath the shade of rocks and woods reclined beside some murmuring rivulet which naturally return our thoughts upon ourselves or whether you prefer the exalted situation where the mind widens with the view into benevolence and good wishes that prospects have a kind of moral effect on the thought i presume no one will deny since light and colors are to the eye what sound and harmony is to the ear hence too it was that the temples of the ancient deities were situated according to their attributes that of pluto in a cavern all sad and gloomy by the side of rumbling waters whilst that of the muses was placed on the point of parnassus all gay and enlivening perhaps the most elevated eminence of this cliff was made the seat of st vincents chapel because his beneficence was more extensive than that of other men  the essential difference of the air in this place from most other dry and elevated situations is that it has but little if any of that vague acid so generally dispersed through the earth which in some places is even deadly as at the grotto dei cani in italy we may be assured of this from the nature of the waters and fossils in both which an alcalescence prevails now every thing offensive in the atmosphere must arise from exhalation but it is scarce probable that there are any acid effluvia here because if the acid was in any quantity there must be more salts found in the water since it is evident there is no want of limestone now limestone and a mineral acid for ever produce alum and consequently as there is little alum found here the air must be void of acid effluvia notwithstanding this this great advantage it must not be thought that this air is agreeable to every indispsition it can be of service to none but those of a cold pituitous nervous habit and detrimental to all whose juices tend to alcalescence and putrefaction from a sanguine constitution  the lodginghouses are neat and well situated having a pleasant prospect and as they are near a large city it is easy to be provided with every necessary here are baths too both private and well contrived and a long room with the usual diversions attending such places  it seems but of little significancy to determine the quantity of water discharged in any certain time because it conduces nothing toward an account of it is properties and since there is more wasted than used notwithstanding the great demand for it but should there be any one curious enough to enquire he may be satisfied by the following experiment it has been experimentally found by monsieur mariotte that water flowing from the surface of a pool through a hole an inch square and always full runs off thirty cubic feet in an hour paris measure upon this experiment having taken the mean proportion of the depth of the stream where it runs out over the rock it may be nearly known how many square inches it contains and consequently what aperture it would pass through naturally then considering that the contents of circles are to each other as the squares of their diameters the whole discharge in one hour may be pretty justly known  how long this medicinal water has been prescribed by physicians for those maladies it is now so deservedly esteemed to cure is uncertain we know however that they have been administered with great success and their character much heightened by the present physicians of bristol  experiments on the bristol water the more accurately to distinguish the genus of the waters i shall consider the phenomenon as they naturally appear the first of which are its sparkling and whiteness in the glass upon growing cold this whiteness disappears and is precipitated to the bottom of the bottle in white flakes after being kept some time  experiment i to the bottom of a glass by means of some wax having fixed a thermometer the thermometer was of farenheits contrivance and measured from iceland cold to hot by a scale of     degrees  it was pumped on till the spirits rose to the utmost from the heat upon examination it was found to the heat of health as seventyseven is to ninetyfour the heat of the atmosphere being at that time fiftytwo  experiment ii to a glass of the water recent from the spring was poured syrup of violets and it became green with a solution of silver in aqua fortis sugar of lead in common water oil of tartar per deliquium it turned milky and precipitated quicksilver dissolved in strong spirit of nitre turned yellow with the hotwell water with a solution of sublimate in water spirit of hartshorn and tincture of steel the water continued transparent with oil of vitriol a brisk agitation and effervescence arose with galls no difference  experiment iii in order to know whether there were any spirits escaped from the waters in cooling i fixed a receiver to a retort and well luted the juncture then through a hole made in the crown of the retort by a glass funnel the retort was filled with water as it ran warm from the spring the hole then being stopped i waited to see if there would any spirit come over into the receiver in all the cooling there appeared not the least evaporation or dew and if there was any it escaped like light through the pores of the glass a thing scarce credible  experiment iv the bristol water examined statically and compared with rain water received very pure on an eminence scarce differed from it in weight it was ten grains in a pint lighter than common spring water  experiment v having distilled five gallons of bristol water from a clean glass retort in a gentle heat of sand there remained   0 grains of a whitish salt powder and consequently   grains to a pint now a pint containing    cubic inches and a cubic inch weighing       0 grains nearly the water is to the residuum as    0 to   or  0   to    experiment vi two drams of the remains being dissolved in water and filtered the salt was found after evaporation to the earth as eleven to thirteen with another solution of the remains after filtration all the experiments were repeated that were made by different menstrua at the well the difference was that syrup of violets did not turn green nor the solution of mercury yellow but spirits of hartshorn became milky and oil of vitriol discovered no effervescence  experiment vii another part of the filtered solution was evaporated till a pellicle appeared and then was placed in a cold cellar that the salts might shoot after a few days the glass was covered with crystals which being examined by a microscope appeared octogonal interspersed with cubical ones  experiment viii having separated the octogonal crystals from the square i put them in a crucible on the fire at first they melted then dried and blisterd and became white after taking off the crucible there appeared a light spongy substance acrid to the taste  experiment ix the salts obtained from an evaporation of the filtered solution were put into a very small retort and then pouring oil of vitriol on them the receiver was immediately fixed and luted and both placed in a sandheat upon the gradual application of fire there ascended a white fume and a genuine spirit of salt came over into the receiver  experiment x to an equal quantity of the octogonal crystals and common tartar powdered and well mixed i applied a red hot iron but there ensued no fulmination or firing  experiment xi upon the insipid earth that remained in filter there was poured oil of vitriol and it raised a strong ebullition and with syrup violets turned green and showed every appearance of alkalescence upon application of a loadstone there were no ferruginous particles attracted  experiments producing phenomenon analogous to the bristol waters experiment i to one ounce of unslakd lime i poured cold water instantly there arose little bubbles from the lime and upon application the thermometer arose very fast the heat was brought as nigh as possible to that of the hotwell by the affusion of more water uncalcind limestone produces no warmth nitre alum and all fossile salts produce cold  experiment ii having filtered the lime water and prepared separate solutions of nitre roche alum and sea salt i first mixed the solution of nitre with the lime water and the transparency continued then was added the solution of sea salt and it continued unaltered as before to another glass of lime water was the solution of alum poured and immediately it became milky and precipitated white flakes no other mineral salt but alum can produce this phenomenon because it is the only one in which the acid prevails in a natural state nor any other but lime water  experiment iii with a solution of alum and common salt the same experiments were repeated that were made with the filtered solution of the hotwell remains they answered in every trial particularly with spirit of hartshorn and oil of tartar per deliquium this is characteristic to alum and can be produced by no other fossile salt et si e saxo aere and igne materies aqua solvitur affusu alcali fixi vel volatilis praecipitatur cum effervescentia  boer de alumine     experiment iv to the solution of alum and sea salt i poured the solution of quicksilver and it became milky but upon adding lime water it turned yellow as it does at the hotwell this then is another definitive proof of it is being aq calcis the water in which an unburnt limestone taken from the spot had been laid produced no alteration  experiment v the crystals of alum being examined by a microscope were found of the same dat crystallos albas vel rubellas octohedras figure with those of the bristol water to those crystals of alum i added sea salt and then putting them both in a small retort proceeded as in the ninth process on the hotwell water the effect was the same as in the former nothing came over but true spirit of salt the alum imparts no spirit to the salt but acts only by means of its predominating acid much like oil of vitriol had this been nitre instead of alum the production would have been an aqua regia  experiment vi i put a crucible into the fire in which was first put some alum it melted then dried and blisterd and upon being taken out resembled in every respect the salt of the hotwell water as it was after the eighth experiment had it been nitrum crucibulo puro inditum igne leni funditur totum sine crepitatione stat fusum in catino instar aquae purae boer de alumine and nitro nitre in the room of alum it would have flowed for ever in the crucible and upon cooling would have been a sal prunella  experiment vii after having mixed equal quantities of alum and tartar well dried and powdered i put to it a red hot iron rod there was no firing ensued nitre mixed with tartar would have fulminated and become a fixed alcaline salt  experiment viii to the earth left after the evaporation of lime water i added oil of vitriol it excited an effervescence and was not to be distinguished in any respect or experiment from the earth of the hotwell  from the foregoing experiments it pretty plainly appears that instead of nitre and limestone powder with an exceeding subtle spirit there is contained in the water alum and lime in the act of slaking and from thence only i shall deduce the cure of a diabetes and then show if it was nitre and a volatile spirit they would be absolutely mischievous and if limestone inefficacious but before i proceed to account for the cause of a diabetes and its cure i shall advance some conjectures about the cause of the heat as it arises from lime in the slaking  conjectures on the cause of the heat of the hotwell water before i begin i foresee the most material objection which is that naturally there is no limestone calcined and consequently the heat must arise from some other cause and as that acid which is every where floating through the earth resembles oil of vitriol it will like that oil meeting with water produce heat this may be granted but then the stream would taste acid and turn syrup of violets red and the alum must be in greater proportion since here is more alcaline earth than the acid can sat which is demonstrated by the alcaline qualities predominating at the well neither can the warmth arise from the solution of the salts for all fossile salts produce cold in dissolution much less can it come from the attrition of the water because that is experimentally known not to affect water if in the polishing two marble stones you rub one against the other dry they will conceive an intense heat but add the least water and it is impossible to produce it  these objections then being got over i beg leave to take back my own sentiments wherever i find them and endeavor to prove that it is probable at some distant time this lime rock was partially calcined by a subterraneous fire and has supplied the stream with warmth ever since  it must be considered at the same time that this subject will admit of no experimental proof and whether i succeed or not in the account of the cause of the heat it has already been definitively proved to be a lime water in which is dissolved alum and sea salt but as natural philosophy is in great part but analogy and as probability is equal to demonstration in all cases where a downright negative without any support is the opposition it may be allowed me here to instance suppose yourself in any country in which there was not the least trace of any human presence but some very antique and ruined architecture what would you conclude why that as those structures were as far as ever you had observed the effects of men this must be so likewise the parallel will hold for it is as certain that subterraneous fires have broke hills asunder and altered the course of rivers and that fire will burn limestone according to its degree and duration as that ruins are the proofs of human means especially when it is supported by all the collateral phenomenon left after such convulsions  now let us see whether we have appearance in the present case to support us whoever considers the situation of the hotwell that it lies between two precipices between which also the river runs will directly imagine that in the place of this river there was once a continued hill and that the chasm was caused by something preternatural and violent add the corresponding inequalities of the cliffs on each side and that the heat arises from lime in the act of slaking and that naturally there is no lime without fire the inclination of the river is most evidently through the valley of long ashton which leads to the severn sea and there is a faint tradition that it once ran that way till st vincent by cleaving the rocks formed the channel through which it now runs those traditions however fabulous they may appear have generally some real foundations though traced with difficulty fond amongst the numerous years that cover them and obscured by the imaginations of mankind too apt to run into the mavelous i should scarce have insisted on this had it not made this essay approach nearer to a system though it has at least as great a probability on it is side as that dover and calais were ever joined which i have seen very gravely asserted  had i contented myself without experiment that the hotwell water contained alum and not nitre quintus inter fossiles simples sales est acidus vagus volatilis liquidus forte

and dune esprit vitriolique on pent en retirer de lalun par levaporation  nouveau course de chymie    i should have had an indisputable authority on my side the sea salt which it has is left from the mixture of the tide water  of the diabetes every disease to which we are subjected must necessarily arise from some alteration in the solids or fluids a diabetes may arise from either but i believe the most frequent and most fatal arises from the want of digestion in the primae viae or from what may be safely enough called the secondary digestion in the minuter vessels my meaning will be better understood by what follows digestion i apprehend is nothing more than preparing the aliments for a separation to be made by the lacteals now when this separation is performed and the secreted chyle brought into the blood there remains another process of nature which is to assimilate the nutritious and throw off the detrimental particles by the kidneys and cuticular glands for unless the urinous salts etc are secreted it is no more nutriment in the blood than it was chyle before it was secreted from the faeces and this is what is meant by the secondary digestion  it follows now that a fault in either of these functions may be the source of many distempers and as it is universally allowed that the weakest part suffers in every assault there may be various diseases from one and the same cause according as constitutions are differently disposed to receive impressions particularly suppose any one has spent a life gay enough bottle and friend too much indulging upon any fault in either of the functions a disease will likely enough fall on the kidneys as those have been the glands mostly distended and weakened by frequent use  it is notorious also that the continued use of spirituous liquors indurates all aliments and stiffens the fibers of the stomach nay that spirit of wine injected into the arteries of a living animal immediately congeals the serum impedes circulation and death ensues this is in some degree the case whenever we indulge too freely in spirituous liquors and at last totally deprives us of appetite and digestion if digestion then is but illy performed in the primae viae instead of chyle the secretion will be crude and imperfect and consequently the fault will never be amended when it gets within the laws of circulation nor will the vis naturae of itself avail to separate those salts by the kidneys thence it will result that through want of this separation there be will no nutriment assimilated and an accumulation of fluids supervening the vessels and glands are distended and the serum with all the nutritious juice passes off by the kidneys  it has been i know not how always thought that a diabetes diuturna est hujus morbi creatio and longo tempore

too profuse discharge of urine but there cannot be a greater mistake the disorder is not from too great a discharge of urine but quite contrary because there is no urine at all discharged but serum or chyle in it is room for it is scarce possible to secret too much urine or any natural secretion but the danger ever is when something that is not the true secretion is carried off this holds equally true in hectic fevers and profuse sweats and i shall endeavor to show that hectic sweats are through the cuticular glands what a diabetes is by the kidneys  that what has already been said is the true cause of a diabetes will evidently appear from the history of that malady as laid down by our best physicians and every symptom is easily deduced from that original whoever will take the least trouble to review the above quotations will easily deduce every symptom from the cause which has been assigned before and must observe that the cure wholly depends upon bringing back the true secretion of urine which is no more than separating the animal salts from the fluids and restoring the strength and elasticity of the overdistended fibers  there remains now that we examine if lime in the act of slaking will separate those urinous salts and whether alum will restore the tone of the weakened fibers what the effects of lime will be cannot be better seen than by the xcviith experiment of the learned boerhaave with his observations of it is use  hence are plainly discovered the effects of lime on animal fluids and that it exactly executes what a medicine must do to cure a diabetes which is to extricate and prepare an easy secretion for the more fixed muriatic salts sticking in the blood let us now suppose that this separation of the salts is brought about what must be added to finish the cure it must be some medicine which may bring the fibers into a contractile state and recover that elasticy they had lost from too great distention that alum will answer in all this part is notorious from it is astringency it will bring the stomach into stronger contractions and improve digestion in the glands it will lessen the diameters of the secreting vessels in the arteries it will shorten their fibers improve their spring and accelerate the circulation and as according to the laws of hydrostatics fluids circulating in tubes have their lightest parts driven to the sides whilst the more heavy are propelld the emulgent arteries lying at right angles must receive the lightest parts of the fluid and bring it to the kidneys which from the aluminous particles are contracted to let nothing through but these salts dissolved in the aqueous menstrum which the lime had before disengaged  we can now assign a good reason for the drinking those waters warm at the spring without being obliged to a ficton for their virtues since it is demonstrated that all the salutary effects arise from the slaking lime and that after that action ceases by cooling it produces no alteration on animal solids and fluids but as a mere alcaline earth the aluminous part indeed though the same at a distance as when on the spot avails nothing without the previous separation of the salts which can be effected by the slaking lime only  let us now examine what would have been the consequences in the foregoing indisposition if the contents of the hotwell had been a subtle spirit nitre and limestone powder if that had been a spirit it must be a mineral one if a mineral spirit an acid one now all mineral acids coagulate the blood and hinder secretions arising from alcalescence spiritus vitrioli sulphurisque paritur cogit in massam constrictam plerumque albescentem  boer cxxvii exp sang phae a acidis etc    nitre absolutely hinders a separation of the animal salts from an alcalescent cause and is beneficial only when the juices are in the quite opposite state to that of a diabetes as in a pleurisy and all inflammatory fevers limestone like all other stone is absolutely no more than a terra damnata boer cxxviii exp de nitro   it may be objected here that instead of proceeding on boerhaves experiment on urine i should have tried whether it would have answered with the bristol waters and if it would not my conclusions are all false and supposititious only suppose this objection true it has a plausible appearance yet upon examination does not stand the test  it is certain we can conceive no alteration by our senses in any thing unless it be strong enough to create a distinct perception the atmosphere differs in pressure from the heaviest to the lightest many degrees yet i believe no one will say that he feels any diminution or increase of weight in the alteration the reason is because this alteration is not a sufficient avocation to the general attention we must allow the general atmosphere now with respect to the bristol water were it ten times as strongly impregnated with lime it would create a very visible effect in the foregoing experiment but though it should not as it is yet it must not be concluded from thence that it is quite inefficacious we must say notwithstanding that it has every proportional appearance with the other another instance will better explain my meaning you have a bundle of straw under your arm i take one secretly from you yet by the strictest scrutiny of your eye and hand you neither perceive the weight nor number much lessened but it is lessened in both respects or the weight is compounded from an aggregate of no weights and the number of no numbers which is impossible well then should i repeat the theft it will at last appear very plain in both senses and you were hindered from observing it in the first by what was said of the atmosphere the difference was not great enough to create a distinct perception and call off your attention from the greater weight of the bundle the same may be said of the bristol waters that though it should create no perceivable alteration at any one time taken singly yet often repeated it would have the same effects with the other but in a slower way  from the slight impregnation of lime we may easily deduce it is most salutary effects as it is alterations are silently and mildly carried on without producing those violent symptoms which would follow from a larger quantity as fevers deliriums etc the very same is true as to the quantity of the alum  of a hectic fever it has already been mentioned that the sweats of a hectic were through the miliary glands what a diabetes is through the kidneys and if we attend diligently we shall find that like the diabetes the danger in a hectic fever does not arise from too profuse a secretion of sweat but from the nutritious particles passing off this way for there is no instance of a too large discharge by sweat provided it is really that secretion now what has been said with respect to a diabetes that there can be no nutriment assimilated unless the excrementitious fluids are secernd holds true here for this reason all attempts are vain which endeavor to check those hectic sweats without altering the juices and generating the natural discharge is it not always observed as often as you endeavor to stop those sweats if you succeed in that particular a diarrhaea constantly succeeds equally fatal as the former symptom it has been observed by the ingenious dr allen that a diabetes and ptyalismus have alternately succeeded the suppression of each other and that the cure of one was the cure of the other it is the same in a hectic if you cure the sweats you suppress the diarrhaea but if you only derive it from the glands of the skin to those of the intestines you have not proceeded one step toward the patients recovery nor can he possibly recover till he produce the natural discharges that the nutritious particles may be laid aside for the support of life and this seems likely to be effected by the slaking lime as in the diabetes for the salts of the animal fluids are the same in every secretion and the state of the fluids the same in each disorder only the secretion passes through different emunctories according as the constitution is disposed from a particular texture of the glands i need not apply the use of the alum because every one will see it is use as plainly here as in the diabetes there can no objection arise from the lime as if it should produce a putrefact state of the blood because then the salts in the boer process xcvii experiment on the urine would have been volatile alkalies whereas it is neither acid nor alcali but quite akin to the human  what advantage may not arise from the use of this bristol water if the patient would apply to them before he is gone beyond the reach of medicine nay even in the last state of a pulmonary consumption i cannot see but it must be serviceable for it is certain human nature cannot be sustained without nutrition and no nutrition can be formed without the previous separation of the excrementitious salts nor can the ulcers of the lungs incarne unless the true balsam be brought to them which i apprehend to be no more than true nutriment  there may be many other diseases in which it may be beneficial as in the elephantiasis from a cold cause chlorosis and all cachexies where the fluids are too viscous and the fibers too much relaxed  of the effects of the waters in nephritic disorders it has of late been an objection to the bristol waters that upon the use of them they have increased the gravel in those subjects liable to that complaint and for that reason not to be drank safely by such persons a stricter attention and a fair state of the case will set the matter in a quite opposite light  it has been found by some subject to nephritic complaints that at their first coming to the well and drinking the waters the paroxysms have oftener succeeded each other and with more violence than before and thence they have concluded that the waters increase these disorders but how unjust is this when we consider that the pain is not the disease but a consequence of it is passing off by means of medicine or the efforts of nature throwing off the already generated concretions suppose any quantity of gravel lodged in the basin of the kidneys is it not manifest that pains must succeed upon it is removal from thence through the ureters into the bladder and is it not equally certain that whatever promotes the dislodging this gravel from the kidneys is a salutary medicine and the more efficacious it is the oftener the paroxysms will follow each other till the whole is brought away this is directly the case in the hot well water and seen in this true light removes the objection  now let us see whether our theory will not vindicate this fact every one allows that nephitic diseases arise from some fault in the urinary secretion it has been already experimentally observed that slaking lime produces that true secretion hence it follows that no alterative can be more successfully pursued than this medicinal water since it washes off the already concreted gravel and hinders it from being generated anew by producing the genuine discharge  it does not belong to me to say what medicine or diet is best adapted in each case with these waters whatever physician shall have the care of those that drink this medicinal water will inform them in these and many other things altogether beyond any thing that can be said by me  finis
