letters of mr pope and several eminent persons from the year      etc  vol ii  london printed and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster  letters of sir william trumbull mr steel mr addison and mr pope from      to      letters of sir william trumbull mr steel mr addison etc secretary of state to king william the third sir william trumbull to mr pope i have this moment received the favor of yours of the  th instant and will make you a true excuse though perhaps no very good one that i deferred the troubling you with a letter when i sent back your papers in hopes of seeing you at binfield before this time if i had met with any fault in your performance i should freely now as i have done too presumptuously in conversation with you tell you my opinion which i have frequently ventured to give you rather in compliance with your desires than that i could think it reasonable for i am not yet satisfied upon what grounds i can pretend to judge of poetry who never have been practiced in the art there may possible be some happy geniuss who may judge of some of the natural beauties of a poem as a man may of the proportions of a building without having read vitruvius or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture but this though it may sometimes be in the right must be subject to many mistakes and is certainly but a superficial knowledge without entering into the art the methods and the particular excellencies of the whole composure in all the parts of it  besides my want of skill i have another reason why i ought to suspect my self by reason of the great affection i have for you which might give too much biass to be kind to every thing that comes from you but after all i must say and i do it with an oldfashioned sincerity that i entirely approve of your translation of those pieces of homer both as to the versification and the true sense that shines through the whole nay i am confirmed in my former application to you and give me leave to renew it upon this occasion that you would proceed in translating that incomparable poet to make him speak good english to dress his admirable characters in your proper significant and expressive conceptions and to make his works as useful and instructive to this degenerate age as he was to our friend horace when he read him at proeneste qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non etc i break off with that quid non with which i confess i am charmed  upon the whole matter i entreat you to send this presently to be added to the miscellanies and i hope it will come time enough for that purpose  i have nothing to say of my nephew bs observations for he sent them to me so late that i had not time to consider them i dare say he endeavored very faithfully though he told me very hastily to execute your commands  all i can add is that if your excess of modesty should hinder you from publishing this essay i shall only be sorry that i have no more credit with you to persuade you to oblige the public and very particularly dear sir  your most faithful humble servant w trumbull apr     0  mr pope to the hon j c esquire june         i send you denniss remarks on the on criticism essay which equally abound in just criticisms and fine railleries the few observations in my hand in the margins are what a mornings leisure permitted me to make purely for your perusal for i am of opinion that such a critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book is but one way to be properly answered and that way i would not take after what he informs me in his preface that he is at this time persecuted by fortune this i knew not before if i had his name had been spared in the essay for that only reason i cannot conceive what ground he has for so excessive a resentment nor imagine how those but appius reddens at each word you speak and stares tremendous with a threatening eye like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry  three lines can be called a reflection on his person which only describe him subject a little to anger on some occasions i have heard of combatants so very furious as to fall down themselves with that very blow which they designed to lay heavy on their antagonists but if mr denniss rage proceeds only from a zeal to discourage young and unexperienced writers from scribbling he should frighten us with his verse not prose for i have often known that when all the precepts in the world would not reclaim a sinner some very sad example has done the business this thought we find afterward put into verse in the dunciad book    yet to give this man his due he has objected to one or two lines with reason and i will alter em in case of another edition i will make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury and so serve instead of a friend what he observes at the bottom of page  0th of his reflections was objected to by your self and had been mended but for the haste of the press it is right hibernian and i confess it what the english call a bull in the expression though the sense be manifest enough mr denniss bulls are seldom in the expression they are always in the sense  i shall certainly never make the least reply to him not only because you advise me but because i have ever been of opinion that if a book cannot answer for itself to the public it is to no sort of purpose for its author to do it if i am wrong in any sentiment of that essay i protest sincerely i dont desire all the world should be deceived which would be of very ill consequence merely that i my self may be thought right which is of very little consequence i would be the first to recant for the benefit of others and the glory of my self for as i take it when a man owns himself to have been in an error he does but tell you in other words that he is wiser than he was but i have had an advantage by the publishing that book of dss which otherwise i should never have known it has been the occasion of making me friends and open abetters of several gentlemen of known sense and wit and of proving to me what i have till now doubted that my writings are taken some notice of by the world in general or i should never be attacked thus in particular i have read that twas a custom among the romans while a general rode in triumph to have common soldiers in the streets that railed at him and reproached him to put him in mind that though his services were in the main approved and rewarded yet he had faults enough to keep him humble  you will see by this that whoever sets up for wit in these days ought to have the constancy of a primitive christian and be prepared to suffer martyrdom in the cause of it but sure this is the first time that a wit was attacked for his religion as you will find i am most zealously in this treatise and you know sir what alarms i have had from the sea the ensuing letters opposite side on this account have i not reason to cry out with the poor fellow in virgil quid jam misero mihi denique restat cui neque apud danaos usquam locus and super ipsi dardanidae infensi poenas cum sanguine poscunt   it is however my happiness that you sir are impartial jove was alike to latian and to phrygian for you well know that wits of no religion   the manner  which mr d takes to pieces several particular lines detached from their natural places may show how easy it is to a caviller to give a new sense or a new nonsense to any thing and indeed his constructions are not more wrested from the genuine meaning than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts as they called em  our friend the abbe is not of that sort who with the utmost candor and freedom has modestly told me what others thought and shown himself one as he very well expresses it rather of a number than a party the only difference between us in relation to the monks is that he thinks most sorts of learning flourished among em and i am of opinion that only some sort of learning was barely kept alive by em he believes that in the most natural and obvious sense that line  a second deluge learning overrun will be understood of learning in general and i fancy twill be understood only as it is meant of polite learning criticism poetry etc which is the only learning concerned in the subject of the essay it is true that the monks did preserve what learning there was about nicholas the fifths time but those who succeeded fell into the depth of barbarism or at least stood at a stay while others rose from thence insomuch that even erasmus and reuchlin could hardly laugh them out of it i am highly obliged to the abbes zeal in my commendation and goodness in not concealing what he thinks my error and his testifying some esteem for the book just at a time when his brethren raised a clamor against it is an instance of great generosity and candor which i shall ever acknowledge  yours etc  to the same june         in your last you informed me of the mistaken zeal of some people who seem to make no less their business to persuade men they are erroneous than doctors do that they are sick only that they may magnify their own cure and triumph over an imaginary distemper the simile objected to in my essay thus wit like faith by each man is applied to one small sect and all are damned beside plainly concludes at this second line where stands a full stop and what follows meanly they seek etc speaks only of wit which is meant by that blessing and that sun for how can the sun of faith be said to sublime the southern wits and to ripen the geniuss of the northern climates i fear these gentlemen understand grammar as little as they do criticisim and perhaps out of good nature to the monks are willing to take from em the censure of ignorance and to have it to themselves the word they refers as i am sure i meant and as i thought every one must have known to those critics there spoken of who are partial to some particular set of writers to the prejudice of all others and the very simile it self if twice read may convince them that the censure here of damning lies not on our church at all unless they call our church one small sect and the cautious words  by each man manifestly show it a general reflection on all such whoever they are who entertain those narrow rnd limited notions of the mercy of the almighty which the reformed ministers and presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living  yet after all i promise you sir if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of sound faith though weak understanding i will though it were from no other principal than that of common good nature comply with it and if you please but to particularize the spot where their objection lies for it is in a very narrow compass that stumbling block though it be but a little pebble shall be removed out of their way if the heat of these good disputants who i am afraid being bred up to wrangle in the schools cannot get rid of the humor all their lives should proceed so far as to personal reflections upon me i assure you notwithstanding i will do or say nothing however provoked for some people can no more provoke than oblige that is unbecoming the character of a true catholic i will set before me the example of that great man and great saint erasmus who in the midst of calumny proceeded with all the calmness of innocence and the unrevenging spirit of primitive christianity however i would advise them to suffer the mention of him to pass unregarded lest i should be forced to do that for his reputation which i would never do for my own i mean to vindicate so great a light of our church from the malice of past times and the ignorance of the present in a language which the trifle about criticism is written i wish these gentlemen would be contented with finding fault with me only who will submit to em right or wrong as far as i only am concerned i have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to disturb it for things of so little consequence as my credit and my sense a little humility can do a poet no hurt and a little charity would do a priest none for as st austin finely says ubi charitas ibi humilitas ubi humilitas ibi pax  yours etc  to the same july         the concern which you more than seem to be affected with for my reputation by the several accounts you have so obligingly given of what reports and censures the holy vandals have thought fit to pass upon me makes me desirous of telling so good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter and of setting before you in a clear light the true state of it  i have ever believed the best piece of service one could do to our religion was openly to express our detestation and scorn of all those mean artifices and pioe frauds which it stands so little in need of and which have laid it under so great a scandal amongst its enemies  nothing has been so much a scarecrow to them as that too peremptory and seeminglyuncharitable assertion of an utter impossibility of salvation to all but ourselves invincible ignorance excepted which indeed some people define under so great limitations and with such exclusions that it seems as if that word were rather invented as a salvo or expedient not to be thought too bold with the thunderbolts of god which are hurled about so freely on almost all mankind by the hands of ecclesiastics than as a real exception to almostuniversal damnation for besides the small number of the truly faithful in our church we must again subdivide the jansenist is damned by the jesuit the jesuit by the jansenist the scotist by the thomist and so forth  there may be errors i grant but i cannot thinkem of such consequenceas to destroy utterly the charity of mankind the very greatest bond in which we are engaged by god to one another therefore i own to you i was glad of any opportunity to express my dislike of so shocking a sentiment as those of the religion i profess are commonly charged with and i hoped a slight insinuation introduced so easily by a casual similitude only could never have given offense but on the contrary must needs have done good in a nation and time wherein we are the smaller party and consequently most misrepresented and most in need of vindication  for the same reason i took occasion to mention the superstition of some ages after the subversion of the roman empire which is too manifest a truth to be denied and does in no sort reflect upon the present professors of our faith who are free from it our silence in these points may with some reason make our adversaries think we allow and persist in those biggotries which yet in reality all good and sensible men despise though they are persuaded not to speak against em i cannot tell why since now it is no way the interest even of the worst of our priesthood as it might have been then to have them smothered in silence for as the opposite sects are now prevailing it is too late to hinder our church from being slandered it is our business now to show it is slandered unjustly and to vindicate our selves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with this cannot so well be brought about with serious faces we must laugh with them at what deserves it and then we need not doubt of being cleared even in their opinions  as to particulars you cannot but have observed that at first the whole objection against the simile of wit and faith lay to the word they when that was beyond contradiction removed the very grammar serving to confute em then the objection lies against the simile itself or if that simile will not be objected to sense and common reason being indeed a little stubborn and not apt to give way to every body next the mention of superstition must become a crime as if religion and she were sisters or that scandal upon the family of christ to say a word against the devils bastard afterward more mischief is discovered in a place that seemed innocent at first the two lines about schismatics at the bottom of page    an ordinary man would imagine the author plainly declared against those schismatics for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the understanding of some few of its believers but these believers are called dull and because that i say those schismatics think some believers dull therefore these charitable interpreters of my meaning will have it that i think all believers dull i was telling lately mr  these objections who assured me i had said nothing which a catholic need to disown and i have cause to know that gentlemans fault if he has any is not want of zeal he put a notion into my head which i confess i cannot but perfectly acquiesce in that when a set of people are piqud at any truth which they think to their own disadvantage their method of revenge on the truthspeaker is to attack his reputation a byway and not openly to object to the place they are really galled by what these therefore in his opinion are in earnest angry at is that erasmus whom their tribe oppressed and persecuted should be vindicated after an age of obloquy by one of their own people willing to utter an honest truth in behalf of the dead whom no man sure will flatter and to whom few will do justice others you know were as angry that i mentioned mr walsh with honor who as he never refused to any one of merit of any party the praise due to him so honestly deserved it from all others though of ever so different interests or sentiments may i be ever guilty of this sort of liberty and latitude of principle which gives us the hardiness of speaking well of those whom envy oppresses even after death as i would always speak well of my living friends when they are absent nay because they are absent so would i much more of the dead in that eternal absence and the rather because i expect no thanks forit  thus sir you see i do in my conscience persist in what i have written yet in my friendship i will recant and alter whatever you please in case of a second edition which i think the book will not so soon arrive at for tonsons printer told me he drew off a thousand copies in this first impression and i fancy a treatise of this nature which not one gentleman in threescore even of a liberal education can understand can hardly exceed the vent of that number you shall find me a true trojan in my faith and friendship in both which i will persevere to the end  your etc  to general upon his having translated into french verse the essay on criticism if i could as well express or if you will allow me to say it translate the sentiments of my heart as you have done those of my head in your excellent version of my essay i should not only appear the best writer in the world but what i much more desire to be thought the most your servant of any man living it is an advantage very rarely known to receive at once a great honor and a great improvement this sir you have afforded me having at the same time made others take my sense and taught me to understand my own if i may call that my own which is indeed more properly yours your verses are no more a translation of mine than virgils are of homer but are like his the justest imitation and the noblest commentary  in putting me into a french dress you have not only adorned my outside but mended my shape and if i am now a good figure i must consider you have naturalized me into a country which is famous for making every man a fine gentleman it is by your means that contrary to most young travelers i am come back much better than i went out  i cannot but wish we had a bill of commerce for translation established the next parliament we could not fail of being gainers by that nor of making our selves amends for all we have lost by the war nay though we should insist upon the demolishing of boileaus works the french as long as they have writers of your form might have as good an equivalent  upon the whole i am really as proud as our ministers can be of the terms i have gained from abroad and i design like them to publish speedily to the world the benefits accruing from them for i cannot resist the temptation of printing your admirable translation here this was never done for the two printed french versions are neither of this hand the one was the work of monsieur roboton private secretary to king george the first printed in  o at amsterdam and at london      the other by the abbe resnel in  o with a large preface and notes at paris    0  to which if you will be so obliging to give me leave to prefix your name it will be the only addition you can make to the hounour already done me i am  your etc  the hon j c to mr pope may         i am very glad for the sake of the widow and for the credit of the deceased that a translation of some part of chaucers canterbury tales the prologues etc printed in a miscellany with some works of mr pope in   vol   ves by b lintot bettertons remains are fallen into such hands as may render em reputable to the one and beneficial to the other besides the public acquaintance i long had with that poor man i also had a slender knowledge of his parts and capacity by private conversation and ever thought it pity he was necessitated by the straitness of his fortune to act and especially to his latest hours an imaginary and fictitious part who was capable of exhibiting a real one with credit to himself and advantage to his neighbor  i hope your health permitted you to execute your design of giving us an imitation of pollio i am satisfied twill be doubly divine and i shall long to see it i ever thought churchmusick the most ravishing of all harmonious compositions and must also believe sacred subjects well handled the most inspiring of all poetry  but where hangs the lock now though i know that rather than draw any just reflection upon your self of the least shadow of ill nature you would freely have suppressed one of the best of poems i hear no more of it  will it come out in lintots miscellany or not i wrote to lord petre upon the subject of the lock some time since but have as yet had no answer nor indeed do i know when he will be in london i have since i saw you corresponded with mrs w i hope she is now with her aunt and that her journey thither was something facilitated by my writing to that lady as pressingly as possible not to let any thing whatsoever obstruct it i sent her obliging answer to the party it most concerned and when i hear mrs w is certainly there i will write again to my lady to urge as much as possible the effecting the only thing that in my opinion can make her niece easy i have run out my extent of paper and am  your etc  mr popes answer may         it is not only the disposition i always have of conversing with you that makes me so speedily answer your obliging letter but the apprehension left your charitable intent of writing to my lady a on mrs ws affair should be frustrated by the short stay she makes there she went thither on the   th with that mixture of expectation and anxiety with which people usually go into unknown or halfdiscoverd countries utterly ignorant of the dispositions of the inhabitants and the treatment they are to meet with the unfortunate of all people are the most unfit to be left alone yet we see the world generally takes care they shall be so whereas if we took a considerate prospect of humane nature the business and study of the happy and easy should be to divert and humor as well as comfort and pity the distressed i cannot therefore excuse some near allies of mine for their conduct of late toward this lady which has given me a great deal of anger as well as sorrow all i shall say to you of em at present is that they have not been my relations these two months the consent of opinions in our minds is certainly a nearer tie than can be contracted by all the blood in our bodies and i am proud of finding i have something congenial with you will you permit me to confess to you that all the favors and kind offices you have shown toward me have not so strongly cemented me yours as the discovery of that generous and manly compassion you manifested in the case of this unhappy lady i am afraid to insinuate to you how much i esteem you flatterers have taken up the style which was once peculiar to friends and an honest man has now no way left to express himself besides the common one of knaves so that true friends nowadays differ in their address from flatterers much as right mastiffs do from spaniels and show themselves by a dumb surly sort of fidelity rather than by their complaisant and open kindness  will you never leave commending my poetry in fair truth sir i like it but too well my self already  expose me no more i beg you to the great danger of vanity the rock of all men but most of young men and be kindly content for the future when you would please me thoroughly to say only you like what i write  your etc  mr steel to mr pope june        i am at a solitude an house between hampstead and london wherein sir charles sedley died this circumstance set me a thinking and ruminating upon the employments in which men of wit exercise themselves it was said of sir charles who breathed his last in this room sedley has that prevailing gentle art which can with a resistless charm impart the loosest wishes to the chastest heart raise such a conflict kindle such a fire between declining virtue and desire till the poor vanquished maid dissolves away in dreams all night in sighs and tears all day this was an happy talent to a man of the town but i dare say without presuming to make uncharitable conjectures on the authors present condition he would rather have had it said of him that he had prayed  oh thou my voice inspire who touched isaiahs hallowed lips with fire   i have turned to every verse and chapter and think you have preserved the sublime heavenly spirit throughout the whole especially at  hark a glad voice  and  the lamb with wolves shall graze  there is but one line which i think below the original he wipes the tears for ever from our eyes  you have expressed it with a good and pious but not with so exalted and poetical a spirit as the prophet the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces if you agree with me in this alter it by way of paraphrase or otherwise that when it comes into a volume it may be amended your poem is already better than the pollio i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel june         you have obliged me with a very kind letter by which i find you shift the scene of your life from the town to the country and enjoy that mixed state which wise men both delight in and are qualified for methinks the moralists and philosophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending entirely either solitude or public life in the former men for the most part grow useless by too much rest and in the latter are destroyed by too much precipitation as waters lying still putrify and are good for nothing and running violently on do but the more mischief in their passage to others and are swallowed up and lost the sooner themselves those indeed who can be useful to all states should be like gentle streams that not only glide through lonely valleys and forests amidst the flocks and the shepherds but visit populous towns in their course and are at once of ornament and service to them but there are another sort of people who seem designed for solitude such i mean as have more to hide than to show as for my own part i am one of those of whom seneca says tam umbratiles sunt ut putent in turbido esse quicquid in luce est some men like some pictures are fitter for a corner than a full light and i believe such as have a natural bent to solitude to carry on the former similitude are like waters which may be forced into fountains and exalted into a great height and make a noble figure and a louder noise but after all they would run more smoothly quietly and plentifully in their own natural course upon the ground the consideration of this would the foregoing similitudes our author had put into verse some years before and inserted into mr wycherleys poem an mixed life we find him apparently in the versification of them as they are since printed in wycherleys posthumous works  o page   d and   th make me very well contented with the possession only of that quiet which cowley calls the companion of obscurity but whoever has the muses too for his companions can never be idle enough to be uneasy thus sir you see i would flatter my self into a good opinion of my own way of living plutarch just now told me that it is in human life as in a game at tables where a man may wish for the highest cast but if his chance be otherwise he is even to play it as well as he can and to make the best of it i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel july         you formerly observed to me that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a mans life than the disparity we often find in him sick and well thus one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a miserable example of the weakness of his mind and of his body in their turns i have had frequent opportunities of late to consider my self in these different views and i hope have received some advantage by it if what mr waller says be ture that the souls dark cottage battered and decayed lets in new light through chincks that time has made   then surely sickness contributing no less than old age to the shaking down this scaffolding of the body may discover the inward structure more plainly sickness is a sort of early old age it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state and inspires us with the thoughts of a future better than a thousand volumes of philosiphers and divines it gives so warning a concussion to those props of our vanity our strength and youth that we think of fortifying our our selves within when there is so little dependence upon our outworks youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age it is like a stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret my youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me it has afforded several prospects of my danger and given me an advantage not very common to young men that the attractions of the world have not dazzle me very much and i begin where most people end with a full conviction of the emptiness of all sorts of ambition and the unsatisfactory nature of all human pleasure when a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time i am even as unconcerned as was that honest hiberniam who being in bed in the great storm some years ago and told the house would tumble over his head made answer what care i for the house i am only a lodger i fancy it is the best time todie when one is in the best humor and so excessively weak as i now am i may say with conscience that i am not at all uneasy at the thought that many men whom i never had any esteem for are likely to enjoy this world after me when i reflect what an inconsiderable little attom every single man is with respect to the whole creation methinks it is a shame to be concerned at the removal of such a trivial animal as i am the morning after my exit the sun will rise as bright as ever the flowers smell as sweet the plants spring as green the world will proceed in its old course people will laugh as heartily and marry as fast as they were used to do the memory of man as it is elegantly expressed in the wisdom of solomon passes away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day there are reasons enough in the fourth chapter of the same book to make any young man contented with the prospect of death for honorable age is not that which stands in length of time or is measured by number of years but wisdom is the gray hair to men and an unspotted life is old age he was taken away speedily lest wickedness should alter his understanding or deceit beguile his soul etc i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel nov        i was the other day in company with five of six men of some learning where chancing to mention the famous verses which the emperor adrian spoke on his deathbed they were all agreed that t was a piece of gaiety unworthy of that prince in those circumstances i could not but differ from this opinion methinks it was by no means a gay but a very serious soliloquy to his soul at the point of his departure in which sense i naturally took the verses at my first reading them when i was very young and before i knew what interpretation the world generally put upon them animula vagula blandula hospes comesque corporis quae nunc abibis in loca pallidula rigida nudula nec ut soles dabis joca alas my soul thou pleasing companion of this body thou fleeting thing that art now deserting it whither art thou flying to what unknown scene all trembling fearful and pensive non what is become of thy former wit and humor thou shall jest and be gay no more  i confess i cannot apprehend where lies the trifling in all this it is the most natural and abvious reflection imaginable to a dying man and if we consider the emperor was a heathen that doubt concerning the future fate of his soul will seem so far from being the effect of want of thought that twas scarce reasonable he should think otherwise not to mention that here is a plain confession included of his belief in its immortality the diminutive epithets of vagula glandula and the rest appear not to me as expressions of levity but rather of endearment and concern such as we find in catullus and the authors of hendecasyllabi after him where they are used to express the utmost love and tenderness for their mistresses  if you think me right in my notion of the last words of adrian be pleased to insert it in the spectator if not to suppress it i am  your etc adriani morientis ad animam translated ah fleeting spirit wandering fire that long have warmed my tender breast must thou no more this frame inspire no more a pleasing cheerful guest whither ah whither art thou flying to what dark undiscovered shore thou seem all trembling shivering dying and wit and humor are no more   mr steel to mr pope nov         i have read over your temple of fame twice and cannot find any thing amiss of weight enough to call a fault but see in it a thousand beauties mr addison shall see it to marrow after his perusal of it i will let you know his thoughts i desire you would let me know whether you are at leisure or not i have a design which i shall open a month or two hence with the assistance of the few like your self if your thoughts are unengaged i shall explain my self further i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel nov         you oblige me by the indulgence you have shown to the poem i sent you but will oblige me much more by the kind severity i hope for from you no errors are so trivial but they deserve to be mended but since you say you see nothing that may be called a fault can you but think it so that i have confined the attendance of this is not now to be found in the temple of fame of which poem he speaks here guardian spirits to heavens favorites only i could point you to several but it is my business to be informed of those faults i do not know and as for those i do not to talk of em but to correct em you speak of that poem in a style i neither merit nor expect but i assure you if you freely mark or dash out i shall look upon your blots to be its greatest beauties i mean if mr addison and your self should like it in the whole otherwise the trouble of correction is what i would not take for i was really so diffident of it as to let it lie by me these hence it appears this poem was writ before the author was    years old two years just as you now see it i am afraid of nothing so much as to impose any thing on the world which is unworthy of its acceptance  as to the last period of your letter i shall be very ready and glad to contribute to any design that tends to the advantage of mankind which i am sure all yours do i wish i had but as much capacity as leisure for i am perfectly idle a sign i have not much capacity  if you will entertain the best opinion of me be pleased to think me your friend assure mr addison of my most faithful service of every ones esteem he must be assured already i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel nov         i am sorry you published that nation about adrians verses as mine had i imagined you would use my name i should have expressed my sentiments with more modesty and diffidence i only sent it to have your opinion and not to publish my own which i distrusted but i think the supposition you draw from the notion of adrians being addicted to magic is a little uncharitable  that he might fear no sort of deity goog or bad since in the third verse he plainly testifies his apprehension of a future state by being sollicitous whither his soul was going as to what you mention of his using gay and ludicrous expressions i have owned my opinion to be that the expressions are not so but that diminutives are as often in the latin tongue used as marks of tenderness and concern  anima is no more than my soul animula has the force of my dear soul to say virgo bella is not half so endearing as virguncula bellula and had augustus only called horace lepidum hominem it had amounted to no more than that he thought him a pleasant fellow twas the homunciolum that expressed the love and tenderness that great emperor had for him and perhaps i should my self be much better pleased if i were told you called me your little friend than if you complimented me with the title of a great genius or an eminent hand as jacob does all his authors i am  your etc  mr pope to december        you have at length complied with the request i have often made you for you have shown me i must confess several of my faults in the sight of those letters upon a review of them i find many things that would give me shame if i were not more desirous to be thought honest than prudent so many things freely thrown out such lengths of unreservd friendship thoughts just warm from the brain without any polishing or dress the very dishabille of the understanding you have proved your self more tender of anothers embroyos than the fondest mothers are of their own for you have preserved every thing that i miscarried of since i know this i shall in one respect be more afraid of writing to you than ever at this careless rate because i see my evil works may again rise in judgment against me yet in another respect i shall be less afraid since this has given me such a proof of the extreme indulgence you afford to my slightest thoughts the revisal of these letters has been a kind of examination of conscience to me so fairly and faithfully have i set down in em from time to time the true and undistinguished state of my mind but i find that these which were intended as sketches of my friendship give as imperfect images of it as the little landscapes we commonly see in black and white do of a beautiful country they can represent but a very small part of it and that deprived of the life and luster of nature i perceive that the more i endeavored to render manifest the real affection and value i ever had for you i did but injure it by representing less and less of it as glasses which are designed to make an object very clear generally contract it yet as when people have a full idea of a thing first upon their own knowledge the least traces of it serve to refresh the remembrance and are not displeasing on that score so i hope the foreknowledge you had of my esteem for you is the reason that you do not dislike my letters  they will not be of any great service i find in the design i mentioned to you i believe i had better steal from a richer man and plunder your letters which i have kept as carefully as i would letters patents since they entitle me to what i more value than titles of honor you have some cause to apprehend this usage from me if what some say be true that i am a great borrower however i have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challenged me for it and those who say it are such whose writings no man ever borrowed from so have the least reason to complain their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own  another has been pleased to declare that my verses are corrected by other men i verily believe theirs were never corrected by any man but indeed if mine have not twas not my fault i have endeavored my utmost that they should but these things only whispered and i will not encroach upon bays province and pen whispers so hasten to conclude  your etc  sir william trumbull to mr pope march        i think a hasty scribble shows more what flows from the heart than a letter after balzacs manner in studied phrases therefore i will tell you as fast as i can that i have received your favor of the   th past with your kind present of the rape of the lock you have given me the truest satisfaction imaginable not only in making good the just opinion i have ever had of your reach of thought and my idea of your comprehensive genius but likewise in that pleasure i take as an english man to see the french even boileau himself in his lutrin outdone in your poem for you descend leviore plectro to all the nicer touches that your own observation and wit furnish on such a subject as requires the finest strokes and the liveliest imagination but i must say no more though i could a great deal on what pleases me so much and henceforth i hope you will never condemn me of partiality since i only swim with the stream and approve what all men of good taste notwithstanding the jarring of parties must and do universally applaud i now come to what is of vast moment i mean the preservation of your health and beg of you earnestly to get out of all taverncompany and fly away tanquam ex incendio what a misery it is for you to be destroyed by the foolish kindness it is all one whether real or pretended of those who are able to bear the poison of bad wine and to engage you in so unequal a combat as to homer by all i can learn your business is done therefore come away and take a little time to breathe in the country i beg now for my own sake but much more for yours methinks mr  has said to you more than once heu fuge nate dea teque his ait eripe flammis i am  your etc  mr pope to sir william trumbull march         though any thing you write is sure to be a pleasure to me yet i must own your last letter made me uneasy you really use a style of compliment which i expect as little as i deserve it i know it is a common opinion that a young scribler is as ill pleased to hear truth as a young lady from the moment one sets up for an author one must be treated as ceremoniously that is as unfaithfully as a kings favorite or as a king this proceeding joined to that natural vanity which first makes a man an author is certainly enough to render him a coxcomb for life but i must grant it is but a just judgment upon poets that they whose chief pretense is wit should be treated just as they themselves treat fools that is be cajolld with praises and i believe poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter  i would not be thought to say this as if the obliging letter you sent me deserved this imputation only it put me in mind of it and i fancy one may apply to ones friend when caesar said of his wife it was not sufficient that he knew her to be chaste himself but she should not be so much as suspected by others  as to the wonderful discoveries and all the good news you are pleased to tell me of my self i treat it as you who are in the secret treat common news groundless reports of things at a distance which i who look into the true springs of the affair at home in my own breast know to have no foundation at all for fame though it be as milton finely calls it the last infirmity of noble minds is scarce so strong a temptation as to warrant our loss of time here it can never make up lie down contentedly on a deathbed as some of the ancients are said to have done with that thought you sir have your self taught me that an easy situation at that hour can proceed from no ambition less noble than that of an eternal felicity which is unattainable by the strongest endeavors of the wit but may be gained by the sincere intentions of the heart only as in the next world so in this the only solid blessings are owing to the goodness of the mind not the extent of the capacity friendship here is an emanation from the same source as beatitude there the same benevolence and grateful disposition that qualifies us for the one if extended farther makes us partakers of the other the utmost point of my desires in my present state terminates in the society and good will of worthy men which i look upon as no ill earnest and foretaste of the society and alliance of happy souls hereafter  the continuance of your favors to me is what not only makes me happy but causes me to set some value upon my self as a part of your care the instances i daily meet with of these agreeable awakenings of friendship are of too pleasing a nature not to be acknowledged whenever i think of you i am  your etc  to the same april  0      i have been almost every day employed in following your advice and amusing my self in painting in which i am most particularly obliged to mr jervas who gives me daily instructions and examples as to poetical affairs i am content at present to be a bare lookeron and from a practitioner turn an admirer which is as the world goes not very usual cato was not so much the wonder of rome in his days as he is of britain in ours and though all the foolish industry possible has been used to make it thought a partyplay yet what the author once said of another may the most properly in the world be applied to him on this occasion envy itself is dumb in wonder lost and factions strive who shall applaud him most   the numerous and violent claps of the whigparty on the oneside of the theater were echoed back by the tories on the other while the author sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their applause proceeding more from the hand than the head this was the case too of the prologuewriter who was clapped into a stanch whig at almost every too lines i believe you have heard that after all the applauses of the opposite faction my lord bolingbroke sent for booth who played cato into the box between one of the acts and presented him with fifty guineas in acknowledgment as he expressed it for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator the whigs are unwilling to be distancd this way as it is said and therefore design a present to the same cato very speedily in the mean time they are getting ready as good a sentence as the former on their side so betwixt them it is probable that cato as dr garth expressed it may have something to live upon after he dies i am  your etc  mr pope to mr addison july  0      i am more joyd at your return than i should be at that of the sun so much as i wish for him this melancholy wet season but it is his fate too like yours to be displeasing to owls and obscene animals who cannot bear his luster what put me in mind of these nightbirds was john dennis whom i think you are best revenged upon as the sun was in the fable upon those batts and beastly birds abovementioned only by shining on i am so far from esteeming it any misfortune that i congratulate you upon having your share in that which all the great men and all the good men that ever lived have had their part of envy and calumny to be uncensurd and to be obscure is the same thing you may conclude from what i here say that twas never in my thoughts to have offered you my pen in any direct reply to such a critic but only in some little raillery not in defense of you but in contempt of him this relates to the paper occasioned by denniss remarks upon cato called dr norriss narative of the frenzy of john den but indeed your opinion that it is entirely to be neglected would have been my own had it been my own case but i felt more warmth here than i did when first i saw his book against myself though indeed in two minutes it made me heartily merry he has written against every thing the world has approved these many years i apprehend but one danger from denniss disliking our sense that it may make us think so very well of it as to become proud and conceited upon his disapprobation  i must not here omit to do justice to mr  whose zeal in your concern is worthy a friend and honourer of you he writ to me in the most pressing terms about it though with that just contempt of the critic that he deserves i think in these days one honest man is obliged to acquaint another who are his friends when so many mischievous insects are daily at work to make people of merit suspicious of each other that they may have the satisfaction of seeing them looked upon no better than themselves i am  your etc  mr addison to mr pope october         i was extremely glad to receive a letter from you but more so upon reading the contents of it the the translation of the iliad work you mention will i dare say very sufficiently recommend itself when your name appears with the proposals and if you think i can any way contribute to the forwarding of them you cannot lay a greater obligation upon me than by employing me in such an office as i have an ambition of having it known that you are my friend i shall be very proud of showing it by this or any other instance i question not but your translation will enrich our tongue and do honor to our country for i conclude of it already from those performances with which you have obliged the public i would only have you consider how it may most turn to your advantage excuse my impertinence in this particular which proceeds from my zeal for your ease and happiness the work would cost you a great deal of time and unless you undertake it will i am afraid never be executed by any other at least i know none of this age that is equal to it besides your self  i am at present wholly immersed in country business and begin to take delight in it i wish i might hope to see you here sometime and will not despair of it when you engage in a work that will require solitude and retirement i am  your etc  mr addison to mr pope nov        i have received your letter and am glad to find that you have laid so good a scheme for your great undertaking i question not but the prose will require as much care as the poetry but the variety will give your self some relief and more pleasure to your readers  you gave me leave once to take the liberty of a friend in advising you not to content your self with one half of the nation for your admirers when you might command them all if i might take the freedom to repeat it i would on this occasion i think you are very happy that you are out of the fray and i hope all your undertakings will turn to the better account for it  you see how i presume on your friendship in taking all this freedom with you but i already fancy that we have lived many years together in an unreserved conversation and that we may do many more is the sincere wish of  your etc  mr pope to mr addison your last is the more obliging as it hints at some little niceties in my conduct which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me and which so trivial as things of this nature seem are vet of no slight consequence to people whom every body talks of and every body as he pleases it is a sort of tax that attends an estate in parnassus which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the small possession an author holds for indeed an author who is once come upon the town is enjoyed without being thanked for the pleasure and sometimes illtreated by those very persons that first debauched him yet to tell you the bottom of my heart i am no way displeased that i have offended the violent of all parties already and at the same time i assure you conscientiously i feel not the least malevolence or resentment against any of those who misrepresent me or are dissatisfied with me this frame of mind is so easy that i am perfectly content with my condition  as i hope and would flatter my self that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either so it is a pleasure to me that you guessed so right in regard to the author of that guardian you mentioned but i am sorry to find it has taken air that i have some hand in those papers because i write so very few as neither to deserve the credit of such a report with some people nor the disrepute of it with others an honest jacobite spoke to me the sense or nonsense of the weak part of his party very fairly that the good people took it ill of me that i writ with steel though upon never so indifferent subjects  this i know you will laugh at as well as i do yet i doubt not but many little calumniators and persons of sower dispositions will take occasion hence to bespatter me i confess i scorn narrow souls of all parties and if i renounce my reason in religious matters i will hardly do it in any other  i cannot imagine whence it comes to pass that the few guardians i have written are so generally known for mine that in particular which you mention i never discovered to any man but the publisher till very lately yet almost every body i met told me of it  the true reason that mr steel laid down the paper was a quarrel between him and jacob tonson he stood engaged to his bookseller in articles of penalty for all the guardians and by desisting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the englishman was quit of his obligation these papers being printed by buckley  as to his taking a more politic turn i cannot any way enter into that secret nor have i been let into it any more than into the rest of his politics though it is said he will take into these papers also several subjects of the politer kind as before but i assure you as to my self i have quite done with em for the future the little i have done and the great respect i bear mr steel as a man of wit has rendered me a suspected whig to some of the violent but as old dryden said before me it is not the violent i design to please  i generally employ the mornings in painting with mr jervas see mr popes epistle to him in verse writ about this time  and the evenings in the conversation of such as i think can most improve my mind of whatever party or denomination they are i ever must set the highest value upon men of truly great that is honest principles with equal capacities the best way i know of overcoming calumny and misconstruction is by a vigorous perseverance in every thing we know to be right and a total neglect of all that can ensue from it it is partly from this maxim that i depend upon your friendship because i believe it will do justice to my intention in every thing and give me leave to tell you that as the world goes this is no small assurance i repose in you i am  your etc  to the same dec         i have been lying in wait for my own imagination this week and more and watching what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy that were worth communicating to you in a letter but i am at length convinced that my rambling head can produce nothing of that sort so i must even be contented with telling you the old story that i love you heartily i have often found by experience that nature and truth though never so low or vulgar are yet pleasing when openly and artlessly represented it would be diverting to me to read the very letters of an infant could it write its innocent inconsistencies and tautologies just as it thought em this makes me hope a letter from me will not be unwelcome to you when i am conscious i write with more unreservedness than ever man wrote or perhaps talked to another i trust your good nature with the whole range of my follies and really love you so well that i would rather you should pardon me than esteem me since one is an act of goodness and benevolence the other a kind of constrained deference  you cannot wonder my thoughts are scarce consistent when i tell you how they are distracted every hour of my life my mind is strangely divided this minute perhaps i am above the stars with a thousand systems round about me looking forward into a vast abyss and losing my whole comprehension in the boundless space of creation in dialogues with w and the astronomers the next moment i am below all trifles grovelling with t in the very center of nonsense now i am recreated with the brisk sallies and quick turns of wit which mr steel in his liveliest and freest humors darts about him and now levelling my application to the insignificant observations and quirks of grammar of mr  and d  good good what an incongruous animal is man how unsettled in his best part his soul and how changing and variable in his frame of body the constancy of the one shook by every notion the temperament of the other affected by every blast of wind what is man altogether but one mighty inconsistency sickness and pain is the lot of one half of us doubt and fear the portion of the other what a bustle we make about passing our time when all our space is but a point what aims and ambitions are crowded into this little instant of our life which as shakespeare finely words it is rounded with a sleep our whole extent of being no more in the eyes of him who gave it than a scarce perceptible motion of duration those animals whose circle of living is limited to three or four hours as the naturalists assure us are yet as longlived and possess as wide a scene of action as a man if we consider him with an eye to all space and all eternity who knows what plots what achievements a mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of dust within his life of some minutes and of how much less consideration than even this is the life of man in the fight of that god who is from ever and for ever  who that thinks in this train but must see the world and its contemptible grandeurs lessen before him at every thought it is enough to make one remain stupifyd in a poize of inaction void of all desires of all designs of all friendships  but we must return through our very condition of being to our narrow selves and those things that affect our selves our passions our interests flow in upon us and unphilosophize us into mere mortals for my part i never return so much into my self as when i think of you whose friendship is one of the best comforts i have for the insignificancy of my self i am  your etc  to the same jan  0       your letter found me very busy in my grand undertaking to which i must wholly give my self up for some time unless when i snatch an hour to please my self with a distant conversation with you and a few others by writing it is no comfortable prospect to be reflecting that so long a siege as that of troy lies upon my hands and the campaign above half over before i have made any progress indeed the greek fortification upon a nearer approach does not appear so formidable as it did and i am almost apt to flatter my self that homer secretly seems inclined to a correspondence with me in letting me into a good part of his intentions there are indeed a sort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work called commentators and critics who would frighten many people by their number and bulk and perplex our progress under pretense of fortifying their author these lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themselves have dug encompassed with dirt of their own heaping up but i think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more speedy and gallant way than by mining under ground that is by using the poetical engines wings and flying over their heads  while i am engaged in the fight i find you are concerned how i shall be paid and are sollicitous that i may not have the ill fate of many discarded generals to be first envied and malignd then perhaps praised and lastly neglected the former the constant attendant upon all great and laudable enterprises i have already experienced some have said i am not a master in the greek who either are so themselves or are not if they are not they cannot tell and if they are they cannot without having catechized me but if they can read for i know some critics can and others cannot there are fairly lying before them some specimens of my translation from this author in the miscellanics which they are heartily welcome to i have met with as much malignity another way some calling me a tory because the heads of that party have been distinguishingly favorable to me some a whig because i have been favored with yours mr congreves and mr craggs his friendship and of late with my lord hallifaxs patronage how much more natural a conclusion might be formed by any goodnatured man that a person who has been well used by all sides has been offensive to none this miserable age is so sunk between animosities of party and those of religion that i begin to fear most men have politics enough to make through violence the best scheme of government a bad one and faith enough to hinder their own salvation i hope for my own part never to have more of either than is consistent with common justice and charity and always as much as becomes a christian and honest man though i find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a papist here where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being so too much and to the fifth part as being so too little i shall yet be easy under both their mistakes and be what i more than seem to be for i suffer for it god is my witness that i no more envy you protestants your places and possessions than i do our priests their charity or learning i am ambitious of nothing but the good opinion of good men on both sides for i know that one virtue of a free spirit is more worth than all the virtues put together of all the narrowsould people in the world i am  your etc  the reverend dean berkley to mr pope leghorne may i      as i take ingratitude to be a greater crime than impertinence i choose rather to run the risque of being thought guilty of the latter than not to return you my thanks for a very agreeable entertainment you just now gave me i have accidentally met with your rape of the lock here having never seen it before style painting judgment spirit i had already admired in others of your writings but in this i am charmed with the magic of your invention with all those images allusions and inexplicable beauties which you raise so surprizingly and at the same time so naturally out of a trifle and yet i cannot say that i was more pleased with the reading of it than i am with the pretext it gives me to renew in your thoughts the remembrance of one who values no happiness beyond the friendship of men of wit learning and good nature  i remember to have heard you mention some halfformd design of coming to italy what might we not expect from a muse that sings so well in the bleak climate of england if she felt the same warm sun and breathed the same air with virgil and horace  there are here an incredible number of poets that have all the inclination but want the genius or perhaps the art of the ancients some among them who understand english begin to relish our authors and i am informed that at florence they have translated milton into italian verse if one who knows so well how to write like the old latin poets came among them it would probably be a means to retrieve them from their cold trivial conceits to an imitation of their predecessors  as merchants antiquaries men of pleasure etc have all different views in traveling i know not whether it might not be worth a poets while to travel in order to store his mind with strong images of nature  green fields and groves flowery meadows and purling streams are no where in such perfection as in england but if you would know lightsome days warm suns and blue skys you must come to italy and to enable a man to describe rocks and precipices it is absolutely necessary that he pass the alps  you will easily perceive that it is selfinterest makes me so fond of giving advice to one who has no need of it if you come into these parts i should fly to see you i am here by the favor of my good friend the dean of st patricks in quality of chaplain to the earl of peterborough who about three months since left the greatest part of his family in this town god knows how long we shall stay here i am  your etc  mr pope to the honorable  june        the question you ask in relation to mr ad and mr philips i shall answer in a few words mr philips did express himself with much indignation against me one evening at buttons coffeehouse as i was told saying that i was entered into a cabal with dean swift and others to write against the whiginterest and in particular to undermine his own reputation and that of his friends steel and addison but mr philips never opened his lips to my face on this or any like occasion though i was almost every night in the same room with him nor ever offered me any indecorum mr addison came to me a night or two after philips had talked in this idle manner and assured me of his disbelief of what had been said of the friendship we should always maintain and desired i would say nothing further of it my lord hallifax did me the honor to stir in this matter by speaking to several people to obviate a falandse aspersion which might have done me no small prejudice with one party however philips did all he could secretly to continue the report with the hanover club and kept in his hands the subscriptions paid for me to him as secretary to that club the heads of it have since given him to understand that they take it ill but upon the terms i ought to be with a man whom i think a scoundrel i would not even ask him for this money but commissioned one of the players his equals to receive it this is the whole matter but as to the secret grounds of philipss malignity they will make a very pleasant history when we meet mr congreve and some others have been much diverted with it and most of the gentlemen of the hanover club have made it the subject of their ridicule on their secretary it is to this management of philips that the world owes mr gays pastorals the ingenious author is extremely your servant and would have complied with your kind invitation but that he is just now appointed secretary to my lord clarendon in his embassy to hanover  i am sensible of the zeal and friendship with which i am sure you will always defend your friend in his absence from all those little tales and calumnies which a man of any genius or merit is born to i shall never complain while i am happy in such noble defenders and in such contemptible opponents may their envy and ill nature ever increase to the glory and pleasure of those they would injure may they represent me what they will as long as you think me what i am  your etc  to the same july         you mention the account i gave you some time ago of the things which philips said in his foolishness but i cannot tell from any thing in your letter whether you received a long one from me about a fortnight since it was principally intended to thank you for the last obliging favor you did me and perhaps for that reason you pass it in silence i there launched into some account of my temporal affairs and intend now to give you some hints of my spiritual the conclusion of your letter draws this upon you where you tell me you prayed for me your proceeding sir is contrary to that of most other friends who never talk of praying for a man after they have done him a service but only when they will do him none nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human sciences which i assure you i am daily more and more convinced of and indeed i have for some years past looked upon all of em no better than amusements to make them the ultimate end of our pursuit is a miserable and short ambition which will drop from us at every little disappointment here and even in case of no disappointments here will infallibly desert us hereafter the utmost fame they are capable of bestowing is never worth the pains they cost us and the time they lose us if you attain the top of your desires that way all those who envy you will do you harm and of those who admire you few will do you good the unsuccessful writers are your declared enemies and probably the successful your secret ones for those hate not more to be excelled than these to be rivalld and at the upshot after a life of perpetual application to reflect that you have been doing nothing for your self and that the same or less industry might have gained you a friendship that can never deceive or end a satisfaction which praise cannot bestow nor vanity feel and a glory which though in one respect like same not to be had till after death yet shall be felt and enjoyed to eternity these dear sir are unfeignedly my sentiments whenever i think at all for half the things that employ our heads deserve not the name of thoughts they are only stronger dreams or impressions upon the imagination our schemes of government our systems of philosophy our golden worlds of poetry are all but so many shadowy images and airy prospects which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent as we are more overcast with the darkness and disturbed with the fumes of human vanity  the same thing that makes old men willing to leave this world makes me willing to leave poetry longhabit and weariness of the same track homer will work a cure upon me fifteen thousand verses are equivalent to fourscore years to make one old in rhyme and i should be sorry and ashamed to go on jingling to the last step like a waggoners horse in the same road and so leave my bells to the next silly animal that will be proud of em that man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reason who is measuring syllables and coupling rhimes when he should be mending his own soul and securing his own immortality if i had not this opinion i should be unworthy even of those small and limited parts which god has given me and unworthy of the friendship of such a man as you i am  your etc  to the same july         i have no better excuse to offer you that i have omitted a task naturally so pleasing to me as conversing upon paper with you but that my time and eyes have been wholly employed upon homer whom i almost fear i shall find but one way of imitating which is in his blindness i am perpetually afflicted with headachs that very much affect my sight and indeed since my coming hither i have scarce past an hour agreeably except that in which i read your letter i would seriously have you think you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friendship than he who least deserves it on all other accounts than his due sense of it but let me tell you you can hardly guess what a task you undertake when you profess your self my friend there are some tories who will take you for a whig some whigs who will take you for a tory some protestants who will esteem you a rank papist and some papists who will account you a heretic  i find by dear experience we live in an age where it is criminal to be moderate and where no one man can be allowed to be just to all men the notions of right and wrong are so far strained that perhaps to be in the right so very violently may be of worse consequence than to be easily and quietly in the wrong i really wish all men so well that i am satisfied but few can wish me so but if those few are such as tell me they do i am content for they are the best people i know while you believe me what i profess as to religion i can bear any thing the bigoted may say while mr congreve likes my poetry i can endure dennis and a thousand more like him while the most honest and moral of each party think me no ill man i can easily support it though the most violent and mad of all parties rose up to throw dirt at me  i must expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my homer whoever in our times would be a professor of learning above his fellows ought at the very first to enter the world with the constancy and resolution of a primitive christian and be prepared to suffer all sort of public persecution it is certainly to be lamented that if any man does but endeavor to distinguish himself or gratify others by his studies he is immediately treated as a common enemy instead of being looked upon as a common friend and assaulted as generally as if his whole design were to prejudice the state and ruin the public i will venture to say no man ever rose to any degree of prefection in writing but through obstinacy and an inveterate resolution against the stream of mankind so that if the world has received any benefit from the labors of the learned it was in its own despite for when first they essay their parts all people in general are prejudiced against new beginners and when they have got a little above contempt then some particular person who were before unfortunate in their own attempts are sworn foes to them only because they succeed  upon the whole one may say of the best writers that they pay a severe fine for their fame which it is always in the power of the most worthless part of mankind to levy upon them when they please  i am etc  to mr jervas july         i am just entered upon the old way of life again sleep and musing it is my employment to revive the old of past ages to the present as it is yours to transmit the young of the present to the future i am copying the great master in one art with the same love and diligence with which the painters hereafter will copy you in another  thus i should begin my epistle to you if it were a dedicatory one but as it is a friendly letter you are to find nothing mentioned in your own praise but what only one in the world is witness to your particular goodnatured offices to me whatever mankind in general would allow you that i am not to give you to your face and if i were to do it in your absence the world would tell me i am too partial to be permitted to pass any judgment of you  so you see me cut out from any thing but common acknowledgments or common discourse the first you would take ill though i told you but half what i ought so in short the last only remains  and as for the last what can you expect from a man who has not talked these five days who is withdrawing his thoughts as far as he can from all the present world its customs and its manners to be fully possessed and absorpt in the past when people talk of going fo church i think of sacrifices and libations when i see the parson i address him as chryses priest of apollo and instead of the lords prayer i begin  god of the silver bow etc while you in the world are concerned about the protestant succession i consider only how menalaus may recover helen and the trojan war be put to a speedy conclusion i never inquire if the queen be well or not but heartily wish to be at hectors funeral the only things i regard in this life are whether my friends are well whether my translation go well on whether dennis be writing criticisms whether any body will answer him since i dont and whether lintott be not yet broke  i am etc  to the same aug         i thank you for your good offices which are numberless homer advances so fast that he begins to look about for the ornaments he is to appear in like a modish modern auther   picture in the front with bays and wicked ryme upon it   i have the greatest proof in nature at present of the amusing power of poetry for it takes me up so entirely that i scarce see what passes under my nose and hear nothing that is said about me to follow poetry as one ought one must forget father and mother and cleave to it alone my reverie has been so deep that i have scarce had an interval to think myself uneasy in the want of your company i now and then just miss you as i step into bed this minute indeed i want extremely to see you the next i shall dream of nothing but the taking of troy or the recovery of briseis  i fancy no friendship is so likely to prove lasting as ours because i am pretty sure there never was a friendship of so easy a nature we neither of us demand any mighty things from each other what vanity we have expects its gratification from other people it is not i that am to tell you what an artist you are nor is it you that are to tell me what a poet i am but it is from the world abroad we hope piously hope to hear these things at home we follow our business when we have any and think and talk most of each other when we have none it is not unlike the happy friendship of a stayed man and his wife who are seldom so fond as to hinder the business of the house from going on all day or so indolent as not to find consolation in each other every evening thus wellmeaning couples hold in amity to the last by not expecting too much from human nature while romantic friendships like violent loves begin with disquiets proceed to jealousies and conclude in animosities i have lived to see the fierce advancement the sudden turn and the abrupt period of three or four of these enormous friendships and am perfectly convinced of the truth of a maxim we once agreed in that nothing hinders the constant agreement of people who live together but mere vanity a secret insisting upon what they think their dignity or merit and an inward expectation of such an overmeasure of deference and regard as answers to their own extravagant false scale and which no body can pay because none but themselves can tell exactly to what pitch it amounts  i am etc  mr pope to edward blount esquire aug         whatever studies on the one hand or amusements on the other it shall be my fortune to fall into i shall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of em the task i undertook the translation of homers iliad  though of weight enough in itself has had a voluntary increase by the enlarging my design of the notes and the necessity of consulting a number of books has carried me to oxford but i fear through my lord harcourts and dr clarkes means i shall be more conversant with the pleasures and company of the place than with the books and manuscripts of it  i find still more reason to complain of the negligence of the geographers in their maps of old greece since i looked upon two or three more noted names in the public libraries here but with all the care i am capable of i have some cause to fear the engraver will prejudice me in a few situations i have been forced to write to him in so high a style that were my epistle intercepted it would raise no small admiration in an ordinary man there is scarce an order in it of less importance than to remove such and such mountains alter the course of such and such rivers place a large city on such a coast and raze another in another country i have set bounds to the sea and said to the land thus far shall thou advance and no further this relates to the map of ancient greece laid down by our author in his observations on the second iliad  in the mean time i who talk and command at this rate am in danger of losing my horse and stand in some fear of a country justice to disarm me indeed may be but prudential considering what armies i have at present on foot and in my service a hundred thousand grecians are no contemptible boby for all that i can tell they may be as formidable as four thousand priests and they seem proper forces to send against those in barcelona that siege deserves as fine a poem as the iliad and the machining part of poetry would be the juster in it as they say the inhabitants expect angels from heaven to their assistance may i venture to say who am a papist and to say to you who are a papist that nothing is more astonishing to me than that people so greatly warmed with a sense of liberty should be capable of harboring such weak superstition and that so much bravery and so much folly can inhabit the same breasts  i could not but take a trip to london on the death of the queen moved by the common curiosity of mankind who leave their own business to be looking upon other mens i thank god that as for my self i am below all the accidents of statechanges by my circumstances and above them by my philosophy common charity of man to man and universal good will to all are the points i have most at heart and i am sure those are not to be broken for the sake of any governors or government i am willing to hope the best and what i more wish than my own or any particular mans advancement is that this turn may put an end entirely to the divisions of whig and tory that the parties may love each other as well as i love them both or at least hurt each other as little as i would either and that our own people may live as quietly as we shall certainly let theirs that is to say that want of power it self in us may not be a surer prevention of harm than want of will in them i am sure if all whigs and all tories had the spirit of one roman catholic that i know it would be well for all roman catholics and if all roman catholics had always had that spirit it had been well for all others and we had never been charged with so wicked a spirit as that of persecution  i agree with you in my sentiment of the state of our nation since this change i find my self just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own heartily wishing the good that is the quiet of my country and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by partyspirit which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few  i am etc  mr jervas to mr pope aug  0      i have a particular to tell you at this time which pleases me so much that you must expect a more than ordinary alacrity in every turn you know i could keep you in suspense for twenty lines but i will tell you directly that mr addison and i have had a conversation that it would have been worth your while to have been placed behind the wainscot or behind some halflength picture to have heard he assured me that he would make use not only of his interest but of his art to do you some service he did not mean his art of poetry but his art at court and he is sensible that nothing can have a better air for himself than moving in your favor especially since insinuations were spread that he did not care you should prosper too much as a poet he protests that it shall not be his fault if there is not the best intelligence in the world and the most hearty friendship etc he owns he was afraid dr swift might have carried you too far among the enemy during the heat of the animosity but now all is safe and you are escaped even in his opinion i promised in your name like a good godfather not that you should renounce the devil and all his works but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own sake therefore prepare your self for some civilities  i have done homers head shadowed and heightened carefully and i enclose the outline of the same size that you may determine whether you would have it so large or reduced to make room for feuillage or laurel round the oval or about the square of the busto perhaps there is something more solemn in the image itself if i can get it well performed  if i have been instrumental in bringing you and mr addison together with all sincerity i value my self upon it as an acceptable piece of service to such a one as i know you to be  your etc  mr popes answer aug         i am just arrived from oxford very well diverted and entertained there  all very honest fellows  much concerned for the queens death no panegyricks ready yet for the king  i admire your whigprinciples of resistance exceedingly in the spirit of the barcelonians i join in your wish for them mr addisons verses on liberty in his letter from italy would be a good form of prayer in my opinion o liberty thou goddess heavenly bright etc  what you mentioned of the friendly office you endeavored to do betwixt mr addison and me deserves acknowledgments on my part you thoroughly know my regard to his character and my propensity to testify it by all ways in my power you as thoroughly know the scandalous meanness of that proceeding which was used by philips to make a man i so highly value suspect my dispositions toward him but as after all mr addison must be the judge in what regards himself and has seemed to be no very just one to me so i must own to you i expect nothing but civility from him how much soever i wish for his friendship and as for any offices of real kindness or service which it is in his power to do me i should be ashamed to receive em from any man who had no better opinion of my morals than to think me a partyman nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning or envying anothers reputation as a poet so i leave it to time to convince him as to both to show him the shallow depths of those halfwited creatures who misinformd him and to prove that i am incapable of endeavoring to lessen a person whom i would be proud to imitate and therefore ashamed to flatter in a word mr addison is sure of my respect at all times and of my real friendship whenever he shall think fit to know me for what i am  for all that passed betwixt dr swift and me you know the whole without reserve of our correspondence the engagements i had to him were such as the actual services he had done me in relation to the subscription for homer obliged me to i must have leave to be grateful to him and to any one who serves me let him be never so obnoxious to any party nor did the toryparty ever put me to the hardship of asking this leave which is the greatest obligation i owe to it and i expect no greater from the whigparty than the same liberty  a curse on the word party which i have been forced to use so often in this period i wish the present reign may put an end to the distinction that there may be no other for the future than that of honest and knave fool and man of sense these two sorts must always be enemies but for the rest may all people do as you and i believe what they please and be friends  i am etc  mr pope to mr addison october  0      i have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me that you have lately been pleased to speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect i have for you can deserve may i hope that some late malevolencies have lost their effect indeed it is neither for me nor my enemies to pretend to tell you whether i am your friend or not but it you would judge by probabilities i beg to know which of your poetical acquaintance has so little interest in pretending to be so methinks no man should question the real friendship of one who desires no real service i am only to get as much from the whigs as i got by the tories that is to say civility being neither so proud as to be insensible of any good office nor so humble as not to dare heartily to despise any man who does me an injustice  i will not value my self upon having ever guarded all the degrees of respect for you for to say the truth all the world speaks well of you and i should be under a necessity of doing the same whether i cared for you or not  as to what you have said of me i shall never believe that the author of cato can speak one thing and think another as a proof that i account you sincere i beg a favor of you it is that you would look over the two first books of my translation of homer which are now in the hands of my lord halifax i am sensible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it it is therefore some evidence of the trust i repose in your good will when i give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with justice and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts at the same time that you tell others your most favorable ones  i have a farther request which i must press with earnestness my bookseller is reprinting the essay on criticism to which you have done too much honor in your spectator of no     the period in that paper where you say i have admitted some strokes of ill nature into that essay is the only one i could wish omitted of all you have written but i would not desire it should be so unless i had the merit of removing your objection i beg you but to point out those strokes to me and you may be assured they shall be treated without mercy  since we are upon proofs of sincerity which i am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each others opinion give me leave to name another passage in the same spectator which i wish you would alter it is where you mention an observation upon homers verses of sysiphuss stone as these words are since left out in mr tickels edition but were extant in all during mr addisons life never having been made before by any of the critics i happened to find the same in dyonisius of halicarnassuss treatise  who treats very largely upon these verses i know you will think fit to soften your expression when you see the passage which you must needs have read though it be since slipped out of your memory i am with the utmost esteem  your etc  mr pope to the earl of halifax dec        my lord i am obliged to you both for the favors you have done me and for those you intend me i distrust neither your will nor your memory when it is to do good and if ever i become troublesome or sollicitous it must not be out of expectation but out of gratitude your lordship may either cause me to live agreeably in the town or contentedly in the country which is really all the difference i set between an easy fortune and a small one it is indeed a high strain of generosity in you to think of making me easy all my life only because i have been so happy as to divert you some few hours but if i may have leave to add it is because you think me no enemy to my native country there will appear a better reason for i must of consequence be very much as i sincererly am  my lord etc mr pope to mr congreve jan           methinks when i write to you i am making a confession i have got i cannot tell how such a custom of throwing my self out upon paper without reserve you were not mistaken in what you judged of my temper of mind when i writ last my faults will not be hid from you and perhaps it is no dispraise to me that they will not the cleanness and purity of ones mind is never better proved than in discovering its own faults at first view as when a stream shows the dirt at its bottom it shows also the transparency of the water  my spleen was not occasioned however by any thing an dennis who writ an abusive pamplet this year entitled remarks on mr pope s homer abusive angry critic could write of me i take very kindly your heroic manner of congratulation upon this scandal for i think nothing more honorable than to be involved in the same fate with all the great and the good that ever lived that is to be envied and censured by bad writers  you do no more than answer my expectations of you in declaring how well you take my freedom in sometimes neglecting as i do to reply to your letters so soon as i ought those who have a right taste of the substantial part of friendship can wave the ceremonial a friend is the only one that will bear the omission and one may find who is not so by the very trial of it  as to any anxiety i have concerning the fate of my homer the care is over with me the world must be the judge and i shall be the first to consent to the justice of its judgment whatever it be i am not so arrant an author as even to desire that if i am in the wrong all mankind should be so  i am mightily pleased with a saying of monsieur tourreil when a man writes he ought to animate himself with the thoughts of pleasing all the world but he is to renounce that desire or hope the very moment the book goes out of his hands  i write this from binfield whither i came yesterday having past a few days in my way with my lord blingbroke i go to london in three days time and will not fail or pay a visit to mr m whom i saw not long since at my lord halifaxs i hoped from thence he had some hopes of advantage from the present administration for few people i think but i pay respects to great men without any prospects i am in the fairest way in the world of being not worth a groat being born both a papist and a poet this puts me in mind of reacknowledging your continued endeavors to enrich me but i can tell you it is to no purpose for without the opes aequum animum mi ipse parabo  i am your etc  mr pope to mr congreve march           the farce of the whatdyecallit has occasioned many different speculations in the town some looked upon it as mere jest upon the tragic poets others as a satire upon the late war mr cromwell hearing none of the words and seeing the action to be tragical was much astonished to find the audience laugh and says the prince and princess must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same account several templers and others of the more vociferous kind of critics went with a resolution to hiss and confessed they were forced to laugh so much that they forgot the design they came with the court in general has in a very particular manner come into the jest and the three first nights notwithstanding two of them were courtnights were distinguished by very full audiences of the first quality the common people of the pit and gallery received it at first with great gravity and sedateness some few with tears but after the third day they also took the hint and have ever since been very loud in their claps there are still some sober men who cannot be of the general opinion but the laughers are so much the majority that one or two critics seem determined to undeceive the town at their proper cost by writing grave dissertations against it to encourage them in which laudable design it is resolved a preface shall be prefixed to the farce in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing  yesterday mr steels affair was decided i am sorry i can be of no other opinion than yours as to his whole carriage and writings of late but certainly he has not only been punished by others but suffered much even from his own party in the point of character nor i believe received any amends in that of interest as yet whatever may be his prospects for the future  this gentleman among a thousand others is a great instance of the fate of all who are carried away by partyspirit of any side i wish all violence may succeed as ill but am really amazed that so much of that sower and pernicious quality should be joined with so much natural good humor as i think mr steel is possessed of  i am etc  to mr congreve april        mr pope is going to mr jervass where mr addison is sitting for his picture in the mean time amidst clouds of tobacco at a coffeehouse i write this letter there is a grand revolution at wills morris has quitted for a coffeehouse in the city and titcomb is restored to the great joy of cromwell who was at a great loss for a person to converse with upon the fathers and church history the knowledge i gain from him is entirely in painting and poetry and mr pope owes all his skill in astronomy to him and mr whiston so celebrated of late for his discovery of the longitude in an extraordinary copy of verses called an ode on the longitude in swift and popes miscellany  mr rowes jane gray is to be played in easterweek when mrs oldfield is to personate a character directly opposite to female nature for what woman ever despised sovereignty you know chaucer has a tale where a knight saves his head by discovering it was the thing which all woman most coveted mr popes homer is retarded by the great rains that have fallen of late which causes the sheets to be long a drying this gives mr lintot great uneasiness who is now endeavoring to corrupt the curate of his parish to pray for fair weather that his work may go on there is a sixpenny criticism lately published upon the tragedy of the whatdyecall it wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead and mr pope a knave his grand charge is against the pilgrims progress being read which he says is directly levelled at catos reading plato to back this censure he goes on to tell you that the pilgrims progress being mentioned to be the eighth edition makes the reflection evident the tragedy of cato having just eight times as he quaintly expresses it visited the press he has also endeavored to show that every particular passage of the play alludes to some fine part of tragedy which he says i have injudiciously and profanely abused this curious piece was entitled a complete key to the whatdyecallit it was written by one griffin a player assisted by lewis theobald  sir samuel garths poem upon my lord clares house i believe will be published in the easterweek  thus far mr gay  who has in his letter forestalled all the subjects of diversion unless it should be one to you to say that i sit up till two aclock over burgundy and champagne and am become so much a rake that i shall be ashamed in a short time to be thought to do any sort of business i fear i must get the gout by drinking purely for a fashionable pretense to sit still long enough to translate four books of homer i hope you will by that time be up again and i may succeed to the bed and cough of my predecessor pray cause the stuffing to be repaired and the crutches shortened for me the calamity of your gout is what all your friends that is to say all that know you must share in we desire you in your turn to condole with us who are under a persecution and much afflicted with a distemper which proves grievous to many poets a criticism we have indeed some relieving intervals of laughter as you know there are in some diseases and it is the opinion of diverse good guessers that the last fit will not be more violent than advantageous for poets assailed by critics are like men bitten by tarantulas they dance on so much the faster  mr thomas burnet has played the precursor to the coming of homer in a treatise called homerides he has since risen very much in his criticisms and after assaulting homer made a daring attack upon the in one of his papers called the grumbler long since dead whatdyecallit yet is there not a proclamation issued for the burning of homer and the pope by the common hangman nor is the whatdyecallit yet silenced by the lordchamberlain they shall survive the conflagration of his fathers works and live after they and he are damned for that the bp of s already is so is the opinion of dr sacheverel and the church of rome  i am etc  mr pope to the earl of b my lord if your mare could speak she would give you an account of the extraordinary company she had on the road which since she cannot do i will  it was the enterprizing mr lintott the redoubtable rival of mr tonson who mounted on a stonehorse no disagreeable companion to your lordships mare overtook me in windsorforest he said he heard i designed for oxford the seat of the muses and would as my bookseller by all means accompany me thither  i asked him where he got his horse he answered he got it of his publisher for that rogue my printer said he disappointed me i hoped to put him in good humor by a treat at the tavern of a brown fricassee of rabbits which cost two shillings with two quarts of wine besides my conversation i thought myself cocksure of his horse which he readily promised me but said that mr tonson had just such another design of going to cambridge expecting there the copy of a comment upon the revelations and if mr tonson went he was preingagd to attend him being to have the printing of the said copy  so in short i borrowed this stonehorse of my publisher which he had of mr oldmixon for a debt he lent me too the pretty boy you see after me he was a smutty dog yesterday and cost me near two hours to wash the ink off his face but the devil is a fairconditiond devil and very forward in his catechize if you have any more baggs he shall carry them  i thought mr lintotts civility not to be neglected so gave the boy a small bagg containing three shirts and an elzevir virgil and mounting in an instant procceded on the road with my man before my courteous stationer beside and the aforesaid devil behind  mr lintott began in this manner now damn them what if they should put it into the newspaper how you and i went together to oxford why what would i care if i should go down into sussex they would say i was gone to the speaker but what of that if my son were but big enough to go on with the business by gd i would keep as good company as told jacob  hereupon i inquired of his son the lad says he has fine parts but is somewhat sickly much as you are  i spare for nothing in his education at westminster pray dont you think westminster to be the best school in england most of the late ministry came out of it so did many of this ministry i hope the boy will make his fortune  dont you design to let him pass a year at oxford to what purpose said he the universities do but make pedants and i intend to breed him a man of business  as mr lintott was talking i observed he sat uneasy on his saddle for which i expressed some solicitude nothing says he i can bear it well enough but since we have the day before us methinks it would be very pleasant for you to rest awhile under the woods when were alighted see here what a mighty pretty horace i have in my pocket what if you amused your self in turning an ode till we mount again lord if you pleased what a clever miscellany might you make at leisure hours perhaps i may said i if we ride on the motion is an aid to my fancy a round trott very much awakens my spirits then jog on apace and i will think as hard as i can  silence ensued for a full hour after which mr lintott lugd the reins stopped short and broke out well sir how far have you gone i answered seven miles zds sir said lintott i thought you had done seven stanzas oldsworth in a ramble round wimbletonhill would translate a whole ode in half this time i will say that for oldsworth though i lost by his timothys he translates an ode of horace the quickest of any man in england i remember dr king would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could nt speak and there is sir richard in that rumbling old chariot of his between fleetditch and st giles pound shall make you half a job  pray mr lintott said i now you talk of translators what is your method of managing them sir replied he those are the saddest pack of rogues in the world in a hungry fit they will swear they understand all the languages in the universe i have known one of them take down a greek book upon my counter and cry ay this is hebrew i must read it from the latter end by gd i can never be sure in these fellows for i neither understand greek latin french nor italian my self but this is my way i agree with them for ten shillings per sheet with a proviso that i will have their doings corrected by whom i please so by one or other they are led at last to the true sense of an author my judgment giving the negative to all my translators but how are you secure that those correctors may not impose upon you why i get any civil genetleman especially any scotchman that comes into my shop to read the original to me in english by this i know whether my first translator be deficient and whether my corrector merits his money or no  i will tell you what happened to me last month i bargained with s for a new version of lucretius to publish against tonsons agreeing to pay the author so many shillings at his producing so many lines he made a great progress in a very short time and i gave it to the corrector to compare with the latin but he went directly to creechs translation and found it the same word for word all but the first page now what do you think i did i arrested the translator for a cheat nay and i stopped the correctors pay too upon this proof that he had made use of creech instead of the original  pray tell me next how you deal with the critics sir said he nothing more easy i can silence the most formidable of them the rich ones for a sheet apiece of the blotted manuscript which costs me nothing they will go about with it to their acquaintance and pretend they had it from the author who submitted to their correction this has given some of them such an air that in time they come to be consulted with and dedicated to as the top critics of the town  as for the poor critics i will give you one instance of my management by which you may guess at the rest a lean man that looked like a very good scholar came to me the other day he turned over homer shook his head shrugd up his shoulders and pishd at every line of it one would wonder says he at the strange presumption of men homer is no such easy task that every stripling every versifier  he was going on when my wife called to dinner sir said i will you please to eat a piece of beef with me mr lintott said he i am sorry you should be at the expense of this great book i am really concerned on your account  sir i am much obliged to you if you can dine upon a piece of beef together with a slice of pudding  mr lintott i do not say but mr pope if he would condescend to advise with men of learning  sir the pudding is upon the table if you please to go in  my critic complies he comes to a taste of your poetry and tells me in the same breath that the book is commendable and the pudding excellent  now sir concluded mr lintott in return to the frankness i have shown pray tell me is it the opinion of your friends at court that my lord l will be brought to the bar or not i told him i heard not and i hoped it my lord being one i had particular obligations to that may he replied mr lintott but by gd if he is not i shall lose the printing of a very good trial  these my lord are a few traits by which you may discern the genius of my friend mr lintott which i have chosen for the subject of a letter i dropped him as soon as i got to oxford and paid a visit to my lord carlion at middleton  the conversations i enjoy here are not to be prejudiced by my pen and the pleasures from them only to be equaled when i meet your lordship i hope in a few days to cast my self from your horse at your feet  i am etc  dr parnell to mr pope june         i am writing you a long letter but all the tediousness i feel in it is that it makes me during the time think more intently of my being far from you i fancy if i were with you i could remove some of the uneasiness which you may have felt from the opposition of the world and which you should be ashamed to feel since it is but the testimony which one part of it gives you that your merit is unquestionable what would you have otherwise from ignorance envy or those tempers which vie with you in your own way i know this in mankind that when our ambition is unable to attain its end it is not only wearied but exasperated too at the vanity of its labors then we speak ill of happier studies and sighing condemn the excellence which we find above our reach   my printed for b lintott       o under this title zoilus which you used to write about i finished last spring and left in town i waited till i came up to send it you but not arriving here before your book was out imagined it a lost piece of labor if you will still have it you need only write me word  i have here seen the first book of homer which came out at a time when it could not but appear as a kind of setting up against you my opinion is that you may if you please give them thanks who writ it neither the numbers nor the spirit have an equal mastery with yours but what surprises me more is that a scholar being concerned there should happen to be some mistakes in the authors sense such as putting the light of pallass eyes into the eyes of achilles making the taunt of achilles to agamemnon that he should have spoils when troy should be taken to be a cool and serious proposal the translating what you call ablution by the word offals and so leaving water out of the rite of lustration etc but you must have taken notice of this before i write not to inform you but to show i always have you at heart  i am etc  from a letter of the reverend doctor berkeley dean of londonderry july         some days ago three or four gentlemen and my self exerting that right which all readers pretend to over authors sat in judgment upon the two new translations of the first iliad without partiality to my countrymen i assure you they all gave the preference where it was due being unanimously of opinion that yours was equally just to the sense with mr s and without comparison more easy more poetical and more sublime but i will say no more on such a threadbare subject as your late performance is at this time  i am etc  extract from a letter from mr gay to mr pope july         i have just set down sir samuel garth at the opera he bid me tell you that every body is pleased with your translation but a few at buttons and that sir richard steel told him that mr addison said tickels translation was the best that ever was in any language sir richard steel afterward in his preface to an edision of the drummer a comedy by mr addison shows it to be his opinion that  not mr tickel but mr addison himself was the person that translated this book  he treated me with extreme civility and out of kindness gave me a squeeze by the sore finger  i am informed that at buttons your character is made very free with as morals etc and mr a says that your translation and tickels are both very well done but that the latter has more of homer  i am etc  extract from a letter of dr arbuthnot to mr pope july         i congratulate you upon mr tickels first book it does not indeed want its merit but i was strangely disappointed in my expectation of a translation nicely true to the original whereas in those parts where the greatest exactness seems to be demanded he has been the least careful i mean the history of ancient ceremonies and rites etc in which you have with great judgment been exact  i am etc  mr pope to the honorable james craggs esquire july         i lay hold of the opportunity given me by my lord duke of shrewsbury to assure you of the continuance of that esteem and affection i have long born you and the memory of so many agreeable conversations as we have passed together i wish it were a compliment to say such conversations as are not to be found on this side of the water for the spirit of dissension is gone forth among us nor is it a wonder that buttons is no longer buttons when old england is no longer old england that region of hospitality society and good humor party affects us all even the wits though they gain as little by politics as they do by their wit we talk much of fine sense refined sense and exalted sense but for use and happiness give me a little common sense i say this in regard to some gentlemen professed wits of our acquaintance who fancy they can make poetry of consequence at this time of day in the midst of this raging fit of politics for they tell me the busy part of the nation are not more divided about whig and tory than these idle fellows of the feather about mr tickels and my translation i like the tories have the town in general that is the mob on my side but it is usual with the smaller party to make up in industry what they want in number and that is the case with the little senate of cato however if our principles be well considered i must appear a brave whig and mr tickel a rank tory i translated homer for the public in general he to gratify the inordinate desires of one man only we have it seems a great turk in poetry who can never bear a brother on the throne and has his mutes too a set of nodders winkers and whisperers whose business is to strangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth the new translator of homer is the humblest slave he has that is to say his first minister let him receive the honors he gives him but receive them with fear and trembling let him be proud of the approbation of his absolute lord i appeal to the people as my rightful judges and masters and if they are not inclined to condemn me i fear no arbitrary highflying proceedings from the small courtfaction at buttons but after all i have said of this great man there is no rupture between us we are each of us so civil and obliging that neither thinks he is obliged and i for my part treat with him as we do with the grand monarch who has too many great qualities not to be respected though we know he watches any occasion to oppress us  when i talk of homer i must not forget the early present you made me of monsieur de la mottes book and i cannot conclude this letter without telling you a melancholy piece of news which affects our very entrails  is dead and soupes are no more you see i write in the old familiar way this is not to the minister but to the friend  however it is some mark of uncommon regard to the minister that i steal an expression from a secretary of state  i am etc  mr pope to sir william trumbull december         it was one of the enigmas of pythagoras when the winds rise worship the echo a modern writer explains this to signify  when popular tumults begin retire to solitudes or such places where ecchos are commonly found rocks woods etc i am rather of opinion it should be interpreted when rumors increase and when there is abundance of noise and clamor believe the second report this i think agrees more exactly with the echo and is the more natural application of the symbol however it be either of these precepts is extremely proper to be followed at this season and i cannot but applaud your resolution of continuing in what you call your cave in the forest this winter and preferring the noise of breaking ice to that of breaking statesmen the rage of storms to that of parties and fury and ravage of floods and tempests to the precipitancy of some and the ruin of others which i fear will be our daily prospect in london  i sincerely wish my self with you to contemplate the wonders of god in the firmament rather than the madness of man on the earth but i never had so much cause as now to complain of my poetical star that fixes me at this tumultuous time to attend the gingling of rhimes and the measuring of syllables to be almost the only trifler in the nation and as ridiculous as the poet in petronius who while all the rest in the ship were either laboring or praying for life was scratching his head in a little room to write a fine description of the tempest  you tell me you like the sound of no arms but those of achilles for my part i like them as little as the others i listed my self in the battles of homer and i am no sooner in war but like most other folks i wish my self out again  i heartily join with you in wishing quiet to our native country quiet in the state which like charity in religion is too much the perfection and happiness of either to be broken or violated on any pretense or prospect whatsoever fire and sword and fire and faggot are equally my aversion i can pray for opposite parties and for opposite religions with great sincerity i think to be a lover of ones country is a glorious elogy but i do not think it so g eat a one as to be a lover of mankind  mr j and i sometimes celebrate you under these denominations and join your health with that of the whole world a truly catholic health which far excels the poor narrowspirited ridiculous healths now in fashion to this church or that church whatever our teachers may say they must give us leave at least to wish generously these dear sir are my general dispositions but whenever i pray or wish for particulars you are one of the first in the thoughts and affections of  your etc  sir w trumbulls answer jan          i should be ashamed of my long idleness in not acknowledging your kind advice about echo and your most ingenious explanation of it relating to popular tumults which i own to be very useful and yet give me leave to tell you that i keep my self to a shorter receipt of the same pythagoras which is silence and this i shall observe if not the whole time of his discipline yet at least till your return into this country i am obliged further to this method by the most severe weather i ever felt when though i keep as near by the fire as may be yet gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis and often i apprehend the circulation of the blood begins to be stopped i have further great losses to a poor farmer of my poor oxen  intereunt pecudes stant circumfusa pruinis corpora magna boum etc  pray comfort me if you can by telling me that your second volume of homer is not frozen for it must be expressed very poetically to say now that the presses sweat  i cannot forbear to add a piece of attifice i have been guilty of on occasion of my being obliged to congratulate the birthday of a friend of mine when finding i had no materials of my own i very frankly sent him your imitation of martials epigram on antonius primus jam numerat placido felix antonius aevo etc sir william trumbull was born at easthampsted in berkshire he was fellow of all souls college in oxford followed the study of the civil law and was sent by king charles the second judgeadvocate to tangier thence envoy to florence turin etc and in his way back envoy extraordinary to france from thence sent by king james the second ambassador to the ottoman port afterward he was made lord of the treasury then secretary of state with the duke of shrewsbury which office he resigned in      he retired to easthamsted in windsor forest and died in the place of his nativity in december      aged    years our author celebrated that retirement in his poem on the forest and addressed to him his first pastoral at    years of age  this has been applauded so much that i am in danger of commencing poet perhaps laureat pray desire my good friend mr row to enter a caveat provided you will further increase my stock in this bank in which proceeding i have laid the foundation of my estate and as honestly as many others have begun theirs but now being a little tender as young beginners often are i offer to you for i have concealed the true author whether you will give me orders to declare who is the father of this fine child or not whatever you determine my fingers pen and ink are so frozen that i cannot thank you more at large you will forgive this and all other faults of dear sir  your etc  to mr jervas in ireland july        though as you rightly remark i pay my tax but once in half a year yet you shall see by this lettet upon the neck of my last that i pay a double tax as we nonjurors ought to do your acquaintance on this side the sea are under terrible apprehensions from your long stay in ireland that you may grow too polite for them for we think since the great success of so damnd a play as the nonjuror that politeness is gone over the water but others are of opinion it has been longer among you and was introduced much about the same time with frogs and with equal success poor poetry the little that is left of it here longs to cross the seas and leave eusden in full and peaceable possession of the british laurel and we begin to wish you had the singing of our poets as well as the croaking of our frogs to yourselves in saecula seculorum it would be well in exchange if parnelle and two or three more of your swans would come hither especially that swan who like a true modern one does not sing at all dr swist i am like the rest of the world a sufferer by his idleness indeed i hate that any man should be idle while i must translate and comment and i may the more sincerely wish for good poetry from others because i am become a person out of the question for a translator is no more a poet than a tailor is a man  you are doubtless persuaded of the validity of that famous verse it is expectation makes a blessing dear but why would you make your friends fonder of you than they are there is no manner of need of it  we begin to expect you no more than antichrist a man that has absented himself so long from his friends ought to be put into the gazette  every body here has great need of you many faces have died for ever for want of your pencil and blooming ladies have withered in expecting your return even frank and betty that constant pair cannot console themselves for your absence i fancy they will be forced to make their own picture in a pretty babe before you come home t will be a noble subject for a family piece come then and having peopled ireland with a world of beautiful shadows come to us and see with that eye which like the eye of the world creates beauties by looking on them see i say how england has altered the airs of all its heads in your absence and with what sneaking city attitudes our most celebrated personages appear in the mere mortal works of our painters  mr fortescue is much yours gay commemorates you and lastly to climb by just steps and degrees my lord burlington desires you may be put in mind of him his gardens flourish his strutures rise his pictures arrive and what is far nobler and more valuable than all his own good qualities daily extend themselves to all about him whereof i the meanest next to some italian chemists fiddlers bricklayers and operamakers am a living instance  to the same nov         if i had not done my utmost to lead my life so pleasantly as to forget all misfortunes i should tell you i reckoned your absence no small one but i hope you have also had many good and pleasant reasons to forget your friends on this side the world if a wish could transport me to you and your present companions i coild do the same dr swift i believe is a very good landlord and a cheerful host at his own table i suppose he has perfectly learned himself what he has taught so many others rupta non insanire lagena else he would not make a proper host for your humble servant who you know though he drinks a glass as seldom as any man contrives to break one as often but it is a consolation to me that i can do this and many other enormities under my own roof  but that you and i are upon equal terms of all friendly laziness and have taken an inviolable oath to each other always to do what we will i should reproach you for so long a silence the best amends you can make for saying nothing to me is by saying all the good you can of me which is that i heartily love and esteem the dean and dr parnelle  gay is yours and theirs his spirit is awakened very much in the cause of the dean which has broke forth in a courageous couplet or two upon sir richard bl he has printed it with his name to it and bravely assigns no other reason than that the said sir richard has abused dr swift i have also suffered in the like cause and shall suffer more unless parnelle sends me his zoilus and bookworm which the bishop of clogher i hear greatly extols it will be shortly concurrere bellum atque virum  i love you all as much as i despise most wits in this dull country irelnd has turned the tables upon england and if i have no poetical friend in my own nation i will be as proud as scipio and say since i am reduced to skin and bone ingrata patria ne ossa quidem habeas  to the same nov         that you have not heard from me of late ascribe not to the usual laziness of your correspondent but to a ramble to oxford where your name is mentioned with honor even in a land flowing with tories i had the good fortune there to be often in the conversation of doctor clarke he entertained me with several drawings and particularly with the original designs of inigo joness whitehall i there saw and reverenced some of your first pieces which future painters are to look upon as we poets do on the culex of virgil and batrachom of homer  having named this latter piece give me leave to ask what is become of dr parnelle and his frogs oblitusque meorum obliviscendus and illis might be horaces wish but will never be mine while i have such meorums as dr parnelle and dr swift i hope the spring will restore you to us and with you all the beauties and colors of nature not but i congratulate you on the pleasure you must take in being admired in your own country which so seldom happens to prophets and poets but in this you have the advantage of poets you are master of an art that must prosper and grow rich as long as people love or are proud of themselves or their own persons however you have stayed long enough methinks to have painted all the numberless histories of old ogygiae if you have begun to be historical i recommend to your hand the story which every pious irishman ought to begin with that of st patrick to the end you may be obliged as dr p was when he translated the batrachomuomachia to come into england to copy the frogs and such other vermin as were never seen in that land since the time of that confessor  i long to see you a history painter you have already done enough for the private do something for the public and be not confined like the rest to draw only such silly stories as our own faces tell of us the ancients too expect you should do them right those statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble ideas demand it as a piece of gratitude from you to make them truly known to all nations in the account you intend to write of their characters i hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble design  as to your enquiry about your house when i come within the walls they put me in mind of those of carthage where your friend like the wandering trojan animunt pictura pascit inani for the spacious mansion like a turkish caravanserah entertains the vagabond with only bare lodging i rule the family very ill keep bad hours and lend out your pictures about the town see what it is to have a poet in your house frank indeed does all he can in such a circumstance for considering he has a wild beast in it he constantly keeps the door chained every time it is opened the links rattle the rusty hinges roar the house seems so sensible that you are its support that it is ready to drop in your absence but i still trust my self under its roof as depending that providence will preserve so many raphaels titians and guidos as are lodged in your cabinet surely the sins of one poet can hardly be so heavy as to bring an old house over the heads of so many painters in a word your house is falling but what of that i am only a lodger  mr secretary craggs to mr pope paris sept        last post brought me the favor of your letter of the  0th aug o s it would be taking too much upon me to decide that twas a witty one i never pretend to more judgment than to know what pleases me and can assure you it was a very agreeable one the proof i can give you of my sincerity in this opinion is that i hope and desire you would not stop at this but continue more of them  i am in a place where pleasure is continually flowing the princes set the example and the subjects follow at a distance the ladies are of all parties by which means the conversation of the men is very much softened and fashioned from those blunt disputes on politics and rough jests we are so guilty of while the freedom of the women takes away all formality and constraint i must own at the same time these beauties are a little too artificial for my taste you have seen a french picture the original is more painted and such a crust of powder and essence in their hair that you can see no difference between black and red by disusing stays and indulging themselves at table they are run out of all shape but as to that they may give a good reason they prefer convenience to parade and are by this means as ready as they are generally willing to be charitable  i am surpised to find i have wrote so much scandal i fancy i am either setting up for a wit or imagine i must write in this style to a wit i hope you will prove a good natured one and not only let me hear from you sometimes but forgive the small encouragement you meet with if you will complete your favors pray give my humble services to lords wck st and hy i have had my hopes and fears they would have abused me before this time i am sure it is not my business to meddle with a nest of bees i speak only of the honey i will not trouble my self to finish finely a true compliment is better than a good one and i can assure you without any that i am very sincerely  sir yours etc  the revd dean afterward bishop of cloyne in ireland a celebrated metaphysician author of the dialogues of hylas and philonuses the minute philosopher etc berkley to mr pope naples oct    ns      i have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a letter but was discouraged for want of something that i could think worth sending fifteen hundred miles italy is such an exhausted subject that i dare say you would easily forgive my saying nothing of it and the imagination of a poet is a thing so nice and delicate that it is no easy matter to find out images capable of giving pleasure to one of the few who in any age have come up to that character i am nevertheless lately returned from an island where i passed three or four months which were it set out in its true colors might methinks amuse you agreeably enough for a minute or two the island inarime is an epitome of the whole earth containing within the compass of eighteen miles a wonderful variety of hills vales ragged rocks fruitful plains and barren mountains all thrown together in a most romantic confusion the air is in the hottest season constantly refreshed by cool breezes from the sea the vales produce excellent wheat and indian corn but are mostly covered with vineyards intermixed with fruit trees besides the common kinds as cherries apricots peaches etc they produce oranges limes almonds pomegranates figs water melons and many other fruits unknown to our climates which lie every where open to the passenger the hills are the greater part covered to the top with vines some with chestnut groves and others with thickets of myrtle and lentiscus the fields in the northern side are divided by hedgerows of myrtle several fountains and rivulets add to the beauty of this landscape which is likewise set off by the variety of some barren spots and naked rocks but that which crowns the scene is a large mountain rising out of the middle of the island once a terrible volcano by the ancients called mons epomeus its lower parts are adorned with vines and other fruits the middle affords pasture to flocks of goats and sheep and the top is a sandy pointed rock from which you have the finest prospect in the world surveying at one view besides several pleasant islands lying at your feet a tract of italy about three hundred miles in length from the promontory of antium to the cape of palinurus the greater part of which has been sung by homer and virgil as making a considerable part of the travels and adventures of their two heroes the islands caprea prochyta and parthenope together with cajeta cumae monte miseno the habitations of circe the sirens and the lestrygones the bay of naples the promontory of minerva and the whole campagnia felice make but a part of this noble landscape which would demand an imagination as warm and numbers as flowing as your own to describe it the inhabitants of this delicious isle as they are without riches and honors so are they without the vices and follies that attend them and were they but as much strangers to revenge as they are to avarice or ambition they might in fact answer the poetical notions of the golden age but they have got as an alloy to their happiness an ill habit of murdering one another on slight offenses we had an instance of this the second night after our arrival a youth of eighteen being shot dead by our door and yet by the sole secret of minding our own business we found a means of living securely among these dangerous people would you know how we pass the time at naples our chief entertainment is the devotion of our neighbors besides the gayety of their churches where folks go to see what they call una bella devotione i e a sort of religious opera they make fireworks almost every week out of devotion the streets are often hung with arras out of devotion and what is still more strange the ladies invite gentlemen to their houses and treat them with music and sweetmeats out of devotion in a word were it not for this devotion of its inhabitants naples would have little else to recommend it beside the air and situation learning is in no very thriving state here as indeed no where else in italy however among many pretenders some men of taste are to be met with a friend of mine told me not long since that being to visit salvini at florence he found him reading your homer he liked the notes extremely and could find no other fault with the version but that he thought it approached too near a paraphrase which shows him not to be sufficiently acquainted with our language i wish you health to go on with that noble work and when you have that i need not wish you success you will do me the justice to believe that whatever relates to your welfare is sincerely wished by  yours etc  mr pope to  dec         the old project of a window in the bosom to render the soul of man visible is what every honest friend has manifold reason to wish for yet even that would not do in our case while you are so far separated from me and so long i begin to fear you will die in ireland and that the denunciation will be fulfilled upon you hibernus es and in hiberniam reverteris  i should be apt to think you in sanchos case some duke has made you governor of an island or wet place and you are administering laws to the wild irsh but i must own when you talk of building and planting you touch my string and i am as apt to pardon you as the fellow that thought himself jupiter would have pardoned the other madman who called himself his brother neptune alas sir do you know whom you talk to one that had been a poet was degraded to a translator and at last through mere dullness is turned an architect you know martials censure  praeconem facito vel architectum however i have one way left to plan to elevate and to surprise as bays says the next you may expect to hear is that i am in debt  the history of my transplantation and settlement which you desire would require a volume were i to enumerate the many projects difficulties vicissitudes and various fates attending that important part of my life much more should i describe the many draughts elevations profiles perspectives etc of every palace and garden proposed intended and happily raised by the strength of that faculty wherein all great geniuss excel imagination at last the gods and fate have fixed me on the borders of the thames in the districts of richmond and twickenham it is here i have past an entire year of my life without any fixed abode in london or more than casting a transitory glance for a day or two at most in a month on the pomps of the town it is here i hope to receive you sir returned in triumph from eternizing the ireland of this age for you my structures rise for you my colonades extend their wings for you my groves aspire and roses bloom and to say truth i hope posterity which no doubt will be made acquainted with all there things will look upon it as one of the principal motives of my architecture that it was a mansion prepared to receive you against your own should fall to dust which is destined to be the tomb of poor  and  and the immortal monument of the fidelity of two such servants who have excelled in constancy the very rats of your family  what more can i tell you of myself so much and yet all put together so little that i scarce care or know how to do it but the very reasons that are against putting it upon paper are as strong for telling it you in person and i am uneasy to be so long denied the satisfaction of it  at present i consider you bound in by the irish sea like the ghosts in virgil  tristi palus inamabilis unda alligat and novies styx circumfusa coercet and i cannot express how i long to renew our old intercourse and conversation our morning conferences in bed in the same room our evening walks in the park our amusing voyages on the water our philosophical suppers our lectures our dissertations our gravities our reveries our fooleries our what not  this awakens the memory of some of those who have made a part in all these poor parnelle garth row you justly reprove me for not speaking of the death of the last parnelle was too much in my mind to whose memory i am erecting the best monument i can what he gave me to publish was but a small part of what he left behind him but it was the best and i will not make it worse by enlarging it i would fain know if he be buried at chester or dublin and what care has been or is to be taken for his monument etc yet i have not neglected my devoirs to mr row i am writing this very day his epitaph for westminsterabbeyafter these the best natured of men sir samuel garth has left me in the truest concern for his loss his death was very heroical and yet unaffected enough to have made a saint or a philosopher famous but ill tongues and worse hearts have branded even his last moments as wrongfully as they did his life with irreligion you must have heard many tales on this subject but if ever there was a good christian without knowing himself to be so it was dr garth  i am etc  letters to the honorable robert digby from mr pope letters to the honorable robert digby from mr pope to the honorable robert digby chiswick jan        dear sir i had pleased myself sooner in writing to you but that i have been your successor in a fit of sickness and am not yet so much recovered but that i have thoughts of using your asses physicians they are as grave persons as any of the faculty and like the ancients carry their own medicaments about with them but indeed the moderns are such lovers of raillery that nothing is grave enough to escape them let em laugh but people will sill have their opinions as they think our doctors asses to them well think them asses to our doctors  i am glad you are so much in a better state of health as to allow me to jest about it my concern when i heard of your danger was so very serious that i almost take it ill dr evans should tell you of it or you mention it i tell you fairly if you and a few more such people were to leave the world i would not give sixpence to stay in it  i am not so much concerned as to the point whether you are to live fat or lean most men of wit or honesty are usually decreed to live very lean so i am inclined to the opinion that it is decreed you shall however be comforted and reflect that you will make the better busto for it  it is something particular in you not to be satisfied with sending me your own books but to make your acquaintance continue the frolic mr wharton forced me to take gorboduc which has since done me great credit with several people as it has done dryden and oldham some diskindness in showing there is as much difference between their gorbuduc and this as between queen anne and king george it is truly a scandal that men should write with contempt of a piece which they never once saw as those two poets did who were ignorant even of the sex as well as sense of gorboduc  adieu i am going to forget you this minute you took up all my mind the next i shall think of nothing but the terms of agamemnon and the recovery of briseis i shall be achilless humble servant these two months with the good leave of all my friends i have no ambition so strong at present as that noble one of sir salathiel lovel recorder of london to furnish out a decent and plentiful execution of greeks and trojans  it is not to be expressed how heartily i wish the death of all homers heroes one after another the lord preserve me in the day of battle which is just approaching dear sir join in your prayers for me and know me to be always whether i live die or am damned as a poet  yours most faithfully  to the same london march         dear sir to convince you how little pain i give myself in corresponding with men of good nature and good understanding you see i omit to answer your letters till a time when another man would be ashamed to own he had received them if therefore you are ever moved on my account by that spirit which i take to be as samiliar to you as a quotidian ague i mean the spirit of goodness pray never stint it in any fear of obliging me to a civility beyond my natural inclination i dare trust you sir not only with my folly when i write but with my negligence when i do not and expect equally your pardon for either  if i knew how to entertain you through the rest of this paper it should be spotted and diversified with conceits all over you should be put out of breath with laughter at each sentence and pause at each period to look back over how much wit you had passed but i have found by experience that people now adays regard writing as little as they do preaching the most we can hope is to be heard just with decency and patience once a week by folks in the country here in town we hum over a piece of fine writing and we whistle at a sermon the stage is the only place we seem alive at there indeed we stare and roar and clap hands for k george and the government as for all other virtues but this loyalty they are an obsolete train so illdressd that men women and children hiss em out of all good company humility knocks so sneakingly at the door that every footman outraps it and makes it give way to the free entrance of pride prodigality and vainglory  my lady scudamore from having rusticated in your company too long really behaves herself scandalously amongst us she pretends to open her eyes for the sake of seeing the sun and to sleep because it is night drinks tea at nine in the morning and is thought to have said her prayers before talks without any manner of shame of good books and has not seen cibbers play of the nonjuror i rejoiced the other day to see a libel on her toilette which gives me some hope that you have at least a taste of scandal left you in defect of all other vices  upon the whole matter i heartily wish you well but as i cannot entirely desire the ruin of all the joys of this city so all that remains is to wish you would keep your happiness to yourselves that the happiest here may not die with envy at a bliss which they cannot attain to  i am etc  to the same may      0 dear sir you will think me very full of my self when after a long silence which however to say truth has rather been employed to contemplate of you than to forget you i begin to talk of my own works i find it is in the finishing a book as in concluding a session of parliament one alwas thinks it will be very soon and finds it very late there are many unlookdfor incidents to retard the clearing any public account and so i see it is in mine i have plagued my self like great ministers with undertaking too much for one man and with a desire of doing more than was expected from me have done less than i ought  for having designed four very laborious and uncommon sorts of indexes to homer i am forced for want of time to publish two only the design of which you will own to be pretty though far from being fully executed i have also been obliged to leave unfinished in my desk the heads of two essays one on the theology and morality of homer and another on the oratory of homer and virgil so they must wait for future editions or perish and one way or other no great matter which dabit deus his quoque finem  i think of you every day i assire you even without such good memorials of you as your sisters with whom i sometimes talk of you and find it one of the most agreeable of all subjects to them my lord digby must be perpetually remembered by all who ever knew him or knew his children there needs no more than an acquaintance with your family to make all elder sons wish they had fathers to their lives end  i cannot touch upon the subject of filial love without putting you in mind of an old woman who has a sincere hearty oldfashiond respect for you and constantly blames her son for not having writ to you oftener to tell you so  i very much wish but what signifies my wishing my lady scudamore wishes your sisters wish that you were with us to compare the beautiful contraste this season affords us of the town and the country no ideas you could form in the winter can make you imagine what twickenham is and what your friend mr johnson of twickenham is in this warmer season our river glitters beneath an unclouded sun at the same time that its banks retain the verdure of showers our gardens are offering their first nosegays our trees like new acquaintance brought happily together are stretching their arms to meet each other and growing nearer and nearer every hour the birds are paying their thanksgiving songs for the new habitations i have made em my building rises high enough to attract the eye and curiosity of the passenger from the river where upon beholding a mixture of beauty and ruin he enquires what house is falling or what church is rising so little taste have our common tritons of vitruvius whatever delight the true unseen poetical gods of the river may take in reflecting on their streams my tuscan porticos or ionic pilasters  but to descend from all this pomp of style the best account i can give of what i am building is that it will afford me a few pleasant rooms for such a friend as yourself or a cool situation for an hour or two for lady scudamore when she will do me the honor at this public house on the road to drink her own cider  the moment i am writing this i am surprised with the account of the death of a friend of mine which makes all i have here been talking of a mere jest buildings gardens writings pleasures works of whatever stuff man can raise none of them god knows capable of advantaging a creature that is mortal or of satisfying a soul that is immortal dear sir i am  your most faithful servant  to the same july  0    0 your kind desire to know the state of my health had not been unsatisfied so long had not that ill state been the impediment nor should i have seemed an unconcerned party in the joys of your family which i heard of from lady scudamore whose short escbantillon of a letter of a quarter of a page i value as the short glimpse of a vision afforded to some devout hermit for it includes as those revelations do a promise of a better life in the elysian groves of cirencester whither i could almost say in the style of a sermon the lord bring us all etc thither may we tend by various ways to one blisful bower thither may health peace and good humor wait upon us as associates thither may whole cargoes of nectar liquor of life and longaevity by mortals called spawwater be conveyed and there as milton has it may we like the deities on flowers reposd and with fresh garlands crowned quaff immortality and joy    when i speak of garlands i should not forget the green vestments and scarfs which your sisters promised to make for this purpose i expect you too in green with a huntinghorn by your side and a green hat the model of which you may take from osbornes description of king james the first  what words what numbers what oratory or what poetry can suffice to express how infinitely i esteem value love and desire you all above all the great ones the rich ones and the vain ones of this part of the world above all the jews jobbers bubblers subscribers projectors directors governors treasurers etc etc etc etc in saecula saeculorum  turn your eyes and attention from this miserable mercenary period and turn yourself in a just contempt of these sons of mammon to the contemplation of books gardens and marriage in which i now leave you and return wretch that i am to water gruel and palladio  i am etc  to the same twickenham sept   dear sir your doctor is going to the bath and stays a fortnight or more perhaps you would be comforted to have a sight of him whether you need him or not i think him as good a doctor as any for one that is ill and a better doctor than any one for one that is well he would do admirably for mrs mary digby she needed only to follow his hints to be in eternal business and amusement of mind and even as active as she could desire but indeed i fear she would outwalk him for as dean swift observed to me the very first time i saw the doctor he is a man that can do every thing but walk his brother who is lately come into england goes also to the bath and is a more extraordinary man than he worth your going thither on purpose to know him the spirit of philanthropy so long dead to our world is revived in him he is a philosopher all of fire so warmly nay so wildly in the right that he forces all others about him to be so too and draws them into his own vortex he is a star that looks as if it were all fire but is all benignity all gentle and beneficial influence if there be other men in the world that would serve a friend yet he is the only one i believe that could make even an enemy serve a friend  as all human life is checkered and mixed with acquisitions and losses though the latter are more certain and irremediable than the former lasting or satisfactory so at the time i have gained the acquaintance of one worthy man i have lost another a very easy humane and gentlemanly neighbor mr stonor it is certain the loss of one of this character puts us naturally upon setting a greater value on the few that are left though the degree of our esteem may be different nothing says seneca is so melancholy a circumstance in human life or so soon reconciles us to the thought of our own death as the reflection and prospect of one friend after another dropping round us who would stand alone the sole remaining ruin the last tottering column of all the fabric of friendship once so large seemingly so strong and yet so suddenly sunk and buried  i am etc  to the same saturday night dear sir i have belief enough in the goodness of your whole family to think you will all be pleased that i am arrived in safety at twickenham though it is a sort of earnest that you will be troubled again with me at sherborne or coleshill for however i may like one of your places it may be in that as in liking one of your family when one sees the rest one likes them all pray make my services acceptable to them i wish them all the happiness they may want and the continuance of all the happiness they have and i take the latter to comprize a great deal more than the former i must separate lady scudamore from you as i fear she will do herself before this letter reaches you so i wish her a good journey and i hope one day to try if she lives as well as you do though i much question if she can live as quietly i suspect the bells will be ringing at her arrival and on her own and miss scudamores birthdays and that all the clergy in the county come to pay respects both the clergy and their bells expecting from her and from the young lady further business and further employment besides all this there dwells on the one side of her the lord coningsby and on the other mr w yet i shall when the days and the years come about adventure upon all this for her sake  i beg my lord digby to think me a better man than to content myself with thanking him in the common way i am in as sincere a sense of the word his servant as you are his son or he your father  i must in my turn insist upon hearing how my last fellowtravellers got home from clarendon and desire mr philips to remember me in his cider and to tell mr w that i am dead and buried  i wish the young ladies who i almost robbed of their good name a better name in return even that very name to each of them which they like best for the sake of the man that bears it  your ever faithful and affectionate servant  to the same      your making a sort of apology for your not writing is a very genteel reproof to me i know i was to blame but i know i did not intend to be so and what is the happiest knowledge in the world i know you will forgive me for sure nothing is more satisfactory than to be certain of such a friend as will overlook ones failings since every such instance is a conviction of his kindness  if i am all my life to dwell in intentions and never rise to actions i have but too much need of that gentle disposition which i experience in you but i hope better things of myself and fully purpose to make you a visit this summer at sherbourn i am told you are all upon removal very speedily and that mrs mary digby talks in a letter to lady scudamore of seeing my lord bathursts wood in her way how much i wish to be her guide through that enchanted forest is not to be expressed i look upon myself as the magician appropriated to the place without whom no mortal can penetrate into the recesses of those sacred shades i could pass whole days in only describing to her the future and as yet visionary beauties that are to rise in those scenes the palace that is to be built the pavillions that are to glitter the colonnades that are to adorn them nay more the meeting of the thames and the severn which when the noble owner has finer dreams than ordinary are to be led into each others embraces through secret caverns of not above twelve or fifteen miles till they rise and openly celebrate their marriage in the midst of an immense amphitheatre which is to be the admiration of posterity a hundred years hence but till the destined time shall arrive that is to manifest these wonders mrs digby must content herself with seeing what is at present no more than the finest wood in england  the objects that attract this part of the world are of a quite different nature women of quality are all turned followers of the camp in hydepark this year whither all the town resort to magnificent entertainments given by the officers etc the scythian ladies that dwelt in the wagons of war were not more closely attached to the luggage the matrons like those of sparta attend their sons to the field to be the witnesses of their glorious deeds and the maidens with all their charms displayed provoke the spirit of the soldiers tea and coffee supply the place of lacedemonian black broth this camp seems crowned with perpetual victory for every sun that rises in the thunder of cannon sets in the music of violins nothing is yet wanting but the constant presence of the princess to represent the matter exercitus  at twickenham the world goes otherwise there are certain old people who take up all my time and will hardly allow me to keep any other company they were introduced here by a man of their own sort who has made me perfectly rude to all my contemporaries and will not so much as suffer me to look upon em the person i complain of is the bishop of rochester yet he allows me from something he has heard of your character and that of your family as if you were of the old sect of moralists to write three or four sides of paper to you and to tell you what these sort of people never tell but with truth and religious sincerity that i am and ever will be  dear sir yours etc  to the same the same reason that hindered your writing hindered mine the pleasing expectation to see you in town indeed since the willing confinement i have lain under here with my mother whom it is natural and reasonable i should rejoice with as well as grieve i could the better bear your absence from london for i could hardly have seen you there and it would not have been quite reasonable to have drawn you to a sick room hither from the first embraces of your friends my mother is now i thank god wonderfully recovered though not so much as yet to venture out of her chamber yet enough to enjoy a few particular friends when they have the good nature to look upon her i may recommend to you the room we sit in upon one and that a favorite account that it is the very warmest in the house we and our fire will equally smile upon your face there is a persian proverb that says i think very prettily the conversation of a friend brightens the eyes this i take to be a splendour still more agreeable than the fires you so delightfully describe  that you may long enjoy your own fireside in the metaphorical sense that is all those of your family who make it pleasing to fit and spend whole wintry months together a far more rational delight and better felt by an honest heart than all the glaring entertainments numerous lights and false splendors of an assembly of empty heads aching hears and false faces this is my sincere wish to you and yours  you say you propose much pleasure in seeing some few faces about town of my acquaintance i guess you mean mrs howards and mrs blounts and i assure you you ought to take as much pleasure in their hearts if they are what they sometimes express with regard to you  believe me dear sir to you all a very faithful servant  to the same october  0 dear sir i was upon the point of taking a much greater journey than to bermudas even to that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns  a fever carried me on the high gallop toward it for six or seven days  but here you have me now and that is all i shall say of it since which time an impertinent lameness kept me at home twice as long as if fate should say after the other dangerous illness you shall neither go into the other world nor any where you like in this else who knows but i had been at homlacy  i conspire in your sentiments emulate your pleasures wish for your company you are all of one heart and one soul as was said of the primitive christians it is like the kingdom of the just upon earth not a wicked wretch to interrupt you but a set of tried experienced friends and fellow comforters who have seen evil men and evil days and have by a superior rectitude of heart set yourselves above them and reap your reward why will you ever of your own accord end such a millenary year in london transmigrate if i may so call it into other creatures in that scene of folly militant when you may reign for ever at homlacy in sense and reason triumphant i appeal to a third lady in your family whom i take to be the most innocent and the least warped by idle fashion and custom of you all i appeal to her if you are not every soul of you better people better companions and happier where you are i desire her opinion under her hand in your next letter i mean miss scudamores afterward duchess of beaufort at this time about twelve years old  i am confident if she would or durst speak her sense and employ that reasoning which god has given her to infuse more thoughtfulness into you all those arguments could not fail to put you to the blush and keep you out of town like people sensible of your own felicities i am not without hopes if she can detain a parliament man and a lady of quality from the world one winter that i may come upon you with such irresistible arguments another year as may carry you all with me to bermudas about this time the rev dean berkly conceived his project of erecting a settlement in bermuda for the propagation of the christian faith and of sciences in america the seat of all earthly happiness and the new jerusalem of the righteous  dont talk of the decay of the year the season is good where the people are so it is the best time of the year for a painter there is more variety of colors in the leaves the prospects begin to open through the thinner woods over the valleys and through the high canopies of trees to the higher arch of heaven the dews of the morning impearl every thorn and scatter diamonds on the verdant mantle of the earth the frosts are fresh and wholesome what would ye have the moon shines too though not for lovers these cold nights but for astronomers  have ye not reflecting telescopes these instruments were just then brought to perfection whereby ye may innocently magnify her spots and blemishes content yourselves with them and do not come to a place where your own eyes become reflecting telescopes and where those of all others are equally such upon their neighbors stay you at least for what i have said before relates only to the ladies dont imagine i will write about any eyes but theirs stay i say from that idle busylooking sanhedrin where wisdom or no wisdom is the eternal debate not as it lately was in ireland an accidental one  if after all you will despise good advice and resolve to come to london here you will find me doing just the things i should not living where i should not and as worldly as idle in a word as much an antibermudanist as any body dear sir make the ladies know i am their servant you know i am  yours etc  to the same aug    i have been above a month strolling abour in buckinghamshire and oxfordshire from garden to garden but still returning to lord cobhams with fresh satisfation i should be sorry to see my lady scudamores till it has had the full advantage of lord bathursts improvements and then i will expect something like the waters of riskins and the woods of oakley together which without flattery would be at least as good as any thing in our world for as to the hanging gardens of babylon the paradise of cyrus and the sharawaggis of china i have little or no ideas of them but i dare say lord bt has because they were certainly both very great and very wild i hope mrs mary digby is quite tired of his lordships extravagante bergerie and that she is just now sitting or rather reclining on a bank fatigued with over much dancing and singing at his unwearied request and instigation i know your love of ease so well that you might be in danger of being too quiet to enjoy quiet and too philosophical to be a philosopher were it not for the ferment lord b will put you into one of his lordships maxims is that a total abstinence from intemperance or business is no more philosophy than a total consopition of the senses is repose one must feel enough of its contrary to have a relish of either but after all let your temper work and be as sedate and contemplative as you will i will engage you shall be fit for his lordship when you come to town in the winter folly will laugh you into all the customs of the company here nothing will be able to prevent your conversion to her but indisposition which i hope will be far from you i am telling the worst that can come of you for as to vice you are safe but folly is many an honest mans nay every goodhumored mans lot nay it is the seasoning of life and fools in one sense are the salt of the earth a little is excellent though indeed a whole mouthful is justly called the devil  so much for your diversions next winter and for mine i envy you much more at present than i shall then for if there be on earth an image of paradise it is in such perfect union and society as you all possess i would have my innocent envies and wishes of your state known to you all which is far better than making you compliments for it is inward approbation and esteem my lord digby has in me a sincere servant or would have were there any occasion for me to manifest it  to the same sept  0      dear sir i am glad your travels delighted you improve you i am sure they could not you are not so much a youth as that though you run about with a king of sixteen and what makes him still more a child a king of frenchmen my own time has been more melancholy spent in an attendance upon death which has seized one of our family my poor old nurse my mother is something better though at her advanced age every day is a climacterick there was joined to this an indisposition of my own which i ought to look upon as a slight one compared with my mothers because my life is not of half the consequence to any body that hers is to me all these incidents have hindered my more speedy reply to your obliging letter  the article you enquire of is of as little concern to me as you desire it should namely the railing papers about the odyssey if the book has merit and since you like it it must it will extinguish all such nasty scandal as the sun puts an end to stinks merely by coming out  i wish i had nothing to trouble me more an honest mind is not in the power of any dishonest one to break its peace there must be some guilt or consciousness which is inconsistent with its own principles not but malice and injustice have their day like some poor shortlived vermin that die of shooting their own stings falsehood is folly says homer and liers and calumniators at last hurt none but themselves even in this world in the next it is charity to say god have mercy on them they were the devils vicegerents upon earth who is the father of lies and i fear has a right to dispose of his children  i have had an occasion to make these reflections of late more justly than from any thing that concerns my writings for it is one that concerns my morals and which i ought to be as tender of as my own the good character of another very innocent person who i am sure shares your friendship no less than i do  no creature has better natural dispositions or would act more rightly or reasonably in every duty did she act by herself or from herself but you know it is the misfortune of that family to be governed like a ship i mean the head guided by the tail and that by every wind that blows in it  to the same december         dear sir it is now the season to wish you a good end of one year and a happy beginning of another but both these you know how to make yourself by only continuing such a life as you have been long accustomed to lead as for good works they are things i dare not name either to those that do them or to those that do them not the first are too modest and the latter too selfish to bear the mention of what are become either too oldfashioned or too private to constitute any part of the vanity or reputation of the present age however it were to be wished people would now and then look upon good works as they do upon old wardrobes merely in case any of them should by chance come into fashion again as ancient fardingales revive in modern hoopd petticoats which may be properly compared to charities as they cover a multitude of sins  they tell me that at  certain antiquated charities and obsolete devotions are yet subsisting that a thing called christian cheerfulness not incompatible with christmas pyes and plumbroth whereof frequent is the mention in old sermons and almanacks is really kept alive and in practice that feeding the hungry and giving alms to the poor do yet make a part of good housekeeping in a latitude not more remote from london than fourscore miles and lastly that prayers and roastbeef actually make some people as happy as a whore and a bottle but here in town i assure you men women and children have done with these things charity not only begins but ends at home instead of the four cardinal virtues now reign four princely ones we have cunning for prudence rapine for justice timeserving for fortitude and luxury for temperance whatever you may fancy where you live in a state of ignorance and see nothing but quiet religion and good humor the case is just as i tell you where people understand the world and know how to live with credit and glory  i wish that heaven would open the eyes of men and make em sensible which of these is right whether upon a due conviction we are to quit faction and gaming and highfeeding and whoring and take to your country way or you to leave prayers and almsgiving and reading and exercise and come into our measures i wish i say that this matter were as clear to all men as it is to  your affectionate etc  letters to the honorable edw blount esquire from mr pope letters to edw blount esquire from      to      to edward blount esquire jan           dear sir i know of nothing that will be so interessing to you at present as some circumstances of the last act of that eminent comic poet and our friend wycherly he had often told me as i doubt not he did all his acquaintance that he would marry as soon as his life was despaired of accordingly a few days before his death he underwent the ceremony and joined together those two sacraments which wise men say should be the last we receive for if you observe matrimony is placed after extreme unction in our catechism as a kind of hint of the order of time in which they are to be taken the old man then lay down satisfied in the conscience of having by this one act paid his just debts obliged a woman who he was told had merit and shown an heroic resentment of the ill usage of his next heir some hundred pounds which he had with the lady discharged those debts a jointure of four hundred a year made her a recompense and the nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could with the miserable remains of a mortgaged estate i saw our friend twice after this was done less peevish in his sickness than he used to be in his health neither much afraid of dying nor which in him had been more likely much ashamed of marrying the evening before he expired he called his young wife to the bedside and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request the last he should make upon her assurances of consenting to it he told her my dear it is only this that you will never marry an old man again i cannot help remarking that sickness which often destroys both wit and wisdom yet seldom has power to remove that talent which we call humor mr wycherley showed his even in this last compliment though i think his request a little hard for why should he bar her from doubling her jointure on the same easy terms  so trivial as these circumstances are i should not be displeased my self to know such trifles when they concern or characterise any eminent person the wisest and wittiest of men are seldom wiser or wittier than others in these sober moments at least our friend ended much in the character he had lived in and horaces rule for a play may as well be applied to him as a playwright  servetur ad imum qualis ab inceptu processerit and sibi constet   i am etc  to the same feb  0        dear sir i am just returned from the country whither mr row accompanied me and passed a week in the forest i need not tell you how much a man of his turn entertained me but i must acquaint you there is a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to him which make it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness which generally succeeds all our pleasures i have been just taking a solitary walk by moonshine full of reflections on the transitory nature of all human delights and giving my thoughts a loose in the contemplation of those satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taste in the company of separate spirits when we shall range the walks above and perhaps gaze on this world at as vast a distance as we now do on those worlds the pleasures we are to enjoy in that conversation must undoubtedly be of a nobler kind and not unlikely may proceed from the discoveries each shall communicate to another of god and of nature for the happiness of minds can surely be nothing but knowledge  the highest gratification we receive here from company is mirth which at the best is but a fluttering unquiet motion that beats about the breast for a few moments and after leaves it void and empty  keeping good company even the best is but a less shameful art of losing time  what we here call science and study are little better the greater number of arts to which we apply ourselves are mere groping in the dark and even the search of our most important concerns in a future being is but a needless anxious and uncertain haste to be knowing sooner than we can what without all this solicitude we shall know a little later we are but curious impertinents in the case of futurity it is not our business to be guessing what the state of souls shall be but to be doing what may make our own state happy we cannot be knowing but we can be virtuous  if this be my notion of a great part of that high science divinity you will be so civil as to imagine i lay no mighty stress upon the rest even of my darling poetry i really make no other use than horses of the bells that gingle about their ears though now and then they toss their heads as if they were proud of em only to jogg on a little more merrily  your observations on the narrow conceptions of mankind in the point of friendship confirm me in what i was so fortunate as at my first knowledge of you to hope and since so amply to experience let me take so much decent pride and dignity upon me as to tell you that but for opinions like these which i discovered in your mind i had never made the trial i have done which has succeeded so much to mine and i believe not less to your satisfaction for if i know you right your pleasure is greater in obliging me than i can feel on my part till it falls in my power to oblige you  your remark that the variety of opinion in politics or religion is often rather a gratification than objection to people who have sense enough to consider the beautiful order of nature in her variations makes me think you have not construed joannes secundus wrong in the verse which precedes that which you quote been nota fides as i take it does no way signify the roman catholic religion though secundus was of it i think it was a generous thought and one that flowed from an exalted mind that it was not improbable but god might be delighted with the various methods of worshipping him which divided the whole world i am pretty sure you and i should no more make good inquisitors to the modern tyrants in faith than we could have been qualified for lictors to procrustes when he converted refractory members with the rack in a word i can only repeat to you what i think i have formerly said that i as little fear god will damn a man who has charity as i hope that any priest cans save him without it  i am etc  to the same march  0        dear sir i find that a real concern is not only a hindrance to speaking but to writing too the more time we give our selves to think over ones own or a friends unhappiness the more unable we grow to express the grief that proceeds from it it is as natural to delay a letter at such a season as this as to retard a melancholy visit to a person one cannot relieve one is ashamed in that circumstance to pretend to entertain people with trifling insignificant affectations of sorrow on the one hand or unseasonable and forced gayeties on the other it is a kind of profanation of things sacred to treat so solemn a matter as a generous voluntary suffering with compliments or heroic gallantries such a mind as yours has no need of being spirited up into honor or like a weak woman praised into an opinion of its own virtue it is enough to do and suffer what we ought and men should know that the noble power of suffering bravely is as far above that of enterprizing greatly as an unblemished conscience and inflexible resolution are above an accidential flow of spirits or a sudden tide of blood if the whole religious business of mankind be included in resignation to our maker and charity to our fellow creatures there are now some people who give us the opportunity of affording as bright an example in practicing the one as themselves have given an infamous instance of the violation of the other whoever is really brave has always this comfort when he is oppressed that he knows himself to be superior to those who injure him for the greatest power on earth can no sooner do him that injury but the brave man can make himself greater by forgiving it  if it were generous to seek for alleviating consolations in a calamity of so much glory one might say that to be ruined thus in the gross with a whole people is but like perishing in the general conflagration where nothing we can value is left behind us  methinks in our present condition the most heroic thing we are left capable of doing is to endeavor to lighten each others load and oppressed as we are to succor such as are yet more oppressed if there are too many who cannot be assisted but by what we cannot give our money there are yet others who may be relieved by our counsel by our countenance and even by our cheerfulness the misfortunes of private families the misunderstandings of people whom distresses make suspicious the coldnesses of relations whom change of religion may disunite or the necessities of halfruind estates render unkind to each other these at least may be softened in some degrees by a general wellmanagd humanity among ourselves if all those who have your principles of belief had also your sense and conduct but indeed most of em have given lamentable this was written in the year of the affair of preston proofs of the contrary and it is to be apprehended that they who want sense are only religious through weakness and goodnatured through shame these are narrowminded creatures that never deal in essentials their faith never looks beyond ceremonials nor their charity beyond relations as poor as i am i would gladly relieve any distressed conscientious french refugee at this instant what must my concern then be when i perceive so many anxieties now tearing those hearts which i have desired a place in and clouds of melancholy rising on those faces which i have long looked upon with affection i begin already to feel both what some apprehend and what others are yet too stupid to apprehend i grieve with the old for so many additional incoveniencies and chagrins more than their small remain of life seemed destined to undergo and with the young for so many of those gayeties and pleasures the portion of youth which they will by this means be deprived of this brings into my mind one or other of those i love best and among them the widow and fatherless late of  as i am certain no people living had an earlier and truer sense of others misfortunes or a more generous resignation as to what might be their own so i earnestly wish that whatever part they must bear may be rendered as supportable to them as it is in the power of any friend to make it  but i know you have prevented me in this thought as you always will any thing that is good or generous i find by a letter of your ladys which i have seen that their ease and tranquillity is part of your care i believe there is some fatality in it that you should always from time to time be doing those particular things that make me enamored of you  i write this from windsor forest of which i am come to take my last look we here bid our neighbors adieu much as those who go to be hanged do their fellow prisoners who are condemned to follow them a few weeks after i parted from honest mr d with tenderness and from old sir william trumball as from a venerable prophet foretelling with lifted hands the miseries to come from which he is just going to be removed himself  perhaps now i have learnt so far as  nos dulcia linquimus arva  my next lesson may be nos patriam fugimus   let that and all else be as heaven pleases i have provided just enough to keep me a man of honor i believe you and i shall never be ashamed of each other i know i wish my country well and if it undoes me it shall not make me wish it otherwise  to the same june         dear sir if a regard both to public and private affairs may plead a lawful excuse in behalf of a negligent correspondent i have really a very good title to it i cannot say whether it is a felicity or unhappiness that i am obliged at this time to give up my whole application to homer when without that employment my thoughts must turn upon what is less agreeable the violence madness and resentment of modern warmakers which are likely to prove to some people at least more fatal than the same qualities in achilles did to his unfortunate countrymen  though the change of my scene of life from windsor forest to the side of the thames be one of the grand aeras of my days and may be called a notable period in so inconsiderable a history yet you can scarce imagine any hero passing from one stage of life to another with so much tranquillity so easy a transition and so laudable a behavior i am become so truly a citizen of the world according to platos expression that i look with equal indifference on what i have lost and on what i have gained the times and amusements past are not more like a dream to me than those which are present i lie in a refreshing kind of inaction and have one comfort at least from obscurity that the darkness helps me to sleep the better i now and then reflect upon the enjoyment of my friends whom i fancy i remember much as separate spirits do us at tender intervals neither interrupting their own employments nor altogether careless of ours but in general constantly wishing us well and hoping to have us one day in their company  to grow indifferent to the world is to grow philosophical or religious whichsoever of those turns we chance to take and indeed the world is such a thing as one that thinks pretty much must either laugh at or be angry with but if we laugh at it they say we are proud and if we are angry with it they say we are illnaturd so the most politic way is to seem always better pleased than one can be greater admirers greater lovers and in short greater fools than we really are so shall we live comfortably with our families quietly with our neighbors favored by our masters and happy with our mistresses i have filled my paper and so adieu  to the same sept        dear sir i think your leaving england was like a good mans leaving the world with the blessed conscience of having acted well in it and i hope you have received your reward in being happy where you are i believe in the religious country you now inhabit you will be better pleased to find i consider you in this light than if i compared you to those greeks and romans whose constancy in suffering pain and whose resolution in pursuit of a generous end you would rather imitate than boast of  but i had a melancholy hint the other day as if you were yet a martyr to the fatigue your virtue made you undergo on this side the water i beg if your health be restored to you not to deny me the joy of knowing it your endeavors of service and good advices to the poor papists put me in mind of noahs preaching forty years to those folks that were to be drowned at last at the worst i heartily wish your ark may find an ararat and the wife and family the hopes of the good patriarch land safely after the deluge upon the shore of totness  if i durst mix profane with sacred history i would cheer you with the old tale of brutus the wandering trojan who found on that very coast the happy end of his peregrinations and adventures  i have very lately read jeffery of monmouth to whom your cornwall is not a little beholden in the translation of a clergyman in my neighborhood the poor man is highly concerned to vindicate jefferys veracity as an historian and told me he was perfectly astonished we of the roman communion could doubt of the legends of his giants while we believe those of our saints i am forced to make a fair composition with him and by crediting some of the wonders of corinaeus and gogmagog have brought him so far already that he speaks respectfully of st christophers carrying christ and the resuscitation of st nicholas tolentines chickens thus we proceed apace in converting each other from all manner of infidelity  ajax and hector are no more compared to corinaeus and arthur than the guelphs and ghibellines were to the mohocks of everdreadful memory this amazing writer has made me lay aside homer for a week and when i take him up again i shall be very well prepared to translate with belief and reverence the speech of achilless horse  you will excuse all this trifling or any thing else which prevents a sheet full of compliment and believe there is nothing more true even more true than any thing in jeffery is false than that i have a constant affection for you and am etc  p s i know you will take part in rejoicing for the victory of prince eugene over the turks in the zeal you bear to the christian interest though your cousin of oxford with whom i dined yesterday says there is no other difference in the christians beating the turks or the turks beating the christians than whether the emperor shall first declare war against spain or spain declare it against the emperor i must add another apothegm of the same noble earl it was the saying of a politic prince time and he would get the better of any two others to which lord oxford made this answer time and i against any two chance and in against time and you     to the same nov         dear sir the question you proposed to me is what at present i am the most unfit man in the world to answer by my loss of one of the best of fathers  he had lived in such a course of temperance as was enough to make the longest life agreeable to him and in such a course of piety as sufficed to make the most sudden death so also sudden indeed it was however i heartily beg of god to give me such an one provided i can lead such a life i leave him to the mercy of god and to the piety of a religion that extends beyond the grave si qua est ea cura etc  he has left me to the ticklish management of a narrow fortune where every false step is dangerous my mother is in that dispirited state of resignation which is the effect of long life and the loss of what is dear to us we are really each of us in want of a friend of such an humane turn as yourself to make almost any thing desirable to us i feel your absence more than ever at the same time i can less express my regards to you than ever and shall make this which is the most sincere letter i ever writ to you the shortest and faintest perhaps of any you have received it is enough if you reflect that barely to remember any person when ones mind is taken up with a sensible sorrow is a great degree of friendship i can say no more but that i love you and all that are yours and that i wish it may be very long before any of yours shall feel for you what i now feel for my father adieu  to the same rentcomb in gloucestershire oct        dear sir your kind letter has overtaken me here for i have been in and about this country ever since your departure i am pleased to date this from a place so well known to mrs blount where i write as if i were dictated by her ancestors whose faces are all upon me i fear none so much as sir christopher guise who being in his shirt seems as ready to combat me as her own sir john was to demolish duke lancastere i date say your lady will recollect his figure i looked upon the mansion walls and terraces the plantations and slopes which nature has made to command a variety of valleys and rising woods with a veneration mixed with a pleasure that represented her to me in those puerile amusements which engaged her so many years ago in this place i fancied i saw her sober over a sampler or gay over a joynted baby i dare say she did one thing more even in those early times remembered her creator in the days of her youth  you describe so well your hermitical state of life that none of the ancient anchorites could go beyond you for a cave in a rock with a fine spring or any of the accommodations that befit a solitary only i dont remember to have read that any of those venerable and holy personages took with them a lady and begat sons and daughters you must modestly be content to be accounted a patriarch but were you a little younger i should rather rank you with sir amadis and his fellows if piety be so romantic i shall turn hermit in good earnest for i see one may go so far as to be poetical and hope to save ones soul at the same time i really wish myself something more that is a prophet for i wish i were as habakkuk to be taken by the hair of the head and visit daniel in his den you are very obliging in saying i have now a whole family upon my hands to whom to discharge the part of a friend i assure you i like em all so well that i will never quit my hereditary right to them you have made me yours and consequently them mine i still see them walking on my green at twickenham andgratefully remember not only their green gowns but the instructions they gave me how to slide down and trip up the steepest slopes of my mount  pray think of me sometimes as i shall often of you and know me for what i am that is  yours  to the same twickenham oct         dear sir your very kind and obliging manner of enquiring after me among the first concerns of life at your resuscitation should have been sooner answered and acknowledged i sincerely rejoice at your recovery from an illness which gave me less pain than it did you only from my ignorance of it i should have else been seriously and deeply affected in the thought of your danger by a fever i think it a fine and a natural thought which i lately read in a private letter of montaigne giving an account of the last words of an intimate friend of his adieu my friend the pain i feel will soon be over but i grieve for that you are to feel which is to last you for life  i join with your family in giving god thanks for lending us a worthy man some what longer the comforts you receive from their attendance put me in mind of what old fletcher of saltoune said one day to me alas i have nothing to do but to dye i am a poor individual no creature to wish or to fear for my life or death it is the only reason i have to repent being a single man now i grow old i am like a tree without a prop and without young trees of my own shedding to grow round me for company and defense  i hope the gout will soon go after the fever and all evil things remove far from you but pray tell me when will you move toward us if you had an interval to get hither i care not what fixes you afterward except the gout pray come and never stir from us again do away your dirty acres cast em to dirty people such as in the scripture phrase possess the land shake off your earth like the noble animal in milton  the tawny lion pawing to get free his hinder parts be springs as broke from bonds and rampant shakes his brinded main the ounce the lizard and the tiger as the mole rising the crumbled earth above them threw in hillocks but i believe milton never thought these fine verses of his should be applied to a man selling a parcel of dirty acres though in the main i think it may have some resemblance for god knows this little space of ground nourishes buries and confines us as that of eden did those creatures till we can shake it loose at least in our affections and desires  believe dear sir i truly love and value you let mrs blount know that she is in the list of my memento domines famulorum famularumques etc my poor mother is far from well declining and i am watching over her as we watch an expiring taper that even when it looks brightest wastes fastest i am as you will see from the whole air of this letter not in the gayest nor easiest humor but always with sincerity  dear sir yours  to the same june         dear sir you may truly do me the justice to think no man is more your sincere wellwisher than myself or more the sincere wellwisher of your whole family with all which i cannot deny but i have a mixture of envy to you all for loving one another so well and for enjoying the sweets of that life which can only be tasted by people of good will  they from all shades the darkness can exclude and from a desert banish solitude torbay is a paradise and a storm is but an amusement to such people if you drink tea upon a promontory that overhangs the sea it is preferable to an assembly and the whistling of the wind better music to contented and loving minds than the opera to the spleenful ambitious diseased distasted and distracted souls which this world affords nay this world affords no other happy they who are banished from us but happier they who can banish themselves or more properly banish the world from them alas i live at twickenham  i take that period to be very sublime and to include more than a hundred sentences that might be writ to express distraction hurry multiplication of nothings and all the fatiguing perpetual business of having no business to do you will wonder i reckon translating the odyssey as nothing but whenever i think seriously and of late i have met with so many occasions of thinking seriously that i begin never to think otherwise i cannot but think these things very idle as idle as if a beast of burden should go on jingling his bells without bearing any thing valuable about him or ever serving his master lifes vain amusements amidst which we awell not weighed or understood by the grim god of hell   said a heathen poet as he is translated by a christian bishop who has first by his exhortations and since by his example taught me to think as becomes a reasonable creature  but he is gone he carried away more learning than is left in this nation behind him but he left us more in the noble example of bearing calamity well it is true we want literature very much but pray god we dont want patience more if these precedents are to prevail  i remember i promised to write to you as soon as i should hear you were got home you must look on this as the first day i have been myself and pass over the mad interval unimputed to me how punctual a correspondent i shall henceforward be able or not able to be god knows but he knows i shall ever be a punctual and grateful friend and all the good wishes of such an one will ever attend you  to the same june        dear sir you show your self a just man and a friend in those guesses and suppositions you make at the possible reasons of my silence every one of which is a true one as to forgetfulness of you or yours i assure you the promiscuous conversations of the town serve only to put me in mind of better and more quiet to be had in a corner of the world undisturbed innocent serene and sensible with such as you let no access of any distrust make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the most sunshiny weather let the young ladies be assured i make nothing new in my gardens without wishing to see the print of their fairy steps in every part of em i have put the last hand to my works of this kind in happily finishing the subterraneous way and grotto i there found a spring of the clearest water which falls in a perpetual rill that echoes through the cavern day and night from the river thames you see through my arch up a walk of the wilderness to a kind of open temple wholly composed of shells in the rustic manner and from that distance under the temple you look down through a sloping arcade of trees and see the sails on the river passing suddenly and vanishing as through a perspective glass when you shut the doors of this grotto it becomes on the instant from a luminous room a camera obscura on the walls of which all the objects of the river hills woods and boats are forming a moving picture in their visible radiations and when you have a mind to light it up it affords you a very different scene it is finished with shells interspersed with pieces of lookingglass in angular forms and in the cieling is a star of the same material at which when a lamp of an orbicular figure of thin alabaster is hung in the middle a thousand pointed rays glitter and are reflected over the place there are connected to this grotto by a narrower passage two porches with niches and seats one toward the river of smooth stones full of light and open the other toward the arch of trees rough with shells flints and iron ore the bottom is paved with simple pebble as the adjoining walk up the wilderness to the temple is to be cockleshells in the natural taste agreeing not ill with the little dripping murmur and the aquatic idea of the whole place it wants nothing to complete it but a good statue with an inscription like that beautiful antique one which you know i am so fond of hujus nympha loci sacri custodia fontis dormio dum blandae sentio murmur aquae parce meum quisquistangis cava mar mora somnum rumpere seu bibas sive lavere tace nymph of the grot these sacred springs i keep and to the murmur of these waters sleep whoever thou art ah gently tread the cave ah bathe in silence or in silence lave   you will think i have been very poetical in this description but it is pretty near the truth i wish you were here to bear testimony how little it owes to art either the place itself or the image i give of it  i am etc  to the same september         dear sir i should be ashamed to own the receipt of a very kind letter from you two whole months from the date of this if i were not more ashamed to tell a lie or to make an excuse which is worse than a lie for being built upon some probable circumstances it makes use of a degree of truth to falsify with it is a lie guarded your letter has been in my pocket in constant wearing till that and the pocket and the suit are worn out by which means i have read it forty times and i find by so doing that i have not enough considered and reflected upon many others you have obliged me with for true friendship as they say of good writing will bear reviewing a thousand times and still discover new beauties  i have had a fever a short one but a violent i am now well so it shall take up no more of this paper  i begin now to expect you in town to make the winter to come more tolerable to us both the summer is a kind of heaven when we wander in a paradisaical scene of nature among groves and gardens but at this season we are like our poor first parents turned out of that agreeable though solitary life and forced to look about for more people to help to bear our labors to get into warmer houses and hive together in cities  i hope you are long since perfectly restored and risen from your gout happy in the delights of a contented family smiling at storms laughing at greatness and merry over a christmasfire exercising all the functions of an old patriarch in charity and hospitality i will not tell mrs b what i think she is doing for i conclude it is her opinion that he only ought to know it for whom it is done and she will allow herself to be far enough advanced above a fine lady not to desire to shine before men  your daughters perhaps may have some other thoughts which even their mother must excuse them for because she is a mother i will not however suppose those thoughts get the better of their devotions but rather excite em and assist the warmth of them while their prayer may be that they may raise up and breed as irreproachable a young family as their parents have done in a word i fancy you all well easy and happy just as i wish you and next to that i wish you all with me  next to god is a good man next in dignity and next in value minuisti eum paullo minus ab angelis if therefore i wish well to the good and the deserving and desire they only should be my companions and correspondents i must very soon and very much think of you i want your company and your example pray make haste to town so as not again to leave us discharge the load of earth that lies on you like one of the mountains under which the poets say the giants that is the men of the earth are whelmed leave earth to the sons of earth your conversation is in heaven which that it may be accomplished in us all is the prayer of him who makes this short sermon value to you three pence adieu  letters of mr pope to mr gay from      to    0 letters of mr pope to mr gay from      to    0 nov         sir you writ me a very kind letter some months ago and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into devonshire that hindered my answering you and i have since several times inquired of you without any satisfaction for so i call the knowledge of your welfare or of any thing that concerns you i past two months in sussex and since my return have been again very ill i writ to lintot in hopes of hearing of you but had no answer to that point our friend mr cromwell too has been silent all this year i believe he has been displeased at some or other of my freedoms which i very innocently take and most with those i think most my friends but this i know nothing of perhaps he may have opened to you and if i know you right you are of a temper to cement friendships and not to divide them i really much love mr cromwell and have a true affection for your self which if i had any interest in the world or power with those who have i should not be long without manifesting to you i desire you will not either out of modesty or a vicious distrust of anothers value for you those two eternal foes to merit imagine that your letters and conversation are not always welcome to me there is no man more entirely fond of goodnature or ingenuity than myself and i have seen too much of those qualities in mr gay to be any thing less than his  most affectionate friend and real servant a pope binfield no         dec         dear sir it has been my good fortune within this month past to hear more things that have pleased me than i think almost in all my time beside but nothing upon my word has been so homefelt a satisfaction as the news you tell me of your self and you are not in the least mistaken when you congratulate me upon your own good success for i have more people to be happy out of than any illnatured man can boast i may with honesty affirm to you that notwithstanding the many inconveniences and disadvantages they commonly talk of in the res angusti domi i have never found any other than the inability of giving people of merit the only certain proof of our value for them in doing em some real service for after all if we could but think a little selflove might make us philosophers and convince us quantuli indiget natura ourselves are easily provided for it is nothing but the circumstantials and the apparatus or equipage of humane life that costs so much the furnishing only what a luxurious man wants for horses and footmen a goodnatured man wants for his friends or the indigent  i shall see you this winter with much greater pleasure than i could the last and i hope as much of your time as your attendance on the duchess will allow you to spare to any friend will not be thought lost upon one who is as much so as any man i must also put you in mind though you are now secretary to this lady that you are likewise secretary to nine other ladies and are to write sometimes for them too he who is forced to live wholly upon those ladies favors is indeed in as precarious a condition as any he who does what chaucer says  for sustenance but they are very agreeable companions like other ladies when a man only passes a night or so with them at his leisure and away i am  your etc  aug         dear sir just as i received yours i was set down to write to you with some shame that i had so long deferred it but i can hardly repent my neglect when it gives me the knowledge how little you insist upon ceremony and how much a greater share in your memory i have than i deserve i have been near a week in london where i am like to remain till i become by mr jss help elegans formarum spectator i begin to discover beauties that were till now imperceptible to me every corner of an eye or turn of a nose or ear the smallest degree of light or shade on a cheek or in a dimple have charms to distract me i no longer look upon lord plausible as ridiculous for admiring a ladys fine tip of an ear and pretty elbow as the plaindealer has it but am in some danger even from the ugly and disagreeable since they may have their retired beauties in one trait or other about em you may guess in how uneasy a state i am when every day the performances of others appear more beautiful and excellent and my own more despicable i have thrown away three dr swifts each of which was once my vanity two lady bridgewaters a duchess of montague besides half a dozen earls and one knight of the garter i have crucified christ overagain in effigy and made a madona as old as her mother st anne nay what is yet more miraculous i have rivaled st luke himself in painting and as it is said an angel came and finished his piece so you would swear a devil put the last hand to mine it is so begrimd and smutted however i comfort my self with a christian reflection that i have not broken the commandment for my pictures are not the likeness of any thing in heaven above or in earth below or in the waters under the earth neither will any body adore or worship them except the indians should have a fight of em who they tell us worship cetain pagods or idols purely for their ugliness  i am very much recreated and refreshed with the news of the advancement of the fan which i doubt not will delight the eye and sense of the fair as long as that agreeable machine shall play in the hands of posterity i am glad your fan is mounted so soon but i would have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure and polish the sticks as much as you can you may then cause it to be born in the lands of both sexes no less in britain than it is in china where it is ordinary for a mandarine to fan himself cool after a debate and a statesman to hide his face with it when he tells a grave lie  i am etc  may   binfield      dear gay since by your letter we find you can be content to breath in smoke to walk in crowds and divert your self with noise nay and to make fine pictures of this way of life we should give you up as one abandoned to a wrong choice of pleasures we have however so much compassion on you as to think of inviting you to us where your taste for books friendship and ease may be indulged but if you do not come pray leave to tempt us with your description of the court for indeed humanity is frail and we cannot but remember some particular honors which we have enjoyed in conversation bate us this one point and we stand you still untird with one another and fresh to the pleasures of the country if you would have any news from us know that we are well at present this i am sure would have been allowed by you as news from either of us a fortnight ago in return to this send us every thing you imagine diverting and pray forget not my commissions give my respects to the dean dr arbuthnot mr ford and the provost dear gay adieu  your affectionate friend and humble servant tho parnelle  dear mr gay above all other news send us the best that of your good health if you enjoy it which mr harcourt made us very much fear if you have any design either to amend your health or your life i know no better expedient than to come hither where you should not want room though i say myself in a trucklebed under the doctor you might here converse with the old greeks be initiated into all their customs and learn their prayers by heart as we have done the dr last sunday intending to say an our father was got half way in chryses prayer to apollo the ill effects of contention and squabling so lively described in the first iliad make dr parnelle and myself continue in the most exemplary union in every thing we deserve to be worshipped by all the poor divided factious interested poets of this world  as we rise in our speculations daily we are grown so grave that we have not condescended to laugh at any of the idle things about us this week i have contracted a severity of aspect from deep meditation on high subjects equal to the formidable front of blackbrowd jupiter and become an awful nod as well when i assent to some grave and weighty proposition of the doctor or enforce a criticism of my own in a word yg himself has not acquired more tragic majesty in his aspect by reading his own verses than i by homers  in this state i cannot consent to your publication of that ludicrous trifling burlesque you write about dr parnelle also joins in my opinion that it will by no means be well to print it  pray give with the utmost fidelity and esteem my hearty service to the dean dr arbuthnot mr ford and to mr fortescue let them also know at buttons that i am mindful of them i am divine bucoliast  thy loving countryman  oct    dear sir i have been perpetually troubled with sickness of late which has made me so melancholy that the immortality of the soul has been my constant speculation as the mortality of my body my constant plague in good earnest seneca is nothing to a fit of illness  dr parnelle will honor tonsons miscellany with some very beautiful copies at my request he enters heartily into our design i only fear his stay in town may chance to be but short dr swift much approves what i proposed even to the very title which i design shall be the works of the unlearned published monthly in which whatever book appears that deserves praise shall be depreciated ironically and in the same manner that modern critics take to undervalue works of value and to commend the high productions of grubstreet  i shall go into the country about a month hence and shall then desire to take along with me your poem of the fan to consider it at full leisure i am deeply engaged in poetry the particulars whereof shall be deferred till we meet  i am very desirous of seeing mr fortescue when he comes to town before his journey if you can any way acquaint him of my desire i believe his good nature will contrive a way for our meeting i am ever with all sincerity dear sir  your etc  sept         dear mr gay welcome to your native soil welcome to your friends thrice welcome to me whether returned in glory blessed with courtinterest the love and familiarity of the great and filled with agreeable hopes or melancholy with dejection contemplative of the changes of fortune and doubtful for the future whether returned a triumphant whig or a desponding tory equally all hail equally beloved and welcome to me if happy i am to share in your elevation if unhappy you have still a warm corner in my heart and a retreat at binfield in the worst of times at your service if you are a tory or thought so by any man i know it can proceed from nothing but your gratitude to a few people who endeavovrd to serve you and whose politics were never your concern if you are a whig as i rather hope and as i think your principles and mine as brother poets had ever a bias to the side of liberty i know you will be an honest man and an inoffensive one upon the whole i know you are incapable of being so much of either party as to be good for nothing therefore once more whatever you are or in whatever state you are all hail  one or two of your old friends complained they had heard nothing from you since the queens death i told em no man living loved mr gay better than i yet i had not once written to him in all his voyage this i thought a convincing proof how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him so every month but they had reasons too themselves to allege in your excuse as men who really value one another will never want such as make their friends and themselves easy the late universal concern in public affairs threw us all into a hurry of spirits even i who am more a philosopher than to expect any thing from any reign was born away with the current and full of the expectation of the successor during your journeys i knew not whither to aim a letter after you that was a sort of shooting flying add to this the demand homer had upon me to write fifty verses a day besides learned notes all which are at a conclusion for this year rejoice with me o my friend that my labor is over come and make merry with me in much feasting for i to thee and thou to me we will feed among the lillies by the lillies i mean the ladies with whom i hope you have fed to satiety have thou passed through many countries and not tasted the delights thereof have thou not left of thy issue in diverse lands that german gays and dutch gays may arise to write pastorals and sing their songs in strange countries are not the blouzelindas of the hague as charming as the rosalindas of britian or have the two great pastoral poets of our nation renounced love at the same time for philips immortal philips hanover philips has deserted yea and in a rustic manner kicked his rosalind  dr parnelle and i have been inseparable ever since you went we are now at the bath where if you are not as i heartily hope better engaged your coming would be the greatest pleasure to us in the world talk not of expenses homer shall support his children i beg a line from you directed to the posthouse in bath poor parnelle is in an ill state of health  pardon me if i add a word of advice in the poetical way write something on the king or prince or princess on whatsoever foot you may be with the court this can do no harm  i shall never know where to end and am confounded in the many things i have to say to you though they all amount but to this that i am entirely as ever  your etc  london nov        dear sir i am extremely glad to find by a letter of yours to mr fortescue that you have received one from me and i beg you to keep as the greatest of curiosities that letter of mine which you received and i never writ  but the truth is that we were made here to expect you in a short time that i was upon the ramble most part of the summer and have concluded the season in grief for the death of my poor father  i shall not enter into a detail of my concerns and troubles for two reasons because i am really afflicted and need no airs of grief and because they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my self but i think you without too great a compliment enough my friend to be pleased to know he died easily without a groan or the sickness of two minutes in a word as silently and peacefully as he lived sic mihi contingat vivere sicque mori  i am not in the humor to say gay things nor in the affectation of avoiding them i cannot pretend to entertain either mr pulteney or you as you have done both my lord burlington and me by your letter to mr lowndes i am only sorry you have no greater quarrel to mr lowndes and wish you paid some hundreds a year to the landtax that gentleman is lately become an inoffensive person to me too so that we may join heartily in our addresses to him and like true patriots rejoice in all that good done to the nation and government to which we contribute nothing our selves  i should not forget to acknowledge your letter sent from aix you told me then that writing was not good with the waters and i find since you are of my opinion that it is as bad without the waters but i fancy it is not writing but thinking that is so bad with the waters and then you might write without any manner of prejudice if you writ like our brotherpoets of these days  i have no story to tell that is worth your hearing you know i am no man of intrigue but the duchess of hamilton has one which she says is worth my hearing that relates to mr pulteney and your self and which she promises if you will not tell me she will her grace has won in a raffle a very fine tweezercase at the sight of which my tweezercase and all other tweezercases on the globe hide their diminished heads  that duchess lord warwick lord stanhope mrs bellenden mrs lepell and i cannot tell who else had your letters dr arbuthnot and i expect to be treated like friends i would send my services to mr pulteney but that he is out of favor at court and make some compliment to mrs pulteney if she were not a whig my lord burlington tells me she has as much outshind all the french ladies as she did the english before i am sorry for it because it will be detrimental to our holy religion if heretical women should eclypse those nuns and orthodox beauties in whose eyes alone lie all the hopes we can have of gaining such fine gentlemen as you to our church  your etc i wish you joy of the birth of the young prince because he is the only prince we have from whom you have had no expectations and no disappointments    dear sir i think it obliging in you to desire an account of my health the truth is i have never been in a worse state in my life and find whatever i have tried as a remedy so ineffectual that i give myself entirely over i wish your health may be set perfectly right by the waters and be assured i not only wish that and every thing else for you as common friends wish but with a zeal not usual among those we call so i am always glad to hear of and from you always glad to see you whatever accidents or amusements have intervened to make me do either less than usual i not only frequently think of you but constantly do my best to make others do it by mentioning you to all your acquaintance i desire you to do the same for me to those you are now with do me what you think justice in regard to those who are my friends and if there are any whom i have unwillingly deserved so little of as to be my enemies i dont desire you to forfeit their opinion or your own judgment in any case let time convince those who know me not that i am an inoffensive person though to say truth i dont care how little i am indebted to time for the world his hardly worth living in at least to one that is never to have health a week together i have been made to expect dr arbuthnot in town this fortnight or else i had written to him if he by never writing to me seems to forget me i consider i do the same seemingly to him and yet i dont believe he has a more sincere friend in the world than i am therefore i will think him mine i am his mr congreves and  your etc  london sept         dear gay i thank you for remembering me i would do my best to forget my self but that i find your idea is closely connected to me that i must forget both together or neither i am sorry i could not have a glympse either of you or of the sun your father before you went to bath but now it pleases me to see him and hear of you pray put mr congreve in mind that he has one on this side of the world who loves him and that there are more men and women in the universe than mr gay and my lady duchess of m there are ladies in and about richmond that pretend to value him and yourself and one of em at least may be thought to do it without affectation namely mrs howard as for mrs blounts whom you mercifully make mention of they are gone or going to sussex i hope mrs pulteney is the better for the bath though i have little charity and few good wishes for the ladies the destroyers of their best friends the men pray tell her she has forgot the first commission i ever troubled her with and therefore it shall be the last the very thing i fear she desires dr arbuthnot is a strange creature he goes out of town and leaves his bastards at other folks doors i have long been so far mistaken in him as to think him a man of morals as well as of politics pray let him know i made a very unfashionable enquiry the other day of the welfare of his wife and family things that i presume are below the consideration of a wit and an ombreplayer they are in perfect health though mrs as naval has been burnt i hope the doctors own belly is in absolute ease and contentment now i speak of those regions about the abdomen pray dear gay consult with him and dr chene to what exact pitch yours may be suffered to swell not to outgrow theirs who are yet your betters pray tell dr arbuthnot that even pigeonpyes and hogspuddings are thought dangerous by our governors for those which have been sent to the bishop of rochester are opened and profanely pried into at the tower it is the first time dead pigeons have been suspected of carrying intelligence to be serious you and mr congreve nay and the doctor if he has not dined will be sensible of my concern and surprise at the commitment of that gentleman whose welfare is as much my concern as any friends i have i think my self a most unfortunate wretch i no sooner love and upon knowledge fix my esteem to any man but he either dies like mr craggs or is sent to imprisonment like the bishop god send him as well as i wish him manifest him to be as innocent as i believe him and make all his enemies know him as well as i do that they may love him and think of him as well  if you apprehend this period to be of any danger in being addressed to you tell mr congreve or the doctor it is writ to them i am  your etc  july         dear sir i was very much pleased not to say obliged by your kind letter which sufficiently warmed my heart to have answered it sooner had i not been deceived a way one is often deceived by hearkening to women who told me that both lady burlington and yourself were immediately to return from tunbridge and that my lord was gone to bring you back the world furnishes us with too many examples of what you complain of in yours and i assure you none of em touch and grieve me so much as what relates to you i think your sentiments upon it are the very same i should entertain i wish those we call great men had the same notions but they are really the most little creatures in the world and the most interested in all but one point which is that they want judgment to know their greatest interest to encourage and choose honest men for their friends  i have not once seen the person you complain of whom i have of late thought to be as the apostle admonishes one flesh with his wife  pray make my sincere compliments to lord burlington whom i have long known to have more mind to be a good and honorable man than almost any one of his rank  i have not forgot yours to lord bolingbroke though i hope to have speedily a fuller opportunity he returns for flanders and france next month  mrs howard has writ you something or other in a letter which she says she repents she has as much good nature as if she had never seen any ill nature and had been bred among lambs and turtledoves instead of princes and courtladies  by the end of this week fortescue will pass a few days with me we shall remember you in our potations and wish you a fisher with us on my grassplat in the mean time we wish you success as a fisher of women at the wells a rejoycer of the comfortless and widow an impregnator of the barren and a playfellow of the maiden i am  your etc  dear sir i faithfully assure you in the midst of that melancholy with which i have been so long encompassed in an hourly expectation almost of my mothers death there was no circumstance that rendered it more insupportable to me than that i could not leave her to see you your own present escape from so imminent danger i pray god may prove less precarious than my poor mothers can be whose life at her age can at best be but a short reprieve or a longer dying but i fear even that is more than god will please to grant me for these two days past her most dangerous symptoms are returned upon her and unless there be a sudden change i must in a few days if not in a few hours be deprived of her in the afflicting prospect before me i know nothing that can so much alleviate it as the view now given me heaven grant it may increase of your recovery in the sincerity of my heart i am excessively concerned not to be able to pay you dear gay any part of the debt i very gratefully remember i owe you on a like sad occasion where you was here comforting me in her last great illness may your health augment as fast as i fear it pleases god hers must decline i believe that would be very fast  may the life that is added to you be past in good fortune and tranquillity rather of your own giving to your self than from any expectations or trust in others  may you and i live together without wishing more felicity or acquisitions than friendship can give and receive without obligations to greatness  god keep you and three or four more of those i have known as long that i may have something worth the surviving my mother adieu dear gay and believe me while you live and while i live  your etc as i told you in my last letter i repeat it in this do not think of writing to me the doctor mrs howard and mrs blount give me daily accounts of you    sunday night dear sir i truly rejoiced to see your handwriting though i feared the trouble it might give you i wish i had not known that you are still so excessively weak every day for a week past i had hopes of being able in a day or two more to see you but my poor mother advances not at all gains no strength and seems but upon the whole to wait for the next cold day to throw her into a diarrhoea that must if it return carry her off this being greatly to be feared makes me not dare to go a day from her lest that should prove to be her last god send you a speedy recovery and such a total one as at your time of life may be expected you need not call the few words i writ to you either kind or good that was and is nothing but whatever i have in my nature of kindness i really have for you and whatever good i could do i would among the very first be glad to do to you in your circumstance the old roman farewell is proper vive memor nostri  your etc i send you a very kind letter of mr digby between whom and me two letters have passed concerning you    dear gay no words can tell you the great concern i feel for you i assure you it was not and is not lessened by the immediate apprehension i have now every day lain under of losing my mother be assured no duty less than that should have kept me one day from attending your condition i would come and take a room by you at hampstead to be with you daily were she still not in danger of death i have constantly had particular accounts of you from the doctor which have not ceased to alarm me yet god preserve your life and restore your health i really beg it for my own sake for i feel i love you more than i thought in health though i always loved you a great deal if i am so unfortunate as to bury my poor mother and yet have the good fortune to have my prayers heard for you i hope we may live most of our remaining days together if as i believe the air of a better clime as the southern part of france may be thought useful for your recovery thither i would go with you infallibly and it is very probable we might get the dean with us who is in that abandoned state already in which i shall shortly be as to other cares and duties dear gay be as cheerful as your sufferings will permit god is a better friend than a court even any honest man is a better i promise you my entire frindship in all events heartily praying for your recovery  your etc do not write if you are ever so able the doctor tells me all    dear sir i am glad to hear of the progress of your recovery and the oftener i hear it the better when it becomes easy to you to give it me i so well remember the consolation you were to me in my mothers former illness that it doubles my concern at this time not to be able to be with you or you able to be with me had i lost her i would have been no where else but with you during your confinement i have now past five weeks without once going from home and without any company but for three or four of the days friends rarely stretch their kindness so far as ten miles my lord bolingbroke and mr bethel have not forgotten to visit me the rest except mrs blount once were contented to send messages i never passed so melancholy a time and now mr congreves death touches me nearly it is twenty years that i have known him every year carries away something dear with it till we outlive all tendernesses and become wretched individuals again as we begun adieu this is my birthday and this is my reflection upon it with added days if life give nothing new but like a sieve let every pleasure through some joy still lost as each vain year runs over and all we gain some sad reflection more is this a birthday  it is alas too clear it is but the funeral of the former year   i am yours etc  twicknam july    dear gay you have the same share in my memory that good things generally have i always know whenever i reflect that you should be in my mind only i reflect too seldom however you ought to allow me the indulgence i allow all my friends and if i did not they would take it in consideration that they have other avocations which may prevent the proofs of their remembering me though they preserve for me all the friendship and good will which i deserve from them in like manner i expect from you that my past life of twenty years may be set against the omission of perhaps one month and if you complain of this to any other it is you are in the spleen and not i in the wrong if you think this letter splenatick consider i have just received the news of the death of a friend whom i esteemed almost as many years as you poor fenton he died at easthamstead of indolency and inactivity let it not be your fate but use exercise i hope the duchess will take care of you in this respect and either make you gallop after her or teize you enough at home to serve instead of exercise abroad mrs howard is so concerned about you and so angry at me for not writing to you and at mrs blount for not doing the same that i am piqud with jealousy and envy at you and hate you as much as if you had a great place at court which you will confess a proper cause of envy and hatred in any poetmilitant or unpensiond but to set matters even i own i love you and own i am as i ever was and just as i ever shall be  yours etc  twickenham oct         dear sir i have many years ago magnified in my own mind and repeated to you a ninth beatitude added to the eight in the scripture blessed is he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed i could find in my heart to congratulate you on this happy dismission from all courtdependance i dare say i shall find you the better and the honester man for it many years hence very probable the healthfuller and the chearfuller into the bargain you are happily rid of many cursed ceremonies as well as of many ill and vicious habits of which few or no men escape the infection who are hackneyd and tramelled in the ways of a court princes indeed and peers the lackies of princes and ladies the fools of peers will smile on you the less but men of worth and real friends will look on you the better there is a thing the only thing which kings and queens cannot give you for they have it not to give liberty which is worth all they have and which as yet i hope englishmen need not ask from their hands you will enjoy that and your own integrity and the satisfactory consciousness of having not merited such graces from them as they bestow only on the mean servile flattering interested and undeserving the only steps to their favor are such complacencies such compliances such distant decorums as delude them in their vanities or engage them in their passions he is their greatest favorite who is their falsest and when a man by such vile gradations arrives at the height of grandeur and power he is then at best but in a circumstance to be hated and in a condition to be hanged for serving their ends so many a minister has found it  i believe you did not want advice in the letter you sent by my lord grantham i presume you writ it not without and you could not have better if i guess right at the person who agreed to your doing it in respect to any decency you ought to observe for i take that person to be a perfect judge of decencies and forms i am not without fears even on that persons account i think it a bad omen but what have i to do with courtomens  dear gay adieu i can only add a plain uncourtly speech while you are no bodys servant you may be any ones friend and as such i embrace you in all conditions of life while i have a shilling you shall have sixpence nay eightpence if i can contrive to live upon a groat i am faithfully  your etc  aug    dear gay if my friendship were as effectual as it is sincere you would be one of those people who would be vastly advantaged and enriched by it i ever honored those popes who were most famous for nepotism it is a sign that the old fellows loved somebody which is not usual in such advanced years and i now honor sir robert walpole for his extensive bounty and goodness to his private friends and relations but it vexes me to the heart when i reflect that my friendship is so much less effectual than theirs nay so utterly useless that it cannot give you any thing not even a dinner at this distance nor help the general whom i greatly love to catch one fish my only consolation is to think you happier than myself and to begin to envy you which is next to hating and excellent remedy for love how comes it that providence has been so unkind to me who am a greater object of compassion than any fat man alive that i am forced to drink wine while you riot in water prepared with oranges by the hand of the duchess of queensberry that i am condemned to live on a highway side like an old patriarch receiving all guests where my portico as virgil has it mane salutantum totis vomit aedibus undam while you are wrapped into the idalian groves sprinkled with rose water and live in burrage balm and burnet up to the chin with the duchess of queensberry that i am doomed to the drudgery of dining at court with the ladies in waiting at windsor while you are happily banished with the duchess of queensberry so partial is fortune in her dispensations for i deserved ten times more to be banished than you and i know some ladies who merit it better than even her grace after this i must not name any who dare do so much for you as to send you their services but one there is who exhorts me often to write to you i suppose to prevent or excuse her not doing it herself she seems for that is all i will say for a courtier to wish you mighty well another who is no courtier frequently mentions you and does certainly wish you well  i fancy after all they both do so  i writ to mr fortescue and told him the pains you took to see him dr a for all that i know may yet remember you and me but i never hear of it the dean is well i have had many accounts of him from irish evidence but only two letters these four months in both which you are mentioned kindly he is in the north of ireland doing i know not what with i know not whom cleland always speaks of you he is at tunbridge wondering at the superior carnivoracity of the dr he plays now with the old duchess of m nay dines with her after she has won all his money other news know i not but that counselor bickford has hurt himself and has the strangest walkingstaff i ever saw he intends speedily to make you a visit at amesbury i am my lord dukes my lady dutchesss mr dormers general dormers and  your etc  sept       0 dear sir i may with great truth return your speech that i think of you daily oftener indeed than is consistent with the character of a reasonable man who is rather to make himself easy with the things and men that are about him than uneasy with those which are not and you whose absence is in a manner perpetual to me ought rather to be remembered as a good man gone than breathed after as one living you are taken from us here to be laid up in a more blessed state with spirits of a higher kind such i reckon his grace and her grace since their banishment from an earthly court to an heavenly one in each other and their friends for i conclude none but true friends will consort or associate with them afterward i cannot but look upon my self so unworthy as a man of twitnam seems to be ranked with such rectified and sublimated beings as you as a separated spirit too from courts and courtly fopperies but i own not altogether so divested of terrene matter nor altogether so spiritualized as to be worthy of admission to your depths of retirement and contentment i am tugged back to the world and its regards too often and no wonder when my retreat is but ten miles from the capital i am within earshot of reports within the vortex of lies and censures i hear sometimes of the lampooners of beauty the calumniators of virtue the jokers at reason and religion i presume these are creatures and things as unknown to you as we of this dirty orb are to the inhabitants of the planet jupiter except a few fervant prayers reach you on the wings of the post from two or three of your zealous votaries at this distance as one mrs howard who lifts up her heart now and then to you from the midst of the colluvies and sink of human greatness at wr one mrs b that fancies you may remember her while you lived in your mortal and too transitory state at petersham one lord b who admired the duchess before she grew quite a goddess and a few others  to descend now to tell you what are our wants our complaints and our miseries here i must seriously say the loss of any one good woman is too great to be born easily and poor mrs rollinson though a private woman was such her husband is gone into oxfordshire very melancholy and thence to the bath to live on for such is our fate and duty adieu write to me as often as you will and to encourage you i will write as seldom as if you did not believe me  your etc  oct      0 dear sir i am something like the sun at this season withdrawing from the world but meaning it mighty well and resolving to shine whenever i can again but i fear the clouds of a long winter will overcome me to such a degree that any body will take a farthing candle for a better guide and more serviceable companion my friends may remember my brighter days but will think like the irishman that the moon is a better thing when once i am gone i dont say this with an allusion to my poetical capacity as a son of apollo but in my companionable one if you will suffer me to use a phrase of the earl of clarendons for i shall see or be seen of few of you this winter i am grown too faint to do any good or to give any pleasure i not only as dryden fairly says feel my notes decay as a poet but feel my spirits flag as a companion and shall return again to where i first began my books i have been putting my library in order and enlarging the chimney in it with equal intention to warm my mind and body if i can to some life a friend a womanfriend god help me with whom i have spent three or four hours a day these fifteen years advised me to pass more time in my studies i reflected she must have found some reason for this admonition and concluded she would complete all her kindnesses to me by returning me to the employment i am fittest for conversation with the dead the old and the wormeaten  judge therefore if i might not treat you as a beatifyd spirit comparing your life with my stupid state for as to my living at windsor with ladies etc it is all a dream i was there but two nights and all the day out of that company i shall certainly make as little court to others as they do to me and that will be none at all my fairweather friends of the summer are going away for london and i shall see them and the butterflies together if i live till next year which i would not desire to do if it were only for their sakes but we that are writers ought to love posterity that posterity may love us and i would willingly live to see the children of the present race merely in hope they may be a little wiser than their parents  i am etc  to j gay esquire dec         i am astonished at the complaints occasioned by a late epistle to the earl of burlington and i should be afflicted were there the least just ground for em had the writer attacked vice at a time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant and so far from being concealed as a defect that it is proclaimed with ostentation as a merit i should have been apprehensive of the consequence had he satirized gamesters of a hundred thousand pounds fortune acquired by such methods as are in daily practice and almost universally encouraged had he overwarmly defended the religion of his country against such books as come from every press are publicly vended in every shop and greedily bought by almost every rank of men or had he called our excellent weekly writings by the same names which they openly bestow on the greatest men in the ministry and out of the ministry for which they are all unpunished and most rewarded in any of these cases indeed i might have judged him too presumptious and perhaps have trembled for his rashness  i could not but hope better for this small and modest epistle which attacks no one vice whatsoever which deals only in folly and not folly in general but a single species of it that only branch for the opposite excellency to which the noble lord to whom it is written must necessarily be celebrated i fancied it might escape censure especially seeing how tenderly these follies are treated and really less accused than apologized for yet hence the poor are clothed the hungry fed health to himself and to his infants bread the labrer bears is this such a crime that to impute it to a man must be a grievous offense it is an innocent folly and much more beneficent than the want of it for ill taste employs more hands and diffuses expense more than a good one is it a moral defect no it is but a natural one a want of taste it is what the best good man living may be liable to the worthiest peer may live exemplary in an illfavored house and the best reputed citizen be pleased with a vile garden i thought i say the author had the common liberty to observe a defect and to compliment a friend for a quality that distinguishes him which i know not how any quality should do if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others  but they say the satire is personal i thought it could not be so because all its reflections are on things his reflections are not on the man but his house garden etc nay he reflects as one may say the persons of the gladiator amphitheatre the nile and the triton he is only sorry to see them as he might be to see any of his friends ridiculous by being in the wrong place and in bad company some fancy that to say a thing is personal is the same as to say it is injust not considering that nothing can be just that is not personal i am afraid that all such writings and discourses as touch no man will mend no man the good natured indeed are apt to be alarmed at any thing like satire and the guilty readily concur with the weak for a plain reason because the vicious look upon folly as their frontier  jam stroximus ardet ucalegon  no wonder those who know ridicule belongs to them find an inward consolation in removing it from themselves as far as they can and it is never so far as when they can get it fixed on the best characters no wonder those who are food for satirists should rail at them as creatures of prey every beast born for our use would be ready to call a man so  i know no remedy unless people in our age would as little frequent the theaters as they begin to do the churches unless comedy were forsaken satire silent and every man left to do what seems good in his own eyes as if there were no king no priest no poet in israel  but i find myself obliged to touch a point on which i must be more serious it well deserves i should i mean the malicious application of the character of timon which i will boldly say they would impute to the person the most different in the world from a manhater and the person whose taste and encouragement of wit have often been shown in the rightest place the author of that epistle must certainly think so if he has the same opinion of his own merit as authors generally have for he has been favored by this very person  why in gods name must a portrait apparently collected from twenty different men be applied to one only has it his eye no it is very unlike has it his nose or mouth no they are totally differing what then i beseech you why it has the mole on his chin very well but must the picture thereof be his and has no other man that blemish  could there be a more melancholy instance how much the taste of the public is vitiated and turns the most salutary and seasonable physic into poison than if amidst the blaze of thousand bright qualities in a great man they should only remark there is a shadow about him as what eminence is without i am confident the author was incapable of imputing any such to one whose whole life to use his own expression in print of him is a continued series of good and generous actions  i know no man who would be more concerned if he gave the least pain or offense to any innocent person and none who would be less concerned if the satire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it if ever that happens i dare engage he will own it with all the freedom of one whose censures are just and who sets his name to them  to the earl of burlington march        my lord the clamor raised about my epistle to you could not give me so much pain as i received pleasure in seeing the general zeal of the world in the cause of a great man who is beneficient and the particular warmth of your lordship in that of a private man who is innocent  it was not the poem that deserved this from you for as i had the honor to be your friend i could not treat you quite like a poet but sure the writer deserved more candor even from those who knew him not than to promote a report which in regard to that noble person was impertinent in regard to me villainous yet i had no great cause to wonder that a character belonging to twenty should be applied to one since by that means nineteen would escape the ridicule  i was too well content with my knowledge of that noble persons opinion in this affair to trouble the public about it but since malice and mistake are so long a dying i have taken the opportunity of a third edition to declare his belief not only of my innocence but of their malignity of the former of which my own heart is as conscious as i fear some of theirs must of the latter his humanity feels a concern for the injury done to me while his greatness of mind can bear with indifference the insult offered to himself alludes to the letter the duke of ch wrote to mr pope on this occasion a copy of which together with mr popes to his grace we hope to procure for the next volume   however my lord i own that critics of this sort can intimidate me nay half incline me to write no more that would be making the town a compliment which i think it deserves and which some i am sure would take very kindly this way of satire is dangerous as long as slander raised by fools of the lowest rank can find any countenance from those of a higher even from the conduct shown on this occasion i have learnt there are some who would rather be wicked than ridiculous and therefore it may be safer to attack vices than follies i will therefore leave my betters in the quiet possession of their idols their groves and their high places and change my subject from their pride to their meanness from their vanities to their miseries and as the only certain way to avoid misconstructions to lessen offense and not to multiply illnaturd applications i may probably in my next make use of real names and not of fictitious ones this he did in his next piece which was the epistle to the lord bathurst of the use of riches   i am my lord your faithful affectionate servant a pope  dr arbuthnot to mr pope hampstead july        o dear sir i little doubt of your kind concern for me nor of that of the lady you mention i have nothing to repay my friends with at present but prayers and good wishes i have the satisfaction to find that i am as officiously served by my friends as he that has thousands to leave in legacies besides the assurance of their sincerity god almighty has made my bodily distress as easy as a thing of that nature can be i have found some relief at least sometimes from the air of this place my nights are bad but many poor creatures have worse  as for you my good friend i think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little suspicions or jealousies that often affect the sincerest friendships i am sure not on my side i must be so sincere as to own that though i could not help valuing you for those talents which the world prizes yet they were not the foundation of my friendship they were quite of another sort nor shall i at present offend you by enumerating them and i make it my last request that you continue that noble disdain and abhorrence of vice which you seem naturally endud with but still with a due regard to your own safety and study more to reform than chastise though the one often cannot be effected without the other  lord bathurst i have always honored for every good quality that a person of his rank ought to have pray give my respects and kindest wishes to the family my venison stomach is gone but i have those about me and often with me who will be very glad of his present if it is left at my house it will be transmitted safe to me  a recovery in my case and at my age is impossible the kindest wish of my friends is euthanasia living or dying i shall always be  your most faithful friend and humble servant jo arbuthnot  finis
