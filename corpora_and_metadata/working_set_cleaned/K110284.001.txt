part of the poetical works of mr shenstone particularly his elegies and pastorals are as he himself expresses it the exact transcripts of the situation of his own mind and abound in frequent allusions to his own place the beautiful scene of his retirement from the world exclusively therefore of our natural curiosity to be acquainted with the history of an author whose works we peruse with pleasure some short account of mr shenstones personal character and situation in life may not only be agreeable but absolutely necessary to the reader as it is impossible he should enter into the true spirit of his writings if he is entirely ignorant of those circumstances of his life which sometimes so greatly influenced his reflections  i could wish however that this task had been allotted to some person capable of performing it in that masterly manner which the subject so well deserves to confess the truth it was chiefly to prevent his remains from falling into the hands of any one still less qualified to do him justice that i have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them myself  mr shenstone was the eldest son of a plain uneducated gentleman in shropshire who farmed his own estate the father sensible of his sons extraordinary capacity resolved to give him a learned education and sent him a commoner to pembroke college in oxford designing him for the church but though he had the most awful notions of the wisdom power and goodness of god he never could be persuaded to enter into orders in his private opinions he adhered to no particular sect and hated all religious disputes but whatever were his own sentiments he always showed great tenderness to those who differed from him tenderness indeed in every sense of the word was his peculiar characteristic his friends his domestics his poor neighbors all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind indeed this virtue in him was often carried to such excess that it sometimes bordered upon weakness yet if he was convinced that any of those ranked amongst the number of his friends had treated him ungenerously he was not easily reconciled he used a maxim however on such occasions which is worthy of being observed and imitated i never said he will be a revengeful enemy but i cannot it is not in my nature to be half a friend he was in his temper quite unsuspicious but if suspicion was once awakened in him it was not laid asleep again without difficulty  he was no economist the generosity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper regard to the use of money he exceeded therefore the bounds of his paternal fortune which before he died was considerably incumbered but when one recollects the perfect paradise he had raised around him the hospitality with which he lived his great indulgence to his servants his charities to the indigent and all done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds a year one should rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him than to blame his want of economy he left however more than sufficient to pay all his debts and by his will appropriated his whole estate for that purpose  it was perhaps from some considerations on the narrowness of his fortune that he forbore to marry for he was no enemy to wedlock had a high opinion of many among the fair sex was fond of their society and no stranger to the tenderest impressions one which he received in his youth was with difficulty surmounted the lady was the subject of that sweet pastoral in four parts which has been so universally admired and which one would have thought must have subdued the loftiest heart and softened the most obdurate  his person as to height was above the middle stature but largely and rather inelegantly formed his face seemed plain till you conversed with him and then it grew very pleasing in his dress he was negligent even to a fault though when young at the university he was accounted a beau he wore his own hair which was quite gray very early in a particular manner not from any affectation of singularity but from a maxim he had laid down that without too slavish a regard to fashion every one should dress in a manner most suitable to his own person and figure in short his faults were only little blemishes thrown in by nature as it were on purpose to prevent him from rising too much above that level of imperfection allotted to humanity  his character as a writer will be distinguished by simplicity with elegance and genius with correctness he had a sublimity equal to the highest attempts yet from the indolence of his temper he chose rather to amuse himself in culling flowers at the foot of the mount than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous steeps of parnassus but whenever he was disposed to rise his steps though natural were noble and always well supported in the tenderness of elegiac poetry he has not been excelled in the simplicity of pastoral one may venture to say he had very few equals of great sensibility himself he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers and amidst the nicest attention to the harmony of his numbers he always took care to express with propriety the sentiments of an elegant mind in all his writings his greatest difficulty was to please himself i remember a passage in one of his letters where speaking of his love songs he says  some were written on occasions a good deal imaginary others not so and the reason there are so many is that i wanted to write one good song and could never please myself it was this diffidence which occasioned him to throw aside many of his pieces before he had bestowed upon them his last touches i have suppressed several on this account and if among those which i have selected there should be discovered some little want of his finishing polish i hope it will be attributed to this cause and of course be excused yet i flatter myself there will always appear something well worthy of having been preserved and though i was afraid of inserting what might injure the character of my friend yet as the sketches of a great master are always valuable i was unwilling the public should lose any thing material of so accomplished a writer in this dilemma it will easily be conceived that the task i had to perform would become somewhat difficult how i have acquitted myself the public must judge nothing however except what he had already published has been admitted without the advice of his most judicious friends nothing altered without their particular concurrence it is impossible to please every one but it is hoped that no reader will be so unreasonable as to imagine that the author wrote solely for his amusement his talents were various and though it may perhaps be allowed that his excellence chiefly appeared in subjects of tenderness and simplicity yet he frequently condescended to trifle with those of humor and drollery these indeed he himself in some measure degraded by the title which he gave them of levities but had they been entirely rejected the public would have been deprived of some jeux desprits excellent in their kind and mr shenstones character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited  but the talents of mr shenstone were not confined merely to poetry his character as a man of clear judgment and deep penetration will best appear from his prose works it is there we must search for the acuteness of his understanding and his profound knowledge of the human heart it is to be lamented indeed that some things here are unfinished and can be regarded only as fragments many are left as single thoughts but which like the sparks of diamonds show the richness of the mine to which they belong or like the foot of a hercules discover the uncommon strength and extraordinary dimensions of that hero i have no apprehension of incurring blame from any one for preserving these valuable remains they will discover to every reader the authors sentiments on several important subjects and there can be very few to whom they will not impart many thoughts which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the source of their own reflections  but i believe little need be said to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention his character is already sufficiently established and if he be not injured by the inability of his editor there is no doubt but he will ever maintain an eminent station among the best of our english writers  r dodsley  a prefatory essay on elegy it is observable that discourses prefixed to poetry are contrived very frequently to inculcate such tenets as may exhibit the performance to the greatest advantage the fabric is very commonly raised in the first place and the measures by which we are to judge of its merit are afterward adjusted  there have been few rules given us by the critics concerning the structure of elegiac poetry and far be it from the author of the following trifles to dignify his own opinions with that denomination he would only intimate the great variety of subjects and the different styles this essay was written near twenty years ago in which the writers of elegy have hitherto indulged themselves and endeavor to shield the following ones by the latitude of their example  if we consider the etymology of the word elegein eparticulam dolendi  the epithet which horace gives it miserabiles elegos hor  or the confession which ovid makes concerning it heu nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit ovid de morte tibulli  i think we may conclude thus much however that elegy in its true and genuine acceptance includes a tender and querulous idea that it looks upon this as its peculiar characteristic and so long as this is thoroughly sustained admits of a variety of subjects which by its manner of treating them it renders its own it throws its melancholystole over pretty differentobjects which like the dresses at a funeral procession gives them all a kind of solemn and uniform appearance  it is probable that elegies were written at first upon the death of intimate friends and near relations celebrated beauties or favorite mistresses beneficent governors and illustrious men one may add perhaps of all those who are placed by virgil in the laurel grove of his elysium  vide hurds dissertation on horaces epistle quique sui memores alios secere merendo after these subjects were sufficiently exhausted and the severity of fate displayed in the most affecting instances the poets sought occasion to vary their complaints and the next tender species of sorrow that presented itself was the grief of absent or neglected lovers and this indulgence might be indeed allowed them but with this they were not contented they had obtained a small corner in the province of love and they took advantage from thence to overrun the whole territory they sung its spoils triumphs ovations and rejoicings dicite io paean et io bis dicite paean ovid  as well as the captivity and exequies that attended it they gave the name of elegy to their pleasantries as well as lamentations till at last through their abundant fondness for the myrtle they forgot that the cypress was their peculiar garland  in this it is probable they deviated from the original design of elegy and it should seem that any kind of subjects treated in such a manner as to diffuse a pleasing melancholy might far better deserve the name than the facetious mirth and libertine festivity of the successful votaries of love  but not to dwell too long upon an opinion which may seem perhaps introduced to favor the following performance it may not be improper to examine into the use and end of elegy the most important end of all poetry is to encourage virtue epic and tragedy chiefly recommend the public virtues elegy is of a species which illustrates and endears the private there is a truly virtuous pleasure connected with many pensive contemplations which it is the province and excellency of elegy to enforce this by presenting suitable ideas has discovered sweets in melancholy which we could not find in mirth and has led us with success to the dusty urn when we could draw no pleasure from the sparkling bowl as pastoral conveys an idea of simplicity and innocence it is in particular the task and merit of elegy to show the innocence and simplicity of rural life to advantage and that in a way distinct from pastoral as much as the plain but judicious landlord may be imagined to surpass his tenant both in dignity and understanding it should also tend to elevate the more tranquil virtues of humility disinterestedness simplicity and innocence but then there is a degree of elegance and refinement no way inconsistent with these rural virtues and that raises elegy above that merum rus that unpolished rusticity which has given our pastoral writers their highest reputation  wealth and splendour will never want their proper weight the danger is lest they should too much preponderate a kind of poetry therefore which throws its chief influence into the otherscale that magnifies the sweets of liberty and independence that endears the honest delights of love and friendship that celebrates the glory of a good name after death that ridicules the futile arrogance of birth that recommends the innocent amusement of letters and insensibly prepares the mind for that humanity it inculcates such a kind of poetry may chance to please and if it please should seem to be of service  as to the style of elegy it may be well enough determined from what has gone before it should imitate the voice and language of grief or if a metaphor of dress be more agreeable it should be simple and diffuse and flowing as a mourners veil a versification therefore is desirable which by indulging a free and unconstrained expression may admit of that simplicity which elegy requires  heroic meter with alternate rhyme seems well enough adapted to this species of poetry and however exceptionable upon other occasions its inconveniences appear to lose their weight in shorter elegies and its advantages seem to acquire an additional importance the world has an admirable example of its beauty in a collection of elegies nb this preface was written near twenty years ago not long since published the product of a gentleman of the most exact taste and whose untimely death merits all the tears that elegy can shed  it is not impossible that some may think this meter too lax and prosaic others that even a more dissolute variety of numbers may have superior advantages and in favor of these last might be produced the example of milton in his lycidas together with one or two recent and beautiful imitations of his versification in that monody but this kind of argument i am apt to think must prove too much since the writers i have in view seem capable enough of recommending any meter they shall choose though it must be owned also that the choice they make of any is at the same time the strongest presumption in its favor  perhaps it may be no great difficulty to compromise the dispute there is no one kind of meter that is distinguished by rhymes but is liable to some objection or other heroic verse where every second line is terminated by a rhyme with which the judgment requires that the sense should in some measure also terminate is apt to render the expression either scanty or constrained and this is sometimes observable in the writings of a poet lately deceased though i believe no one ever threw so much sense together with so much ease into a couplet as mr pope but as an air of constraint too often accompanies this meter it seems by no means proper for a writer of elegy  the previous rhyme in miltons lycidas is very frequently placed at such a distance from the following that it is often dropped by the memory much better employed in attending to the sentiment before it be brought to join its partner and this seems to be the greatest objection to that kind of versification but then the peculiar ease and variety it admits of are no doubt sufficient to overbalance the objection and to give it the preference to any other in an elegy of length  the chief exception to which stanza of all kinds is liable is that it breaks the sense too regularly when it is continued through a long poem and this may be perhaps the fault of mr wallers excellent panegyric but if this fault be less discernible in smaller compositions as i suppose it is i flatter myself that the advantages i have before mentioned resulting from alternate rhyme with which stanza is i think connected may at least in shorter elegies be allowed to outweigh its imperfections  i shall say but little of the different kinds of elegy the melancholy of a lover is different no doubt from what we feel on other mixed occasions the mind in which love and grief at once predominate is softened to an excess loveelegy therefore is more negligent of order and design and being addressed chiefly to the ladies requires little more than tenderness and perspicuity elegies that are formed upon promiscuous incidents and addressed to the world in general inculcate some sort of moral and admit a different degree of reasoning thought and order  the author of the following elegies entered on his subjects occasionally as particular incidents in life suggested or dispositions of mind recommended them to his choice if he describes a rural landscape or unfolds the train of sentiments it inspired he fairly drew his picture from the spot and felt very sensibly the affection he communicates if he speaks of his humble shed his flocks and his fleeces he does not counterfeit the scene who having whether through choice or necessity is not material retired betimes to country solitudes and sought his happiness in rural employments has a right to consider himself as a real shepherd the flocks the meadows and the grottos are his own and the embellishment of his farm his sole amusement as the sentiments therefore were inspired by nature and that in the earlier part of his life he hopes they will retain a natural appearance diffusing at least some part of that amusement which he freely acknowledges he received from the composition of them  there will appear perhaps a real inconsistency in the moral tenor of the several elegies and the subsequent ones may sometimes seem a recantation of the preceding the reader will scarcely impute this to oversight but will allow that mens opinions as well as tempers vary that neither public nor private active nor speculative life are unexceptionably happy and consequently that any change of opinion concerning them may afford an additional beauty to poetry as it gives us a more striking representation of life  if the author has hazarded throughout the use of english or modern allusions he hopes it will not be imputed to an entire ignorance or to the least disesteem of the ancient learning he has kept the ancient plan and method in his eye though he builds his edifice with the materials of his own nation in other words through a fondness for his native country he has made use of the flowers it produced though in order to exhibit them to the greater advantage he has endeavored to weave his garland by the best model he could find with what success beyond his own amusement must be left to judges less partial to him than either his acquaintance or his friends  if any of those should be so candid as to approve the variety of subjects he has chosen and the tenderness of sentiment he has endeavored to impress he begs the meter also may not be too suddenly condemned the public ear habituated of late to a quicker measure may perhaps consider this as heavy and languid but an objection of that kind may gradually lose its force if this measure should be allowed to suit the nature of elegy  if it should happen to be considered as an objection with others that there is too much of a moral cast dissused through the whole it is replied that he endeavored to animate the poetry so far as not to render this objection too obvious or to risk excluding the fashionable reader at the same time never deviating from a fixed principle that poetry without morality is but the blossom of a fruittree poetry is indeed like that species of plants which may bear at once both fruits and blossoms and the tree is by no means in perfection without the former however it may be embellished by the flowers which surround it  advertisement to the reader to this edition is subjoined for the sake of those readers to whom it may not prove unwelcome an explanation or rather in most places a liberal imitation of all the latin inscriptions and quotations throughout this work by mr hull that gentlemans wellknown friendship for mr shenstone and willingness to oblige being his sole inducements to this as he chooses to have it called trifling addition the editor thinks it no more than a just return of gratitude to let his purchasers know to whom they are beholden for it be it remembered however that it was executed in a country retirement where our eminent translators of the classics were not at hand to be consulted  a description of the leasowes the following description was intended to give a friend some idea of the leasowes  which having been so justly admired by persons of the best taste and celebrated by the muse of such an original genius as mr shenstone it is hoped the public will not be displeased with this slight attempt to perpetuate those beauties which time or the different taste of some future possessor may destroy  the seat of the late william shenstone esquire by r dodsley the leasowes is situate in the parish of hales owen a small market town in the county of salop but surrounded by other counties and thirty miles from shrewsbury as it is near ten to the borders of shropshire though a paternal estate it was never distinguished for any peculiar beauties till the time of its late owner it was reserved for a person of his ingenuity both to discover and improve them which he has done so effectually that it is now considered as amongst the principal of those delightful scenes which persons of taste in the present age are desirous to see far from violating its natural beauties mr shenstones only study was to give them their full effect and although the form in which things now appear be indeed the consequence of much thought and labor yet the hand of art is no way visible either in the shape of ground the disposition of trees or which are here so numerous and striking the romantic fall of his cascades  but i will now proceed to a more particular description about half a mile short of hales owen in your way from birmingham to bewdley you quit the great road and turn into a green lane on the left hand where descending in a winding manner to the bottom of a deep valley finely shaded the first object that occurs is a kind of ruinated wall and a small gate within an arch inscribed the priory gate here it seems the company should properly begin their walk but generally choose to go up with their horses or equipage to the house from whence returning they descend back into the valley passing through a small gate at the bottom of the fine swelling lawn that surrounds the house you enter upon a winding path with a piece of water on your right the path and water overshadowed with trees that grow upon the slopes of this narrow dingle render the scene at once cool gloomy solemn and sequestered and form so striking a contrast to the lively scene you have just left that you seem all on a sudden landed in a subterraneous kind of region winding forward down the valley you pass beside a small roothouse where on a tablet are these lines  here in cool grot and mossy cell  we rural fays and faeries dwell  though rarely seen by mortal eye  when the pale moon ascending high  darts through yon limes her quivering beams  we frisk it near these crystal streams  her beams reflected from the wave  afford the light our revels crave  the turf with daisies broiderd over  exceeds we wot the parian floor  nor yet for artful strains we call  but listen to the waters fall  would you then taste our tranquil scene  be sure your bosoms be serene  devoid of hate devoid of strife  devoid of all that poisons life  and much it vails you in their place  to graft the love of human race  and tread with awe these favored bowers  nor wound the shrubs nor bruise the flowers  so may your path with sweets abound  so may your couch with rest be crowned  but harm betide the wayward swain  who dares our hallowed haunts profane   these sentiments correspond as well as possible with the ideas we form of the abode of fairies and appearing deep in this romantic valley serve to keep alive such enthusiastic images while this sort of scene continues  you now pass through the priory gate before mentioned and are admitted into a part of the valley somewhat different from the former tall trees high irregular ground and rugged scars the right presents you with perhaps the most natural if not the most striking of the many cascades here found the left with a sloping grove of oaks and the center with a pretty circular landscape appearing through the trees of which hales owen steeple and other objects at a distance form an interesting part the seat beneath the ruinated wall has these lines of virgil inscribed suiting well with the general tenor of mr shenstones late situation   lucis habitamus opacis  riparumque toros et prata recentia rivis  incolimus imitation  we dwell in shady groves and seek the groves with cooling streams refreshed and trace the verdant banks       you now proceed a few paces down the valley to another bench where you have this cascade in front which together with the internal arch and other appendages make a pretty irregular picture i must observe once for all that a number of these protempore benches two stumps with a transverse board seem chiefly intended as hints to spectators lest in passing cursorily through the farm they might suffer any of that immense variety the place furnishes to escape their notice the stream attending us with its agreeable murmurs as we descend along this pleasing valley we come next to a small seat where we have a sloping grove upon the right and on the left a striking vista to the steeple of hales owen which is here seen in a new light we now descend farther down this shady and sequestered valley accompanied on the right by the same brawling rivulet running over pebbles till it empties itself into a fine piece of water at the bottom the path here winding to the left conforms to the water before mentioned running round the foot of a small hill and accompanying this semicircular lake into another winding valley somewhat more open and not less pleasing than the former however before we enter this it will be proper to mention a seat about the center of this waterscene where the ends of it are lost in the two valleys on each side and in front it is invisibly connected with another piece of water of about twenty acres open to mr shenstone but not his property this last was a performance of the monks and part of a prodigious chain of fish ponds that belonged to hales abbey the back ground of this scene is very beautiful and exhibits a picture of villages and varied ground finely held up to the eye  i speak of all this as already finished but through some misfortune in the mound that pounds up the water it is not completed  we now leave the priory upon the left which is not meant for an object here and wind along into the other valley and here i cannot but take notice of the judgment which formed this piece of water for although it be not very large yet as it is formed by the concurrence of three valleys in which two of the ends are hid and in the third it seems to join with the large extent of water below it is to all appearance unbounded i must confess i never saw a more natural bed for water or any kind of lake that pleased me better but it may be right to mention that this water in its full extent has a yet more important effect from mr shenstones house where it is seen to a great advantage we now by a pleasing serpentine walk enter a narrow glade in the valley the slopes on each side finely covered with oaks and beeches on the left of which is a common bench which affords a retiring place secluded from every eye and a short respite during which the eye reposes on a fine amphitheatre of wood and thicket  we now proceed to a seat beneath a prodigiously fine canopy of spreading oak on the back of which is this inscription  huc ades o meliboee caper tibi salvus et hoedi  et si quid cessare potes requiesce sub umbra imitation hither o meliboeus bend thy way thy herds thy goats secure from harm repose if happy leisure serve a while to stay here rest thy limbs beneath these shady boughs     the picture before it is that of a beautiful homescene a small lawn of wellvaried ground encompassed with hills and wellgrown oaks and embellished with a cast of the piping faunus amid trees and shrubs on a slope upon the left and on the right and nearer the eye with an urn thus inscribed  ingenio et amicitiae and on the opposite side  g s posvit translation to the genius and friendship sprinkling the ashes of a friendly bard with tributary tears     the scene is enclosed on all sides by trees in the middle only there is an opening where the lawn is continued and winds out of sight  here entering a gate you are led through a thicket of many sorts of willows into a large roothouse inscribed to the right honorable the earl of stamford it seems that worthy peer was present at the first opening of the cascade which is the principal object from the roothouse where the eye is presented with a fairy vision consisting of an irregular and romantic fall of water very unusual one hundred and fifty yards in continuity and a very striking scene it affords other cascades may possibly have the advantage of a greater descent and a larger torrent but a more wild and romantic appearance of water and at the same time strictly natural is what i never saw in any place whatever this scene though comparatively small is yet aggrandized with so much art that we forget the quantity of water which flows through this close and overshaded valley and are so much transported with the intricacy of scene and the concealed height from whence it flows that we without reflection add the idea of magnificence to that of beauty in short it is not but upon reflection that we find the stream is not a niagara but rather a waterfall in miniature and that the same artifice upon a larger scale were there large trees instead of small ones and a river instead of a rill would be capable of forming a scene that would exceed the utmost of our ideas but i will not dwell longer upon this inimitable scene those who would admire it properly must view it as surely as those that view it must admire it beyond almost any thing they ever saw  proceeding on the right hand path the next seat affords a scene of what mr shenstone used to call his forest ground consisting of wild green slopes peeping through dingle or irregular groupes of trees a confused mixture of savage and cultivated ground held up to the eye and forming a landscape fit for the pencil of salvator rosa  winding on beside this lawn which is overarched with spreading trees the eye catches at intervals over an intermediate hill the spire of hales church forming here a perfect obelisk  the urn to mr somerville etc and now passing through a kind of thicket we arrive at a natural bower of almost circular oaks inscribed in the manner following  to mr dodsley  come then my friend thy sylvan taste display  come hear thy faunus tune his rustic lay  ah rather come and in these dells disown  the care of other strains and tune thine own   on the bank above it amid the forementioned shrubs is a statue of the piping faun which not only embellishes this scene but is also seen from the court before the house and from other places it is surrounded by venerable oaks and very happily situated from this bower also you look down upon the forementioned irregular ground shut up with trees on all sides except some few openings to the more pleasing parts of this grotesque and hilly country the next little bench affords the first but not most striking view of the priory it is indeed a small building but seen as it is beneath trees and its extremity also hid by the same it has in some sort the dignity and solemn appearance of a larger edifice  passing through a gate we enter a small open grove where the first seat we find affords a picturesque view through trees of a clump of oaks at a distance overshadowing a little cottage upon a green hill we thence immediately enter a perfect dome or circular temple of magnificent beeches in the center of which it was intended to place an antique altar or a statue of pan the path serpentizing through this open grove leads us by an easy ascent to a small bench with this motto   me gelidum nemus  nympharumque leves cum satyris chori  secernant populo explanation  may the cool grove and gay assembled nymphs with sylvans mixed conceal me from the world     hor which alludes to the retired situation of the grove there is also seen through an opening to the left a pleasing landscape of a distant hill with a whited farmhouse upon the summit and to the right hand a beautiful round slope crowned with a clump of large firs with a pyramidal seat on its center to which after no long walk the path conduct us  but we first come to another view of the priory more advantageous and at a better distance to which the eye is led down a green slope through a scenery of tall oaks in a most agreeable manner the grove we have just passed on one side and a hill of trees and thicket on the other conducting the eye to a narrow opening through which it appears  we now ascend to a small bench where the circumjacent country begins to open in particular a glasshouse appears between two large clumps of trees at about the distance of four miles the glasshouses in this country not ill resembling a distant pyramid ascending to the next seat which is in the gothic form the scene grows more and more extended woods and lawns hills and valleys thicket and plain agreeably intermingled on the back of this seat is the following inscription which the author told me that he chose to fix here to supply what he thought some want of life in this part of the farm and to keep up the spectators attention till he came to scale the hill beyond  inscription  shepherd would thou here obtain  pleasure unalloyd with pain  joy that suits the rural sphere  gentle shepherd lend an ear  learn to relish calm delight  verdant vales and fountains bright  trees that nod on sloping hills  caves that echo tinkling rills  if thou can no charm disclose  in the simplest bud that blows  go forsake thy plain and fold  join the crowd and toil for gold  tranquil pleasures never cloy  banish each tumultuous joy  all but love  for love inspires  fonder wishes warmer fires  love and all its joys be thine   yet ere thou the reins resign  hear what reason seems to say  hear attentive and obey  crimson leaves the rose adorn  but beneath them lurks a thorn  fair and flowery is the brake  yet it hides the vengeful snake  think not she whose empty pride  dares the fleecy garb deride  think not she who light and vain  scorns the sheep can love the swain  artless deed and simple dress  mark the chosen shepherdess  thoughts by decency controlled  well conceived and freely told  sense that shuns each conscious air  wit that falls ere well aware  generous pity prone to sigh  if her kid or lambkin die  let not lucre let not pride  draw thee from such charms aside  have not those their proper sphere  gentler passions triumph here  see to sweeten thy repose  the blossom buds the fountain flows  lo to crown thy healthful board  all that milk and fruits afford  seek no more  the rest is vain  pleasure ending soon in pain  anguish lightly gilded over  close thy wish and seek no more   and now passing through a wicket the path winds up the back part of a circular green hill discovering little of the country till you enter a clump of stately firs upon the summit overarched by these firs is an octagonal seat the back of which is so contrived as to form a table or pedestal for a bowl or goblet thus inscribed   to all friends round the wrekin this facetious inscription being an old shropshire health is a commemoration of his country friends from which this part of shropshire is divided add to this that the wrekin that large and venerable hill appears full in front at the distance of about thirty miles  the scene is a very fine one divided by the firs into several compartments each answering to the octagonal seat in the center to each of which is allotted a competent number of striking objects to make a complete picture a long serpentine stream washes the foot of this hill and is lost behind trees at one end and a bridge thrown over at the other over this the eye is carried from very romantic homescenes to very beautiful ones at a distance it is impossible to give an idea of that immense variety that fine configuration of parts which engage our attention from this place in one of the compartments you have a simple scene of a cottage and a road winding behind a farmhouse half covered with trees upon the top of some wild sloping ground and in another a view of the town appearing from hence as upon the shelving banks of a large piece of water in the flat suffice it to say that the hill and vale plain and woodland villages and single houses blue distant mountains that skirt the horizon and green hills romantically jumbled that form the intermediate ground make this spot more than commonly striking  nor is there to be seen an acre of level ground through the large extent to which the eye is carried  hence the path winds on betwixt two small benches each of which exhibits a pleasing landscape which cannot escape the eye of a connoisseur  here we wind through a small thicket and soon enter a cavity in the hill filled with trees in the center of which is a seat from whence is discovered gleaming across the trees a considerable length of the serpentine stream before mentioned running under a slight rustic bridge to the right hence we ascend in a kind of gothic alcove looking down a slope sided with large oaks and tall beeches which together overarch the scene on the back of this building is found the following  inscription  o you that bathe in courtlye bliss  or toil in fortunes giddy sphere  do not too rashlye deem amysse  of him that bydes contented here  nor yet disdeigne the russet stoale  which over each careless lymbe he flyngs  nor yet deryde the beechen bowl  in which he quaffs the lympid springs  forgive him if at eve or dawne  devoide of worldly cark he stray  or all beside some flowerye lawne  he waste his inoffensive day  so may he pardonne fraud and strife  if such in courtlye haunt he see  for faults there been in busye life  from which these peaceful glennes are free   below this alcove is a large sloping lawn finely bounded crossed by the serpentine water before mentioned and interspersed with single or clumps of oaks at agreeable distances further on the scene is finely varied the hills rising and falling toward the opposite concavities by the side of a long winding vale with the most graceful confusion among other scenes that form this landscape a fine hanging wood backed and contrasted with a wild heath intersected with cross roads is a very considerable object near adjoining to this is a seat from whence the water is seen to advantage in many different stages of its progress or where as a poetical friend once observed the proprietor has taken the naiad by the hand and led her an irregular dance into the valley  proceeding hence through a wicket we enter upon another lawn beyond which is a new theater of wild shaggy precipices hanging coppice ground and smooth round hills between being not only different but even of an opposite character to the ground from which we passed walking along the head of this lawn we come to a seat under a spreading beech with this  inscription  hoc erat in votis modus agri non ita magnus  hortus ubi et tecto vicinus jugis aquae fons  et paulum sylvae super his foret auctius atque  dii melius fecere    imitation this was my wish  an humble spot of ground a garden welldisposd and fenced around a bubbling fountain to my dwelling nigh with crystal treasures stored and never dry the whole defended by a modest wood  this was my wish  my wish the gods allowed and even beyond that wish indulgently bestowed   in the center of the hanging lawn before you is discovered the house half hid with trees and bushes a little hanging wood and a piece of winding water issues through a noble clump of large oaks and spreading beeches at the distance of about ten or twelve miles lord stamfords grounds appear and beyond these the clee hills in shropshire the scene here consists of admirablyvaried ground and is i think a very fine one hence passing still along the top of the lawn we cross another gate and behind the fence being to descend into the valley about half way down is a small bench which throws the eye upon a near scene of hanging woods and shaggy wild declivities intermixed with smooth green slopes and scenes of cultivation  we now return again into the great lawn at bottom and soon come to a seat which gives a nearer view of the water before mentioned between the trunks of high overshadowing oaks and beeches beyond which the winding line of trees is continued down the valley to the right to the left at a distance the top of clent hill appears and the house upon a swell amidst trees and bushes in the center the eye is carried by a sideling view down a length of lawn till it rests upon the town and spire of hales with some picturesque and beautiful ground rising behind it  somewhat out of the path and in the center of a noble clump of stately beeches is a seat inscribed to mr spence in these words iosepho spence explanation dedicated by friendship     we now through a small gate enter what is called the lovers walk and proceed immediately to a seat where the water is seen very advantageously at full length which though not large is so agreeably shaped and has its bounds so well concealed that the beholder may receive less pleasure from many lakes of greater extent the margin on one side is fringed with alders the other is overhung with most stately oaks and beeches and the middle beyond the water presents the hales owen scene with a group of houses on the slope behind and the horizon well fringed with the wood now winding a few paces round the margin of the water we come to another small bench which presents the former scene somewhat varied with the addition of a whited village among trees upon a hill proceeding on we enter the pleasing gloom of this agreeable walk and come to a bench beneath a spreading beech that overhangs both walk and water which has been called the assignation seat and has this inscription on the back of it  nerine galatea thymo mihi dulcior hyblae  candidior cygnis hedera formosior alba  cum primum pasti repetent praesepia tauri  si qua tui corydonis habet te cura venito imitation o galatea nereus lovely child sweeter than hybla thyme more undefiled than down of swan or ivys purest white when the full oxen warned by fading light home to the stall their sober footsteps bend if damons dear to damons call attend     here the path begins gradually to ascend beneath a depth of shade by the side of which is a small bubbling rill either forming little peninsulas rolling over pebbles or falling down small cascades all under cover and taught to murmur very agreeably this very soft and pensive scene very properly styled the lovers walk is terminated with an ornamented urn inscribed to miss dolman a beautiful and amiable relation of mr shenstones who died of the smallpox about twentyone years of age in the following words on one side peramabili suae consobrinae on the other side ah maria explanation  sacred to the memory  how much inferior     the ascent from hence winds somewhat more steeply to another seat where the eye is thrown over a rough scene of broken and furzy ground upon a piece of water in the flat whose extremities are hid behind trees and shrubs amongst which the house appears and makes upon the whole no unpleasing picture the path still winds under cover up the hill the steep declivity of which is somewhat eased by the serpentine sweep of it till we come to a small bench with this line from popes eloisa  divine oblivion of lowthoughted care the opening before it presents a solitary scene of trees thickets and precipice and terminates upon a green hill with a clump of firs on the top of it  we now find the great use as well as beauty of the serpentine path in climbing up this wood the first seat of which alluding to the rural scene before it has the following lines from virgil   hic latis otia fundis  speluncae vivique lacus hic frigida tempe  mugitusque boum mollesque sub arbore somni imitation here tranquil leisures in the ample field here caves and living lakes their pleasures yield here vales invite where sports the cooling breeze and peaceful sleep beneath embowring trees while lowing herds surround     here the eye looking down a slope beneath the spreading arms of oak and beech trees passes first over some rough furzy ground then over water to the large swelling lawn in the center of which the house is discovered among trees and thickets this forms the fore ground beyond this appears a swell of waste furzy land diversified with a cottage and a road that winds behind a farmhouse and a fine clump of trees the back scene of all is a semicircular range of hills diversified with woods scenes of cultivation and enclosures to about four or five miles distance  still winding up into the wood we come to a slight seat opening through the trees to a bridge of five piers crossing a large piece of water at about half a miles distance the next seat looks down from a considerable height along the side of a steep precipice upon irregular and pleasing ground and now we turn upon a sudden into a long straightlined walk in the wood arched over with tall trees and terminating with a small rustic building though the walk as i said be straightlined yet the base rises and falls so agreeably as leaves no room to censure its formality about the middle of this avenue which runs the whole length of this hanging wood we arrive unexpectedly at a lofty gothic seat whence we look down a slope more considerable than that before mentioned through the wood on each side this view is indeed a fine one the eye first traveling down over wellvariegated ground into the valley where is a large piece of water whose sloping banks give all the appearance of a noble river the ground from hence rises gradually to the top of clent hill at three or four miles distance and the landscape is enriched with a view of hales owen the late lord dudleys house and a large wood of lord lyttletons it is impossible to give an adequate description of this view the beauty of it depending upon the great variety of objects and beautiful shape of ground and all at such a distance as to admit of being seen distinctly  hence we proceed to the rustic building before mentioned a slight and unexpensive edifice formed of rough unhewn stone commonly called here the temple of pan having a trophy of the tibia and syrinx and this inscription over the entrance  pan primus calamos cera conjungere plures  edocuit pan curat oves oviumque magistros imitation pan god of shepherds first inspired our swains their pipes to frame and tune their rural strains pan from impending harm the fold defends and pan the master of the fold befriends     hence mounting once more to the right through this dark umbrageous walk we enter at once upon a lightsome high natural terrace whence the eye is thrown over all the scenes we have seen before together with many fine additional ones and all beheld from a declivity that approaches as near a precipice as is agreeable in the middle is a seat with this inscription divini gloria rvris explanation o glory of the sylvan scene divine    to give a better idea of this by far the most magnificent scene here it were perhaps best to divide it into two distinct parts  the noble concave in the front and the rich valley toward the right  in regard to the former if a boon companion could enlarge his idea of a punchbowl ornamented within with all the romantic scenery the chinese ever yet devised it would perhaps afford him the highest idea he could possibly conceive of earthly happiness he would certainly wish to swim in it suffice it to say that the horizon or brim is as finely varied as the cavity it would be idle here to mention the clee hills the wrekin the welsh mountains or caer caradoc at a prodigious distance which though they finish the scene agreeably should not be mentioned at the leasowes the beauty of which turns chiefly upon distinguishable scenes the valley upon the right is equally enriched and the opposite side thereof well fringed with woods and the high hills on one side this long winding vale rolling agreeably into the hollows on the other but these are a kind of objects which though really noble in the survey will not strike a reader in description as they would a spectator upon the spot  hence returning back into the wood and crossing pans temple we go directly down the slope into another part of mr shenstones grounds the path leading down through very pleasing homescenes of wellshaped ground exhibiting a most perfect concave and unequal till we come at a seat under a noble beech presenting a rich variety of foreground and at perhaps half a miles distance the gothic alcove on a hill well covered with wood a pretty cottage under trees in the more distant part of the concave and a farmhouse upon the right all picturesque objects  the next and the subsequent seat afford pretty much the same scenes a little enlarged with the addition of that remarkable clump of trees called frankly beeches adjoining to the old familyseat of the lyttletons and from whence the present lord lyttleton derives his title  we come now to a handsome gothic screen backed with a clump of firs which throws the eye in front full upon a cascade in the valley issuing from beneath a dark shade of poplars the house appears in the center of a large swelling lawn bushed with trees and thicket the pleasing variety of easy swells and hollows bounded by scenes less smooth and cultivated affords the most delightful picture of domestic retirement and tranquillity  we now descend to a seat enclosed with handsome pales and backed with firs inscribed to lord lyttleton it presents a beautiful view up a valley contracted gradually and ending in a group of most magnificent oaks and beeches the right hand side is enlivened with two striking cascades and a winding stream seen at intervals between tufts of trees and woodland to the left appears the hanging wood already mentioned with the gothic screen on the slope in the center  winding still downwards we come to a small seat where one of the offices of the house and a view of a cottage on very high ground is seen over the tops of the trees of the grove in the adjacent valley giving an agreeable instance of the abrupt inequality of ground in this romantic wellvariegated country the next seat shows another face of the same valley the water gliding calmly along betwixt two seeming groves without any cascade as a contrast to the former one where it was broken by cascades the scene very significantly alluded to by the motto  rura mihi et rigul placeant in vallibus amnes  flumina amem silvasque inglorius imitation woods vales and running streams my mind enchant the woods and streams inglorious let me haunt       we descend now to a beautiful gloomy scene called virgils grove where on the entrance we pass by a small obelisk on the right hand with this inscription p virgilio maroni explanation to note  it was customary with the romans to give a praenomen or first name in the manner of our christian names accordingly virgil had that of publius he derived the addition of maro from his father who was so called    before this is a slight bench where some of the same objects are seen again but in a different point of light it is not very easy either to paint or describe this delightful grove however as the former has been more than once attempted i will hope to apologize for an imperfect description by the difficulty found by those who have aimed to sketch it with their pencil be it therefore first observed that the whole scene is opaque and gloomy consisting of a small deep valley or dingle the sides of which are enclosed with irregular tufts of hazel and other underwood and the whole overshadowed with lofty trees rising out of the bottom of the dingle through which a copious stream makes its way through mossy banks enamelled with primroses and variety of wild wood flowers the first seat we approach is thus inscribed celeberrimo poetae explanation to the much celebrated poet james thomson this seat was placed near his favorite springs by w s     quae tibi quae tali reddam pro carmine dona  nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri  nec percussa juvant fluctu tam littora nec quae  saxosas inter decurrunt fl umina valles imitation how shall i thank thy muse so formed to please for not the whisprings of the southern breeze nor banks stillbeaten by the breaking wave nor limpid rills that pebbly valleys lave yield such delight      this seat is placed upon a steep bank on the edge of the valley from which the eye is here drawn down into the flat below by the light that glimmers in front and by the sound of various cascades by which the winding stream is agreeably broken opposite to this seat the ground rises again in an easy concave to a kind of dripping fountain where a small rill trickles down a rude nich of rockwork through fern liverwort and acquatic weeds the green area in the middle through which the stream winds being as well shaped as can be imagined after falling down these cascades it winds under a bridge of one arch and then empties itself into a small lake which catches it a little below this terminates the scene upon the right and after these objects have for some time amused the spectator his eye rambles to the left where one of the most beautiful cascades imaginable is seen by way of incident through a kind of vista or glade falling down a precipice overarched with trees and strikes us with surprise it is impossible to express the pleasure which one feels on this occasion for though surprise alone is not excellence it may serve to quicken the effect of what is beautiful i believe none ever beheld this grove without a thorough sense of satisfaction and were one to choose any particular spot of this perfectly arcadian farm it should perhaps be this although it so well contrasts both with the terrace and with some other scenes that one cannot wish them ever to be divided we now proceed to a seat at the bottom of a large root on the side of a slope with this inscription  inscription  o let me haunt this peaceful shade  nor let ambition ever invade  the tenants of this leafy bower  that shun her paths and slight her power  hither the peaceful halcyon flies  from social meads and open skies  pleased by this rill her course to steer  and hide her sapphire plumage here  the trout bedroppd with crimson stains  forsakes the rivers proud domains  forsakes the suns unwelcome gleam  to lurk within this humble stream  and sure i hear the naiad say  flow flow my stream this devious way  though lovely soft thy murmurs are  thy waters lovely cool and fair  flow gentle stream nor let the vain  thy small unsullied stores disdain  nor let the pensive sage repine  whose latent course resembles thine   the view from it is a calm tranquil scene of water gliding through sloping ground with a sketch through the trees of the small pond below  the scene in this place is that of water stealing along through a rude sequestered vale the ground on each side covered with weeds and field flowers as that before is kept close shaven farther on we lose all sight of water and only hear the noise without having the appearance a kind of effect which the chinese are fond of producing in what they call their scenes of enchantment we now turn all on a sudden upon the high cascade which we admired before in vista the scene around is quite a grotto of native stone running up it roots of trees overhanging it and the whole shaded over head however we first approach upon the left a chalybeat spring with an iron bowl chained to it and this inscription upon a stone fons ferrvginevs explanation to the goddess    then turning to the right we find a stone seat making part of the aforesaid cave with this wellapplied inscription intus aqvae dulces vivoqve sedilia saxo nympharvm domvs imitation within are wholesome springs and marble seats carved in the living rock of nymphs the blessed retreats     which i have often heard mr shenstone term the definition of a grotto we now wind up a shady path on the left hand and crossing the head of this cascade pass beside the river that supplies it in our way up to the house one seat first occurs under a shady oak as we ascend the hill soon after we enter the shrubbery which half surrounds the house where we find two seats thus inscribed to two of his most particular friends the first thus amicitiae et meritis explanation to the    explanation thee tityrus the pines    and a little further the other with the following inscription amicitiae et meritis explanation to the    from this last is an opening down the valley over a large sliding lawn well edged with oaks to a piece of water crossed by a considerable bridge in the flat  the steeple of hales a village amid trees making on the whole a very pleasing picture thus winding through flowering shrubs beside a menageric for doves we are conducted to the stables but let it not be forgot that on the entrance into this shrubbery the first object that strikes us is a venus de medicis beside a basin of goldfish encompassed round with shrubs and illustrated with the following inscription  semireducta venus explanation venus halfretired     to venus venus here retired  my sober vows i pay  not her on paphian plains admired  the bold

retired to drink large draughts of friendships cordial stream in sweet oblivion wrapped by damons verse and social converse many a summers day romantic wish in vain frail mortals trace the imperfect sketch of human bliss  whilst yet the enraptured sire his wellplannd structure views majestic rising midst his infant groves sees the dark laurel spread its glossy shade its languid bloom the purple

esquire by mr j cunningham i come shepherds well follow the hrse and see our loved corydon laid though sorrow may blemish the verse yet let the sad tribute be paid they called him the pride of the plain in sooth he was gentle and kind he marked in his elegant strain the graces that glowed in his mind ii on purpose he planted yon trees that birds in the covert might dwell he cultured his thyme for the bees but never would rifle their cell ye lambkins that played at his feet go bleat  and your master bemoan his music was artless and sweet his manners as mild as your own iii no verdure shall cover the vale no bloom on the blossoms appear the sweets of the forest shall fail and winter discolor the year no birds in our hedges shall sing our hedges so vocal before since he that should welcome the spring can greet the gay season no more iv his phyllis was fond of his praise and poets came round in a throng they listened and envied his lays but which of them equaled his song ye shepherds henceforward be mute for lost is the pastoral strain so give me my corydons flute and thus  let me break it in twain elegies written on many different occasions tantum inter densas umbrosa

dissembling doubts and tears for praise for flattery sighing sigh forlorn soft as the line of lovesick hammond flows twas his fond heart effusd the melting theme ah never could aonias hill disclose so

pray and all for this  to lead the way such is my theme which means to prove that though we drink or game or love as that or this is most in fashion precedence is our ruling passion when collegestudents take degrees and pay the beadles endless fees what moves that scientific body but the first cutting at a gaudy and whence such shoals in bare conditions that starve and languish as

if your drift i rightly scan you would hint a beau were not a man say women then are fond of places i wave all disputable cases a man perhaps would something linger were his loved rank to cost  a finger or were an ear or toe the price on it he might delibrate once or twice on it perhaps ask gatakers advice on it and many as their frame grows old would hardly purchase it with gold but women wish precedence ever it is their whole lifes supreme endeavor it fires their youth with jealous rage and strongly animates their age perhaps they would not sell outright or maim a limb  that was in

charms of youth when women hid their necks and veiled their faces nor rompd nor raked nor stard at public places nor took the airs of amazons for graces then plain domestic virtues were the mode and wives never dreamed of happiness abroad they loved their children learned no flaunting airs but with the joys of wedlock mixed the cares those times are past  yet sure they merit praise for marriage

hill when damon left his humble bowers to guard his flocks to fence his flowers or check his wandering rill though schooled from fortunes paths to fly the swain beneath each lowering sky would often his fate bemoan that he in sylvan shades forlorn must waste his cheerless even and morn nor praised nor loved nor known no friend to fames obstreprous noise yet to the whispers of her voice soft murmuring not a foe the pleasures he through choice declined when gloomy fogs depressed his mind it grieved him to forego grieved him to lurk the lakes beside where coots in rushy dingles hide and moorcocks shun the day while caitiff bitterns undismayed remark the swains familiar shade and scorn to quit their prey but see the radiant sun once more the brightning face of heaven restore and raise the doubtful dawn and more to gild his rural sphere at once the brightest train appear that ever trod the lawn amazement chilled the shepherds frame to think bridgewaters the duchess of bridgewater

love and admire ah lead forth my flock in the morn and the damps of each evening repel alas i am faint and forlorn  i have bade my dear phyllis farewell since phyllis vouchsafed me a look i never once dreamed of my vine may i lose both my pipe and my crook if i knew of a kid that was mine i prized every hour that went by beyond all that had pleased me before but now they are past and i sigh and i grieve that i prized them no more but why do i languish in vain why wander thus pensively here oh why did i come from the plain where i fed on the smiles of my dear they tell me my favorite maid the pride of that valley is flown alas where with her i have strayed i could wander with pleasure alone when forced the fair nymph to forego what anguish i felt at my heart yet i thought  but it might not be so  twas with pain that she saw me depart she gazed as i slowly withdrew my path i could hardly discern so sweetly she bade me adieu i thought that she bade me return the pilgrim that journeys all day to visit some fardistant shrine if he bear but a relic away is happy nor heard to repine thus widely removed from the fair where my vows my devotion i owe soft hope is the relic i bear and my solace wherever i go ii hope my banks they are furnished with bees whose murmur invites one to sleep my grottoes are shaded with trees and my hills are whiteover with sheep i seldom have met with a loss such health do my fountains bestow my fountains all bordered with moss where the harebells and violets grow not a pine in my grove is there seen but with tendrils of woodbine is bound not a beechs more beautiful green but a sweetbriar entwines it around not my fields in the prime of the year more charms than my cattle unfold not a brook that is limpid and clear but it glitters with fishes of gold one would think she might like to retire to the bower i have labored to rear not a shrub that i heard her admire but i hasted and planted it there o how sudden the jessamine strove with the lilac to render it gay already it calls for my love to prune the wild branches away from the plains from the woodlands and groves what strains of wild melody flow how the nightingales warble their loves from thickets of roses that blow and when her bright form shall appear each bird shall harmoniously join in a concert so soft and so clear as  she may not be fond to resign i have found out a gift for my fair i have found where the woodpigeons breed but let me that plunder forbear she will say twas a barbarous deed for he never could be true she averred who could rob a poor bird of its young and i loved her the more when i heard such tenderness fall from her tongue i have heard her with sweetness unfold how that pity was due to  a dove that it ever attended the bold and she called it the sister of love but her words such a pleasure convey so much i her accents adore let her speak and whatever she say methinks i should love her the more can a bosom so gentle remain unmoved when her corydon sighs will a nymph that is fond of the plain these plains and this valley despise dear regions of silence and shade soft scenes of contentment and ease where i could have pleasingly strayed if aught in her absence could please but where does my phyllida stray and where are her grots and her bowers are the groves and the valleys as gay and the shepherds as gentle as ours the groves may perhaps be as fair and the face of the valleys as fine the swains may in manners compare but their love is not equal to mine iii solicitude why will you my passion reprove why term it a folly to grieve ere i show you the charms of my love she is fairer than you can believe with her mien she enamours the brave with her wit she engages the free with her modesty pleases the grave she is every way pleasing to me o you that have been of her train come and join in my amorous lays i could lay down my life for the swain that will sing but a song in her praise when he sings may the nymphs of the town come trooping and listen the while nay on him let not phyllida frown  but i cannot allow her to smile for when paridel tries in the dance any favor with phyllis to find o how with one trivial glance might she ruin the peace of my mind in ringlets he dresses his hair and his crook is bestudded around and his pipe  oh may phyllis beware of a magic there is in the sound it is his with mock passion to glow it is his in smooth tales to unfold  how her face is as bright as the snow  and her bosom be sure is as cold  how the nightingales labor the strain  with the notes of his charmer to vie  how they vary their accents in vain  repine at her triumphs and die to the grove or the garden he strays and pillages every sweet then suiting the wreath to his lays he throws it at phylliss feet  o phyllis he whispers more fair  more sweet than the jessamines flower  what are pinks in a morn to compare  what is eglantine after a shower  then the lily no longer is white  then the rose is deprived of its bloom  then the violets die with despite  and the woodbines give up their perfume thus glide the soft numbers along and he fancies no shepherd his peer  yet i never should envy the song were not phyllis to lend it an ear let his crook be with hyacinths bound so phyllis the trophy despise let his forehead with laurels be crowned so they shine not in phylliss eyes the language that flows from the heart is a stranger to paridels tongue  yet may she beware of his art or sure i must envy the song iv disappointment ye shepherds give ear to my lay and take no more heed of my sheep they have nothing to do but to stray i have nothing to do but to weep yet do not my folly reprove she was fair  and my passion begun she smiled  and i could not but love she is faithless  and i am undone perhaps i was void of all thought perhaps it was plain to foresee that a nymph so complete would be sought by a swain more engaging than me ah love every hope can inspire it banishes wisdom the while and the lip of the nymph we admire seems for ever adorned with a smile she is faithless and i am undone ye that witness the woes i endure let reason instruct you to shun what it cannot instruct you to cure beware how you loiter in vain amid nymphs of an higher degree it is not for me to explain how fair and how fickle they be alas from the day that we met what hope of an end to my woes when i cannot endure to forget the glance that undid my repose yet time may diminish the pain the flower and the shrub and the tree which i reared for her pleasure in vain in time may have comfort for me the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose the sound of a murmuring stream the peace which from solitude flows henceforth shall be corydons theme high transports are shown to the sight but we are not to find them our own fate never bestowed such delight as i with my phyllis had known o ye woods spread your branches apace to your deepest recesses i fly i would hide with the beasts of the chase i would vanish from every eye yet my reed shall resound through the grove with the same sad complaint it begun how she smiled and i could not but love was faithless and i am undone contents
