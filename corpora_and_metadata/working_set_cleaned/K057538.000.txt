the necessity and usefulness of the dispensaries lately set up by the college of physicians in london for the use of the sick poor  together with an answer to all the objections raised against them by the apothecaries or others  the necessity and usefulness of the dispensaries the practice of physic in london and seven miles round being for near two hundred years settled by law wholly in the college of physicians in london and such as they approve of upon examination and license it is worth the while to enquire by what means they come to enjoy so small a part of it chemists and distillers astrologers and mountebanks midwives and nurses and the whole train of brokentradesmendoctors have every one their share there are not a few that are their own doctors and practice upon themselves and there is hardly any one so unkind as not to recommend to his sick friend what has done himself good the college can only blame these last for indiscretion and the former are the most of them hardly worth the charge of a prosecution yet the college have been ever and anon making an example of one or other of them to strike terror into the rest  but when i have reckoned up these and as many more such as these they have hardly all of them invaded the tenth part of the practice that one single sort of men have usurpt viz the apothecaries and these not only practice but pretend to a right and to a necessity so to do as to their right though the honorable court of kings bench have more than once quasht that pretense and have sufficiently determined the matter against them yet i shall presume to give a touch at it afterward in this paper but as to the necessity which they plead i will consider that here  they plead a necessity to practice upon the rich because many times they cannot persuade these to send for a physician when yet it is necessary that something should be done and therefore they must do it now this seems a very odd way of arguing that if the patient will not send for a physician the apothecary must needs undertake the cure for if the patient be covetous or foolhardy or will not believe himself ill enough to have the advice of a physician what is that to the apothecary yes for if one apothecary will not give him something another will and so the first shall lose a patient this i must confess is a kind of necessity se defendendo for one apothecary to defend himself from the invasion of another but this is far from proving a necessity with respect to the patient who i dare say had generally much better be without any of them  another necessity to practice upon the rich is when they are taken suddenly ill and no physician can be met with as to practicing in this case of necessity so long as such necessity lasts i dare secure the apothecaries or any other person that does his best in such urgent cases that they shall never be troubled for it by the college but this necessity is far from justifying the apothecaries continuing to practice even upon such patients from day to day when better advice may be had  these two cases i think are the only ones for which they can plead necessity with respect to their practicing upon the rich and how far they are from excusing or justifying their practicing upon any such for weeks or months together as they commonly do is too obvious to be farther examined  but then how shall i get over the other necessity the great necessity with respect to the poor who if you will believe the apothecaries would all perish for want of looking to if they did not take care of them for the physicians of the college they say will only visit the rich that can fee them well  i believe this accusation of the collegephysicians was never true but that for several years bypast it has been notoriously false is known to the whole town for that the physicians might clear themselves of this false charge they have been obliged to set their care of the poor more in the eyes of the world than heretofore not only giving advice gratis to the poor at their own and the patients lodgings but appointing public dispensaries also for the poor to resort to every day of the week except sundays where they may both have the best advice gratis and also proper medicines for their respective cases at the lowest value whereby the poor are at once delivered from the danger of the apothecaries ignorance in practice and also from the oppressive charge of his medicines  and the college have been forced to take this course not only to clear themselves of the aspersions cast upon them but also to make their charity in advising gratis truly serviceable to the poor for unless physicians could teach the poor to make something themselves their advice was seldom followed because the apothecaries used to make them pay so dear for their physic and could by no overtures or arguments be induced to abate of their prices though often pressed to it by the physicians as clearly appears in a paper some years ago published under the title of a short account of the proceedings of the college of physicians london in relation to the sick poor of the said city etc  and notwithstanding that the physicians as appears in the said paper were so forward to advise the poor gratis and the apothecaries so backward in contributing their part yet these did not only continue to insinuate to the town that the care of the poor lay wholly upon them but when about seven years ago they petitioned the high court of parliament to be exempted from offices as the physicians are they had the confidence to suggest the same there also and endeavored to get a clause in their bill that they might have liberty to give physic to the poor who otherwise were like to perish for want of due care to be taken of them  the physicians being thus unjustly calumniated before the whole nation twas high time for them to think of an effectual remedy wherefore dec         a proposal was made in the public college for a subscription by the several members thereof to raise a fund for the furnishing a repository of medicines for the use of the poor which proposal was then approved of and a subscription immediately made to the effect following  whereas the several orders of the college of physicians london for prescribing medicines gratis to the poor sick of the cities of london and westminster and parts adjacent as also the proposals made by the said college to the lord mayor court of aldermen and common council of london in pursuance thereof have hitherto been ineffectual for that no method has been taken to furnish the poor with medicines for their cure at low and reasonable rates we therefore whose names are here underwritten fellows or members of the said college being willing effectually to promote so great a charity by the counsel and good liking of the president and college declared in their comitia hereby to wit each of us severally and apart and not the one for the other of us do oblige our selves to pay to dr thomas burwel fellow and elect of the said college the sum of ten pounds apiece of lawful money of england by such proportions and at such times as to the major part of the subscribers hereto shall seem most convenient which money when received by the said dr thomas burwel is to be by him expended in preparing and delivering medicines to the poor at their intrinsic value in such manner and at such times and by such orders and directions as by the major part of the subscribers hereto shall in writing be hereafter appointed and directed for that purpose in witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands and seals this    december       this was in a few days subscribed by above forty and has by several more since  the subscription being made a college was called that a grant might be forthwith made by way of lease to the subscribers of the collegelaboratory and other rooms and conveniences necessary for executing the intended charitable design and a grant was accordingly made and sealed in open college whereupon the subscribers presently chose a committee of twelve to manage this affair who were so diligent in it that in about half a year they got it into a serviceable condition and method  but this design being wholly new no wonder if at first it was not brought to that degree of serviceableness it is now improved to at first those poor only were supplied with medicines that repaired for advice to the several subscribers lodgings or those whom they were called to in their respective neighbourhoods which in comparison were but few for the apothecaries still made a shift to keep most of them in their own hands so loath were they to part with their objects of charity for reasons best known to themselves wherefore the subscribers thought it advisable for the enlarging of their charity to appoint certain days wherein two physicians by turns should attend at the college to give advice gratis to all the poor that would resort thither and to give notice of this not only in the public prints but also by papers which they printed and gave away for the information of the town by this means far greater numbers flocked for advice and many from the remotest parts of the town for whose convenience it has been thought fit not only to continue the attendance with the dispensary for medicines at the college but also to erect two dispensaries more one in s martins lane in the fields and the other in gracechurch street that the sick poor might not have too far to go for relief and might at one or other of these places have advice any day in the week and medicines every day at all of them thus two physicians attend in the afternoons on monday in s martins on tuesday in grace church street on wednesday at the college and so on thursday in s martins on friday in grace church street and on saturday at the college and the physicians attendance at these places is not intended at all to excuse any subscriber from giving advice gratis at his own house or in his neighborhood but because a physicians hours are uncertain being obliged to be abroad whenever called that the poor who can ill lose time may not be disappointed when they seek for advice certain provision is made for them by these fixed days and places  by this means it is hoped the physicians have sufficiently wiped off the scandal they lay so long unjustly under and the poor have that care taken of them and kindness showed them that we challenge any city in europe to parallel  the committee who are new chosen every year meet twice every week for the looking after the due management of this undertaking and they choose two curators monthly whose peculiar business it is to buy in the best drugs they can meet with and to see that the compositions for the dispensaries be duly prepared and that these may be the better inspected they are all ordered to be made at the college and to be conveyed from thence to the other two dispensaries as they are wanted  and as the medicines at all the dispensaries are the best that can be made so they are sold out for no greater gains than will just bear the charge viz of houserent and servants wages so that the price is ordinarily   d or   d in the shilling less than the apothecaries use to exact  and now that the poor are so very well taken care of by the subscribers to the dispensaries one would think the apothecaries should be very thankful that so much trouble is taken off their hands but instead of that to show that their gains by practicing upon the poor is more in their eye than their relief they rail every where against the subscribers as men that would undo them and have entered into a combination to hinder them of all the business they possibly can while they caress and bring into business such physicians as have refused to be concerned in the subscription they make it their business also in all companies to raise objections against the dispensaries as well as to misrepresent the designs of those that have set them up as i have therefore plainly shown the subscribers design to be the most laudable that can be and that they were necessitated to erect them as well for the relief of the poor as in their own vindication so to prevent all groundless prejudices i will give a full answer to all such objections as the apothecaries have raised against them  these objections may i think be reduced to six  i they say that physicians ought not to give physic but only prescribe it  ii that they have no right to erect public dispensaries  iii that if the dispensaries be suffered the apothecaries will all be undone  iv that physicians fees are as unreasonable and oppressive as the apothecaries prices  v that the rich are supplied with medicines from the dispensaries as well as the poor  vi that the dispensaries sell medicines as dear as the apothecaries  obj   that physicians ought not to give physic but only prescribe it  answ it might suffice in answer to this to say that it is as little the apothecaries province to advise the sick as they can suppose it to be the physicians to give them physic and yet where is the apothecary that does not do this every day how unfit then are the apothecaries to impute that as a crime to physicians which they are so notoriously guilty of themselves viz of intruding into other mens business i say this might suffice as an answer to them but i shall consider the accusation it self and demonstrate that physicians when they give physic are in their own lawful proper business and that apothecaries are not so when they prescribe it  when a physician has arrived at the skill to know diseases and their symptoms and to take indications for their cure as to the quid agendum he must then proceed to find out the quo i e operations or medicines to satisfy those indications and when he has found these out can any man think it reasonable that he should be obliged to communicate all his skill in every particular cure to what person soever the patient is pleased to call in for an apothecary so as to make him presently master of all those secrets that by long study and observation he has arrived at the knowledge of whosoever is the author but of one invention useful to the public has a right by law to the sole benefit of it for many years and shall physicians that are continually inventing new and more effectual remedies for the diseases of mankind be bound to divulge and prostitute all their inventions to men that if they can help it will never let the inventors have twice the benefit of the same prescription but presently usurp the use of it themselves and leave the physicians at leisure to invent more i know the apothecary that is ignorant of the reasons and natures of things by unfitly applying good remedies shall never perform the same cures that the learned physician can but while the apothecaries pretend to do it and give those remedies to patients though these receive no benefit the physician is no less injured i say then it is against all the reason and justice in the world to hinder the physician himself from administering to the sick such remedies as he has invented it is as absurd as to hinder a workman from using his own tools which he has invented and which he alone knows the right use of and the parliament of    h   for this and other weighty reasons did wisely enact that any physician being admitted by the president and fellowship of physicians in london may any where within this realm practice and exercise the science of physic in all and every its members and parts which clause is plainly applied to making and giving medicines in the charter granted to the apothecaries by k james i for after the charter had granted them diverse immunities powers and privileges particularly the sole making and vending of internal remedies etc at length there is this clause added et denique volumus  quod fraesideus and communitas medicor civit land omnesque and singuli medici de eodem collegio sive communitate and successores sui sicut and medici regis reginae and principum imposterum debeant and pro arbitrio suo possint artem medicam in omnibus suis partibus exercere etc i e and lastly we will  that the president and commonalty of physicians in the city of london and all and every the physicians of the same college or commonalty and their successors as also the physicians of the king queen and princes hereafter ought and at their pleasure may exercise the art of physic in all its parts and to drive the matter yet further out of all dispute it is immediately added and insuper gaudebunt utentur and fruentur and gaudere uti and frui valiant and possint eisdem and consimil jurisdictionibus authoritat supervis and correctionibus ac omnibus aliis potestatibus privileg and libertat qualibus unquam antehac pharmacopolae usi and gavisi fuerunt etc i e and shall moreover enjoy and use and have a right to enjoy and use the same and like jurisdictions authorities supervisings and corrections and all other powers privileges and liberties which the apothecaries have ever hitherto used and enjoyed etc what words can be more comprehensive and full to continue in the physicians of the college an equal power and privilege with apothecaries themselves to make and vend medicines  but where is the clause in any statute or charter even their own that gives or reserves a power to the apothecaries to practice physic and to dispense out all the medicines in their shops to patients without the prescription or advice of any physician if they can show none then i affirm that they do this against plain positive law while physicians have law as plain and positive to empower them to prepare and give physic  obj   that physicians have no right to erect public dispensaries  answ to this i answer that it seems strange if each particular physician have power by law to prepare and give his own physic as has been shown that two or three or any number of these physicians may not for their own convenience prepare their medicines together and have one common place from whence to dispense them especially when all the benefit of such convenience accrues to the patient who by that means has his medicines considerably cheaper than they could be afforded if every physician were at the charge to keep servants and a dispensary of his own but suppose there were any weight in this objection of what advantage would it be to the apothecaries to have the physicians debarred from this convenience there would perhaps in such case be as many dispensaries as there are now subscribers to the three in being and whereas each subscriber sends in comparison but few of his patients at present to the dispensaries if he had one at his own house he would probably supply all his patients with his own medicines the objectors therefore had much better in my opinion quietly endure three common dispensaries set up for the use of the poor than by endeavoring to pull these down to give occasion to set up forty or fifty private ones for the use of the rich as well as the poor  obj   that if the dispensaries are suffered the apothecaries will all be undone  ans it must be confessed that part of their business especially that relating to the poor must indeed be abated and that business which they retain will hardly be so profitable to them as formerly when the rich understand how unreasonable their gains have been but if the apothecaries please they may in good part make up these losses by contenting themselves to live in houses of less rent to bear only the port of laboring or handycraftsmen as indeed they are but especially by keeping fewer servants and putting their own hands to their own work and by making such bylaws to their company in relation to taking apprentices as may lessen the number of apothecaries who are now grown so over numerous and if notwithstanding they cannot get so much by their trade as they have done every unprejudiced man will conclude it more reasonable and just that a few men should be lessened in their gains and grandeur than that a thousand times their number should be oppressed for the support of them and all must confess that the ambition of these men is very extravagant that desire with an hundred pound stock many not with half so much to vie with the best shopkeepers or merchants in their neighborhood that employ fifty times as much in their business  obj   that physicians fees are as unreasonable and oppressive as the apothecaries prices  answ it is denied that physicians fees are either unreasonable or oppressive for how should they be so when the patient is at liberty to give what he pleases every one is the best judge of his own condition and ability and accordingly some give a guinea some ten shillings some a crown and some nothing and whatever other physicians do the subscribers to the dispensaries profess themselves as ready to serve the two last as the two first and take these one with another how far short will physicians fees come of those of lawyers which yet are not disputed and the disproportion will still appear the greater when it is considered that for one client the lawyers have in forma pauperis the subscribers to the dispensaries have fifty or an hundred gratis patients there being several hundreds of them every week so that take one patient with another rich and poor and i dare confidently aver that no physician that duly attends at the dispensaries has a crown a bill for all the bills he writes through the year nay i can be positive that some have not half a crown and what ground then can there be for this great cry against physicians fees  but supposing they were indeed unreasonable this objection would only argue that physicians were not fit persons to accuse the apothecaries of excessive gains but it does no way excuse or justify them and i will make it appear that there is no proportion between their gains and physicians fees in chronical cases when the patient can come to the physician he ordinarily gives him but half a fee for which he expects to be put into a course of physic that shall cure him which generally lasts several weeks in this time the physic commonly comes to several pounds of which three parts in four at least shall be gains as i will undertake to prove if it be denied and if the same patient chance to relapse into the same disease he shall repeat the course toties quoties without ever consulting his physician again so that by such a patient the apothecary shall get at time and time perhaps twenty times as much as the physician  yea though the patients case be acute and require the daily attendance of the physician the apothecarys gains shall far exceed his fees especially if the physician be one of the apothecaries friends and have the knack of writing well as their cant is i could give instances enough of this but i appeal to the experience of most that have been sick of fevers for instance wherein they have had an apothecary with a physician of his recommending let them cast up the physicians fees and compute three parts in four at least of the apothecaries bill to be gains and they shall generally find the latter greatly to outbalance the former only i must here except two or three physicians not concerned in the dispensaries who have got a way under the specious pretense of being careful men to visit their patients twice or thrice a day when once would serve only to multiply their fees i am not writing an apology for such but am content they should fall under the same censure with the apothecaries of being unreasonable and oppressive  obj   that the rich are supplied with medicines from the dispensaries as well as the poor  answ the prime reason of setting up the dispensaries was as has been showed the supplying the poor with medicines at a low rate and that the subscribers do still put them to this use hundreds of poor people can weekly testify and if there are any rich supplied with medicines from thence the apothecaries may thank themselves for it for this i will affirm that whatsoever physicians subscribers to the dispensaries send their rich patients thither for physic it is for one or more of these following reasons either first because of the general combination of the apothecaries to keep out or turn out the subscribers from all patients where they have an interest to do it in order to bring in those physicians that will not be concerned in the subscription and so the subscribers find this the only way to retain some of those they have left or secondly because the apothecaries by sending in ill prepared medicines disappoint them in their practice on purpose to make the patients question their physicians skill and to send for some other of their recommendation which i have often known to be done or thirdly when the patients themselves complain not only of the dearness but of the badness of their apothecaries medicines and desire they may be supplied from the dispensaries where they are not only cheap but good or fourthly when the apothecary has for many days together even in dangerous and acute diseases kept the patient in his own hands till almost all opportunity of benefiting him is lost for in such cases the subscribers think it just that the apothecaries should receive some check to deter them from such unfair and dangerous practices or lastly when the physician prescribes some secret medicin that is kept at the dispensaries which he thinks not fit to make known to the apothecaries lest they should presently as is usual with them fall a practicing therewith themselves to his disadvantage and to these i may add a sixth reason which is only accidental viz when persons of condition come to the dispensaries for gratis advice on the usual days in forma pauperum and the physicians attending are ignorant of their quality and so are imposed upon  these reasons i allege in answer to this fifth objection not that the subscribers need give a reason for what they do in this particular for they have an undoubted right to give physic to whom they please as i have proved before in the answer to obj   but that all the world may see how every way justifiable the subscribers are as to any complaint the apothecaries make against them and after all the noise of sending the rich to the dispensaries for medicines i dare say take all the subscribers together and they do not send one bill in thirty that they write for the rich thither and if some send more than others it is upon account of greater injuries and affronts they have met with from the apothecaries for appearing more forward than their brethren in this charitable undertaking  obj   the last objection is that the dispensaries sell medicines as dear as the apothecaries  answ it is confessed that some apothecaries especially the wholesale ones do sell some medicines as cheap as the dispensaries can afford them but pray what medicines are they they are either simple medicines and drugs the nature and value whereof most people know or such single compound medicines as are kept ready prepared in shops to be sold out when called for by their proper and peculiar names the value whereof is as commonly known as that of drugs and simples as for instance venice treacle mithridate diascordium etc though very compounded medicines are sold as cheap i will not say so good by the wholesale apothecaries as at the dispensaries and the reason is the buyer understands what he buys and the current price of it and so cannot be imposed upon by the apothecary and the gains the apothecary has by these medicines thus sold was never called unreasonable and excessive by the subscribers to the dispensaries but the gain complained of as unreasonable and oppressive is when medicines either simple or compound are mixed together or disguised and have a new name put upon them denoting only their form or their use and virtue and the patient is ignorant what they consist of as for instance a cordial bolus shall be priced at   s   d by some at   s   d when the ingredients of it are not worth   d a dose of purging pills at the same price with the cordial bolus when they are only half a dram of extract rudii pil ruffi or cochiae worth   d a cordial draught shall be   s   d when the waters and syrup of which it consists are dear of   d a vomit is   s   d or   s   d when it is not intrinsecally worth above   d or   d a stomachick apozem of a quart is never rated at less than   s   d when the ingredients that are boiled in the water are bought for   d or less as in the bitter decoction and many apothecaries are so void of all conscience as to make eight shillings of such an apozem by dividing the quart into eight parts and sending it in to the patient for so many draughts with some cramp name annexed at   s per draught the like extravagant way of increasing the price do they very often take by dividing an electuary worth it may be   s into twelve parts or more and sending in the parts so divided to the patient under the name of boluss at   s a piece at least and so if a physician prescribe a powder of an ounce to be taken by half a dram at a time though the whole ounce be dear of a shilling as consisting only of testaceous powders sal prunellae sugar of roses etc yet the apothecary by officiously dividing the ounce into sixteen papers shall make   s of it viz   d a paper now whosoever will take the pains to enquire at what rate the very same boluss pills vomits cordial draughts apozems powders etc are priced at the dispensaries he will see that they are generally at least   d in the shilling cheaper than what the apothecaries fell them for who then does not see a notorious fallacy in the objection when they affirm that they sell medicines as cheap as the dispensaries when it holds not true in a fiftieth part and only in those wherein the people cannot be imposed upon  and besides there is another circumstance that makes it yet exceedingly dearer to have physic from the apothecaries than from the dispensaries and that is that if either the apothecary be doctor himself and send in medicines to the sick of his own head or if he be able to bring in a favorite physician that is an enemy to the dispensaries they shall either of them pour in upon the patient three times as much physic as the subscribers to the dispensaries usually prescribe in like cases the greatest part whereof i dare be bold to say is nothing to the purpose of the cure but serves only for pomp and to raise the apothecaries bill or perhaps does the patient a great deal of harm  so that take all considerations together and who sees not that the dispensaries are the greatest relief to the poor that can be imagined when for it may be five shillings they shall have as much help in their respective cases as the rich who are supplied with medicines from the apothecaries can have for five pounds and at the same time have the ease of taking only a few necessary medicines when the others are crammed and drenched all day and night long with one slap or other  and now that i have given a full answer to all the apothecaries objections against the dispensaries i should have put an end to this paper were there not two objections more commonly to be met with in the town which it may be necessary to say something to viz one on the apothecaries behalf against physicians having the whole advising part of physic and the other against one particular in the present management of the dispensaries    on the apothecaries behalf people argue that an apothecary who has for many years made up physicians prescriptions for patients and has observed their operations and effects ought to have a right to administer such medicines as have had good effects to other patients in like cases when he is desired without consulting any physician  ans in answer to this we will first suppose that the apothecary is of a capacity to make observations and to know when a like case occurs and yet in such case i affirm that he ought not of his own head to administer the most successful remedy to any other patient than him for whom such remedy was first prescribed unless in case of urgent necessity and when the physician that prescribed it cannot be had for a physician has a double property in his prescriptions first in that when a physician prescribes for a patient he prescribes only pro hoc and nunc for this man and at this time and for doing that alone he receives his fee he does not sell his prescription by way of alienation so that it should be to his patient and to his heirs or assigns for ever much less does he pass any title over to the apothecary who is only employed by the patient to make it up and who ought to return the bill when he is paid for it either to the patient or to the physician that writ it and if he either detain it or transcribe it in order to make use of it to other patients without the first prescribers lieve or direction he is manifestly guilty of fraudulently usurping another property secondly a physician has another property in his prescriptions in that no man yb law has a right to prescribe but himself and as i take it there is as real a property in practice as in estate no man ought to meddle in that profession that he is not brought up to or has not a legal admission into not to mention the ministry this is plain in the law wherein no solicitor or attorney how long soever they have practiced and how well soever versed in their business can take upon them the practice of a lawyer either in the chamber or in court preparing of medicines is but one and that the meanest and most mechanic part of physic this part is committed to the apothecaries by such physicians as will not undergo the more servile and toilsome part of their profession or through multitude of business are not at leisure for it but still it remains inseparable from it and whatsoever physician will may exercise it but the apothecary whose sole trade is to prepare medicines according to the dispensatories or recipes put into his hands by physicians has no more a right to invade the advising and prescribing part than the solicitor or attorney the practice of council learned in the law  but letting pass this argument from property i will in further answer to the objection demonstrate that apothecaries are not capable of making observations nor of judging of like cases and therefore ought not to have the right contended for  every one knows an apothecarys education to be to come to the trade from a grammar school where he has learned to construe or to make a little latin it is very rare that any designed for that employment have any smattering in the greek thus qualified he comes prentice and is presently set to the pestil and mortar to run of errands etc and after a year or two when he has learned to know one thing in the shop from another and to read a physicians bill he begins to be employed in making up medicines and carrying them out to patients and continues so to do till his time runs out all this while he has neither time to read nor can have capacity to understand such books as teach the art of physic nor can he know any thing to any purpose of the diseases for which the medicines he carries out are administered for any patient would reckon it sanciness in boys to be inquisitive about their cases in the enquiry whereinto a man must be very nice and particular or he shall be never the wiser and during this time of his apprenticeship he generally loses the little latin that he had when he came from school saving what the physicians bills preserve  well now he is out of his time what must he do but set up excellently qualified for the practice of physic no doubt yes there were such and such famous doctors writ to his masters shop and he saw all their bills and made many of them up and carried them out to patients of whom he saw some live and some die and so he must needs know something of the matter well to judge of that let us consider what the matter is viz the art of physic  this noble art consists of five parts of which the preparing of medicines is but the least part of one  there is i the physiologick which treats of the subject and the end of physic and so includes the anatomy of an humane body and explains its constitution and that of all its parts with their uses and actions and the faculties of the animal soul  ii the pathologick which treats of the nature differences and causes of diseases and their symptoms and explains every particular wherein an humane body departs from its natural constitution  iii the semiotick which teaches the signs whereby it may be known whether a man is well or ill and how diseases latent in the body with their causes and events may be discovered which signs are commonly called diagnosticks and prognostics  iv the   th part contains the knowledge of those things which are as it were the matter of health and are usually called nonnaturals as air meat and drink affections of the mind exercise and rest venery sleep and watching with excrements and retents and it contains also the knowledge of the right use of these nonnatural things so as that health may be preserved thereby  and v the fifth part called the therapeutick shows how loft health may be restored and diseases with their causes and symptoms removed and to this end it is necessary to be instructed first in method whereby according to indications one may find out due helps and then in the matter of such helps whether contained under diet surgery or pharmacy  now this very last thing viz pharmacy is all that an apothecary by his education can pretend to the knowledge of and it is but the least part of this neither that he can have such pretense to for the pharmaceutick part contains not only the preparing of medicines but the knowledge of the natures and virtues of all those things that are the matter of medicines whether vegetables animals or minerals and this knowledge he is a stranger to  with what patience then can a man animadvert upon the assuming confidence of these men who will set up for practisers in such a difficult and mysterious art that understand not any one part of it a man is like to make special observations that neither knows the subject affected nor the nature nor cause of the disease nor the nature of the medicines that cure it and he must needs be a witch at judging of like cases that for the mentioned defects could never be a competent judge of any one case  the case in short is this an apothecary when he learns his trade is taught to know one drug from another can tell which will melt and which will powder nay may observe which will purge which vomit etc he learns also to make them up into different forms according to the prescripts of physicians and i will grant he has opportunity to observe that some are given most commonly in fevers others in consumptions others in dropsies etc but will any man conclude that because an apothecary knows and may have observed these things that therefore he can judge with due accurateness either of these diseases or the methods or reasons of their cure there is no general remedy nor method for any one disease different medicines and different methods must be made use of in different subjects though the disease in the main be the same and hereof no man can be a fit judge but one who is well versed in all the parts of physic and therefore if there were no law to restrain apothecaries from practicing their undeniabl gnorance ought to keep all who value their health or lives from depending on their advice    the other objection that the people make is against one particular thing in the present management of the dispensaries and is to this purpose if say they the dispensaries sell medicines so cheap and so good why may not any body have such medicines there as they have occasion for without the trouble of going to one of the subscribers for a note  i answer   that people are not competent judges of what they ail or what will help them and so the physicians are willing to prevent their doing themselves a mischief by taking improper things    unless the subscribers be still more provoked by the apothecaries in juries they are very unwilling to make that of common use which was purely designed for the relief of the poor only for they have no intention to injure the apothecaries in their proper calling if they will keep themselves to that will make good medicines and be content with moderate gains  but   the principal reason is that medicines are given out from the dispensaries by servants who are generally directed what to take for every medicin by him that prescribes it and it might be very prejudical as well to patients as to the subscribers themselves if the servants might sell out what they pleased without order and might take of the patient what they pleased for it for they would be under a great temptation to sell things and either never bring them to account at all or to take more of the patient then the stated price and to put the overplus into their own pockets and therefore how inconvenient soever it may seem to such as would be their own doctors not to have from the dispensaries what they think would do them good the subscribers can by no means for these reasons recede from their established method in this particular  london printed in the year   0
