confined who from his study rails at human kind though what he learns he speaks and may advance some general maxims or be right by chance the coxcomb bird so talkative and grave that from his cage cries cuckold whore and knave though many a passenger he rightly call you hold him no philosopher at all and yet the fate of all extremes is such men may be read as well as books too much to observations which ourselves we make we grow more partial for the observers sake to written wisdom as anothers less maxims are drawn from notions those from guess there is some peculiar in each leaf

comes then is master of the field as the last image of that troubled heap when sense subsides and fancy sports in sleep though past the recollection of the thought becomes the stuff of which our dream is wrought something as dim to our internal view is thus perhaps the cause of most we do true some are open and to all men known others so very close they are hid from none so darkness strikes the sense no less than light thus gracious chandos is beloved at sight and every child hates shylock though his soul still sits at squat and peeps not from its hole at half mankind when generous manly

the story of sir balaam v     to the end  epistle iii epistle iii this epistle was written after a violent outcry against our author on a supposition that he had ridiculed a worthy nobleman merely for his wrong taste he justified himself upon that article in a letter to the earl of burlington at the end of which are these words i have learnt that there are some who would rather be wicked than ridiculous and therefore it may be safer to attack vices than follies i will therefore leave my betters in the quiet possession of their idols their groves and their high places and change my subject from their pride to their meanness from their vanities to their miseries and as the only certain way to avoid misconstructions to lessen offense and not to multiply illnatured applications i may

sorts of men to squander these and those to hide again like doctors thus when much dispute has past we find our tenets just the same at last both fairly owning riches in effect no grace of heaven or

real estate to his brother and son and concealed all his personal which was computed to be one hundred and fifty thousand pounds these conveyances being also set aside by a bill in chancery ward was imprisoned and hazarded the forfeiture of his life by not giving in his effects till the last day which was that of his examination during his confinement his amusement was to give poison to dogs and cats and see them expire by slower or quicker torments to sum up the worth of this gentleman at the several aeras of his life at his standing in the pillory he was worth above two hundred thousand
