commence with refinement of manners literature becomes sentimental and discursive in proportion as a people is polished and men must be instructed by facts either real or imaginary before they can apprehend the subtleties of argument and the force of refection  vincent of beauvais a learned dominican of france who flourished in the thirteenth century observes in his mirror of history that it was a practice of the preachers of his age to rouse the indifference and relieve the languor of their hearers by quoting the fables of esop yet at the same time he recommends a sparing and prudent application of these profane fancies in the discussion of sacred subjects specul hist lib iii c viii ol    b edit ven       among the harleian manuscripts in the british museum we find a very ancient collection of two hundred and fifteen stories romantic allegorical religious and legendary which were evidently compiled by a professed preacher for the use of monastic societies some of these appear to have been committed to writing from the recitals of bards and minstrels others to have been invented and written by troubadours and monks mss harl     membran fol  in the year      a grand system of divinity appeared at paris afterward translated by caxton under the title of the court of sapyence which abounds with a multitude of historical examples parables and apologues and which the writer wisely supposes to be much more likely to interest the attention and excite the devotion of the people than the authority of science and the parade of theology in consequence of the expediency of this mode of of instruction the legends of the saints were received into the ritual and rehearsed in the course of public worship for religious romances were nearly allied to songs of chivalry and the same gross ignorance of the people which in the early centuries of christianity created a necessity of introducing the visible pomp of theatrical ceremonies into the churches was taught the duties of devotion by being amused with the achievements of spiritual knighterrantry and impressed with the examples of pious heroism in more cultivated periods the decameron of boccace and other books of that kind ought to be considered as the remnant of a species of writing which was founded on the simplicity of mankind and was adapted to the exigencies of the infancy of society  many obsolete collections of this sort still remain both printed and manuscript containing narratives either fictitious or historical   of king and heroes old such as the wise demodocus once told in solemn songs at king alcinous feast milton at a vacation exercise etc  but among the ancient storybooks of this character a latin compilation entitled gesta romanorum seems to have been the favorite  this piece has been before incidentally noticed but as it operated powerfully on the general body of our old poetry affording a variety of inventions not only to chaucer gower and lydgate but to their distant successors i have judged it of sufficient importance to be examined at large in a separate dissertation which has been designedly reserved for this place for the purpose both of recapitulation and illustration and of giving the reader a more commodious opportunity of surveying at leisure from this intermediate point of view and under one comprehensive detail a connected display of the materials and original subjects of many of our past and future poets  indeed in the times with which we are now about to be concerned it seems to have been growing more into esteem at the commencement of typography wynkyn

editions for which see supr vol ii p     i must add that the gesta romanorum were translated into dutch so early as the year      there is an old french version in the british museum  this work is compiled from the obsolete latin chronicles of the later roman or rather german story heightened by romantic inventions from legends of the saints oriental apologues and many of the shorter fictitious narratives which came into europe with the arabian literature and were familiar in the ages of ignorance and imagination the classics are sometimes cited for authorities but these are of the lower order such as valerius maximus macrobius aulus gallius seneca pliny and boethius to every tale a moralisation is subjoined reducing it into a christian or moral lesson  most of the oriental apologues are taken from the clericalis disciplina or a latin dialogue between an arabian philoopher and edric edric was the name of enoch among the arabians to whom they attribute many fabulous compositions herbelot in v lydgates chorle and the bird mentioned above is taken form the clericalis disciplina of alphonsus his son never printed mss harl      and in many other libraries it occurs in old french

else great bards beside in sage and solemn tunes have sung of turneys and of trophies hung of forests and enchantments drear where more is meant than meets the ear miltons il penseroso  our author frequently cites gesta romanorum the title of his own work by which i understand no particular book of that name but the roman history in general thus in the title of the saint albans chronicle printed by caxton titus livyus de gestis romanorum is recited in the year      lucius florus was printed at paris under the same title apud vascosan  to  in the british museum we find les fais de romans jusques a la in de l empire domician selon orose justin lucan etc a plain historical deduction mss re  0 c i  the romuleon an old manuscript history of rome from the foundation of the city to constantine the great is also called de gestis romanorum this manuscript occurs both in latin and french and a french copy among the royal manscripts has the title romuleon ou des fais de romans ms    e v  among the manuscript books written by lapus de castellione a florentine civilian who flourished about the year    0 there is one de origin urbis romae et de gestis romanorum see supr vol ii p     gower in the confessio amantis often introduces roman stories with the latin preamble hic secundum gesta where he certainly means the roman history which by degrees had acquired simply the appellation of gesta herman korner in his chronica novella written about the year      refers for his vouchers to bid orosius valerius maximus josephus eusebius and the chronicon et gesta romanorum most probably to say no more by the chronicon he means the later writers of the roman affairs such as isidore and the monkish compilers and by gesta the ancient roman history as related by livy and the more established latin historians  neither is it possible that this work could have been brought as a proof or authority by any serious annalist for the roman story  for though it bears the title of gesta romanorum yet this title by no means properly corresponds with the contents of the collection which as has been already hinted comprehends a multitude of narratives either not historical or in another respect such as are either totally unconnected with the roman people or perhaps the most preposterous misrepresentations of their history to cover this deviation from the promised plan which by introducing a more ample variety of matter has contributed to increase the readers entertainment our collector has taken care to preface almost every story with the name or reign of a roman emperor who at the same time is often a monarch that never existed and who seldom whether real or suppositious has any concern with the circumstances of the narrative  but i hasten to exhibit a compendious analysis of the chapters which form this very singular compilation intermixing occasional illustrations arising from the subject and shortening or lengthening my abridgement of the stories in proportion as i judge they are likely to interest the reader where for that reason i have been very concise i have yet said enough to direct the critical antiquarian to this collection in case he should find a similar tale occurring in any of our old poets i have omitted the mention of a very few chapters which were beneath notice sometimes where common authors are quoted i have only mentioned the authors name without specifying the substance of the quotation for it was necessary that the reader should be made acquainted with our collectors track of reading and the books which he used in the mean time this review will serve as a full notification of the edition of      which is more comprehensive and complete than some others of later publication and to which all the rest as to a general criterion may be now comparatively referred  chap i of a daughter of king pompey whose chamber was guarded by five armed knights and a dog being permitted to be present at a public show she is educed by a duke who is afterward killed by the champion of her fathers court she is reconciled to her father and betrothed to a nobleman on which occasion she receives from her father an embroidered robe and a crown of gold from the champion a gold ring another from the wise man who pacified the kings anger another from the kings son another from her cousin and from her spouse a seal of gold all these presents are inscribed with proverbial sentences suitable to the circumstances of the princess  the latter part of this story is evidently oriental the feudal manners in a book which professes to record the achievements of the roman people are remarkable in the introductory circumstances but of this mixture we shall see many striking instances  chap ii of a youth taken captive by pirates the kings daughter falls in love with him and having procured his escape accompanies him to his own country where they are married  chap vi an emperor is married to a beautiful young princess in case of death they mutually agree not to survive one other to try the truth of his wife the emperor going into a distant country orders a report of his death to be circulated in remembrance of her vow and in imitation of the wives of india she prepares to throw herself headlong from a high precipice she is prevented by her father who interposes his paternal authority as predominating over a rash and unlawful promise  chap vii under the reign of dioclesian a noble knight had two sons the youngest of which marries a harlot  this story but with a difference of circumstances ends like the beautiful apologue of the prodigal son  chap viii the emperor leo commands three female statues to be made one has a gold ring on a finger pointing forward another a beard of gold and the third a golden cloak and purple tunic whoever steals any of these ornaments is to be punished with an ignominious death  this story is copied by gower in the confessio amantis but he has altered some of the circumstances he supposes a statue of apollo  of plate of gold a berde he had the wiche his breast all ovir spradde of gold also without fail his mantell was of large entayle besette with perrey all about forth right he straught his finger out upon the which he had a ring to seen it was a rich thing a fine carbuncle for the nones most precious of all stones lib v fol     b  in the sequel gower follows the substance of our author  chap x vespasian marries a wife in a distant country who refuses to return home with him and yet declares she will kill herself if he goes the emperor ordered two rings to be made of a wondrous efficacy one of which in the stone has the image of oblivion the other the image of memory the ring of oblivion he gave to the empress and returned home with the ring of memory  chap xi the queen of the south sends her daughter to king alexander to be his concubine she was exceedingly beautiful but had been nourished with poison from her birth alexanders master aristotle whose sagacity nothing could escape knowing this entreated that before she was admitted to the kings bed a malefactor condemned to death might be sent for who should give her a kiss in the presence of the king the malefactor on kissing her instantly dropped down dead aristotle having explained his reasons for what he had done was loaded with honors by the king and the princess was dismissed to her mother  this story is founded on the twentyeighth chapter of aristotles secretum secretorum in which a queen of india is said to have treacherously sent to alexander among other costly presents the pretended testimonies of her friendship a girl of exquisite beauty who having been fed with serpents from her infancy partook of their nature see supr vol i p     this i now cite from a latin translation without date but evidently printed before   00 it is dedicated to guido vere de valencia bishop of tripoly by his most humble clerk philippus who says that he found this treatise in arabic at antioch quo arbant lini and that therefore and because the arabic copies were scarce he translated it into latin  this printed copy does not exactly correspond with ms bodl     membr  to in the last alexanders miraculous horn is mentioned at fol    b in the former in chapter lxxii the dedication is the same in both    if i recollect right in pliny there are accounts of nations whose natural food was poison mithridates king of pontus the land of venomous herbs and the country of the sorceress medea was supposed to eat poison sir john maundevilles travels i believe will afford other instances  chap xii a profligate priest in the reign of the emperor otto or otho walking in the fields and neglecting to say mass is reformed by a vision of a comely old man  chap xiii an empress having lost her husband becomes so doatingly fond of her only son then three years of age as not to bear his absence for a moment they sleep together every night and when he was eighteen years of age she proves with child by him she murders the infant and her left hand is immediately marked with four circles of blood her repentance is related in consequence of a vision of the holy virgin  this

the filial piety of a young man who redeems his father a knight from captivity  chap xv eufemian a nobleman in the court of the emperor of rome is attended by three thousand servants girt with golden belts and clothed in silken vestments his house was crowded with pilgrims orphans and widows for whom three tables were kept every day he has a son allexius who quits his fathers palace and lives unknown seventeen years in a monastery in syria he then returns and lives seventeen years undiscovered as a pilgrim in his fathers family where he suffers many indignities from the servants  allexius or alexis was canonised this story is taken from his legend see caxton gold leg f ccclxiii b  in the metrical lives of the saints his life is told in a sort of measure different from that of the rest

histories in the colophon   chap xvi a roman emperor in digging for the foundation of a new palace finds a golden sarcophagus or coffin inscribed with mysterious words and sentences which being explained prove to be so many moral lessons of instruction for the emperors future conduct  chap xvii a poor man named guido engages to serve an emperor of rome in six several capacities or employments one of these services is to show the best way to the holy land acquitting himself in all with singular address and fidelity he is made a knight and loaded with riches  chap xviii a knight named julian is hunting a stag who turns and says you will kill your father and mother on this he went into a distant country where he married a rich lady of a castle julians father and mother traveled into various lands to find their son and at length accidentally came to this castle in his absence where telling their story to the lady who had heard it from her husband she discovered who they were and gave them her own bed to sleep in early in the morning while she was at mass in the chapel her husband julian unexpectedly returned and entering his wifes chamber perceived two persons in the bed whom he immediately slew with his sword hastily supposing them to be his wife and her adulterer at leaving the chamber he met his wife coming from the chapel and with great astonishment asked her who the persons were sleeping in her bed she answered they are your parents who have been seeking you so long and whom i have honored with a place in our own bed afterward they founded a sumptuous hospital for the accommodation of travelers on the banks of a dangerous river  this story is told in caxtons golden legende fol  0 edit       and in the metrical lives of the saints mss bodl      f    hence julian or saint julian was called hospitator or the good herberjour and the pater noster became famous which he used to say for the souls of his father and mother whom he had thus unfortunately killed ibid  the peculiar excellencies of this prayer are displayed by boccace decam d ii n    chaucer speaking of the hospitable disposition of his frankelein says saint julian he was

vincent of beauvais spcul hist lib ix c     f     venet        i take this opportunity of observing that the legends of the the saints so frequently referred to in the gesta romanorum often contain high strokes of fancy both in the structure and decorations of the story that they should abound in extravagant conceptions may be partly accounted for from the superstitious and visionary cast of the writer but the truth is they derive this complexion from the east some were originally forged by monks of the greek church to whom the oriental fictions and mode of fabling were familiar the more early of the latin lives were carried over to constantinople where they were translated into greek with new embellishments of eastern imagination these being returned into europe were translated into latin where they naturally superseded the old latin archetypes others of the latin lives contracted this tincture from being written after the arabian literature became common in europe the following ideas in the life of saint pelagian evidently betray their original as the bishop sange mass in the cite of usanance he saw three dropes right clear all of one gratenesse which were upon the altar and al three ran to gyder in to a precious gemme and when they had set this gemme in a cross of gold all the other precious stones that were there fyllen fell out out and this gemme was clear to them that were clean out of sin and it was obscure and dark to sinners caxtons gold leg f ccclxxxxviii  etc the peculiar cast of romantic invention was admirably suited to serve the purposes of superstition  possevin a learned jesuit who wrote about the close of the sixteenth century complains that for the last five hundred years the courts of all the princes in europe had been infatuated by reading romances and that in his time it was a mark of inelegance not to be familiarly acquainted with lancelot du lake perceforest tristan giron the courteous amadis de gaul primaleon boccaces decameron and ariosto he even goes so far as to say that the devil instigated luther to procure a translation of amadis from spanish into french for the purpose of facilitating his grand scheme of overthrowing the catholic religion the popularity of this book he adds warped the minds of the french nation from their ancient notions and studies introduced a neglect of the scriptures and propagated a love for astrology and other fantastic arts bilioth select lib i cap    p     edit       but with the leave of this zealous catholic i would observe that this sort of reading was likely to produce if any an effect quite contrary the genius of romance and of popery was the same and both were strengthened by the reciprocation of a similar spirit of credulity the dragons and the castles of the one were of a piece with the visions and pretended miracles of the other the ridiculous theories of false and unsolid science which by the way had been familiarised to the french by other romances long before the translation of amadis were surely more likely to be advanced under the influence of a religion founded on deception than in consequence of luthers reformed system which aimed at purity and truth and which was to gain its end by the suppression of ancient prejudices  many of the absurdities of the catholic worship were perhaps as i have hinted in some degree necessary in the early ages of the church on account of the ignorance of the people at least under such circumstances they were natural and therefore excusable but when the world became wiser those mummeries should have been abolished for the same reason that the preachers left off quoting esops fables in their sermons and the stage ceased to instruct the people in the scripturehistory by the representation of the mysteries the advocates of the papal communion do not consider that in a cultivated age abounding with every species of knowledge they continue to retain those fooleries which were calculated only for christians in a condition of barbarism and of which the use now no longer subsists  chap xix when julius caesar was preparing to pass the rubicon a gigantic spectre appeared from the middle of the river threatening to interrupt his passage if he came not to establish the peace of rome our author cites the gesta romanorum for this story  it was impossible that the roman history could pass through the dark ages without being infected with many romantic corruptions indeed the roman was almost the only ancient history which the readers of those ages knew and what related even to pagan rome the parent of the more modern papal metropolis of christianity was regarded with a superstitious veneration and often magnified with miraculous additions  chap xx the birth of the emperor henry son of earl leopold and his wonderful preservation from the stratagems of the emperor conrade till his accession to the imperial throne  this story is told by caxton in the golden legende under the life of pelagian the pope

a devout hermit lived in a cave near which a shepherd folded his flock many of the sheep being stolen the shepherd was unjustly killed by his master as being concerned in the theft the hermit seeing an innocent man put to death began to suspect the existence of a divine providence and resolved no longer to perplex himself with the useless seveties of religion but to mix in the world in traveling from his retirement he was met by an angel in the figure of a man who said i am an angel and am sent by god to be your companion on the road they entered a city and begged for lodging at the house of a knight who entertained them at a splendid supper in the night the angel rose from his bed and strangled the knights only child who was asleep in the cradle the hermit was astonished at this barbarous return for so much hospitality but was afraid to make any remonstrance to his companion next morning they went to another city here they were liberally received in the house of an opulent citizen but in the night the angel rose and stole a golden cup of inestimable value the hermit now concluded that his companion was a bad angel in traveling forward the next morning they passed over a bridge about the middle of which they met a poor man of whom the angel asked the way to the next city having received the desired information the angel pushed the poor man into the water where he was immediately drowned in the evening they arrived at the house of a rich man and begging for a lodging were ordered to sleep in a shed with the cattle in the morning the angel gave the rich man the cup which he had stolen the hermit amazed that the cup which was stolen from their friend and benefactor should be given to one who refused them a lodging began to be now convinced that his companion was the devil and begged to go on alone but the angel said hear me and depart when you lived in your hermitage a shepherd was killed by his master he was innocent of the supposed offense but had he not been then killed he would have committed crimes in which he would have died impenitent his master endeavors to atone for the murder by dedicating the remainder of his days to alms and deeds of charity i strangled the child of the knight but know that the father was so intent on heaping up riches for this child as to neglect those acts of public munificence for which he was before so distinguished and to which he has now returned i stole the golden cup of the hospitable citizen but know that from a life of the trictest temperance he became in consequence of possessing this cup a perpetual drunkard and is now the most abstemious of men i threw the poor man into the water he was then honest and religious but know had he walked one half of a mile further he would have murdered a man in a state of mortal sin i gave the golden cup to the rich man who refused to take us within his roof he has therefore received his reward in this world and in the next will suffer the pains of hell for his inhospitality the hermit fell prostrate at the angels feet and requesting forgiveness returned to his hermitage fully convinced of the wisdom and justice of gods government  this is the fable of parnells hermit which that elegant yet original writer has heightened with many masterly touches of poetical coloring and a happier arrangement of circumstances among other proofs which might be mentioned of parnells genius and address in treating this subject by reserving the discovery of the angel to a critical period at the close of the fable he has found means to introduce a beautiful description and an interesting surprise in this poem the last instance of the angels seeming injustice is that of pushing the guide from the bridge into the river at this the hermit is unable to suppress his indignation  wild sparkling rage inflames the fathers eyes he bursts the bonds of fear and madly cries detested wretch  but scarce his speech began when the strange partner seemed no longer man his youthful face grew more serenely sweet his robe turned white and flowed upon his feet fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair celestial odours fill the purple air and wings whose colors glittered on the day wide at his back their gradual plumes display the form ethereal bursts upon his sight and moves in all the majesty of light the same apologue occurs with some slight

as told in our gesta among a collection of latin apologues quoted above mss harl     fol   a the rubric is d angelo qui duxit heremitam ad diversa hospitia  who has illustrated its important moral with the following fine reflections the affairs of this world are like a curious but intricately contrived comedy and we cannot judge of the tendency of what is past or acting at present before the entrance of the last act which shall bring in righteousness in triumph who though she has abided many a brunt and has been very cruelly and despightfully used hitherto in the world yet at last according to our desires we shall see the knight overcome the giant for what is the reason we are so much pleased with the reading romances and the fictions of the poets but that here as aristotle says things are set down as they should be but in the true history hitherto of the world things are recorded indeed as they are but it is but a testimony that they have not been as they should be wherefore in the upshot of all when we shall see that come to pass that so mightily pleases us in the reading the most ingenious plays and heroic poems that long afflicted virtue at last comes to the crown the mouth of all unbelievers must be for ever stopped and for my own part i doubt not but that it will so come to pass in the close of the world but impatiently to call for vengeance upon every enormity before that time is rudely to overturn the stage before the entrance into the fifth act out of ignorance of the plot of the comedy and to prevent the solemnity of the general judgment by more paltry and particular executions ibid p       parnell seems to have chiefly followed the story as it is told by this platonic theologist who had not less imagination than learning pope used to say

furnished with a bed richly embroidered but stuck all over with sharp razors this kingdom he also relinquishes at length he meets a hermit who gives him a staff with which he is directed to knock at the gate of a magnificent palace seated on a lofty mountain here he gains admittance and finds every sort of happiness unembittered with the laest degree of pain  the king means every man advanced to riches and honor and who thinks to enjoy these advantages without interruption and alloy the hermit is religion the staff penitence and the palace heaven  in a more confined sense the first part of this apologue may be separately interpreted to signify that a king when he enters on his important charge ought not to suppose himself to succeed to the privilege of an exemption from care and to be put into immediate possession of the highest pleasures conveniences and felicities of life but to be sensible that from that moment he begins to encounter the greatest dangers and difficulties  chap

was in his power to take it i therefore grant you a free pardon depart and be admonished hence to live virtuously  the learned reader must immediately recollect a similar story of one androclus who being exposed to fight with wild beasts in the roman amphitheatre is recognized and unattacked by a most savage lion whom he had formerly healed exactly in the same manner but i believe the whole is nothing more than an oriental apologue on gratitude written much earlier and that it here exists in its original state androcluss story is related by aulus gellius on the authority of a greek writer one appion called plistonices who flourished under tiberius the character of appion with which gellius prefaces this tale in some measure invalidates his credit notwithstanding he pretends to have been an eye witness of this extraordinary fact ejus libri says gellius non incelebres feruntur quibus omnium ferme quae mirifica in aegypto visuntur audiunturque historia comprehenditur sed in his

it is of a boy beloved by a dolphin  had our compiler of the gesta taken this story from gellius it is probable he would have told it with some of the same circumstances especially as gellius is a writer whom he frequently follows and even quotes and to whom on this occasion he might have been obliged for a few more strokes of the mavelous but the two writers agree only in the general subject our compilers narrative has much more simplicity than that of gellius and contains marks of eastern manners and life let me add that the oriental fabulists are fond of illustrating and enforcing the duty of gratitude by feigning instances of the gratitude of beasts toward men and of this the present compilation which is strongly tinctured with orientalism affords several other proofs  chap cv theodosius the bld emperor ordained that the cause of every injured person should be heard on ringing a bell placed in a public part of his palace a serpent had a nest near the spot where the bellrope fell in the absence of the serpent a toad took possession of her nest the serpent twisting herself round the rope rang the bell for justice and by the emperors special command the toad was killed a few days afterward as the king was reposing on his couch the serpent entered the chamber bearing a precious stone in her mouth the serpent creeping up to the emperors face laid the precious stone on his eyes and glided out of the apartment immediately the emperor was restored to his sight  this circumstance of the bell of justice occurs in the real history of some eastern monarch whose name i

of the inscribed finger on the ground at some distance he immediately took a spade and began to dig exactly on that spot he came at length to a flight of steps which descended far under ground and led him to a stately palace here he entered a hall where he saw a king and queen sitting at table with their nobles and a multitude of people all clothed in rich garments but no person spoke a word he

reflect how he should return but says he my report of all these wonders will not be believed unless i carry something back with me he therefore took from the principal table a golden cup and a golden knife and placed them in his bosom when the man who stood in the corner with the bow immediately shot at the carbuncle which he shattered into a thousand pieces at that moment the hall became dark as night in this darkness not being able to find hi way he remained in the subterraneous palace and soon died a miserable death  in the moralisation of this story the steps by which the clerk descends into the earth are supposed to be the passions the palace so richly stored is the world with all its vanities and temptations the figure with the bow bent is death and the carbuncle is human life he suffers for his avarice in coveting and seizing what was not his own and no sooner has he taken the golden knife and cup that is enriched himself with the goods of this world than he is delivered up

invented of pope gerbert or sylvester the second who died in the year  00  he was eminently learned in the mathematical sciences and on that account was styled a magician william of malmesbury is i believe the first writer now extant by whom it is recorded and he produces it partly to show that gerbert was not always successful in those attempts which he so frequently practiced to discover treasures hid in the earth by the application of the necromantic arts i will translate malmesburys narration of this fable as it varies in some of the circumstances and has some heightenings of the fiction at rome there was a brazen statue extending the forefinger of the right hand and on its forehead was written strike here being suspected to conceal a treasure it had received many bruises from the credulous and ignorant in their endeavors to open it at length gerbert unriddled the mystery at noonday observing the reflection of the forefinger on the ground he marked the spot at night he came to the place with a page carrying a lamp there by a magical operation he opened a wide passage in the earth through which they both descended and came to a vast palace the walls the beams and the whole structure were of gold they saw golden images of knights playing at chess with a king and queen of gold at a banquet with numerous attendants in gold and cups of immense size and value in a recess was a carbuncle whose luster illuminated the whole palace opposite to which stood a figure with a bended bow as they attempted to touch some of the rich furniture all the golden images seemed to rush upon them gerbert was too wise to attempt this a second time but the page was bold enough to snatch from the table a golden knife of exquisite workmanship at that moment all the golden images rose up with a dreadful noise the figure with the bow shot at the carbuncle and a total darkness ensued the page then replaced the knife otherwise they both would have suffered a cruel death malmesbury afterward mentions a brazen bridge framed by the enchantments of gerbert beyond which were golden horses of a gigantic size with riders of gold richly illuminated by the most serene meridian sun a large company attempt to pass the bridge with a design of stealing some pieces of the gold immediately the bridge rose from its foundations and stood perpendicular on one end a brazen man appeared from beneath it who struck the water with a mace of brass and the sky was overspread with the most horrible gloom gerbert like some other learned necromancers of the gothic ages was supposed to have fabricated a brazen head under the influence of certain planets which answered questions but i forbear to suggest any more hints for a future collection of arabian tales i shall only add malmesburys account of the education of gerbert which is a curious illustration of what has been often inculcated in these volumes concerning the introduction of romantic fiction into europe see diss i and vol i  00 seq  gerbert a native of france went into spain for the purpose of learning astrology and other sciences of that cast of the saracens who to this day occupy the upper regions of spain they are seated in the metropolis of seville where according to the customary practice of their country they study the arts of divination and enchantment  here gerbert soon exceeded ptolemy in the astrolabe alchind in astronomy and julius firmicus in fatality here he learned the meaning of the flight and language of birds and was taught how to raise specter from hell here he acquired whatever human curiosity has discovered for the destruction or convenience of mankind i say nothing of his knowledge in arithmetic music and geometry which he so fully understood as to think them beneath his genius and which he yet with great industry introduced into france where they had been long forgotten he certainly was the first who brought the algorithm from the saracens and who

golden coverings to be the most precious supposing they were made to contain the crowns and girdles of the king in doctor johnsons abridgement of a tale like this from boccace which he supposes to

an apartment to be hewed within a rock into which no light could enter and here he shut up the boy totally in the dark yet with proper attendants for twelve years at the end of which time he brought him abroad from his gloomy chamber and placed in his view men women gold precious stones rich garments chariots of exquisite workmanship drawn by horses with golden bridles heaps of purple tapestry armed knights on horseback oxen and sheep these were all distinctly pointed out to the youth but being most pleased with the women he desired to know by what name they were called an esquire of the

were to wait for the kings word and then to kill him in the mean time a table covered with the most costly dishes was spread before him accompanied with all sorts of music then said the king my

sword will penetrate my brain while these four tormentors only wait your command to put me to death the king replied now i will answer your question why i was sad yesterday i am exactly in your

rich man as is the custom with the great was sitting round the fire and telling ancient gests here is a traite of the private life of our ancestors who wanted the diversions and engagements of modern times to relieve a tedious evening hence we learn that when a company was assembled if a jugler or a minstrel were not present it was their custom to entertain themselves by relating or hearing a series of adventures thus the general plan of the canterbury tales which at first sight seems to be merely an ingenious invention of the poet to serve a particular occasion is in great measure founded on a fashion of ancient life and chaucer in supposing each of the pilgrims to tell a tale as they are traveling to beckets shrine only makes them adopt a mode of amusement which was common to the conversations of his age i do not deny that chaucer has shown his address in the use and application of this practice  so habitual was this amusement in the dark ages that the graver sort thought it

after administering the draught which was of so wonderful a nature as to dispel the most oppressive lassitude and to make the body more vigorous than before at length a hunter having drank of this

addicions which altogether consist of poetry in sevenlined stanzas i believe to be lydgate not to insist on the correspondence of time and style i observe that the thirtyfourth chapter of lydgates metrical life of the virgin mary is literally repeated in the thirtyfourth chapter of this translation this chapter is a digression of five or six stanzas in praise of chaucer in which the writer feelingly laments the recent death of his master chaucer poet of britain who used to amend and correct the wrong traces of my rude pen no writer besides in lydgates own lifetime can be supposed with any sort of grace or propriety to have mentioned those personal assistances of chaucer in lydgates own words and if we suppose that the translation or its addicions were written by lydgate before he wrote his life of the virgin the proof will be the same stowe mentions lydgates pilgrimage of the world by the commandment of the earl of salisburie      but this must be a different work ad calc opp chauc fol     col     another piece probably written by lydgate yet never supposed or acknowledged to be of his composition is a poem in the octave stanza containing thirtyseven leaves in folio and entitled laberous and marveylous work of sapience after a long debate between mercy and truth and justice and peace all the products of nature and of human knowledge are described as they stand arranged in the palace and dominions of wisdom it is generally allowed to have been printed by caxton it has not the name of the printer nor any date had it been written by caxton as i once hastily suspected or by any of his cotemporaries the name of lydgate would have appeared in conjunction with those of gower and chaucer who are highly celebrated in the prologue as erthely gods expert in poesy for these three writers were constantly joined in panegyric at least for a century by their successors as the distinguished triumvirate of english poetry in the same prologue the author says he was commanded to write this poem by the king no poet cotemporary with caxton was of consequence enough to receive such a command and we know that lydgate compiled many of his works by the direction or under the patronage of king henry the fifth lydgate was born in suffolk and our author from the circumstance of having lived in a part of england not of a very polished dialect apologizes for the rudeness of his language so that he cannot delycately endyte it is much in the style and manner of lydgate and i believe it to have been one of his early performances see supr vol ii p     i know not

having achieved many splendid exploits for the love of a beautiful lady at length married her three days after his marriage he saw a vision which summoned him to engage in the holy war at parting she gave him a ring saying as often as you look on this ring remember me soon after his departure she had a son after various adventures in which his friend tirius has a share at the end of seven years he returned to england in the habit of a pilgrim coming to his castle he saw at the gate his lady sitting and distributing alms to a crowd of poor people ordering them all to pray for the return of her lord guido from the holy land she was on that day accompanied by her son a little boy very beautiful and richly apparelled and who hearing his mother as she was distributing her alms perpetually recommending guido to their prayers asked if that was his father among others she gave alms to her husband guido not knowing him in the pilgrims disguise guido seeing the little boy took him in his arms and kissed him saying o my sweet son may god give you grace to please him for this boldness he was reproved by the attendants but the lady finding him destitute and a stranger assigned him a cottage in a neighboring forest soon afterward falling sick he said to his servant carry this ring to your lady and tell her if she desires ever to see me again to come hither without delay the servant conveyed the ring but before she arrived he was dead she threw herself on his body and exclaimed with tears where are now my alms which i daily gave for my lord i saw you receive those alms but i knew you not  you beheld embraced and kissed your own son but did not discover yourself to him nor to me what have i done that i shall see you no more she then interred him magnificently  the reader perceives this is the story of guido or guy earl of warwick and probably this is the early outline of the life and death of that renowned champion  many romances were at first little more than legends of devotion containing the pilgrimage of an old warrior at length as chivalry came more into vogue and the stores of invention were increased the youthful and active part of the pilgrims life was also written and a long series of imaginary martial adventures was added in which his religious was eclipsed by his heroic character and the penitent was lost in the knight errant that which was the principal subject of the short and simple legend became only the remote catastrophe of the voluminous romance and hence by degrees it was almost an established rule of every romance for the knight to end his days in a hermitage cervantes has ridiculed this circumstance with great pleasantry where don quixote holds a grave debate with sancho whether he shall turn saint or archbishop  so reciprocal or rather so convertible was the pious and the military character that even some of the apostles had their romance in the ninth century the chivalrous and fabling spirit of the spaniards transformed saint james into a knight they pretended that he appeared and fought with irresistible fury completely armed and mounted on a stately white horse in most of their engagements with the moors and cause by his superior prowess in these bloody conflicts he was supposed to have freed the spaniards from paying the annual tribute of a hundred christian virgins to their infidel enemies they represented him as a professed and powerful champion of distressed damsels this apotheosis of chivalry in the person of their own apostle must have ever afterward contributed to exaggerate the characteristical romantic heroism of the spaniards by which it was occasioned and to propagate through succeeding ages a stronger veneration for that species of military enthusiasm to which they were naturally devoted it is certain that in consequence of these illustrious achievements in the moorish wars saint james was constituted patron of spain and became the founder of one of the most magnificent shrines and of the most opulent order of knighthood now existing in christendom the legend of this invincible apostle is inserted in the mosarabic liturgy  chap clxxiii a king goes to a

anecdotes and the investigation of ancient manners it is extraordinary that a new translation should not be made of froissart from a collated and corrected original of the french froissart is commonly ranked with romances but it ought to be remembered that he is the historian of a romantic age when those manners which form the fantastic books of chivalry were actually practiced as he received his multifarious intelligence from such a variety of vouchers and of different nations and almost always collected his knowledge of events from report rather than from written or recorded evidence his notices of persons and places are frequently confused and unexact many of these petty incorrectnesses are not however to be imputed to froissart and it may seem surprising that there are not more inaccuracies of this kind in a voluminous chronicle treating of the affairs of england and abounding in english appellations composed by a frenchman and printed in france whoever will take the pains to compare this author with the coeval records in rymer will find numerous instances of his truth and integrity in relating the more public and important transactions of his own times why he should not have been honored with a modern edition at the louvre it is easy to conceive the french have a national prejudice against a writer who has been so much more complaisant to england than to their own country upon the whole if froissart should be neglected by the historical reader for his want of precision and authenticity he will at least be valued by the philosopher for his striking pictures of life drawn without reserve or affectation from real nature with a faithful and free pencil and by one who had the best opportunities of observation who was welcome alike to the feudal castle or the royal palace and who mingled in the bustle and business of the world at that very curious period of society when manners are very far refined and yet retain a considerable tincture of barbarism but i

other smaller pieces which they have not named or described among these perhaps is comprehended the gesta which we may conceive to have been thus undistinguished either as having been neglected or proscribed by graver writers or rather as having been probably disclaimed by its author who saw it at length in the light of a juvenile performance abounding in fantastic and unedifying narrations

the novices of the benedictine congregation or monastery at clugni in the year    0 oudin ubi supr p  0    at which time he drew up his notes on the prosody and his commentary on ovid for the use of his scholars about the same time and with a view of rendering their exercises in latinity more agreeable and easy by an entertaining latin storybook yet resoluble into lessons of religion he probably compiled the gesta perpetually addressing the application of every tale to his young audience by the paternal and affectionate appellation of carissimi this by habit and otherwise with no impropriety he seems to have retained in his later and larger works  there was therefore time enough for the gesta to become a fashionable book of tales before boccace published his decameron the action of the decameron being supposed in      the year of the great pestilence we may safely conjecture that boccace did not begin his work till after that period an exact and ingenious critic has proved that it was not finished till the year      see tyrwhitts chaucer iv     seq   i have just observed that berchorius probably compiled this work for the use of his grammatical pupils were there not many good reasons for that supposition i should be induced to think that it might have been intended as a book of stories for the purpose of preachers i have already given instances that it was anciently fashionable for preachers to enforce the several moral duties by applying fables or exemplary narratives and in the present case the perpetual recurrence of the address of carissimi might be brought in favor of this hypothesis but i will here suggest an additional reason soon after the age of berchorius a similar collection of stories of the same cast was compiled though not exactly in the same form professedly designed for sermon writers and by one who was himself an eminent preacher for rather before the year    0 a latin volume was printed in germany written by john herolt a dominican friar of basil better known by the adopted and humble appellation of discipulus and who flourished about the year      it consists of three parts the first is entitled incipiunt sermones pernotabiles discipuli de sanctis per anni circulum that is a set of sermons on the saints of the whole year the second part and with which i am now chiefly concerned is a promptuary or ample repository of examples for composing sermons and in the prologue to this part the author says that saint dominic always abundabat exemplis in his discourses and that he constantly practiced this popular mode of edification this part contains a variety of little histories among others are the following chaucers friars tale aristotle falling in love with a queen who compels him to permit her to ride upon his

the revolutions of taste and so capricious the modes of composition that a latin homilybook of a german monk in the fifteenth century should exhibit outlines of the tales of boccace chaucer and parnell  it may not be thought impertinent to close this discourse with a remark on the moralisations subjoined to the stories of the gesta romanorum this was an age of vision and mystery and every work was believed to contain a double or secondary meaning nothing escaped this eccentric spirit of refinement and abstraction and together with the bible as we have seen not only the general history of ancient times was explained allegorically but even the poetical fictions of the classics were made to signify the great truths of religion with a degree of boldness and a want of a discrimination which in another age would have acquired the character of the most profane levity if not of absolute impiety and can only be defended from the simplicity of the state of knowledge which then prevailed  thus god creating man of clay animated with the vital principle of respiration was the story of prometheus wh formed a man of similar materials to which he communicated life by fire stolen from heaven christ twice born of his father god and of his mother mary was prefigured by bacchus who was first born of semele and afterward of jupiter and as minerva sprung from the brain of jupiter so christ proceeded from god without a mother christ born of the virgin mary was expressed in the fable of danae shut within a tower through the covering of which jupiter descended in a shower of gold and begot perseus acteon killed by his own hounds was a type of the persecution and death of our savior the poet lycophron relates that hercules in returning from the adventure of the golden fleece was shipwrecked and that being devoured by a monstrous fish he was disgorged alive on the shore after three days here was an obvious symbol of christs resurrection john waleys an english frnciscan of the thirteenth century in his moral exposition of ovids metamorphoses i have before mentioned berchoriuss ovid moralized  affords many other instances equally ridiculous and who forgot that he was describing a more heterrogeneous chaos than that which makes so conspicuous a figure in his authors exordium and which combines amid the monstrous and indigested aggregate of its unnatural associations  sine pondere habentia pondus mtam l i  0    at length compositions professedly allegorical with which that age abounded were resolved into allegories for which they were never intended in the famous romaunt of the rose written about the year    0 the poet couches the difficulties of an ardent lover in attaining the object of his passion under the allegory of a rose which is gathered in a delicious but almost inaccessible garden the theologists proved this rose to be the white rose of jericho the new jerusalem a state of grace divine wisdom the holy virgin or eternal beatitude at none of which obstinate heretics can ever arrive the chemists pretended that it was the philosophers stone the civilians that it was the most consummate point of equitable decision and the physicians that it was an infallible panacea in a word other professions in the most elaborate commentaries explained away the lovers rose into the mysteries of their own respective science in conformity to this practice tasso allegorised his own poem and a flimsy structure of morality was raised on the chimerical conceptions of ariostos orlando in the year      a translation of a part of amadis de gaul appeared in france with a learned preface developing the valuable stores of profound instruction concealed under the naked letter of the old romances which were discernible only to the intelligent and totally unperceived by common readers who instead of plucking the fruit were obliged to rest contented with le simple fleur de la lecture litterale even spenser at a later period could not indulge his native impulse to descriptions of chivalry without framing such a story as conveyed under the dark conceit of ideal champions a set of historic transactions and an exemplification of the nature of the

mirror may behold thy face and thine own realms in land of faery and in this antique image thy great ancestry b ii introd st vi  it was not however solely from an unmeaning and a wanton spirit of refinement that the fashion of resolving every thing into allegory so universally prevailed the same apology may be offered for the cabalistical interpreters both of the classics and of the old romances the former not willing that those books should be quite exploded which contained the ancient mythology labored to reconcile the apparent absurdities of the pagan system to the christian mysteries by demonstrating a figurative resemblance the latter as true learning began to dawn with a view of supporting for a while the expiring credit of giants and magicians were compelled to palliate those monstrous incredibilities by a bold attempt to unravel the mystic web which had been wove by fairy hands and by showing that truth was hid under the gorgeous veil of gothic invention  the history of english poetry sect xix our communications and intercourse with italy which began to prevail about the beginning of the sixteenth century not only introduced the studies of classical literature into england but gave a new turn to our vernacular poetry at this period petrarch still continued the most favorite poet of the italians and had established a manner which was universally adopted and imitated by his ingenious countrymen in the mean time the courts both of france and england were distinguished for their elegance francis the first had changed the state of letters in france by mixing gallantry with learning and by admitting the ladies to his court in company with the ecclesiastics see supr vol ii p      his carousals were celebrated with a brilliancy and a festivity unknown to the ceremonious shows of former princes henry the eighth vied with francis in these gaieties his ambition which could not bear a rival even in diversions was seconded by liberality of disposition and a love of ostentation for henry with many boisterous qualities was magnificent and affable had he never murdered his wives his politeness to the fair sex would remain unimpeached his martial sports were unincumbered by the barbaric pomp of the ancient chivalry and softened by the growing habits of more rational manners he was attached to those spectacles and public amusements in which beauty assumed a principal share and his frequent masks and tournaments encouraged a high spirit of romantic courtesy poetry was the natural accompaniment of these refinements henry himself was a leader and a chief character in these pageantries and at the same time a reader and a writer of verses the language and the manners of italy were esteemed and studied the sonnets of petrarch were the great models of composition they entered into the genius of the fashionable manners and in a court of such a complexion petrach of course became the popular poet henry howard earl surrey with a mistress perhaps as beautiful as laura and at least with petrarchs passion if not his taste led the way to great improvements in english poetry by a happy imitation of petrarch and other italian poets who had been most successful in painting the anxieties of love with pathos and propriety  lord surreys life throws so much light on the character and subjects of his poetry that it is almost impossible to consider the one without exhibiting a few anecdotes of the other he was the son and grandson of two lords treasurers dukes of norfolk and in his early childhood discovered the most promising marks of lively parts and an active mind  while a boy he was habituated to the modes of a court at windsorcastle where he resided yet under the care of proper instructors in the quality of a companion to henry fitzroy duke of richmond a natural son of king henry the eighth and of the highest expectations  this young nobleman who also bore other titles and honors was the child of henrys affection not so much on account of hi hopeful abilities as for a reason insinuated by lord herbert and at which those who know henrys history and character will not be surprised because he equally and strongly resembled both his father and mother  a friendship of the closest kind commencing between these two illustrious youths about the year    0 they were both removed to cardinal wolseys college at oxford then universally frequented as well for the excellence as the novelty of its institution for it was one of the first seminaries of an english university that professed to explode the pedantries of the old barbarous philosophy and to cultivate the graces of polite literature two years afterward for the purpose of acquiring every accomplishment of an elegant education the earl accompanied his noble friend and fellowpupil into france where they received king henry on his arrival at calais to visit francis the first with a most magnificent retinue the frienship of these two young noblemen was soon strengthened by a new tie for richmond married the lady mary howard surreys sister richmond however appears to have died in the year      about the age of seventeen having never cohabited with his wife wood ath oxon i     it was long before surrey forgot the untimely loss of this amiable youth the friend and associate of his childhood and who nearly resembled himself in genius refinement of manners and liberal acquisitions  the fair geraldine the general object of lord surreys passionate sonnets is commonly said to have lived at florence and to have been of the family of the gerai of that city this is a mistake yet not entirely without grounds propagated by an easy misapprehension of an expression in one of our poets odes and a passage in draytons heroic epistles she was undoubtedly one of the daughters of gerald fitzgerald earl of kildare but it will be necessary to transcribe what our author himself has said of this celebrated lady the history of one who caused so memorable and so poetical a passion naturally excites curiosity and will justify an investigation which on many a similar occasion would properly be censured as frivolous and impertinent  from tuskane came my ladies worthy race fair florence was sumtyme her i e their ancient seat the western isle whose pleasant shore does face wild cambers cliffs did gyve her lively heat fostred she was with milk of irishe breast her sire an earl her dame of princes blood from tender years in britain she does rest with kings child where she tastes costly food hunsdon did first present her to mine yien bright is her hew and geraldine she hight hampton me taught to wish her first mine and windsor alas does chase me from her sight fol   edit       these notices it must be confessed are obscure and indirect but a late elegant biographer has with the most happy sagacity solved the difficulties of this little enigmatical ode which had been before either neglected and unattempted as inexplicable or rendered more unintelligible by false conjectures i readily adopt mr walpoles key to the genealogy of the matchless geraldine catal roy and noble authors vol i p  0  edit        her poetical appellation is almost her real name gerald fitzgerald abovementioned earl of kildare in the reign of henry the eighth married a second wife margaret daughter of thomas gray marquis of dorset by whom he had three daughters margaret elisabeth and cicely margaret was born deaf and dumb and a lady who could neither hear nor answer her lover and who wanted the means of contributing to the most endearing reciprocations can hardly be supposed to have been the cause of any vehement effusions of amorous panegyric we may therefore safely pronounce elisabeth or cicely to have been surreys favorite it was probably elisabeth as she seems always to have lived in england  every circumstance of the sonnet evidently coincides with this state of the case but to begin with the first line it will naturally be asked what was lady elisabeth geralds connection with tuscany the beginnings of noble families like those of nations often owe somewhat to fictitious embellishment and our genealogists uniformly assert that the family of fitzgerald derives its origin from otho a descendant of the dukes of tuscany that they migrated into england under the reign of king alfred whose annals are luckily too scanty to contradict such an account and were from england speedily transplanted into ireland her father was an irish earl resident at his earldom of kildare and she was consequently born and nursed in ireland her mother adds the sonnet was of princely parentage here is a no less exact correspondence with the line of the ladys pedigree for thomas marquis of dorset was son of queen elisabeth gray daughter of the duchess of bedford descended from the royal house of luxemburgh the poet acquaints us that he first saw her at hunsdon this notice which seems of an indifferent nature and quite extraneous to the question abundantly corroborates our conjecture hundsdonhouse in hertfordshire was a new palace built by henry the eighth and chiefly for the purpose of educating his children the lady elisabeth fitzgerald was second cousin to henrys daughters the princesses mary and elisabeth who were both educated at hunsdon strype eccl mem vol i append numb     at this royal nursery she therefore tasted of costly food with kings child that is lived while a girl with the young princesses her relations as a companion in their education at the same time and on the same plan our earl of surrey resided at windsorcastle as i have already remarked with the young duke of richmond it is natural to suppose that he sometimes visited the princesses at hunsdon in company with the young duke their brother where he must have also seen the fair geraldine yet by the nature of his situation at windsor which implied a degree of confinement he was hindered from visiting her at hunsdon so often as he wished he therefore pathetically laments windsor alas does chase me from her sight but although the earl first beheld this lady at the palace of hunsdon yet as we further learn from the sonnet he was first struck with her incomparable beauty and his passion commenced at hampton court hampton me taught to wish her first for mine that is and perhaps on occasion of some splendid masque or carousal when the lady elisabeth fitzgerald with the princesses mary and elisabeth and their brother richmond with the young lord surrey were invited by the king to hampton court  in the mean time we must remember that the lord leonard gray uncle to lord gerald fitzgerald was deputy of ireland for the young duke of richmond a connection exclusive of all that has been said which would alone account for surreys acquaintance at least with this lady it is also a reason to say no more why the earl should have regarded her from the first with a particular attention which afterward grew into the most passionate attachment she is supposed to have been maid of honor to queen catharine but there are three of henrys queens of that name for obvious reasons however we may venture to say that queen catharine howard was geraldines queen  it is not precisely known at what period the earl of surrey began his travels they have the air of a romance he made the tour of europe in the true spirit of chivalry and with the ideas of an amadis proclaiming the unparalleled charms of his mistress and prepared to defend the cause of her beauty with the weapons of knighterrantry nor was this adventurous journey performed without the intervention of an enchanter the first city in italy which he proposed to visit was florence the capital of tuscany and the original seat of the ancestors of his geraldine in his way thither he passed a few days at the emperors court where he became acquainted with cornelius agrippa a celebrated adept in natural magic this visionary philosopher showed our hero in a mirror of glass a living image of geraldine reclining on a couch sick and reading one of his most tender sonnets by a waxen taper drayton her epist  howard to geraldine v     his imagination which wanted not the flattering representations and artificial incentives of illusion was heated anew by this interesting and affecting spectacle inflamed with every enthusiasm of the most romantic passion he hastened to florence and on his arrival immediately published a defiance against any person who could handle a lance and was in love whether christian jew turk saracen or canibal who should presume to dispute the superiority of geraldines beauty as the lady was pretended to be of tuscan extraction the pride of the florentines was flattered on this occasion and the grand duke of tuscany permitted a general and unmolested ingress into his dominions of the combatants of all countries till this important trial should be decided the challenge was accepted and the earl victorious wood ubi supr  the shield which he presented to the duke before the tournament began is exhibited in virtues valuable plate of the arundel family and was actually in the possession of the late duke of norfolk walpole ancd paint i      these heroic vanities did not however so totally engross the time which surrey spent in italy as to alienate his mind from letters he studied with the greatest success a critical knowledge of the italian tongue and that he might give new luster to the name of geraldine attained a just taste for the peculiar graces of the italian poetry  he was recalled to england for some idle reason by the king much sooner than he expected and he returned home the most elegant traveller the most polite lover the most learned nobleman and the most accomplished gentleman of his age dexterity in tilting and gracefulness in managing a horse under arms were excellencies now viewed with a critical eye and practiced with a high degree of emulation in    0 at a tournament held in the presence of the court at westminster and in which the principal of the nobility were engaged surrey was distinguished above the rest for his address in the use and exercise of arms but his martial skill was not solely displayed in the parade and ostentation of these domestic combats in      he marched into scotland as a chief commander in his fathers army and was conspicuous for his conduct and bravery at the memorable battle of floddenfield where james the fourth of scotland was killed the next year we find the career of his victories impeded by an obstacle which no valor could resist the censures of the church have humiliated the greatest heroes and he was imprisoned in windsorcastle for eating flesh in lent the prohibition had been renewed or strengthened by a recent proclamation of the king i mention this circumstance not only as it marks his character impatient of any control and careless of very serious consequences which often arise from a contempt of petty formalities but as it gave occasion to one of his most sentimental and pathetic sonnets fol      in      he was fieldmarshal of the english army in the expedition to bologne which he took in that age love and arms constantly went together and it was amid the fatigues of this protracted campaign that he composed his last sonnet called the fancy of a wearied lover fol    see dudg baronag ii p       but as surreys popularity increased his interest declined with the king whose caprices and jealousies grew more violent with his years and infirmities the brilliancy of surreys character his celebrity in the military science his general abilities his wit learning and affability were viewed by henry with disgust and suspicion it was in vain that he possessed every advantageous qualification which could adorn the scholar the courtier and the soldier in proportion as he was amiable in the eyes of the people he became formidable to the king his rising reputation was misconstrued into a dangerous ambition and gave birth to accusations equally groundless and frivolous he was suspected of a design to marry the princess mary and by that alliance of approaching to a possibility of wearing the crown it was insinuated that he conversed with foreigners and held a correspondence with cardinal pole  the addition of the escocheon of edward the confessor to his own although used by the family of norfolk for many years and justified by the authority of the heralds was a sufficient foundation for an impeachment of high treason these motives were privately aggravated by those prejudices with which henry remembered the misbehaviour of catharine howard and which were extended to all that ladys relations at length the earl of surrey fell a sacrifice to the peevish injustice of a merciless and ungrateful master notwithstanding his eloquent and masculine defense which even in the cause of guilt itself would have proved a powerful persuasive he was condemned by the prepared suffrage of a servile and obsequious jury and beheaded on tower hill in the year      see stowe chron p     challoner de republ angl instaurand lib ii p     in the mean time we should remember that surreys public conduct was not on all occasions quite unexceptionable in the affair of bologne he had made a false step this had offended the king but henry when once offended could never forgive and when hertford was sent into france to take the command he could not refrain from dropping some reproachful expressions against a measure which seemed to impeach his personal courage conscious of his high birth and capacity he was above the little attentions of caution and reserve and he too frequently neglected to consult his own situation and the kings temper it was his misfortune to serve a monarch whose resentments which were easily provoked could only be satisfied by the most severe revenge henry brought those men to the block which other monarchs would have only disgraced  among these anecdotes of surreys life i had almost forgot to mention what became of his amor with the fair geraldine we lament to find that surreys devotion to this lady did not end in a wedding and that all his gallantries and verses availed so little no memoirs of that incurious age have informed us whether her beauty was equalled by her cruelty or whether her ambition prevailed so far over her gratitude as to tempt her to prefer the solid glories of a more splendid title and ample fortune to the challenges and the compliments of so magnanimous so faithful and so eloquent a lover she appears however to have been afterward the third wife of edward clinton earl of lincoln such also is the power of time and accident over amorous vows that even surrey himself outlived the violence of his passion he married frances daughter of john earl of oxford by whom he left several children one of his daughters jane countess of westmoreland was among the learned ladies of that age and became famous for her knowledge of the greek and latin languages dugd baron i     ii       surreys poems were in high reputation with his cotemporaries and for many years afterward he is thus characterised by the author of the old art of english poesy whose opinion remained long as a rule of criticism in the latter end of the same kings henry reign spronge up a new company of courtly makers of whom sir thomas wyat the elder and henry earl of surrey were the two chieftaines who having travailed into italy and there tasted the sweet and stately measured and style of the italian poesy as novices newly crept out of the schools of dante ariosto and petrarch they greatly polished our rude and homely manner of vulgar poesy from that it had been before and for that cause may justly be said the first reformers of our english meeter and style lib i chapter xxxi p    edit       and again toward the close of the same chapter henry earl of surrey and sir thomas wyat between whom i find very little difference i repute them as before for the two chief lanternes of light to all others that have since employed their pens upon english poesy their conceits were lofty their styles stately their conveyance cleanly their terms proper their meetre sweet and wellproportioned in all imitating very naturally and studiously their master francis petrarcha ibid p  0  i forbear to recite the testimonies of leland sydney tuberville churchyard and drayton nor have these pieces although scarcely known at present been without the panegyric of more recent times surrey is praised by waller and fenton and he seems to have been a favorite with pope pope in windsorforest having compared his patron lord granville with surrey he was immediately reprinted but without attracting many readers by sewell      reprinted by curl ib  it was vainly imagined that all the world would eagerly wish to purchase the works of a neglected ancient english poet whom pope had called the granville of a former age so rapid are the revolutions of our language and such the uncerainty of literary fame that philips miltons nephew who wrote about the year      has remarked that in his time surreys poetry was antiquated and totally forgotten thatr potar p    edit        mo   our authors songs and sonnettes as they have been styled were first collected and printed at london by tottell in      in

kind they are of various merit surrey is said by the ingenious author of the muses library to have been the first who broke through the fashion of stanzas and wrote in the heroic couplet but all surreys poems are in the alternate rhyme nor had this been true is the other position to be granted chaucers prologues and most of the canterbury tales are written in long verse nor was the use of the couplet resumed till late in the reign of elisabeth  in the sonnets of surrey we are surprised to find nothing of that metaphysical cast which marks the italian poets his supposed masters especially petrarch surreys sentiments are for the most part natural and unaffected arising from his own feelings and dictated by the present circumstances his poetry is alike unembarrassed by learned allusions or elaborate conceits if our author copies petrarch it is petrarchs better manner when he descends from his platonic abstractions his refinements of passion his exaggerated compliments and his play upon opposite sentiments into a track of tenderness simplicity and nature petrarch would have been a better poet had he been a worse scholar our authors mind was not too much overlaid by learning  the following is the poem abovementioned in which he laments his imprisonment in windsorcastle but it is rather an elegy than a sonnet  so cruel prison how could betyde alas as proud windsor how could the

our english youth by travail unto fame an eye whose judgment none affect passion could blind friends to allure and foes to reconcile whose persing piercing look did represent a mind with virtue

kings amors  some passages in his description of the restless state of a lover are pictures of the heart and touched with delicacy  i wish for night more covertly to plain and me withdraw from every haunted place lest by my chere behavior looks my chance appear too plain and in my mind i mesure pace by pace to seek the place where i myself had lost that day when i was tangled in the lace in

commonly supposed to have been confined to sentiment and amorous lamentation were adapted to descriptive poetry and the representations of rural imagery a writer only that viewed the beauties of nature with poetic eyes could have selected the vernal objects which compose the following exquisite ode fol     the soote season that bud and blome forth brings with grene has clad the hill and eke

as may begile the night contented with thine own estate ne wish for death ne fear his might fol     but surrey was not merely the poet of idleness and gallantry he was fitted both from nature and study for the more solid and laborious parts of literature he translated the second and fourth books of virgil into blank verse they were first printed in        mo  and it seems probable that his active situations of life prevented him from completing a design of translating the whole eneid  this is the first composition in blank verse extant in the english language nor has it merely the relative and accidental merit of being a curiosity it is executed with great fidelity yet not with a prosaic servility the diction is often poetical and the versification varied with proper pauses this is the description of dido and eneas going to the field in the fourth book   at the threshold of her chaumberdore the carthage lords did on the queen attend the trampling steed with gold and

the fury of this flame this was a noble attempt to break the bondage of rhyme but blank verse was now growing fashionable in the italian poetry the school of surrey felice figlinei a sanese and surreys cotemporary in his admirable italian commentary on the ethics of aristotle entitled filososia morale sopra il libri d ethica daristotile declaims against the barbarity of rhyme and strongly recommends a total rejection of this gothic ornament to his countrymen he enforces his precept by his own example and translates all aristotles quotations from homer and euripides into verse without rhyme gonsalvo perez the learned secretary to philip of spain had also recently translated homers odyssey into spanish blankverse how much the excellent roger ascham approved of surreys disuse of rhyme in this translation from virgil appears from the following passage in his scholemaster written about the year      i know of no english critic besides who has mentioned surreys virgil except

best that write in these days in italy  and you that be able to understand no more than ye find in the italian tongue and never went further than the school of petrarch and ariosto abroad or else of chaucer at home though you have pleasure to wander blindlie still in your foul wrong way envy not others that seek as wise men have done before them the fairest and ryghtest way  and therefore even as virgill and horace deserve most worthy praise that they spying the unperfitness in ennius and plautus by true imitation of homer and euripides brought poetry to the same perfectnes in latin as it was in greek even so those that by the same way would benefit their tongue and country deserve rather thanks than disprayse b ii p    b    a edit       to   the revival of the greek and roman poets in italy excited all the learned men of that country to copy the roman versification and consequently banished the old leonine latin verse the same classical idea operated in some degree on the vernacular poetry of italy in the year      trissino published his italia liberata di goti or italy delivered from the goths an heroic poem professedly written in imitation of the iliad without either rhyme or the usual machineries of the gothic romance trissinos design was to destroy the terza rima of dante we do not however find whether it be from the facility with which the italian tongue falls into rhyme or that the best and established italian poets wrote in the stanza that these efforts to restore blankverse produced any lasting effects in the progress of the italian poetry it is very probable that this specimen of the eneid in blankverse by surrey led the way to abraham flemings blankverse translation of virgils bucolics and georgics although done in alexandrines published in the year      london  to   lord surrey wrote many other english poems which were never published and are now perhaps entirely lost he translated the ecclesiastes of solomon into english verse this piece is cited in the preface to the translation of the psalms printed at london in      he also translated a few of the psalms into meter these versions of scripture show that he was a friend to the reformation among his works are also recited a poem on his friend the young duke of richmond an exhortation to the citizens of london a translation of boccaces epistle to pinus and a set of latin

commendations many translations done by surrey from the latin italian french and spanish languages but these it is probable were nothing more than juvenile exercises  surrey for his justness of thought correctness of style and purity of expression may justly be pronounced the first english classical poet he unquestionably is the first polite writer of loveverses in our language it must however be allowed that there is a striking native beauty in some of our loveverses written much earlier than surreys but in the most savage ages and countries rude nature has taught elegance to the lover  sect xx with surreys poems tottel has joined in his editions of      and      the songs and sonnettes of sir thomas wyat the elder wyats begin at fol     and of uncertain auctours  wyat was of allingtoncastle in kent which he magnificently repaired and educated in both our universities but his chief and most splendid accomplishments were derived from his travels into various parts of europe which he frequently visited in the quality of an envoy he was endeared to king henry the eighth who did not always act from caprice for his fidelity and success in the execution of public business his skill in arms literature familiarity with languages and lively conversation wood who degrades every thing by poverty of style and improper representations says that the king was in a high manner delighted with his witty jests ath oxon i     it is not perhaps improbable that henry was as much pleased with his repartees as his politics he is reported to have occasioned the reformation by a joke and to have planned the fall of cardinal wolsey by a seasonable story se miscellaneous antiquities numb ii page    printed at strawberryhill       to  but he had almost lost his popularity either from an intimacy with queen anne boleyn which was called a connection or the gloomy cabals of bishop bonner who could not bear his political superiority yet his prudence and integrity no less than the powers of his oratory justified his innocence he laments his severe and unjust imprisonment on that trying occasion in a sonnet addressed to sir francis bryan insinuating his solicitude that although the wound would be healed the scar would remain and that to be acquitted of the accusation would avail but little while the thoughts of having been accused were still fresh in remembrance fol     it is a common mistake that he died abroad of the plague in an embassy to charles the fifth being sent to conduct that emperors ambassador from falmouth to london from too eager and a needless desire of executing his commission with dispatch and punctuality he caught a fever by riding in a hot day and in his return died on the road at shirburn where he was buried in the great conventual church in the year      the next year leland published a book of latin verses on his death with a wooden print of his head prefixed probably done by holbein naenae in mortem t viati land       to see also lelands encom p      it will be superfluous to transcribe the panegyrics of his cotemporaries after the encomium of lord surrey in which his amiable character owes more to truth than to the graces of poetry or to the flattery of friendship  we must agree with a critic above quoted that wyat cooperated with surry in having corrected the roughness of our poetic style but wyat although sufficiently distinguished from the common versifiers of his age is confessedly inferior to surrey in harmony of numbers perspicuity of expression and facility of phraseology nor is he equal to surrey in elegance of sentitiment in nature and sensibility his feelings are disguised by affectation and obscured by conceit his declarations of passion are embarrassed by wit and fancy and his style is not intelligible in proportion as it is careless and unadorned his compliments like the modes of behavior in that age are ceremonious and strained he has too much art as a lover and too little as a poet his gallantries are labored and his versification negligent the truth is his genius was of the moral and didactic species and his poems abound more in good sense satire and observations on life than in pathos or imagination yet there is a degree of lyric sweetness in the following lines to his lute in which the lover complains of the unkindness of his love  my lute awake perform the last labor that thou and i shall wast and end that i have now begone and when this song is sung and past my lute be still for i have done as to be heard where care is none as lead to grave in marble stone my song now pearse her heart as sone should we then sigh or sing or moan no no my lute for i have done the rocks do not so cruelly repulse the waves continually as she my suit and affection so that i am past remedy whereby wherefore my lute and i have done proud of the spoil which thou has got of simple hearts through loves shot by whom unkind thou have them won think not he has his bow forgotte although my lute and i have done vengeance shall fall on thy disdain that make but game on earnest pain think not alone under the sun unquit unacquitted free to cause thy lovers plain although my lute and i have done may chance thee it may chance you may etc lie withered and old in winter nights that are so cold plaining in vain unto the moon moon  thy wishes then dare not be told care then who list for i have done and then may chance thee to repent the time that thou have lost and spent to cause thy lovers sighe and swowne then shall thou know beauty but lent and wish and want as i have done now cease my lute this is the last labor that thou and i shall wast and ended is that that we begone now is this song both song and past my lute be still for i have done fol     our author has more imitations and even translations from the italian poets than surrey and he seems to have been more fond of their conceits petrarch has described the perplexities of a lovers mind and his struggles betwixt hope and despair a subject most fertile of sentimental complaint by a combination of contrarieties a species of wit highly relished by the italians i am says he neither at peace nor war i burn and i freeze i soar to heaven and yet grovel on the earth i can hold nothing and yet grasp every thing my prison is neither shut nor is it opened i see without eyes and i complain without a voice i laugh and i weep i live and am dead laura to what a condition am i reduced by your cruelty  pace non trovo e non ho da far guerra e temo e spero ed ardo e son en un ghiaccio e volo sopral

altrui pascomi di dolor piangendo rido egualmente mi spiace morte e vita in questo stato son donna per vui son ciii there is a sonnet in imitation of this among those of the uncertain auctours at the end of surrey poems fol  0  and in davisons poems b ii canzon viii p  0   th edit land        mo  wyat has thus copied this sonnet of epigrams  i find no peace and all my war is done i fear and hope i burn and frese likewise i fly aloft and yet cannot arise and naught i have and at the world i season that locks that which locks i e a key nor loses nor holds me in prison and holds me not yet can i escape no wise nor lettes me live nor dye at my devie and yet of death it gives me occasion without eye i se without tongue i plain i wish to perish yet i ask for health i love another and i hate myself i feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain lo thus displeases me both death and life and my delight is causer of this strife fol        it was from the capricious and overstrained invention of the italian poets that wyat was taught to orture the passion of love by prolix and intricate comparisons and unnatural allusions at one time his love is a galley steered by cruelty through stormy seas and dangerous rocks the sails torn by the blast of tempestuous sighs and the cordage consumed by incessant showers of tears a cloud of grief envelopes the stars reason is drowned and the haven is at a distance fol     at another fol     it is a spring trickling from the summit of the alps which gathering force in its fall at length overflows all the plain beneath fol     sometimes it is a gun which being overcharged expands the flame within itself and bursts in pieces fol     sometimes it is like a prodigious mountain which is perpetually weeping in copious fountains and sending forth sighs from its forests which bears more leaves than fruits which breeds wildbeasts the proper emblems of rage and harbors birds that are always singing fol     in another of his sonnets he says that all nature sympathises with his passion the woods resound his elegies the rivers stop their course to hear him complain and the grass weeps in dew these thoughts are common and fantastic but he adds an image which is new and has much nature and sentiment although not well expressed the hugy oaks have rored in the wind each thing methought complaining in their kind this is a touch of the pensive and the apostrophe which follows is natural and simple ah stony heart who has thus framed thee so cruel that art clothed with beauty fol     and there is much strength in these lines of the lover to his bed the place of sleep wherein i do but wake besprent with tears my bed i thee forsake fol     but such passages as these are not the general characteristics of wyats poetry they strike us but seldom amidst an impracticable mass of forced reflections hyperbolical metaphors and complaints that move no compassion  but wyat appears a much more pleasing writer when he moralizes on the felicities of retirement and attacks the vanities and vices of a court with the honest indignation of an independent philosopher and the freedom and pleasantry of horace three of his poetical epistles are professedly written in this strain two to john poines he seems to have been a person about the court see life of sir thomas pope p     and the other to sir francis bryan and we must regret that he has not left more pieces in a style of composition for which he seems to have been eminently qualified in one of the epistles to poines on the life of a courtier are these spirited and manly reflections  mine own john poines since ye delight to know the causes why that homewarde i me draw and flee the prease press crowd of courts where so they go the court was perpetually moving from one palace to another  rather than to live thrall under the awe of lordly looks wrapped within my cloak to will and lust learning to set a law it is not that because i scorn or mock the power of them whom fortune here has lent charge over us of right justice to strike the stroke but true it is that i have always meant less to esteem them than the common sort of outward things that judge in their intent without regard what inward does resort i grant sometime of glory that the fire does touch my heart me list not to report to speak favorably of what is bad  blame by honor nor honor to desire but how can i this honor now attain that cannot die the color black a liar my poines i cannot frame my tune perhaps the reding is tongue to feign to cloak the truth etc in pursuit of this argument he declares his indisposition and inability to disguise the truth and to flatter by a variety of instances among others he protests he cannot prefer chaucers tale of sir thopas to his palamon and arite  praise sir thopas for a noble tale and scorn the story that the knight told praise him for counsel that is drunk of ale grinne when he laughes that bears all the sway frown when he frowns and groan when he is pale on others lust to hang both night and day etc i mention this circumstance about chaucer to show the esteem in which the knights tale that noble epic poem of the dark ages was held in the reign of henry eighth by men of taste  the poets execration of flatterers and courtiers is contrasted with the following entertaining picture of his own private life and rural enjoyments at allinghamcastle in kent  this is the cause that i could never yet hang on their sleeve that weigh as thou may se a chippe of chance more than a pound of wit this makes me at home to hunt and hawke and in foul wether at my book to sit in frost and snow then with my bow to stalk no man does mark whereso i ride or go in lusty leas in large fields over fruitful grounds at liberty i walk and of these news i feel no weal nor woe save that a clogge does hang yet at my hele probably he alludes to some office which he still held at court and which sometimes recalled him but not too frequently from the country  no force for that for it is ordered so that i may leap both hedge and dike full well i am not now in france to judge the wine etc but i am here in kent and christendom among the muses where i read and rhyme where if thou list mine own john poines to come thou shall be judge how do i spend my time fol     in another epistle to john poines on the security and happiness of a moderate fortune he versifies the fable of the city and country mouse with much humor my mothers maids when they do sow and spinne they sing a song made of the feldishe mouse etc this fable appositely suggests a train of sensible and pointed observations on the weakness of human conduct and the delusive plans of life  alas my poines how men do seek the best and find the worse by error as they stray and no marvel when sight is so oppressed and blindes the guide anon out of the way goes guide and all in seking quiet life o wretched minds there is no gold that may grant that you seek no war no peace no strife no no although thy head were hoopt with gold serjaunt at mace with hawbert halbert a parade of guards etc the classical allusion is obvious  sword nor knife cannot repulse the care that follow should each kind of life has with him his disease live in delites even as thy lust would and thou shall find when lust does most thee please it irketh strait and by itself does fade a small thing is it that may thy mind appease none of you al there is that is so mad to seek for grapes on brambles or on breeres so read instead of bryrs  nor nonne i trow that has a wit so badde to set his hay for conneyes oer riveres nor yet set not a drag net for a hare and yet the thing that most is your desire you do misseke with more travel and care make plain thine heart that it be not knotted with hope or dread and se thy will be bare free  from all affects passions  whom vice has never spotted thyself content with that is thee assinde assigned  and use it well that is to the allotted then seek no more out of thyself to find the thing that thou have sought so long before for thou shall feel it sticking in thy mind  these platonic doctrines are closed with a beautiful application of virtue personified and introduced in her irresistible charms of visible beauty for those who deviate into vain and vicious pursuits  none other pain pray i for them to be but when the rage does lead them from the right that loking backwarde virtue they may se even as she is so goodly fair and bright fol        with these disinterested strains we may join the following single stanza called the courtiers life  in court to serve decked with fresh array of sugared delicious meats feeling the sweet repaste the life in bankets and sundry kinds of play amid the prease of worldly looks to waste has with it joinde often times such bitter taste that whosoever joys such kind of life to hold in prison joys fettred with chains of gold fol     wyat may justly be deemed the first polished english satirist i am of opinion that he mistook his talents when in compliance with the mode he became a sonnetteer and if we may judge from a few instances that he was likely to have treated any other subject with more success than that of love his abilities were seduced and misapplied in fabricating fine speeches to an obdurate mistress in the following little ode or rather epigram on a very different occasion there is great simplicity and propriety together with a strain of poetic allusion it is on his return from spain into england  tagus farewell that westward with thy stremes turns up the grains of gold al ready tried pure gold  for i with spur and ayle go seek the temes the thames  gainward the sun that shows her welthy pride and to the town that brutus sought by dremes a tradition in geoffrey of monmouth  like bended moon the old city from the river appeared in the shape of a crescent that leanes her lusty strong flourishing populous etc side my king my country i seek for whom i live o mighty jove the winds for this me give fol     among wyats poems is an unfinished translation in alexandrine verse of the song of iopas in the first book of virgils eneid fol     wyats and surreys versions from virgil are the first regular translations in english of an ancient classic poet and they are symptoms of the restoration of the study of the roman writers and of the revival of elegant literature a version of davids psalms by wyat is highly extolled by lord surrey and leland but wyats version of the penitential psalms seems to be a separate work from his translation of the whole psaltery and probably that which is praised by surrey in an ode above quoted and entitled praise of certain psalms of david translated by sir t wyat the elder fol    see supr p     they were printed with this title in      certain psalms chosen out of the psalms of david commonly called vij penytentiall psalms drawn into english meter by sir thomas wyat knight whereunto is added a prolog of the aucthore before every psalm very pleasant and profettable to the godly reader imprinted at london in pauls churchyard at the sign of the star by thomas raynald and john harryngton cum previlegio ad imprimendum solum mdxlix leland seems to speak of the larger version  transtulit in nostram davidis carmina linguam et numeros magna reddidit art pares non morietur opus tersum spectabile sacrum nn ut supr  but this version with that of surrey mentioned above is now lost see hollinsh chrn iii p     col    and the pious thomas sternhold and john hopkins are the only immortal translators of davids psalms  a similarity or rather sameness of studies as it is a proof so perhaps it was the chief cement of that inviolable friendship which is said to have subsisted between wyat and surrey the principal subject of their poetry was the same and they both treated the passion of love in the spirit of the italian poets and as professed disciples of petrarch they were alike devoted to the melioration of their native tongue and an attainment of the elegancies of composition they were both engaged in translating virgil and in rendering select portions of scripture into english meter  sect xxi to the poems of surrey and wyat are annexed as i have before hinted in tottells editions those of uncertain authors they begin at fol  0  this latter collection forms the first printed poetical miscellany in the english language

famous declaration sent to pope clement the seventh he was brother to queen anne boleyn with whom he was suspected of a criminal familiarity the chief accusation against him seems to have been that he was seen to whisper with the queen one morning while she was in bed as he had been raised by the exaltation he was involved in the misfortunes of that injured princess who had no other fault but an unuarded and indiscrete frankness of nature and whose character has been blackened by the bigoted historians of the catholic cause merely because she was the mother of queen elisabeth to gratify the ostensible jealousy of the king who had conceived a violent passion for a new object this amiable nobleman was beheaded on the first of may in      see dugd baron iii p  0  a  his elegance of person

nature ubi supr  these are now lost unless some as i have insinuated are contained in the present collection a garland in which it appears to have been the fashion for every flowery courtier to leave some of his blossoms but boleyns poems cannot now be distinguished  the lord vaulx whom i have supposed and on surer proof to be another contributor to this miscellany could not be the nicholas lord vaux whose gown of purple velvet plated with gold eclipsed all the company present at the marriage of prince arthur who shines as a statesman and a soldier with uncommon luster in the history of henry the seventh and continued to adorn the earlier annals of his successor and who died in the year      lord vaux the poet was probably thomas lord vaux the son of nicholas and who was summoned to parliament in      and seems to have lived till the latter end of the reign of queen mary see what i have said of his son lord william in the life of sir thomas pope p     in      sir tho pope leaves him a legacy of one hundred pounds by the name of lord vaulx  all our old writers mention the poetical lord vaux as rather posterior to wyat and surrey neither of whom was known as a writer till many years after the death of lord nicholas george gascoyne who wrote in      in his panegyric on the english poets places vaux after surrey  piers plowman was full plain and chaucers spreet was great earl surrey had a goodly vain lord vaux the mark did beat puttenham author of the art of english poesy having spoken of surrey and wyat immediately adds in the same time or not long after was the lord nicholas the christian name is a mistake into which it was asy to fall vaux a man of much facility in vulgar making fol     web in his discourse of english poetry published in      has a similar arrangement great numbers of vauxs poems are extant in the paradise of dainty devises and instead of the rudeness of skeleton they have a smoothness and facility of manner which does not belong to poetry written before the year      in which lord nicholas vaux died an old man see percys ball ii    edit       the paradise of dainty devises was published in      and he is there simply styled lord vaulx the elder this was to distinguish him from his son lord william then living if lord nicholas was a writer of poetry i will venture to assert that none of his performances now remain notwithstanding the testimony of wood who says that nicholas in his juvenile years was sent to oxon where by reading humane and romantic rather than philosophical authors he advanced his genius very much in poetry and history ath oxon i     this may be true of his son thomas whom i suppose to be the poet but such was the celebrity of lord nicholass public and political character that he has been made to monopolise every merit which was the property of his successors all these difficulties however are at once adjusted by a manuscript in the british museum in which we have a copy of vauxs poem beginning i loathe that i did love with this title a dyttye or sonet made by the lord vaus in the time of the noble queen marye representing the image of death mss harl   0      this sonnet or rather ode entitled the aged lover renounceth love which was more remembered for its morality than its poetry and which is idly conjectured to have been written on his deathbed g gascoyne says the l vaux his dittie beginning thus i loath was thought by some to be made upon his dathbed etc epistl to the young gentlemen prefixed to his poems  makes a part of the collection which i am now examining fol     from this ditty are taken three of the stanzas yet greatly disguised and corrupted of the gravediggers song in shakespeares hamlet act v  another of lord vauxs poems in the volume before us is the assault of cupide upon the fort in which the lovers heart lay wounded fol     these two are the only pieces in our collection of which there is undoubted evidence although no name is prefixed to either that they were written by lord vaux from palpable coincidencies of style subject and other circumstances a slender share of critical sagacity is sufficient to point out many others  these three writers were cotemporaries with surrey and wyat but the subjects of some of the pieces will go far in ascertaining the date of the collection in general there is one on the death of sir thomas wyat the elder who died as i have remarked in      fol     another on the death of lord chancellor audley who died in      fol     another on the death of master devereux a son of lord ferrers who is said to have been a cato for his counsel fol     and who is probably richard devereux buried in berkyng church stowe surv land p     fol ed  the son of walter lord ferrers a distinguished statesman and

the death of phillips an eminent musician and without his rival on the lute fol    one philips is mentioned among the famous english musicians in meress wits tresurie      fol     i cannot ascertain who this phillips a musician was but one robert phillips or phelipp occurs among the gentlemen of the royal chapel under edward the sixth and queen mary he was also one of the singingmen of saint georges chapel at windsor and fox says he was so notable a singingman wherein he gloried that wheresoever he came the longest song with most counterverses in it should be set up against him fox adds that while he was singing on one side of the choir of windsor chapel o redemptrix et salvatrix he was answered by one testwood a singer on the other side non redemptrix nec salvatrix for this irreverence and a few other slight heresies testwood was burnt at windsor acts and monum vol ii p         i must add that sir thomas phelyppis or philips is mentioned as a musician before the reformation hawkis hist mus ii      another on the death of a countess of pembroke who is celebrated for her learning and her perfect virtues linked in a chain fol     probably anne who was buried

henrys wars we have here an elegy fol     with some verses on his picture fol     here is also a poem on a treasonable conspiracy which is compared to the stratagem of sinon and which threatened immediate extermination to the british constitution but was speedily discovered fol        i have not the courage to explore the formidable columns of the circumstantial hollingshed for this occult piece of history which i leave to the curiosity and conjectures of some more laborious investigator it is certain that none of these pieces are later than the year      as they were published in that year by richard tottell the printer we may venture to say that almost all of them were written between the years    0 and    0 there is an epitaph by w g made on himself with an answer ol       i cannot explain those initials at fol     a lady called arundel is highly celebrated for her incomparable beauty and accomplishments perhaps of lord arundels family  thus aundl sits throned still with fam etc    most of them perhaps within the first part of that period  the following nameless stanzas have that elegance which results from simplicity the compliments are such as would not disgrace the gallantry or the poetry of a polished age the thoughts support themselves without the aid of expression and the affectations of language this is a negligence but it is a negligence produced by art here is an effect obtained which it would be vain to seek from the studied ornaments of style  give place ye ladies and be gone boast not yourselves at all for here at hand approaches one whose face will stain you all the virtue of her lively lokes excels the precious stone i wish to have none other books to read or look upon in each of her two crisall eyes smileth a naked boy it would you all in

nor gasing in an open street nor gadding as astray the modest mirth that she does use is mixed with shamefatnesse al vice she does wholly refuse and hates idleness o lord it is a world to see how virtue can repair and deck in her such honesty whom nature made so fair  how might i do to get a graffe of this unspotted tree for all the rest are plain but chaffe which seem good corn to be fol      of the same sort is the following stanza on beauty  then beauty stepped before the bar whose breast and neck was bare with hair trust up and on her head a caul of gold she ware fol     we are to recollect that these compliments were penned at a time when the graces of conversation between the sexes were unknown and the dialogue of courtship was indelicate when the monarch of england in a style which the meanest gentleman would now be ashamed to use pleaded the warmth of his affection by drawing a coarse allusion from a present of venison which he calls flesh in a loveletter to his future queen anne boleyn a lady of distinguished breeding beauty and modesty see hearnes avesbury append p       in lord vauxs assault of cupide abovementioned these are the most remarkable stanzas  when cupide scaled first the fort wherein my heart lay wounded sore the batry was of such a sort that i must yield or die therefore there saw i love upon the wall how he his baner did display alarm alarm he began to call and bade his soldiers keep away the arms the which that cupid bare were pierced hearts with tears besprent  and even with the trumpettes sown the scaling ladders were up set and beauty walked up and down with bow in hand and arrows whet then first desire began to scale and shrouded him under his targe etc fol        puttenham speaks more highly of the contrivance of the allegory of this piece than i can allow in this figure counterfait action the lord nicholas for thomas vaux a noble gentleman and much delighted in vulgar making english poetry  and a man otherwie of no great learning but having herein a marvelous facility made a dittie representing the battle and assault of cupid so excellently well as for the gallant and propre aplication of his fiction in every part i cannot choose but set down the greatest part of his ditty for in truth it cannot be amended when cupid scaled etc page  00  and in another part of the ame book the lord vaux his commendation lies chiefly in the facility of his meetre and the aptness of his descriptions such as he takes upon him to make namely in sundry of his songs wherein he shows the counterfeit action very lively and pleasantly page     by counterfeit action the critic means fictitious action the action of imaginary beings expressive of fact and reality there is more poetry in some of the old pageants described by hollingshed than in this allegory of cupid vaux seems to have had his eye on sir david lyndseys golden terge see supr vol ii p   0   in the following little ode much pretty description and imagination is built on the circumstance of a lady being named bays so much good poetry could hardly be expected from a pun  in bays i boast whose branch i bear such joye therein i find that to the death i shall it wear to ease my careful mind in heat in cold both night and day her virtue may be seen when other fruits and flowers decay the bay yet grows full green her berries feed the birds full often her leaves sweet water make her bows be set in every loft for their sweet savours sake the birds do shroud them from the cold in her we daily see and men make arbers as they would under the pleasant tree fol  0    from the same collection the following is perhaps the first example in our language now remaining of the pure and unmixed pastoral and in the erotic species for ease of numbers elegance of rural allusion and simplicity of imagery excels every thing of the kind in spenser who is erroneously ranked as our earliest english bucolic i therefore hope to be pardoned for the length of the quotation  phyllida was a fair maid as fresh as any flour whom harpalus the herdman prayde to be her paramour harpalus and eke corin were herdmen both yfere together  and phyllida could twist and spin and thereto sing full clear but phyllida was all to coy for harpalus to win for corin was her only joy who forced her not a pin loved her not in the least  how often would she flowers twine how often

clothes were black and also bare as one forlorn was he upon his head always he ware a wreath of wyllow tree his beasts he kept upon the hill and he sat in the dale and thus with sighs and sorrows shryll he began to tell his tale o harpalus thus would he say unhappiest under sun the cause of thine unhappy day by love was first begun for thou wentst first by suit to seek a tigre to make tame that settes not by thy love a leeke but makes thy grief her game as easy it were to convert the frost into the flame as for to turn a froward heart whom thou so feign would frame corin he lives

phyllida so fair for i may say that i have bought thy beauty all too dear etc ol     the illustrations in the two following stanzas of the restlessness of a lovers mind deserve to be cited for their simple beauty and native force of expression  the owl with feeble sight lies lurking in the leaves the sparrow in the frosty night may shroud her in the eaves but woe to me alace in sun nor yet in shade i cannot find a resting place my burden to unlade fol     nor can i omit to notice the sentimental and expressive metaphor contained in a single line  walking the path of pensive thought fol     perhaps there is more pathos and feeling in the ode in which the lover in despair lamenteth his case than in any other piece of the whole collection  adieu desert how art thou spent ah dropping tears how do ye waste ah scalding sighs how ye be spent to prick them forth that will not haste ah pained heart thou gapst for grace favor  even there where pity has no place as easy it is the stony rock from place to place for to remove as by thy plaint for to provoke a frosen heart from hate to love what should i say such is thy lot to fawn on them that force love thee not thus may thou safely say

will not grow alas poor heart thus have thou spent thy flowring time thy pleasant years with sighing voice weep and lament for of thy hope no fruit apperes thy true meaning is paid with scorn that ever sows and repeth no corn and where thou sekes a quiet port thou do but weigh against the wind for where thou gladdest woldst resort there is no place for thee assinde assigned  thy destiny has set it so that thy true heart should cause thy woe fol  0   these reflections resulting from a retrospect of the vigorous and active part of life destined for nobler pursuits and unworthily wasted in the tedious and fruitless anxieties of unsuccessful love are highly natural and are painted from the heart but their force is weakened by the poets allusions  tis miscellany affords the first pointed english epigram that i remember and which deserves to be admitted into the modern collections of that popular species of poetry sir thomas more was one of the best jokers of that age and there is some probability that this might have fallen from his pen it is on a scholar who was pursuing his studies successfully but in the midst of his literary career married unfortunately  a student at his book so plast so pursuing his studies plast so spelled for the rhyme is placed  that wealth he might have won from book to wife did flete in have from wealth to woe to run now who has played a feater cast since juggling first begone in knitting of himself so fast himself he has undonne fol     but the humor does not arise from the circumstances of the character it is a general joke on an unhappy match  these two lines are said to have been written by mary queen of scots with a diamond on a window in fotheringay castle during her imprisonment there and to have been of her composition from the top of all my trust mishap has thrown me in the dust see ballards learn lad p      but they belong to an elegant little ode of ten stanzas in the collection before us in which a lover complains that he is caught by the snare which he once defied fol     the unfortunate queen only quoted a distich applicable to her situation which she remembered in a fashionable set of poems perhaps the amusement of her youth  the ode which is the comparison of the authors faithful and painful passion with that of troilus fol     is founded on chaucers poem or boccaces on the same subject this was the most favorite lovestory of our old poetry and from its popularity was wrought into a drama by shakespeare troiluss sufferings for cressida were a common topic for a lovers fidelity and assiduity shakespeare in his merchant of venice compares a night favorable to the stratagems or the meditation of a lover to such a night as troilus might have chosen for stealing a view of the grecian camp from the ramparts of troy  and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night act v sc i   among these poems is a short fragment of a translation into alexandrines of ovids epistle from penelope to ulysses fol     this is the first attempt at a metrical translation of any part of ovid into english for caxtons ovid is a loose paraphrase in prose nor were the heroic epistles of ovid translated into verse till the year      by george tuberville it is a proof that the classics were studied when they began to be translated  it would be tedious and intricate to trace the particular imitations of the italian poets with which these anonymous poems abound two of the sonnets fol    are panegyrics on petrarch and laura names at that time familiar to every polite reader and the patterns of poetry and beauty the sonnet on the diverse and contrary passions of the lover fol  0   is formed on one of petrarchs sonnets and which as i have remarked before was translated by sir thomas wyat supr p     so many of the nobility and principal persons about the court writing sonnets in the italian style is a circumstance which must have greatly contributed to circulate this mode of composition and to encourage the study of the italian poets beside lord surrey sir thomas wyat lord boleyn lord vaux and sir francis bryan already mentioned edund lord sheffield created a baron by king edward the sixth and killed by a butcher in the norfolk insurrection is said by bale to have written sonnets in the italian manner see tanner bibl p     dugd bar iii       i have been informed that henry lord berners translated some of petrarchs sonnets mss oldys  but this nobleman otherwise deserved notice here for his prose works which cooperated with the romantic genius and the gallantry of the age he translated and by the kings command froissarts chronicle which was printed by pinson in      some of his other translations are professed romances he translated from the spanish by desire of the lady of sir nicholas carew the castle of love from the french he translated at the request of the earl of huntingdon sir hugh of bourdeaux which became exceedingly popular and from the same language the history of arthur an armorican knight bale says cent ix p  0   that he wrote a comedy called ite in vineam or the parable of the vineyard which was frequently acted at calais where lord berners resided after vespers ath oxon i    it is not known whether it was in latin or english stowe says that in      at greenwich after a grand tournament and banquet there was the most goodliest disguising or interlude in latin etc chron p     edit fol      but possibly this may be stowes way of naming and describing a comedy of plautus see supr vol ii      he died in       i have also been told that the late lord eglintoun had a genuine book of manuscript sonnets written by king henry the eighth there is an old madrigal set to music by william bird supposed to be written by henry when he first fell in love with anne boleyn i must not forget that a song is ascribed to anne boleyn but with little probability called her complaint see hawkins hist mus iii    v   0  it begins  the eagles force

his taste or his interest polemical divinity seems to have been his favorite science he was a patron of learned men when they humoured his vanities and were wise enough not to interrupt his pleasures his convenience or his ambition  sect xxii to these songs and sonnettes of uncertain auctours in tottells edition are annexed songs written by n g they begin with fol     by the initials n g we are to understand nicholas grimoald a name which never appeared yet in the poetical biography of england but i have before mentioned him incidentally see vol ii      he was a native of huntingdonshire and received the first part of his academical institution at christs college in cambridge removing to oxford in the year      he was elected fellow of merton college but about      having opened a rhetorical lecture in the refectory of christchurch then newly founded he was transplanted to that society which gave the greatest encouragement to such students as were distinguished for their proficiency in criticism and philology the same year he wrote a latin tragedy which probably was acted in the college entitled archipropheta ive johannes baptista tragaedia that is the archprophet or saint john baptist a tragedy and dedicated to the dean richard cox printed colon       vo see supr vol ii      in the year      ii edw vi  he explained all the four books of virgils georgics in a regular prose latin paraphrase in the public hall of his college printed at london in       vo  he wrote also explanatory commentaries or lectures on the andria of terence the epistles of horace and many pieces of cicero perhaps for the same auditory he translated tullys offices into english this translation which is dedicated to the learned thirlby bishop of ely was printed at london      in octavo again             he also familiarised some of the purest greek classics by english versions which i believe were never printed among others was the cyropaedia bale the biographer and bishop of ossory says that he turned chaucers troilus into a play but whether this piece was in latin or english we are still to seek and the word comedia which bale uses on this occasion is without precision or distinction the same may be said of what bale calls his fame a comedy bale also recites his system of rhetoric for the use of englishmen rhetorica in usum britannorum  which seems to be the course of the rhetorical lectures i have mentioned it is to be wished that bale who appears to have been his friend bale cites his comment or paraphrase on the first eclogue of virgil addressed ad amicum joannem balum viii     and therefore possessed the opportunities of information had given us a more exact and full detail at least of such of grimoalds works as are now lost or if remaining are unprinted titles of many others of his pieces may be seen in bale ubi supr  undoubtedly this is the same person called by strype one grimbold who was chaplain to bishop ridley and who was employed by that prelate while in prison to translate into english laurentio vallas book against the fiction of constantines donation with some other popular latin pieces against the papists see strypes cranmer b iii c    p     and grindal   fox edit i  0   and wood ath oxon i      in the ecclesiastical history of marys reign he appears to have been imprisoned for heresy and to have saved his life if not his credit by a recantation but theology does not seem to have been his talent nor the glories of martyrdom to have made any part of his ambition one of his plans but which never took effect was to print a new edition of josephus iscanuss poem on the trojan war with emendations from the most correct manuscripts bale ubi supr   i have taken more pains to introduce this nicholas grimoald to the readers acquaintance because he is the second english poet after lord surrey who wrote in blankverse nor is it his only praise that he was the first who followed in this new path of versification to the style of blankverse exhibited by surrey he added new strength elegance and modulation in the disposition and conduct of his cadencies he often approaches to the legitimate structure of the improved blankverse but we cannot suppose that he is entirely free from those dissonancies and asprities which still adhered to the general character and state of our diction  in his poem on the death of marcus tullius cicero are these lines the assassins of cicero are said to relent   when they his bare neck beheld and his hoar hears scant could they hold the tears that forth began burst and almost fell from bloody hands the swoordes only the stern herennius with grym look dastardes why stand ye still he says and straight swapt off the head with his presumptuous yrone ne with the slaughter yet

disclosde fled with her fleeing friend fol      and out alas has left the earth ne will no more return nor is this passage unsupported by a warmth of imagination and the spirit of pathetic poetry the general cast of the whole poem shows that our author was not ill qualified for dramatic composition  another of grimoalds blankverse poems is on the death of zoroas an egyptian astronomer who was killed in alexanders first battle with the persians it is opened with this nervous and animated exordium  now clattering arms now ragyng broyls of war began pass the noyes of dreadful trompets clang

a classical and elegant description of whose skill in natural science forms a pleasing contrast amidst images of death and destruction and is inserted with great propriety as it is necessary to introduce the history of his catastrophe  shaking her bloody hands bellone among the perses sowth all kind of cruel death  him smites the club him wounds farstrikyng bow and him the slyng and him the

only transiently mentioned will be more fully considered hereafter in its proper place we will now return to our author grimoald  grimoald as a writer of verses in rhyme yields to none of his cotemporaries for a masterly choice of chaste expression and the concise elegancies of didactic versification some of the couplets in his poem in praise of moderation have all the smartness which marks the modern style of sententious poetry and would have done honor to popes ethic epistles  the ancient time commended not for naught the mean what better thing can there be sought in mean is

of english literature for having collected at a critical period and preserved in a printed volume so many admirable specimens of ancient genius which would have mouldered in manuscript or perhaps from their detached and fugitive state of existence their want of length the capriciousness of taste the general depredations of time inattention and other accidents would never have reached the present

sect xxiii it will not be supposed that all the poets of the reign of henry the eighth were educated in the school of petrarch the graces of the italian muse which had been taught by surrey and wyat were confined to a few nor were the beauties of the classics yet become general objects of imitation there are many writers of this period who still rhymed on in the old prosaic track of their immediate predecessors and never ventured to deviate into the modern improvements the strain of romantic fiction was lost in the place of which they did not substitute the elegancies newly introduced  i shall consider together yet without an exact observation of chronological order the poets of the reign of henry the eighth who form this subordinate class and who do not bear any mark of the character of the poetry which distinguishes this period yet some of these have their degree of merit and if they had not necessarily claimed a place in our series deserve examination  andrew board who

censured by poynet a calvinistic bishop of winchester for keeping three prostitutes in his house which he proved to be his patients see against martn etc p     he appears to have been a man of great superstition and of a weak and whimsical head and having been once a carthusian continued ever afterward to profess celibacy to drink water and to wear a shirt of hair his thirst of knowledge dislike of the reformation or rather his unsettled disposition led him abroad into various parts of europe which he visited in the medical character wood says that he was esteemed a noted poet a witty and ingenious person and an excellent physician hearne who has plainly discovered the origin of tom thumb is of opinion that this facetious practitioner in physic gave rise to the name of merry andrew the fool on the mountebanks stage the reader will not perhaps be displeased to see that antiquarys reasons for this conjecture which are at the same time a vindication of bordes character afford some new anecdotes of his life and show that a merry andrew may be a scholar and an ingenious man it is observable that the author borde was as fond of the word dolentyd as of many other hard and uncooth words as any quack can be he begins his breviary of health egregious doctors and masters of the eximious and archane science of physic of your urbanite exasperate not your selve etc but notwithstanding this will any one from hence infer or assert that the author was either a pedant or a superficial scholar i think upon due consideration he will judge the contrary dr board was an ingenious man and knew how to humor and please his patients readers and auditors in his travells and visits he often appeared and spoke in public and would often frequent markets and fairs where a conflux of people used to get together to whom he prescribed and to induce them to flock thither the more readily he would make humorous speeches couched in such language as caused mirth and wonderfully propagated his fame and twas for the same end that he made use of such expressions in his books as would otherwise the circumstances not considered be very justly pronounced bombast as he was versed in antiquity he had words at command from old writers with which to amuse his hearers which could not fail of pleasing provided he added at the same time some remarkable explication for instance if he told them that  was an old brass medal among the greeks the oddness of the word would without doubt gain attention tho nothing near so much as if withal he signified that twas a brass medal a little bigger than an obolus that used to be put in the mouths of persons that were dead  and withal twould affect them the more if when he spoke of such a brass medal he signified to them that brass was in old time looked upon as more honorable than other metals which he might safely enough do from homer and his scholiast homers words are etc a passage which without doubt hieronymus magius would have taken notice of in the fourteenth chapter of his book de tintinnabulis had it occurred to his memory when in prison he was writing without the help of books before him that curious discourse twas from the doctors method of using such speeches at markets and fairs that in aftertimes those that imitated the like humorous jocose language were styled merry andrews a term much in vogue on our stages hearnes benedict abb tom

its neighborhood now grown obsolete and that blount might have enriched his book on ancient tenures with these ludicrous stories he is speaking of the political design of reynard the fox printed by caxto it was an admirable thing and the design being political and to represent a wise government was equally good so little reason is there to look upon this as a poor despicable book nor is there more reason to esteem the merry tales of the mad men of gotham which was much valued and cried up in henry the eighths time tho now sold at balladsingers stalls as altogether a romance a certain skillfull person having told me more than once that he was assured by one of gotham that they formerly held lands there by such sports and customs as are touched upon in this book for which reason i think particular notice should have been taken of it in blounts tenures as i do not doubt but there would had that otherwise curious author been apprised of the matter but it is strange to see the

of the authors age without a respect to the national character and as board was a rigid catholic there is a probability notwithstanding in other places he treats o natural dispositions that a satire

this he says was only to make your grace merry and because mirth has ever been esteemed the best medicine board must have had no small share of vanity who could think thus highly of his own pleasantry

he considered as monks are entitled the mass of the gluttons and the alcoran of the prelates ibid  next to exposing the impostures of popery literary history was his favorite pursuit and his most celebrated performance is his account of the british writers but this work perhaps originally undertaken by bale as a vehicle of his sentiments in religion is not only full of misrepresentations and partialities arising from his religious prejudices but of general inaccuracies proceeding from negligence or misinformation even those more ancient lives which he transcribes from lelands commentary on the same subject are often interpolated with false facts and impertinently marked with a misapplied zeal for reformation he is angry with many authors who flourished before the thirteenth century

her presence and to have had the honor to be constantly admitted into her privychamber for this purpose wood ath oxon i   0   notwithstanding his professional dissipation heywood appears to have lived

and the language of ribaldry but perfection must not be expected before its time he is called our first writer of comedies but those who say this speak without determinate ideas and confound comedies

quarto others followed                         to  all the proverbs of the english language are here interwoven into a very silly comic tale  the lady of the story an old widow now going to be married again is thus described with some degree of drollery on the bridal day  in this late old widow and than old new wife age and appetite fell at a strong strife her lust was as young as her lims were old the day of her wedding like one to be sold she set out herself in fine apparel she was made like a beerepott or a barell a crooked hooked nose beetle browde blere eyde many men wished for beautifying

curiosity as a repertory of proverbs made at so early a period nor was the plan totally void of ingenuity to exhibit these maxims in the course of a narrative enlivened by facts and circumstances it certainly was susceptible of humor and invention  heywoods largest and most labored performance is the spider and the fly with wooden cuts printed at london by thomas powell in      in quarto  it is a very long poem in the octave stanza containing ninetyeight chapters perhaps there never was so dull so tedious and trifling an apologue without fancy meaning or moral a long tale of fictitious manners will always be tiresome unless the design be burlesque and then the ridiculous arising from the contrast between the solemn and the light must be ingeniously supported our author seems to have intended a fable on the burlesque construction but we know not when he would be serious and when witty whether he means to make the reader laugh or to give him advice we must indeed acknowledge that the age was not yet sufficiently refined either to relish or to produe burlesque poetry but i must not forget chaucers sir thopas and that among the cotton manuscripts there is a anonymous poem perhaps coeval with chaucer in the style of allegorical burlesque which describes the power of money with great humor and in no common vein of satire the hero of the piece is sir penny mss cott call

scottish poems p     edinb    0 see supr vol i    harrison the author of the description of britain prefixed to hollinsheds chronicle has left a sensible criticism on this poem one has made a book of the spider and fly wherein he deals so profoundly and beyond all measure of skill that neither he himself that made it neither any one that reads it can reach unto the meaning thereof descript brit p     hollinsh chron tom i  it is a proof of the unpopularity of this poem that it never was reprinted our authors epigrams and the poem of proverbs were in high vogue and had numerous editions within the year      the most lively part of the spider and fly is perhaps the mockfight between the spiders and flies an awkward imitation of homers batrachomuomachy the preparations for this bloody and eventful engagement on the part of the spiders in their cobwebcastle are thus described  behold the battilments in every loope how the ordinance lies flies far and nere to fac behold how every peace that lies there in groope in rows  has a spider gonner with redyfred match behold on the walls spiders making ware wach the wachspider in the tower a larum to strike at aproch of any number showing

confusion is owing to a fly entering the poets window not through a broken pane as might be presumed but through the lattice where it is suddenly entangled in a cobweb cap i  the cobweb however will be allowed to be sufficiently descriptive of the poets apartment but i mention this circumstance as a probable proof that windows of lattice and not of glass were now the common fashion see his

exile for the sake of religion  sect xxv i know not if sir thomas more may properly be considered as an english poet he has however left a few obsolete poems which although without any striking merit yet as productions of the restorer of literature in england seem to claim some notice here one of these is a merry jest how a sergeant would learn to play the freere written by master thomas more in his youth workers land      in folio sign c i  the story is too dull and too long to be told here but i will cite two or three of the prefatory stanzas  he that has lafte left the hosiers craft and

thrifty man with bate debate and strife but by my life i cannot tell you when when an htter will smatter in philosophy or a pedlar wax a medlar in theology in these lines which are intended to illustrate by familiar examples the absurdity of a sergeant at law assuming the business of a friar perhaps the reader perceives but little of that festivity which is supposed to have marked the character and the conversation of sir thomas more the last two stanzas deserve to be transcribed as they prove that this tale was designed to be sung to music by a minstrel for the entertainment of company  now masters all here now i shall end then as i began in any wise i would avyse and counsel every man his own crate use all new refuse and lightly let them gone play not the freere now make good cheer this piece is mentioned among other popular storybooks in      by laneham in his entertainment at killingworth castle in the reign of queen elisabeth fol    seq   in certain meters written also in his youth as a prologue for his book of fortune and forming a poem of considerable length are these stanzas which are an attempt at personification and imagery fortune is represented sitting

of henry the eighth who died in childbed in   0  it is evidently formed on the tragical soliloquies which compose lydgates paraphrase of boccaces book de casibus virorum illustrium and which gave birth to the mirror of magistrates the origin of our historic dramas these stanzas are part of the queens complaint at the approach of death  where are our castles now where are our towers goodly

works ut supr  in the fourth stanza she reproaches the astrologers for their falsity in having predicted that this should be the happiest and most fortunate year of her whole life this while it is a natural reflection in the speaker is a proof of mores contempt of a futile and frivolous science then so much in esteem i have been prolix in my citation from this forgotten poem but i am of opinion that some of the stanzas have strokes of nature and pathos and deserved to be rescued from total oblivion  more when a young man contrived in an apartment of his fathers house a goodly hangyng of fine painted clothe exhibiting nine pageants or allegoric representations of the stages of mans life together with the figures of death fame time and eternity under each picture he wrote a stanza the first is under childhoode expressed by a boy whipping a top  i am called childhod in play is all my mind to cast a coyte a quoit  a cokstele a stick for throwing at a cock stele is handl sax  or a ball a

hawke to nourishe up and feed the grayhounde to the course the hawke to the flight and to bestryde a good and lusty stead these things become a very man in deed yet thinks this boy his pevishe game sweter but what no force his reason is no better the personification of fame like rumor in the chorus to shakespeares henry the fifth is surrounded with tongues ibid sign c iii   tapestry with metrical legends illustrating the subject was common in this age and the public pageants in the streets were often exhibited with explanatory verses i am of opinion that the comoediolae or little interludes which more is said to have written and acted in his fathers house were only these nine pageants see supr vol ii p       another juvenile exercise of more in the english stanza is annexed to his prose translation of the life of john picus mirandula and entitled twelve rules of john picus mirandula partly exciting partly directing a man in spiritual bataile these pieces were written in the reign of henry the seventh but as more flourished in the succeeding reign i have placed them accordingly  the old collector of his english works has also preserved two short ballettes ibid b iii  or stanzas which he wrote for his pastyme while a prisoner in the tower ut supr fol        it is not my design by these specimens to add to the ame of sir thomas more who is reverenced by posterity as the scholar who taught that erudition which civilized his country and as the philosopher who met the horrors of the block with that fortitude which was equally free from ostentation and enthusiasm as the man whose genius overthrew the fabric of false learning and whose amiable tranquillity of temper triumphed over the malice and injustice of tyranny  to some part of the reign of henry the eighth i assign the tournament of tottenham or the wooeing winning and wedding of tibbe the reeves daugter there i presume it will not be supposed to be later than that reign and the substance of its phraseology which i divest of its obvious innovations is not altogether obsolete enough for a highe period i am aware that in a manuscript of the british museum it is referred to the time of henry the sixth but that manuscript affords no positive indication of that date mss harl       it was published from an ancient manuscript in the year      and reduced to a more modern style by william bedwell rector of tottenham and one of the translators of the bible he says it was written by gilbert pilkington supposed to have been rector of the same parish and author of an unknown tract called passio domini jesu but bedwell without the least comprehension of the scope and spirit of the piece imagines it to be a serious narrative of a real event and with as little sagacity believes it to have been written before the year    0 allowing that it might originate from a real event and that there might be some private and local abuse at the bottom it is impossible that the poet could be serious undoubtedly the chief merit of this poem although not destitute of humor consists in the design rather than the execution as chaucer in the rhyme of sir thopas i take this opportunity of observing that the stanza of one of laurence minots poems on the wars of edward the third is the same as chaucers sir topas minot was chaucers cotempary mss cott gal e ix edward our cumly king in braband has

the romances of chivalry the tournament of tottenham is a burlesque on the parade and opperies of chivalry itself in this light it may be considered as a curiosity and does honor to the good sense and discernment of the writer who seeing through the olly of these fashionable exercises was sensible at the same time that they were too popular to be attacked by the more solid weapons of reason and argument even on a supposition that here is an allusion to real facts and characters and that it was intended to expose some popular story of the amors of the daughter of the reve of tottenham we must acknowledge that the satire is conveyed in an ingenious mode he has introduced a parcel of clowns and rustics the inhabitants of tottenham islington highgate and hackney places then not quite so polished as at present who imitate all the solemnities of the barriers the whole is a mockparody on the challenge the various events of the encounter the exhibition of the prize the devices and escocheons the display of arms the triumphant procession of the conqueror the oath before the combat and the splendid feast which followed with every other ceremony and circumstance which constituted the regular tournament the reader will form an idea of the work from a short extract v      he that bearth him best in the tournament shall be granted the gree prize by the common assent for to win my

manusript do not seem to be all precisely of the same hand and might probably once have been separate papers here stitched together at the end of one of them viz fol    the lysom ledys the blind mention is inserted of an account settled ann    hn vi and this is in the hand and ink of that poem and of some others the tournament of tottnam which might once have been detached from the present collection comes at some distance afterward and cannot perhaps for a certainty be pronounced to be of the same writing i take this opportunity of correcting a wrong reference to sir pni just cited at p    it belongs to gal e   mss cott    it appears to me that the author to give dignity to his narrative and to heighten the ridicule by stiffening the familiarity of his incidents and characters has affected an antiquity of style this i could prove from the cast of its fundamental diction and idiom with which many of the old words do not agree perhaps another of the authors affectations is the alliterative manner for although other specimens of alliteration in smaller pieces are now to be found yet it was a singularity to those which i have mentioned of this reign i take this opportunity of adding an alliterative poem which may be called the falcon and the pie who support a dyalogue desensyve for women against malicyous detractours printed in      coloph thus ends the faucon and pie anno

chestre translated from a more modern french copy of launval heightened and improved from the old simple armorican tale of which i have here produced a short extract see supr vol ii p  0  the same

henry the sixth and very probably by thomas chestre the translator of launval    sect xxvi i fear i shall be pronounced a heretic to modern criticism in retracting what i have said in a preceding page and in placing the notbrowne maid under some part of this reign prior who about the year      paraphrased this poem without improving its native beauties supposes it to have been three hundred years old it appears from two letters preserved in the british museum written by prior to wanley lord oxfords librarian that prior consulted wanley about this ancient ballad mss harl       it is however certain that wanley an antiquarian of unquestionable skill and judgment in these niceties whatever directions and information he might have imparted to prior on this subject could never have communicated such a decision he certainly in these letters gives no such opinion these letters are printed in the additions to popes works in two volumes published about two years ago  this is therefore the hasty conjecture of prior who thought that the curiosity which he was presenting to the world would derive proportionable value from its antiquity who was better employed than in the petty labor of ascertaining dates and who knew much more of modern than ancient poetry  the notbrowne maid first appeared in arnoldes chronicle or customs of london which was first printed about the year      this is perhaps the most heterogeneous and multifarious miscellany that ever existed the collector sets out with a catalogue of the mayors and sheriffs the customs and charters of the city of london soon afterward we have receipts to pickle sturgeon to make vinegar ink and gunpowder how to raise parsley in an hour the arts of brewery and soapmaking an estimate of the livings in london an account of the last visitation of saint magnuss church the weight of essex cheese and a letter to cardinal wolsey the notbrowne maid is introduced between an estimate of some subsidies paid into the exchequer and directions for buying goods in flanders in a word it seems to have been this compilers plan by way of making up a volume to print together all the notices and papers whether ancient or modern which he could amass of every sort and subject it is supposed that he intended an antiquarian repertory but as many recent materials were admitted that idea was not at least uniformly observed nor can any argument be drawn from that supposition that this poem existed long before and was inserted as a piece of antiquity  the editor of the prolusions infers prolusions or select pieces of ancient poetry land    0  to pref p vii  from an identity of rhythmus and orthography and an affinity of words and phrases that this poem appeared after sir thomas mores jest of the sergeant and freer which as i have observed was written about the year   00 this reasoning were not other arguments obvious would be inconclusive and might be turned to the opposite side of the question but it is evident from the language of the notbrowne maid that it was not written earlier than the beginning at least of the sixteenth century there is hardly an obsolete word or that requires a glossary in the whole piece and many parts of surry and wyat are much more difficult to be understood reduce any two stanzas to modern orthography and they shall hardly wear the appearance of ancient poetry the reader shall try the experiment on the two following which occur accidentally v       he yet take good head for ever i dread that ye could not sustain the thornie ways the deep valeis the snow the

simplicity of which passage prior has thus decorated and dilated  henry those limbs in lawn and softest silk arrayed from sunbeams guarded and of winds afraid can they bear angry jove can they resist the parching dog star and the bleak northeast when chilled by adverse snows and beating rain we tread with weary steps the longsome plain when with hard toil we seek our evening food berries and acorns from the neighboring wood and find among the cliffs no other house but the thin covert of some gathered boughs will thou not then reluctant send thine eye around the dreary waste and weeping try though then alas that trial be too late to find thy fathers hospitable gate and seats where ease and plenty brooding sat those seats whence long excluded thou must mourn that gate for ever barred

purpose to embark with thee on the smooth surface of a summers sea while gentle zephyrs play in prosperous gales and fortunes favor fills the swelling sails but would forsake the ship and make the shore when the winds whistle and the tempests roar no henry no one sacred oath has tied our loves one destiny our life shall guide nor wild nor deep our common way divide when from the cave thou risest with the day to beat the woods and rouse the bounding prey the cave with moss and branches i will adorn and cheerful sit to wait my lords return and when thou frequent bringst the smitten deer for seldom archers say thy arrows err i will fetch quick fuel from the neighbouriug wood and strike the sparklng flint and dress the food with humble duty and officious haste i will cull the farthest mead for thy repast the choicest herbs i to thy board will bring and draw thy water from the freshest spring and when at night with weary toil oppressed soft slumbers thou enjoyst and wholesome rest watchful i will guard thee and with midnight prayer weary the gods to keep thee in their care and joyous ask at morns returning ray if thou have health and i may bless the day my thoughts shall fix my latest wish depend on thee guide guardian kinsman father friend by all these sacred names be henry known to emmas heart and grateful let him own that she of all mankind could love but him alone  what degree of credit this poem maintained among our earlier ancestors i cannot determine i suspect the sentiment was too refined for the general taste yet it is enumerated among the popular tales and ballads by laneham in his narrative of queen elisabeths entertainment at kenilworthcastle in      ol     i have never seen it in manuscript i believe it was never reprinted from arnoldes chronicle where it first appeared in      till so late as the year   0  it was that year revived in a collection called the monthly miscellany or memors for the curious and prefaced with a little essay on our ancient poets and poetry in which it is said to have been three hundred old fortunately for modern poetry this republication suggested it to the notice of prior who perhaps from the same source might have adopted or confirmed his hypothesis that it was coeval with the commencement of the fifteenth century  whoever was the original inventor of this little dramatic dialogue he has shown no common skill in contriving a plan which powerfully detains our attention and interests the passions by a constant succession of suspense and pleasure of anxiety and satisfaction betwixt hopes perpetually disappointed and solicitude perpetually relieved we know not how to determine the event of a debate in which new difficulties still continue to be raised and are almost as soon removed in the midst of this vicissitude of feelings a striking contrast of character is artfully formed and uniformly supported between the seeming unkindness and ingratitude of the man and the unconquerable attachment and fidelity of the woman whose amiable compliance unexpectedly defeats every objection and continually furnishes new matter for our love and compassion at length our fears subside in the triumph of suffering innocence and patient sincerity the man whose hard speeches had given us so much pain suddenly surprises us with a change of sentiment and becomes equally an object of our admiration and esteem in the disentanglement of this distressful tale we are happy to find that all his cruelty was tenderness and his inconstancy the most invariable truth his levity an ingenious artifice and his perversity the friendly disguise of the firmest affection he is no longer an unfortunate exile the profligate companion of the thieves and ruffians of the forest but an opulent earl of westmoreland and promises that the lady who is a barons daughter and whose constancy he had proved by such a series of embarrassing proposals shall instantly be made the partner of his riches and honors nor should we forget to commend the invention of the poet in imagining the modes of trying the ladys patience and in feigning so many new situations which at the same time open a way to description and to a variety of new scenes and images  i cannot help observing here by the way that prior has misconceived and essentially marred his poets design by softening the sternness of the man which could not be intended to admit of any degree of relaxation henrys hypocrisy is not characteristically nor consistently sustained he frequently talks in too respectful and complaisant a style sometimes he calls emma my tender maid and my beauteous emma he fondly dwells on the ambrosial plenty of her flowing ringlets gracefully wreathed with variegated ribbands and expatiates with rapture on the charms of her snowy bosom her slender waist and harmony of shape in the ancient poem the concealed lover never abates his affectation of rigor and reserve nor ever drops an expression which may tend to betray any traces of tenderness he retains his severity to the last in order to give force to the conclusion of the piece and to heighten the effect of the final declaration of his love thus by diminishing the opposition of interests and by giving too great a degree of uniformity to both characters the distress is in some measure destroyed by prior for this reason henry during the course of the dialogue is less an object of our aversion and emma of our pity but these are the unavoidable consequences of priors plan who presupposes a long connection between the lovers which is attended with the warmest professions of a reciprocal passion yet this very plan suggested another reason why prior should have more closely copied the cast of his original after so many mutual promises and protestations to have made henry more obdurate would have enhanced the sufferings and the sincerity of the amiable emma  it is highly probable that the metrical romances of richard cuer de lion guy earl of warwick and sir bevys of southampton were modernised in this reign from more ancient and simple narrations the first was printed by wynkyn de word in      in quarto see supr vol i p   0 seq  the second without

censures  in the year    0 thomas lord cromwell during the short interval which henrys hasty passion for catharine howard permitted between his commitment and execution was insulted in a ballad

religious controversy in verse which is preserved in the archives of the antiquarian society  i find a poem of thirty octave stanzas printed in      called the dowfal of antichrists mas or mass in

describing general life will appear if we consider the freedom and facility with which it is executed it is not yet i think discovered on what original shakespeare formed this drama    the public pageantries of this reign are proofs of the growing familiarity and national diffusion of classical learning i will select an instance among others from the shows exhibited with great magnificence at the coronation of queen anne boleyn in the year      the procession to westminster abbey began from the tower and the queen in passing through gracechurch street was entertained with a representation of mount parnassus the fountain of helicon by a bold fiction unknown to the bards of antiquity ran in four streams of rhenish wine from a basin of white marble on the summit of the mountain sat apollo and at his feet calliope on either side of the declivity were arranged four of the muses playing on their respective musical instruments under them were written epigrams and poesies in golden letters in which every muse praised the queen according to her character and office at the conduit in cornhill appeared the three graces before whom with no great propriety was the spring of grace perpetually running wine but when a conduit came in the way a religious allusion was too tempting and obvious to be omitted before the spring however ate a poet describing in meter the properties or functions of every grace and then each of these four graces allotted in a short speech to the queen the virtue or accomplishment over which she severally presided at the conduit in cheapside as my chronicler says she was saluted with a rich pageaunt full of melody and song in this pageant were pallas juno and venus before them stood mercury who presented to her majesty in the name of the three goddesses a golden ball or globe divided into three parts signifying wisdom riches and felicity at entering saint pauls gate an ancient portal leading into the churchyard on the east and long since destroyed three ladies richly attired showered on her head wafers in which were contained latin distichs at the eastern side of saint pauls churchyard two hundred scholars of saint pauls school addressed her in chosen and apposite passages from the roman poets translated into english rhymes on the leads of saint martins church stood a choir of boys and men who sung not spiritual hymns but new balads in praise of her majesty on the conduit without ludgate where the arms and angels had been refreshed was erected a tower with four turrets within each of which was placed a cardinal virtue symbolically habited each of these personages in turn uttered an oration promising to protect and accompany the queen on all occasions halls chronicle fol ccxii among the orations spoken to the queen is one too curious to be omitted at leadenhall sat saint anne with her numerous progeny and mary cleophas with her four children one of the children made a goodly oration to the queen of the fruitfulnes of saint anne and of her generation trusting the like fruit should come of her  here we see the pagan history and mythology predominating in those spectacles which were once furnished from the golden legend instead of saints prophets apostles and confessors we have apollo mercury and the muses instead of religious canticles and texts of scripture which were usually introduced in the course of these ceremonies we are entertained with profane poetry translations from the classics and occasional verses with exhortations not delivered by personified doctors of the church but by the heathen divinities  it may not be foreign to our purpose to give the reader some distinct idea of the polite amusements of this reign among which the masque already mentioned in general terms seems to have held the first place it chiefly consisted of music dancing gaming a banquet and a display of grotesque personages and fantastic dresses the performers as i have hinted were often the king and the chief of the nobility of both sexes who under proper disguises executed some preconcerted strategem which ended in mirth and good humor with one of these shows in    0 the king formed a scheme to surprise cardinal wolsey while he was celebrating a splendid banquet at his palace of whitehall it thn belonged to wolsey  at night his majesty in a masque with twelve more masquers all richly but strangely dressed privately landed from westminster at whitehall stairs at landing several small pieces of canon were fired which the king had before ordered to be placed on the shore near the house the cardinal who was separately seated at the banquet in the presence chamber under the cloth of state a great number of ladies and lords being seated at the sidetables was alarmed at this sudden and unusual noise and immediately ordered lord sandys the kings chamberlain who was one of the guests and in the secret to enquire the reason lord sandys brought answer that thirteen foreign noblemen of distinction were just arrived and were then waiting in the great hall below having been drawn thither by the report of the cardinals magnificent banquet and of the beautiful ladies which were present at it the cardinal ordered them immediately into the banquettingroom to which they were conducted from the hall with twenty new torches and a concert of drums and fifes after a proper refreshment they requested in the french language to dance with the ladies whom they kissed and to play with them at mumchance a game of hazard with dic  producing at the same time a great golden cup filled with many hundred crowns having played for sometime with the ladies they deignedly lost all that remained in the cup to the cardinal whose sagacity was not easily to be deceived and who now began from some circumstances to suspect one of them to be the king on finding their plot in danger they answered if your grace can point him out he will readily discover himself the cardinal pointed to a masque with a black beard but he was mistaken for it was sir edward nevil at this the king could not forbear laughing aloud and pulling off his own and sir edward nevils masque convinced the cardinal with much arch complaisance that he had for once guessed wrong the king and the masquers then retired into another apartment to change their apparel and in the meantime the banquet was removed and the table covered afresh with perfumed clothes soon afterward the king with his company returned and took his seat under the cardinals canopy of state immediately two hundred dishes of the most costly cookery and confectionary were served up the contrivance and success of the royal joke afforded much pleasant conversation and the night was spent in dancing diceplaying banketting and other triumphs hollinsh chron iii     seq  the old chronicler edward hall a cotemporary and a curious observer acquaints us that at greenwich in      on the day of the epiphanie at night the king with eleven others was disguised after the manner of italy called a mask a thing not seen before in england they were apparalled in garments long and broad wrought all with gold with visors and caps of gold and after the banquet done these maskers came in with six gentlemen disguised in silk bearing staffetorches and desired the ladies to danse some were content and some refused and after they had dansed and communed together as the fashion of the mask is they took their leave and departed and so did the queen and all the ladies chron fol xv see supr vol i p       i do not find that it was a part of their diversion in these entertainments to display humor and character their chief aim seems to have been to surprise by the ridiculous and exaggerated oddity of the visors and by the singularity and splendour of the dresses every thing was out of nature and propriety frequently the masque was attended with an exhibition of some gorgeous machinery resembling the wonders of a modern pantomime for instance in the great hall of the palace the usual place of performance a vast mountain covered with tall trees arose suddenly from whose opening caverns issued hermits pilgrims shepherds knights damsels and gypsies who being regaled with spices and wine danced a morisco or morrisdance they were then again received into the mountain which with a symphony of rebecs and recorders closed its caverns and tumbling to pieces was replaced by a ship in full sail or a castle besieged to be more particular the following device was shown in the hall of the palace at greenwich a castle was reared with numerous towers gates and battlements and furnished with every military preparation for sustaining a long siege on the front was inscribed le fortress dangereux from the windows looked out six ladies clothed in the richest russet satin laid all over with leaves of gold and every one knit with laces of blew silk and gold on their heads cois and caps all of gold this castle was moved about the hall and when the queen had viewed it for a time the king entered the hall with five knights in embroidered vestments spangled and plated with gold of the most curious and costly workmanship they assaulted the castle and the six ladies finding them to be champions of redoubted prowess after a parley yielded their perilous fortress descended and danced with their assailants the ladies then led the knights into the castle which immediately vanished and the company retired hollinsh iii      here we see the representation of an action but all these magnificent mummeries which were their eveningamusements on festivals notwithstanding a parley which my historian calls a communication is here mentioned were yet in dumb show but at a most sumptuous disguising in      in the hall at greenwich the figure of fame is introduced who in french declared the meaning of the trees the rock and turneie but as this show was a political compliment and many foreigners present an explanation was necessary see hall chron fol lxvi this was in      but in the year   0  a more rational eveningamusement took place in the hall of the old westminsterpalace several foreign ambassadors being present after supper his grace the king with the queen lords and ladies came into the white hall which was hanged richly the hall was scaffolded and railed on all parts there was an interlude of the gentlemen of his chapel before his grace and diverse fresh songs hall chron fol xi xii see supr ii  0   and without dialogue  but toward the latter part of henrys reign much of the old cumbersome state began to be laid aside this i collect from a set of new regulations given to the royal household about the year      by cardinal wolsey in the chapter for keeping the hall and ordering of the chapel it is recited that by the frequent intermission and disuse of the solemnities of dining and supping in the great hall of the palace the proper officers had almost forgot their duty and the manner of conducting that very long and intricate ceremonial it is therefore ordered that when his majesty is not at westminster and with regard to his palaces in the country the formalities of the hall which ought not entirely to fall into desuetude shall be at least observed when he is at windsor beaulieu or newhall a new house built by henry the eighth hollinsh chron iii      in essex richmond hampton court greenwich eltham and woodstock and that at these places only the whole choir of the chapel shall attend this attempt to revive that which had began to cease from the nature of things and from the growth of new manners perhaps had but little or no lasting effect and with respect to the chapel my record adds that when the king is on journies or progresses only six singing boys and six gentlemen of the choir shall make a part of the royal retinue who daily in absence of the esidue of the chapel shall have a mass of our lady biore noon and on sondaies and holidaies mass of the day besides our ladymasse and an anthempne in the afternoon for which purpose no great carriage of either vestiments or books shall require ordenaunces made for the kings household and chambres bibl bodl mss laud k    fol it is the original on vellum in it sir thomas more is mentioned as chancellor of the duchy of lancaster  henry never seems to have been so truly happy as when he was engaged in one of these progresses in other words moving from one seat to another and enjoying his ease and amusements in a state of royal relaxation this we may collect from a curious passage in hollinshead who had pleased and perhaps informed us less had he never deserted the dignity of the historian from thence the whole court remooved to windsor then beginning his progress and exercising himself daily in shooting singing dansing wrestling casting of the bar plaieing at the recorders flute virginals in setting of songs and making of ballades  and when he came to oking woking in surrey near guildford a royal seat there were kept both justes turneies chron iii  0   i make no apology for these seeming digressions the manners and the poetry of a country are so nearly connected that they mutually throw light on each other  the same connection subsists between the state of poetry and of the arts to which we may now recall the readers attention with as little violation of our general subject  we are taught in the mythology of the ancients that the three graces were produced at a birth the meaning of the fable is that the three most beautiful imitative arts were born and grew up together our poetry now beginning to be divested of its monastic barbarism and to advance toward elegance was accompanied by proportionable improvements in painting and music henry employed many capital painters and endeavored to invite raphael and titian into england instead of allegorical tapestry many of the royal apartments were adorned with historical pictures our familiarity with the manners of italy and affectation of italian accomplishments influenced the tones and enriched the modulation of our musical composition those who could read the sonnets of petrarch must have relished the airs of palestrina at the same time architecture like miltons lion pawing to get free made frequent efforts to disentangle itself from the massy encumbrances of the gothic manner and began to catch the correct graces and to copy the true magnificence of the grecian and roman models henry was himself a great builder and his numerous edifices although constructed altogether on the ancient system are sometimes interspersed with chaste ornaments and graceful mouldings and often marked with a legitimacy of proportion and a purity of design before unattempted it was among the literary plans of leland one of the most classical scholars of this age to write an account of henrys palaces in imitation of procopius who is said to have described the palaces of the emperor justinian frequent symptoms appeared that perfection in every work of taste was at no great distance those clouds of ignorance which yet remained began now to be illuminated by the approach of the dawn of truth  sect xxvii the reformation of our church produced an alteration for a time in the general system of study and changed the character and subjects of our poetry every mind both learned and unlearned was busied in religious speculation and every pen was employed in recommending illustrating and familiarising the bible which was now laid open to the people  the poetical annals of king edward the sixth who removed those chains of bigottry which his brother henry had only loosened are marked with metrical translations of various parts of the sacred scripture of these the chief is the versification of the psalter by sternhold and hopkins a performance which has acquired an importance and consequently claims a place in our series not so much from any merit of its own as from the circumstances with which it is connected  it is extraordinary that the protestant churches should be indebted to a country in which the reformation had never begun to make any progress and even to the indulgence of a society which remains to this day the grand bulwark of the catholic theology for a very distinguishing and essential part of their ritual  about the year    0 clement marot a valet of the bedchamber to king francis the first was the favorite poet of france this writer having attained an unusual elegance and facility of style added many new embellishments to the rude state of the french poetry it is not the least of his praises that la fontaine used to call him his master he was the inventor of the rondeau and the restorer of the madrigal but he became chiefly eminent for his pastorals ballads fables elegies epigrams and translations from ovid and petrarch at length being tired of the vanities of profane poetry or rather privately tinctured with the principles of lutheranism he attempted with the assistance of his friend theodore beza and by the encouragement of the professor of hebrew in the university of paris a version of davids psalms into french rhymes this translation which did not aim at any innovation in the public worship and which received the sanction of the sorbonne as containing nothing contrary to sound doctrine he dedicated to his master francis the first and to the ladies of france in the dedication to the ladies or les dames de france whom he had often before addressed in the tenderest strains of passion or compliment he seems anxious to deprecate the raillery which the new tone of his versification was likely to incur and is embarrassed how to find an apology for turning saint conscious of his apostasy from the levities of life in a spirit of religious gallantry he declares that his design is to add to the happiness of his fair readers by substituting divine hymns in the place of chansons d amor to inspire their susceptible hearts with a passion in which there is no torment to banish that fickle and fantastic deity cupid from the world and to fill their apartments with the praises not of the little god but of the true jehovah  e voz doigts sur les espinettes pour dire saints chansonettes he adds that the golden age would now be restored when we should see the peasant at his plough the carman in the streets and the mechanic in his shop solacing their toils with psalms and canticles and the shepherd and sheperdess reposing in the shade and teaching the rocks to echo the name of the creator  le laboureur a sa charrue le charretier parmy le rue et lartisan a en sa boutique avecques un pseaume ou cantique en son labor se soulager heureux qui orra le berger et la begere au bois estans fair que rochers et

eclipsed the brilliancy of his madrigals and sonnets not suspecting how prejudicial the predominant rage of psalmsinging might prove to the ancient religion of europe the catholics themselves adopted these sacred songs as serious ballads and as a more rational species of domestic merriment thy were the common accompaniments of the fiddle they were sold so rapidly that the printers could not supply the public with copies in the festive and splendid court of francis the first of a sudden nothing was heard but the psalms of clement marot by each of the royal family and the principal nobility of the court a psalm was chosen and fitted to the balladtune which each liked best the dauphin prince henry who delighted in hunting was fond of ainsi quon oit le cerf bruire or like as the heart desires the waterbrooks which he constantly sung in going out to the chase madame de valentinois between whom and the young prince there was an attachment took du fond de ma pensee or from the depth of my heart o lord the queens favorite was ne uveilles pas o sire that is o lord rebuke me not in thine indignation which she sung to a fashionable jig antony king of navarre sung revenge moy pren le querelle or stand up o lord to revenge my quarrel to the air of a dance of poitou see bayle dict v marot  it was on very different principles that psalmody flourished in the gloomy court of cromwell this fashion does not seem in the least to have diminished the gaiety and good humor of the court of francis  at this period john calvin in opposition to the discipline and doctrines of rome was framing his novel church at geneva in which the whole substance and form of divine worship was reduced to praying preaching and singing in the last of these three he chose to depart widely from the catholic usage and either because he thought that novelty was sure to succeed that the practice of antiphonal chanting was superstitious or that the people were excluded from bearing a part in the more solemn and elaborate performance of ecclesiastical music or that the old papistic hymns were unedifying or that verse was better remembered than prose he projected with the advice of luther a species of religious song consisting of portions of the psalms intelligibly translated into the vernacular language and adapted to plain and easy melodies which all might learn and in which all might join this scheme either by design or accident was luckily seconded by the publication of marots metrical psalms at paris which calvin immediately introduced into his congregation at geneva being set to simple and almost monotonous notes by guillaume de franc they were soon established as the principal branch in that reformers new devotion and became a characteristical mark or badge of the calvinistic worship and profession nor were they sung only in his churches they exhilarated the convivial assemblies of the calvinists were commonly heard in the streets and accompanied the labors of the artificer the weavers and woollen manufacturers of flanders many of whom left the loom and entered into the ministry are said to have been the capital performers into this science at length marots psalms formed an appendix to the catechism of geneva and were interdicted to the catholics under the most severe penalties in the language of the orthodox psalmsinging and heresy were synonimous terms  it was calvins system of reformation not only to strip religion of its superstitious and ostensible pageantries of crucifixes images tapers superb vestments and splendid processions but of all that was estimable in the sight of the people and even of every simple ornament every significant symbol and decent ceremony in a word to banish every thing from his church which attracted or employed the senses or which might tend to mar the purity of an abstracted adoration and of a mental intercourse with the deity it is hard to determine how calvin could reconcile the use of singing even when purged from the corruptions and abuses of popery to so philosophical a plan of worship on a parallel principle and if any artificial aids to devotion were to be allowed he might at least have retained the use of pictures in the church but a new sect always draws its converts from the multitude and the meanest of the people who can have no relish for the more elegant externals calvin well knew that the manufacturers of germany were no judges of pictures at the same time it was necessary that his congregation should be kept in good humor by some kind of pleasurable gratification and allurement which might qualify and enliven the attendance on the more rigid duties of praying and preaching calvin therefore intent as he was to form a new church on a severe model had yet too much sagacity to exclude every auxiliary to devotion under this idea he permitted an exercise which might engage the affections without violating the simplicity of his worship and sensible that his chief resources were in the rabble of a republic and availing himself of that natural propensity which prompts even vulgar minds to express their more animated feelings in rhyme and music he conceived a mode of universal psalmody not too refined for common capacities and fitted to please the populace the rapid propagation of calvins religion and his numerous proselytes are a strong proof of his address in planning such a sort of service france and germany were instantly infatuated with a love of psalmsinging which being admirably calculated to kindle and diffuse the flame of fanaticism was peculiarly serviceable to the purposes of faction and frequently served as the trumpet to rebellion these energetic hymns of geneva under the conduct of the calvinistic preachers excited and supported a variety of popular insurrections they filled the most flourishing cities of the low countries with sedition and tumult and fomented the fury which defaced many of the most beautiful and venerable churches of flanders  this infectious frenzy of sacred song soon reached england at the very critical point of time when it had just embraced the reformation and the new psalmody was obtruded on the new english liturgy by some few officious zealots who favored the discipline of geneva and who wished to abolish not only the choral mode of worship in general but more particularly to suppress the te deum benedictus magnificat jubilate nunc dimittis and the rest of the liturgic hymns which were supposed to be contaminated by their long and ancient connection with the roman missal or at least in their prosaic form to be unsuitable to the new system of worship  although wyat and surrey had before made translations of the psalms into meter thomas sternhold was the first whose metrical version of the psalms was used in the church of england sternhold was a native of hampshire and probably educated at winchester college having passed some time at oxford he became groom of the robes to king henry the eighth in this department either his diligent services or his knack at rhyming so pleased the king that his majesty bequeathed him a legacy of one hundred marks he continued in the same office under edward the sixth and is said to have acquired some degree of reputation about the court for his poetry being of a serious disposition and an enthusiast to reformation he was much offended at the lascivious ballads which prevailed among the courtiers and with a laudable design to check these indecencies undertook a metrical version of the psalter thinking thereby says antony wood that the courtiers would sing them instead of their sonnets but did not only some few excepted ath oxon i     here was the zeal if not the success of his fellow labourer clement marot a singular coincidence of circumstances is notwithstanding to be remarked on this occasion vernacular versions for general use of the psalter were first published both in france and england by laymen by courtpoets and by servants of the court nor were the respective translations entirely completed by themselves and yet they translated nearly an equal number of psalms marot having versified fifty and sternhold fiftyone sternhold died in the year      his fiftyone psalms were printed the same year by edward whitchurch under the following title all such psalms of david as thomas sternholde late grome of the kings maiestyes robes did in his lye time draw into english meter they are without the musical notes as is the second edition in      he probably lived to prepare the first edition for the press as it is dedicated by himself to king edward the sixth  cotemporary with sternhold and his coadjutor was john hopkins of whose life nothing more is known than that he was a clergyman and a schoolmaster of suffolk and perhaps a graduate at oxford about the year      of his abilities as a teacher of the classics he has left a specimen in some latin stanzas prefixed to foxs martyrology he is rather a better english poet than sternhold and translated fifty eight of the psalms distinguished by the initials of his name  of the rest of the contributors to this undertaking the chief at least in point of rank and learning was william whyttingham promoted by robert earl of leicester to the deanery of durham yet not without a strong reluctance to comply with the use of the canonical habiliments among our religious exiles in the reign of mary he was calvins principal favorite from whom he received ordination so pure was his faith that he was thought worthy to succeed to the congregation of geneva superintended by knox the scotch reformer who from a detestation of idols proceeded to demolish the churches in which they were contained it was one of the natural consequences of whyttinghams translation from knoxs pastorship at geneva to an english deanery that he destroyed or removed many beautiful and harmless monuments of ancient art in his cathedral to a man who had so highly spiritualised his religious conceptions as to be convinced that a field a street or a barn were fully sufficient for all the operations of christian worship the venerable structures raised by the magnificent piety of our ancestors could convey no ideas of solemnity and had no other charms than their ample endowments beside the psalms he translated among them is the hundredth and the hundred and nineteenth  all which bear his initials by way of innovating still further on our established formularly he versified the decalogue the nicene apostolic and athanasian creeds the lords prayer the te deum the song of the three children with other hymns which follow the book of psalmody how the ten commandments and the athanasian creed to say nothing of some of the rest should become more edifying and better suited to common use or how they could receive improvement in any respect or degree by being reduced into rhym it is not easy to perceive but the real design was to render that more tolerable which could not be entirely removed to accommodate every part of the service to the psalmodic tone and to clothe our whole liturgy in the garb of geneva all these for he was a lover of music were sung in whyttinghams church of durham under his own directions heylin says that from vicinity of situation he was enabled to lend considerable assistance to his friend knox in the introduction of the presbyterian hierarchy into scotland i must indulge the reader with a stanza or two of this dignified fanatics divine poetry from his creeds and the decalogue from the athanasian creed  the father god is god the son god holy ghost also yet are there not three gods in all but one god and no m from the apostolic creed  from thence shall he come for to judge all men both dead and quick i in the holy ghost believe and church that is catholic the ten commandments are thus closed  nor his manservant nor his maid nor ox nor ass of his nor any other thing that to thy neighbor proper is these were also versified by clement marot  twentyseven of the psalms were turned into meter by thomas norton marked n  who perhaps was better employed at least as a poet in writing the tragedy of gordobucke in conjunction with lord buckhurst it is certain that in nortons psalms we see none of those sublime strokes which sir philip sydney discovered in that venerable drama he was of sharpenhoe in bedfordshire a barrister and in the opinion and phraseology of the oxford biographer a bold and busy calvinist about the beginning of the reign of queen elisabeth he was patronised by the protector somerset at whose desire he translated an epistle addressed by peter martyr to somerset into english in    0 under the same patronage he probably tranlated also calvins institutes  robert wisdom a protestant fugitive in the calamitous reign of queen mary afterward archdeacon of ely and who had been nominated to an irish bishopric by king edward the sixth rendered the twentyfifth psalm of this version see strypes cranmer p            psalms  0  0              and     are marked with w k psalm     with t c it is not known to whom these initials belong  but he is chiefly memorable for his metrical prayer intended to be sung in the church against the pope and the turk of whom he seems to have conceived the most alarming apprehensions it is probable that he thought popery and mahometanism were equally dangerous to christianity at least the most powerful and the sole enemies of our religion this is the first stanza  preserve us lord by thy dear word from pope and turk defend us lord which both would thrust out of thy throne our lord jesus christ thy dear son happily we have hitherto survived these two formidable evils among other orthodox wits the facetious bishop corbet has ridiculed these lines he supposes himself seized with a sudden impulse to hear or to pen a puritanical hymn and invokes the ghost of robert wisdom as the most skilful poet in this mode of composition to come and assist but he advises wisdom to steal back again to his tomb which was in carfax church at oxford silent and unperceived for fear of being detected and intercepted by the pope or the turk but i will produce corbets epigram more especially as it contains a criticism written in the reign of charles the first on the style of this sort of poetry  to the ghost of robert wisdom thou once a body now but air archbotcher of a psalm or prayer from carfax come and patch us up a zealous lay with an old ever and for ay or all and some or such a spirit lend me as may a hymn down send me to purge my brain but robert look behind thee lest turk or pope do find thee and go to bed again poems land      duod p     the entire version of the psalter was at length published by john day in      attached for the first time to the common prayer and entitled the whole book of psalms collected into english meter by t sternhold j hopkins and others conferred with the ebrue with apt notes to ing them withal calvins music was intended to correspond with the general parsimonious spirit of his worship not to captivate the passions and seduce the mind by a levity a variety or a richness of modulation but to infuse the more sober and unravishing ecstasies the music he permitted although sometimes it had wonderful effects was to be without grace elegance or elevation these apt notes were about forty tunes of one part only and in one unisonous key remarkable for a certain uniform strain of sombrous gravity and applicable to all the psalms in their turns as the stanza and sense might allow they also appear in the subsequent impressions particularly of      and      they are believed to contain some of the original melodies composed by french and german musicians many of them particularly the celebrated one of the hundredth psalm are the tunes of goudimel and le jeune who are among the first composers of marots french psalms see this matte traced with great skill and accuracy by hawkins hist mus iii      not a few were probably imported by the protestant manufacturers of cloth of flanders and the low countries who fled into england from the persecution of the duke de alva and settled in those counties where their art now chiefly flourishes it is not however unlikely that some of our own musicians who lived about the year      and who could always tune their harps to the religion of the times such as marbeck tallis tie parsons and monday were employed on this occasion yet under the restriction of conforming to the jejune and unadorned movements of the foreign composers i resume much of the primitive harmony of all these ancient tunes is now lost by additions variations and transpositions  this version is said to be conferred with the ebrue but i am inclined to think that the translation was altogether made from the vulgate text either in latin or english  it is evident that the prose psalms of our liturgy were chiefly consulted and copied by the perpetual assumption of their words and combinations many of the stanza are literally nothing more than the proseverses put into rhyme as thus  thus were they stained with the works of their own filthy way and with their own invetions did a whoring go astray psalm cvi     whyttingham however who had traveled to acquire the literature then taught in the foreign universities and who joined in the translation of coverdales bible was undoubtedly a scholar and an adept in the hebrew language  it is certain that every attempt to clothe the sacred scripture in verse will have the effect of misrepresenting and debasing the dignity of the original but this general inconvenience arising from the nature of things was not the only difficulty which our versifiers of the psalter had to encounter in common with all other writers employed in a similar task allowing for the state of our language in the middle of the sixteenth century they appear to have been but little qualified either by genius or accomplishments for poetical composition it is for this reason that they have produced a translation entirely destitute of elegance spirit and propriety the truth is that they undertook this work not so much from an ambition of literary fame or a consciousness of abilities as from motives of piety and in compliance with the cast of the times i presume i am communicating no very new criticism when i observe that in every part of this translation we are disgusted with a languor of versification and a want of common prosody the most exalted effusions of thanksgiving and the most sublime imageries of the divine majesty are lowered by a coldness of conception weakened by frigid interpolations and disfigured by a poverty of phraseology thomas hopkins expostulates with the deity in these ludicrous at least trivial expressions  why do withdraw thy hand aback and hide it in thy lap o pluck it out and be not slack to give thy foes a rappe ps lxxiv    perhaps this verse is not much improved in the translation of king james the first who seems to have rested entirely on the image of why withdrawet thou not thine hand which he has expressed in hopkinss manner why do thou thus withdraw thy hand even thy right hand restrain out of thy bosom for our good draw back the same again in another stanza he has preserved hopkinss rhymes and expletives and if possible lowered his language and cadences ps lxxiv   oh why our god for evrmore have thou neglected us why smoaks thy wrath against the sheep of thine own pasture thus here he has chiefly displayed the smoking of gods wrath which kindles in hopkins the particle thus was never so distinguished and dignified and it is hard to say why his majesty should choose to make the divine indignation smoke rather than burn which is suggested by the original  what writer who wished to diminish the might of the supreme being and to expose the style and sentiments of scripture could have done it more skilfully than by making david call upon god not to consume his enemies by an irresistible blow but to give them a rap although some shadow of an apology may be suggested for the word rap that it had not then acquired its present burlesque acceptance or the idea of a petty stroke the vulgarity of the following phrase in which the practice or profession of religion or more particularly gods covenant with the jews is degraded to a trade cannot easily be vindicated on any consideration of the fluctuating sense of words for why their hearts were nothing bent to him nor to his trade ps lxviii     nor is there greater delicacy or consistency in the following stanza  confound them that apply and seek to work my shame and at my harm do laugh and cry so so there goes the game ps lxx    the psalmist says that god has placed the sun in the heavens which comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber here is a comparison of the sun rising to a bridegroom who according to the jewish custom was ushered from his chamber at midnight with great state preceded by torches and music sternhold has thus metrified the passage ps xix     in them the lord made for the sun a place of great renown who like a bridegroom ready trimmed does from his chamber come the translator had better have spared his epithet to the bridegroom which even in the sense of readydressed is derogatory to the idea of the comparison but readytrimmd in the language of that time was nothing more than freshshaved sternhold as often impairs a splendid description by an impotent redundancy as by an omission or contraction of the most important circumstances  the miraculous march of jehovah before the israelites through the wilderness in their departure from egypt with other marks of his omnipotence is thus imaged by the inspired psalmist o god when thou wentest forth before the people when thou wentest through the wilderness the earth shook and the heavens dropped at the presence of god even as sinai also was moved at the presence of god who is the god of israel thou o god sentedst a gracious rain upon thine inheritance and refreshedst it when it was weary  the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels and the lord is among them as in the holy place of sinai sternhold has thus represented these great ideas  when thou did march before thy folk the egyptians from among and brought them from the wilderness which was both wide and long the earth did quake the rain pourde down heard were great claps of thunder the mount sinai shook in such sort as it would cleave in sunder thy heritage with drops of rain abundantly was washed and if so be it barren was by thee it was refresht gods army is two millions of warriors good and strong the lord also in sinai is present them among ps lxviii   seq  if there be here any merit it arises solely from preserving the expressions of the prose version and the translator would have done better had he preserved more and had given us no feeble or foreign enlargements of his own he has shown no independent skill or energy when once he attempts to add or dilate his weakness appears it is this circumstance alone which supports the two following wellknown stanzas ps xviii    0   the lord descended from above and bowde the heavens high and underneath his feet he cast the darkness of the sky on cherubs and on cherubims full royally he rode and on the wings of all the winds came flying all abroad almost the entire contexture of the prose is here literally transferred unbroken and without transposition allowing for the small deviations necessarily occasioned by the meter and rhyme it may be said that the translator has testified his judgment in retaining so much of the original and proved he was sensible the passage needed not any adventitious ornament but what may seem here to be judgment or even taste i fear was want of expression in himself he only adopted what was almost ready done to his hand  to the disgrace of sacred music sacred poetry and our established worship these psalms still continue to be sung in the church of england it is certain had they been more poetically translated they would not have been acceptable to the common people yet however they may be allowed to serve the purposes of private edification in administering spiritual consolation to the manufacturer and mechanic as they are extrinsic to the frame of our liturgy and incompatible with the genius of our service there is perhaps no impropriety in wishing that they were remitted and restrained to that church in which they sprung and with whose character and constitution they seem so aptly to correspond whatever estimation in point of composition they might have attracted at their first appearance in a ruder age and however instrumental they might have been at the infancy of the reformation in weaning the minds of men from the papistic ritual all these considerations can now no longer support even a specious argument for their being retained from the circumstances of the times and the growing refinements of literature of course they become obsolete and contemptible a work grave serious and even respectable for its poetry in the reign of edward the sixth at length in a cultivated age has contracted the air of an absolute travestie voltaire observes that in proportion as good taste improved the psalms of clement marot inspired only disgust and that although they charmed the court of francis the first they seemed only to be calculated for the populace in the reign of lewis the fourteenth hist mod chapter ccvii   to obviate these objections attempts have been made from time to time to modernise this ancient metrical version and to render it more tolerable and intelligible by the substitution of more familiar modes of diction but to say nothing of the unskilfulness with which these arbitrary corrections have been conducted by changing obsolete for known words the texture and integrity of the original style such as it was has been destroyed and many stanzas before too naked and weak like a plain old gothic edifice stripped of its few signatures of antiquity have lost that little and almost only strength and support which they derived from ancient phrases such alterations even if executed with prudence and judgment only corrupt what they endeavor to explain and exhibit a motley performance belonging to no character of writing and which contains more improprieties than those which it professes to remove hearne is highly offended at these unwarrantable and incongruous emendations which he pronounces to be abominable in any book much more in a sacred work and is confident that were sternhold and hopkins now living they would be so far from owning what is ascribed to them that they would proceed against the innovators as cheats gloss rob gl p      it is certain that this translation in its genuine and unsophisticated state by ascertaining the signification of many radical words now perhaps undeservedly disused and by displaying original modes of the english language may justly be deemed no inconsiderable monument of our ancient literature if not of our ancient poetry in condemning the practice of adulterating this primitive version i would not be understood to recommend another in its place entirely new i reprobate any version at all more especially if intended for the use of the church  in the mean time not to insist any longer on the incompatibility of these metrical psalms with the spirit of our liturgy and the barbarism of their style it should b remembered that they were never admitted into our church by lawful authority they were first introduced by the puritans and afterward continued by connivance but they never received any royal approbation or parliaentary sanction notwithstanding it is said in their title page that they are set forth and allowed to be sung in all churches of all the people together before and after evening prayer and also before and after sermons and moreover in private houses for their godly solace and comfort laying apart all ungodly songs and ballads which tend only to the nourishing of vice and the corrupting of youth at the beginning of the reign of queen elisabeth when our ecclesiastical reformation began to be placed on a solid and durable establishment those english divines who had fled from the superstitions of queen mary to franckfort and geneva where they had learned to embrace the opposite extreme and where from an abhorrence of catholic ceremonies they had contracted a dislike to the decent appendages of divine worship endeavored in conjunction with some of the principal courtiers to effect an abrogation of our solemn church service which they pronounced to be antichristian and unevangelical they contended that the metrical psalms of david set to plain and popular music were more suitable to the simplicity of the gospel and abundantly adequate to all the purposes of edification and this proposal they rested on the authority and practice of calvin between whom and the church of england the breach was not then so wide as at present but the queen and those bishops to whom she had delegated the business of supervising the liturgy among which was the learned and liberal archbishop parker objected that too much attention had already been paid to the german theology she declared that the foreign reformers had before interpoed on imilar deliberations with unbecoming forwardness and that the common prayer of her brother edward had been once altered to quiet the scruples and to gratify the cavils of calvin bucer and fagius she was therefore invariably determined to make no more concessions to the importunate partisans of geneva and peremptorily decreed that the choral formalities should still be continued in the celebration of the sacred offices see canons and injunctions a d      number xlix   sect xxviii the spirit of versifying the psalms and other parts of the bible at the beginning of the reformation was almost as epidemic as psalmsinging william hunnis a gentleman of the chapel under edward the sixth and afterward chapelmaster to

foundress of sydney college in cambridge hunnis also under the happy title of a handful of honeysuckles published blessings out of deuteronomie prayers to christ athanasiuss creed and meditations in

dedicated to king edward the sixth with this title the psalms of david translated into english meter by t sternhold sir t wyat and william hunnis with certain chapters of the proverbes and select

entitled a description of the life of man the world and vanities hereof princ who on earth can justly rejoice   archbishop parker also versified the psalter not from any opposition to our liturgy but either for the private amusement and exercise of his religious exile or that the people whose predilection for psalmody could not be suppressed might at least be furnished with a rational and proper translation it was finished in      and a few years afterward printed by day the archbishops printer in quarto with this title the whole psalter translated into english meter which contains an

the translator in the metrical preface prefixed he tries to remove the objections of those who censured versifications of scripture he pleads the comforts of such an employment to the persecuted theologist who suffers voluntary banishment and thus displays the power of sacred music  the psalmist stayde with tuned song the rage of minds aghast as david did with harp among to saul in fury cast with golden stringes such harmony his harp so sweet did wrest that he relieved his phrenesie whom wicked sprites possessed he thus remonstrates against the secular ballads ye songs so nice ye sonnets all of lothly lovers lays ye work mens minds but bitter gall by phansies peevish plays   whatever might at first have been his design it is certain that his version although printed was never published and notwithstanding the formality of his metrical preface abovementioned which was professedly written to show the spiritual efficacy or virtue of the psalms in meter and in which he directs a distinct and audible mode of congregational singing he probably suppressed it because he saw that the practice had been abused to the purposes of fanaticism and dopted by the puritans in contradiction to the national worship or at least that such a publication whatever his private sentiments might have been would not have suited the nature and dignity of his high office in the church some of our musical antiquaries however have justly conjectured that the archbishop who was skilled in music and had formerly founded a musicschool in his college of stoke clare intended these psalms which are adapted to complicated tunes of four parts probably constructed by himself and here given in score for the use of cathedrals at a time when compositions in counterpoint were uncommon in the church and when that part of our choirservice called the motet or anthem which admits a more artificial display of harmony and which is recommended and allowed in queen elisabeths earliest ecclesiastical injunctions was yet almost unknown or but in a very imperfect state accordingly although the direction is not quite comprehensible he orders many of them to be sung by the rector chori or chantor and the quier or choir alternately that at least he had a taste for music we may conclude from the following not inelegant scale of modulation prefixed to his eight tunes abovementioned  the nature of the eight tunes the first is meke devout to see the second sad in majesty the third does rage and roughly brayth the fourth does fawn and flattry playth the fifth deligth and laugheth the more the sixth bewayleth it wepeth full sore the seventh tredeth stout in froward race the eyghte goes mild in modest pace what follows is another proof that he had proposed to introduce these psalms into the choirservice the tenor of these parts be for the people when they will sing alone the other parts put for the greater quiers or to such as will sing or play them privately as the singingpsalms were never a part of our liturgy no rubrical direction are any where given for the manner of performing them in one of the prefaces written about    0 it is ordered whereas heretofore there has been great diversity of saying and singing in churches within this realm some following salisbury use some hereford use some the use of bangor some of york some of lincoln now from henceforth all the whole realm shall have but one use but this is said in reference to the chants responds suffrages versicles introites kyrieeleeysos doxologies and other melodies of the book of common prayer then newly published under lawful authority with musical notes by marbeck and which are still used that no arbitrary variations should be made in the manner of singing these melodies as had been lately the case with the roman missal in performing which some cathedrals affected a manner of their own the salisbury mial was most famous and chiely followed   how far this memorable prelate perhaps the most accomplished scholar that had yet filled the archbishopric of canterbury has succeeded in producing a translation of the psalter preferable to the common one the reader may judge from these stanzas of a psalm highly poetical in which i have exactly preserved the translators peculiar use of the hemistic punctuation  to feed my need he will me lead to pastures green and fat he forth brought me in liberty to waters delicate my soul and heart he did convart to me he shewth the path of right wisness in holiness his name such virtue has yea though i go through death his woe his vale and shadow wide i fear no dart with me thou art with rod and staff to guide thou shall provyde a table wide for me against their spite with oil my head thou have bespred my cup is fully dight fol     i add in the more sublime character a part of the eighteenth psalm in which sternhold is supposed to have exerted his powers most successfully and without the interruptions of the pointing which perhaps was designed for some regulations of the music now unknown  the earth did shake for fear did quake the hills their bases shook removed they were in place most fair at gods right fearful look dark smoke rose to his face therefro his mouth as fire consumde that coals at it were kyndled bright when he in anger fumde the heavens full low he made to bow and down did he ensue follow  and darkness great was undersete his feet in clowdy hue he rode on hye and did so fly upon the cherubins he came in sight and made his flight upon the wyng of wyndes the lord from heaven sent down his leaven and thundered thence in ire he thunder cast in wondrous blast with hayle and coals of fire fol     here is some degree of spirit and a choice of phraseology but on the whole and especially for this species of stanza parker will be found to want facility and in general to have been unpractised in writing english verses his abilities were destined to other studies and adapted to employments of a more arhiepiscopal nature  the industrious strype parkers biographer after a diligent search never could gain a sight o this translation nor is it even mentioned by ames the inquisitive collector of our typographical antiquities in the late mr wests library there was a superb copy once belonging to bishop kennet who has remarked in a blank page that the archbishop permitted his wife dame margaret to present the book to some of the nobility it is certainly at this time extremely scarce and would be deservedly deemed a fortunate acquisition to those capricious students who labor only to collect a library of rarities yet it is not generally known that there are two copies in the bodleian library of this anonymous version which have hitherto been given to an obscure pot by the name of john keeper one of them in      appears to have been the property of bishop barlow and on the opposite side of the title in somewhat of an ancient hand is this manuscript insertion the auctor of this book is one john keeper who was brought upp in the close of wells perhaps antony wood had no better authority than this slender unauthenticated note for saying that john keeper a native of somersetshire and a graduate at oxford in the year      and who afterward studied music and poetry at wells translated the whole psalter into english meter which contains   0 psalms etc printed at london by john day living over aldersgate about    0 in quarto and added thereunto the gloria patri te deum the song of the three children quicunque vult benedictus etc all in mtre at the end of which are musical notes set in four parts to several psalms what other things he adds of poetry music or other faculties he has published i know not nor any thing more yet i suppose he had some dignity in the church of wells ath oxon i      if this version should really be the work of keeper i fear we are still to seek for archbishop parkers psalms with strype and ames there is a metrical english version of the pslm among the cotton manuscripts about the year    0 which has merit s also supr vol i      a considerable contributor to the metrical theology was robert crowley educated in magdalene college at oxford where he obtained a fellowship in      in the reign of edward the sixth he commenced printer and preacher in london he lived in elyrents in holborn where says wood he sold books and at leisure times exercised the gift of preaching in the great city and elsewhere ath oxon i      in    0 he printed the first edition of pierce plowmans vision but with the ideas of a controversialist and with the view of helping forward the reformation by the revival of a book which exposed the absurdities of popery in strong satire and which at present is only valuable or useful as it serves to gratify the harmless researches of those peaceable philosophers who study the progression of ancient literature his pulpit and his press those two prolific sources of faction happily cooperated in propagating his principles of predestination and his shop and his sermons were alike frequented possessed of those talents which qualified him for captivating the attention and moving the passions of the multitude under queen elisabeth he held many dignities in a church whose doctrines and polity his undiscerning zeal had a tendency to destroy he translated into popular rhyme not only the psalter but the litany with hymns all which he printed together in      in the same year and in the same measure he published the voice of the last trumpet blown by the seventh angel this piece contains twelve several lessons for the instruction or amendment of those who seemed at that time chiefly to need advice and among whom he enumerates lewd priests scholars physicians beggars yeomen gentlemen magistrates and women he also attacked the abuses of his age in thirtyone epigrams first printed in      the subjects are placed alphabetically in his first alphabet are abbayes alehouses alleys and almeshouses the second bailiffs bawds beggars bearbayting and brawlers they display but without spirit or humor the reprehensible practices and licentious manners which then prevailed he published in      a kind of metrical sermon on pleasure and pain heaven and hell many of these to say nothing of his almost innumerable controversial tracts in prose had repeated

xxix but among the theological versifiers of these times the most notable is christopher tie a doctor of music at cambridge in      and musical preceptor to prince edward and probably to his sisters the princesses mary and elisabeth in the reign of elisabeth he was organist of the royal chapel in which he had been educated to his profession of music he joined some knowledge of english literature and having been taught to believe that rhyme and edification were closely connected and being persuaded that every part of the scripture would be more instructive and better received if reduced into verse he projected a translation of the acts of the apostles into familiar meter it appears that the book of kings had before been versified which for many reasons was more capable of shining under the hands of a translator but the most splendid historical book i mean the most susceptible of poetic ornament in the old or new testament would have become ridiculous when clothed in the fashionable ecclesiastical stanza perhaps the plan of setting a narrative of this kind to music was still more preposterous and exceptionable however he completed only the first fourteen chapters and they were printed in      by william serres with the following title which by the reader who is not acquainted with the peculiar complexion of this period will hardly be suspected to be serious the acts of the apostles translated into english meter and dedicated to the kings most excellent majesty by cristofer tie doctor in musyke and one of the gentylmen of his graces most honorable chapel with notes to each chapter to sing and also to play upon the lute very necessary for students after their study to fyle their wits and also for all christians that cannot sing to read the good and godly stories of the lives of christ his apostles it is dedicated in sternholds stanza to the virtuous and godly learned prince edward the sixth as this singular dedication contains not only anecdotes of the author and his work but of his majestys eminent attention to the study of the scripture and of his skill in playing on the lute i need not apologize for transcribing a few dull stanzas especially as they will also serve as a specimen of the poets native style and manner unconfined by the fetters of translation  your grace may note from time to time that some does undertake upon the psalms to write in ryme the verse plesaunt to make and some does take in hand to write out of the book of kings because they se your grace delight in such like godly things strype says that sternhold composed several psalms at first for his own solace for he set and sung them to his organ which music king edward vi sometime hearing for he was a gentleman of the privychamber was much delighted with them which occasioned his publication and dedication of them to the said king eccles memor b i chapter   p     and last of all i your poor man whose doings are full base yet glad to do the best i can to give

thing shall decay your subjectes shall with right good will these words record and say thy life o king to us does shine as gods book does thee teach thou do us feed with such doctrine as gods elect did preach from this sample of his original vein my reader will not perhaps hastily predetermine that our author has communicated any considerable decorations to his acts of the apostles in english verse there is as much elegance and animation in the two following initial stanzas of the fourteenth chapter as in any of the whole performance which i shall therefore exhibit  it chanced in iconium as they apostles often times did use together they into did come the sinagoge of jues where they did preach and only seek gods grace them to atcheve that so they speak to jue and greek that many did bileve doctor tyes acts of the apostles were sung for a time in the royal chapel of edward the sixth but they never became popular the impropriety of the design and the impotency of the execution seem to have been perceived even by his own prejudiced and undiscerning age this circumstance however had probably the fortunate and seasonable effect of turning tyes musical studies to another and a more rational system to the composition of words judiciously selected from the prose psalms in four or five parts before the middle of the reign of elisabeth at a time when the more ornamental and intricate music was wanted in our service he concurred with the celebrated tallis and a few others in setting several anthems which are not only justly supposed to retain much of the original strain of our ancient choral melody before the reformation but in respect of harmony expression contrivance and general effect are allowed to be perfect models of the genuine ecclesiastic style fuller informs us that tie was the chief restorer of the loss which the music of the church had sustained by the destruction of the monasteries worthis ii     tallis here mentioned at the begining of the reign of elisabeth and by proper authority enriched the music of marbecks liturgy he set to music the t deum benedictus magnificat nunc dimittis and other offices to which marbeck had given only the canto fimo or plain chant he composed a new litany still in use and improved the simpler modulation of marbecks suffrages kyries after the commandments and other versicle as they are sung at present

rhyme presented and dedicated to queen elisabeth mss r    b xxxvii the protector somerset was his patron   it is not my intention to pursue any farther the mob of religious rhymers who from principles of the most unfeigned piety devoutly labored to darken the luster and enervate the force of the divine pages and perhaps i have been already too prolix in examining a species of poetry if it may be so called which even impoverishes prose or rather by mixing the style of prose with verse and of verse with prose destroys the character and effect of both but in surveying the general course of a species of literature absurdities as well as excellencies the weakness and the vigor of the human mind must have their historian nor is it unpleasing to trace and to contemplate those strange incongruities and false ideas of perfection which at various times either affectation or caprice or fashion or opinion or prejudie or ignorance or enthusiasm present to the conceptions of men in the shape of truth  i must not however forget that king edward the sixth is to be ranked among the religious poets of his own reign fox has published his metrical instructions concerning the eucharist addressed to sir antony saint ledger bale also mentions his comedy called the whore of babylon which holland the heroologist who perhaps had never seen it and knew not whether it was a play or a ballad in verse or prose pronounces to be a most elegant perfomance heroolog p     its elegance with some will not perhaps apologize or atone for its subject and it may seem strange that controversial ribaldry should have been suffered to enter into the education of a great monarch but the genius habits and situation of his age should be considered the reformation was the great political topic of edwards court intricate discussions in divinity were no longer confined to the schools or the clergy the new religion from its novelty as well as importance interested every mind and was almost the sole object of the general attention men emancipated from the severities of a spiritual tyranny reflected with horror on the slavery they had so long suffered and with exultation on the triumph they had obtained these feelings were often expressed in a strain of enthusiasm the spirit of innovation which had seized the times often transgressed the bounds of truth every change of religion is attended with those ebullitions which growing more moderate by degrees afterward appear eccentric and ridiculous  we who live at a distance from this great and national struggle between popery and protestantism when our church has been long and peaceably established and in an age of good sense of politeness and philosophy are apt to view these effusions of royal piety as weak and unworthy the character of a king but an ostentation of zeal and example in the young edward as it was natural so it was necessary while the reformation was yet immature it was the duty of his preceptors to impress on his tender years an abhorrence of the principles of rome and a predilection to that happy system which now seemed likely to prevail his early diligence his inclination to letters and his seriousness of disposition seconded their active endeavors to cultivate and to bias his mind in favor of the new theology which was now become the fashionable knowledge these and other amiable virtues his cotemporaries have given young edward in an eminent degree but it may be presumed that the partiality which youth always commands the specious prospects excited by expectation and the flattering promises of religious liberty secured to a distant posterity have had some small share in dictating his panegyric  the new settlement of religion by counteracting inveterate prejudices of the most interesting nature by throwing the clergy into a state of contention and by disseminating theological opinions among the people excited so general a ferment that even the popular ballads and the stage

opulence exerted all their powers of declamation in combating the doctrines of protestantism and in alienating the minds of the people from the new doctrines and reformed rites of worship being silenced by authority they had recourse to the stage and from the pulpit removed their polemics to the playhouse their farces became more successful than their sermons the people flocked eagerly to

year      before the reformation was fixed or even intended on its present liberal establishment yet when men had begun to discern and to reprobat many of the impostures of popery it became an object of the legislature to curb the bold and seditious spirit of popular poetry no sooner were the scriptures translated and permitted in english than they were brought upon the stage they were not only misinterpreted and misunderstood by the multitude but profaned or burlesqued in comedies and mummeries effectually to restrain these abuses henry who loved to create a subject for persecution who commonly proceeded to disannul what he had just confirmed and who found that a freedom of enquiry tended to shake his ecclesiastical supremacy framed a law that not only tyndales english bible and all the printed english commentaries expositions annotations defenses replies and sermons whether orthodox or heretical which it had occasioned should be utterly abolished but that the kingdom should also

tales the works of chaucer and gower cronicles and stories of mens lives ibid artic vii  there is also an exception added about plays and those only are allowed which were called moralities or perhaps interludes of ral character and action for the rebuking and reproaching of vices and the setting forth of virtue mysteries are totally rejected ibid artic ix  the reservations which follow concerning

chancellor the speaker of the house of commons captains of the wars justices of the peace and recorders of cities may quote passages to enforce their public harangues as has been accustomed a nobleman or gentleman may read it in his house orchards or garden yet quietly and without disturbance of good order a merchant also may read it to himself privately but the common people who had already abused this liberty to the purpose of division and dissensions and under the denomination of women artificers apprentices journeymen and servingmen are to be punished with one months imprisonment as often as they are detected in reading the bible either privately or openly  it should be observed that few of these had now learned to read but such was the privilege of peerage that ladies of quality might

this age if not from principles of piety at least from motives of curiosity became eager to read a book which was made inaccessible to three parts of the nation but the partial distribution of a treasure to which all had a right could not long remain this was a manna to be gathered by every man the claim of the people was too powerful to be overruled by the bigottry the prejudice or the caprice of henry  i must add here in reference to my general subject that the translation of the bible which in the reign of edward the sixth was admitted into the churches is supposed to have fixed our language it certainly has transmitted and perpetuated many ancient words which would otherwise have been obsolete or unintelligible i have never seen it remarked that at the same time this translation contributed to enrich our native english at an early period by importing and familiarising many latin words more particularly in the latin derivative substantives such as divination perdition adoption manifestatio consolation contribution administration consummation reconciliation operation communication retribution preparation immortality principality etc etc and in other words frustrate inexcusable tranfigure concupiscence etc etc   these were suggested by the latin vulgate which was used as a medium by the translators some of these however now interwoven into our common speech could not have been understood by many readers even above the rank of the vulgar when the bible first appeared in english bishop gardener had therefore much less reason than we now imagine for complaining of the too great clearness of the translation when with an insidious view of keeping the people in their ancient ignorance he proposed that instead of always using english phrases many latin words should still be preserved because they contained an inherent significance and a genuine dignity to which the common tongue afforded no correspondent expressions of sufficient energy such

turbulent and unpropitious reign of queen mary when controversy was no longer confined to speculation and a spiritual warfare polluted every part of england with murders more atrocious than the slaughters of the most bloody civil contest a poem was planned although not fully completed which illuminates with no common luster that interval of darkness which occupies the annals of english poetry from surrey to spenser entitled a mirror for magistrates  more writers than one were concerned in the execution of this piece but its primary inventor and most distinguished contributor was thomas sackville the first lord buckhurst and first earl of dorset much about the same period the same author wrote the first genuine english tragedy which i shall consider in its proper place  sackville was born at buckhurst a pricipal seat of his ancient and illustrious family in the parish of withiam in sussex his birth is placed but with evident inaccuracy under the year      archbishop abbot in sackvilles funeralsermon says he was aged    when he died in the year   0  if so he was not twenty years of age when h wrote gordobuck  at least it should be placed six years before discovering a vigorous understanding in his childhood from a domestic tuition he was removed as it may reasonably be conjectured to harthall now hertford college in oxford but he appears to have been a master of arts at cambridge wood ath oxon i       at both universities he became celebrated as a latin and english poet and he carried his love of poetry which he seems to have almost solely cultivated to the inner temple it was now fashionable for every young man of fortune before he began his travels or was admitted into parliament to be initiated in the study of the law but instead of pursuing a science which could not be his profession and which was unaccommodated to the bias of his genius he betrayed his predilection to a more pleasing species of literature by composing the tragedy just mentioned for the entertainment and honor of his fellowstudents his high birth however and ample patrimony soon advanced him to more important situations and employments his eminent accomplishments and abilities having acquired the confidence and esteem of queen elisabeth the poet was soon lost in the statesman and negotiations and embassies extinguished the milder ambitions of the ingenuous muse yet it should be remembered that he was uncorrupted amidst the intrigues of an artful court that in the character of a first minister he preserved the integrity of a private man and that his family refused the offer of an apology to his memory when it was insulted by the malicious insinuations of a rival party nor is it foreign to our purpose to remark that his original elegance and brilliancy of mind sometimes broke forth in the exercise of his more formal political functions he was frequently disgusted at the pedantry and official barbarity of style with which the public letters and instruments were usually framed and naunton relates that his secretaries had difficulty to please him he was so facete and choice in his style fragm regal p  0  even in the decisions and pleadings of that rigid tribunal the star chamber which was never esteemed the school of rhetoric he practiced and encouraged an unaccustomed strain of eloquent and graceful oratory on which account says lloyd so flowing was his invention that he was called the star chamber bell lloyd wothis p      after he was made a peer by the title of lord buckhurst and had succeeded to a most extensive inheritance and was now discharging the business of an envoy to paris he found time to prefix a latin epistle to clerkes latin translation of castilios courtier printed at london in      which is not an unworthy recommendation of a treatise remarkable for its polite latinity it was either because his mistress elisabeth paid a sincere compliment to his singular learning and fidelity or because she was willing to indulge an affected fit of indignation against the object of her capricious passion that when sackville in      was a candidate for the chancellorship of the university of oxford she condescended earnestly to solicit the university in his favor and in opposition to his competitor the earl of essex at least she appears to have approved the choice for her majesty soon afterward visited oxford where she was entertained by the new chancellor with splendid banquets and much solid erudition it is neither my design nor my province to develope the profound policy with which he conducted a peace with spain the address with which he penetrated or baffled the machinations of essex and the circumspection and success with which he managed the treasury of two opulent sovereigns i return to sackville as a poet and to the history of the mirror of magistrates many of his ltter are in the caala and in the university register at oxford mar         see his letter about the habits see also howard coll p       about the year      he formed the plan of a poem in which all the illustrious but unfortunate characters of the english history from the conquest to the end of the fourteenth century were to pass in review before the poet who descends like dante into the infernal region and is conducted by sorrow although a descent into hell had been suggested by other poets the application of such a fiction to the present design is a conspicuous proof of genius and even of invention every personage was to recite his own misfortunes in a separate soliloquy but sackville had leisure only to finish a poetical preface called an induction and one legend which is the life of henry stafford duke of buckingham relinquishing therefore the design abruptly and hastily adapting the close of his induction to the appearance of buckingham the only story he had yet written and which was to have been the last in his series he recommended the completion of the whole to richard baldwyne and george ferrers  baldwyne seems to have been graduated at oxford about the year      he was an ecclesiastic and engaged in the education of youth i have already mentioned his metrical

queen elisabeth  and dedicated then to your honors with this preface since which time although i have been called to another trade of life yet my good lord stafford has not ceased to call upon me to publyshe so much as i had gotten at other mens hands so that through his lordshyppes earnest means i have now also set forth another part containing as little of mine own as the first part does of other mens signat c ii   the plan was confessedly borrowed from boccaces de casibus principum a book translated as we have seen by lydgate but which never was popular because it had no english examples but baldwynes scope and conduct with respect to this and other circumstances will best appear from his preface which cannot easily be found and which i shall therefore insert at large when the printer had purposed with himself to printe lydgates book of the fall of princes and had made pryvye thereto many both honorable and worshipful he was counsayled by dyvers of them to procure to have the story contynewed from where as bochas left unto this present time chiefly of such as fortune had dalyed with in this ylande  which advyse lyked him so well that he required me to take pains therein but because it was a matter passing my wit and skyll and more thankles than gaineful to meddle in i refused utterly to undertake it except i might have the help of such as in wit were apt in learning allowed and in judgment and estymacyon able to wield and furnysh so weighty an enterprise thinkyng even so to shift my hands but he earnest and diligent in his affairs procured atlas to set under his shoulder for shortly after diverse learned men whose many gifts need few praises consented to take upon them part of the travayle and when certain of them to the number of seven were through a general assent at an appointed time and place gathered together to devyse thereupon i resorted unto them bearing the book of bochas translated by dan lidgate for the better observation of his order which although we liked well yet would it not cumly serve seeing that both bochas and lidgate were dead neither were there any alive that meddled with like argument to whom the unfortunate might make make their moan to make therefore a state mete for the matter they all agreed that i should usurp bochas rowme and the wretched princes complain unto me and take upon themselves every man for his part to be sundry personages and in their behalfes to bewail unto me their greevous chances heavye destinies and woeful misfortunes this done we opened such books of cronicles as we had there present and master ferrers after he had found where bochas left which was about the end of king edward the thirdes reign to begin the matter said thus  i marvayle what bochas means to forget among his miserable princes such as were of our nation whose number is as great as their adventures wunderfull for to let pass all both britons danes and saxons and to come to the last conquest what a sort are they how many they are lude crew  and some even in his boccaces own time as for example king richard the first slain with a quarle qarll the bol of a crosbow in his chyefe prosperity also king john his brother as sum say poisoned are not their histories rufull and of rare example but as it should appear he being an italian minded most the roman and italike story or else perhaps he wanted our country cronicles it were therefore a goodly and a notable matter to search and discourse our whole story from the first beginning of the inhabiting of the isle but seeing the printers mind is to have us follow where lidgate left we will leave that great labor to other that may intend it and as blind bayard is always boldest i will begin at the time of rychard the second a time as unfortunate as the ruler therein and forasmuch friend baldwyne as it shall be your charge to note and pen orderlye the whole process i will so far as my memory and judgment serves sumwhat further you in the truth of the storye and therefore omitting the ruffle of jacke straw and his meyney mu  and the murder of many notable men which thereby happened for jacke as ye know was but a poor prince i will begin with a notable example which within a while after ensued and although he be no great prince yet since he had a princely office i will take upon me the miserable person of sir robert tresilian chyefe justyce of england and of other which suffered with him thereby to warn all of his authority and profession to take heed of wrong judgments misconstruynge of laws or wresting the same to serve the princes turns which ryghtfully brought them to a miserable end which they may justly lament in manner ensuing sinat a ii  then follows sir robert tresilians legend or history supposed to be spoken by himself and addressed to baldwyne  here we see that a company was feigned to be assembled each of which one excepted by turns personates a character of one of the great unfortunate and that the stories were all connected by being related to the silent person of the assembly who is like the chorus in the greek tragedies or the host in chaucers canterbury tales the whole was to form a sort of dramatic interlude including a series of independent soliloquies a continuity to this imagined representation is preserved by the introduction after every soliloquy of a prose epilogue which also serves as a prologue to the succeeding piece and has the air of a stagedirection boccace had done this before we have this interposition which i give as a specimen and which explains the method of the recital between the tragedies of king richard the second and owen glendour when he had ended this so woeful a tragedye and to all princes a right worthy instruction we paused having passed through a miserable time full of pyteous tragedyes and seeing the reygne of henry the fourth ensued a man more ware and prosperous in his doings although not untroubled with wars both of outforthe and inward enemies we began to search what pyers peers were fallen therein whereof the number was not small and yet because their examples were not much to be noted for our purpose we passed over all the maskers of whom king rychardes brother was chief which were all slain and put to death for their traiterous attempt and finding owen glendoure next one of fortunes own whelps and the percyes his confederates i thought them unmete to be overpassed and therefore said thus to the sylent cumpany what my masters is every one at once in a brown study and has no man affection to any of these stories you mind so much some other belyke that those do not move you and to say the troth there is no special cause why they should howbeyt owen glendoure because he was one of fortunes darlings rather than he should be forgotten i will tell his tale for him under the privelidge of martine hundred which owen cuming out of the wild mountains like the image of death in all points his darte only excepted so sore has famyne and hunger consumed him may lament his folly after this manner this process was a departure from sackvilles idea who supposes as i have hinted the scene laid in hell and that the unfortunate princes appeared to him in succession and uttered their respective complaints at the gates of elysium under the guidance of sorrow  many stanzas in the legends written by baldwyne that is baldwyne had previously prepared and written his lgend or monologue and one of the company was to act his part and assume this appearance fol xviii b and ferrers and their friends have considerable merit and often show a command of language and versification these lines in collingbournes legend are remarkable fol cxliiii a like pegasus a poet must have wings to slye to heaven or where him likes best he must have knowledge of eternal things almighti jove must harbor in his breast   but their performances have not the pathos which the subject so naturally suggests they give us yet often with no common degree of elegance and perspicuity the chronicles of hall and fabyan in verse i shall therefore in examining this part of the mirror of magistrates confine my criticism to sackvilles induction and legend of buckingham  sect xxxi sackvilles induction which was to have been placed at the head of our english tragical story and which loses much of its dignity and propriety by being prefixed to a single life and that of no great historical importance is opened with the following poetical landscape of winter see fol cxvi   the wrathful winter prochinge on apace with blustering blasts had all ybard the treene and old saturnus with his frosty face with chilling cold had pearst the tender green the mantels rent wherein enwrapped been the gladsom groves that now lay overthrowen the tapets torn and every bloom down blown the soil that erst so seemly was to seen was all despoyled of her beautys hew and soote fresh flowers wherewith the summers queen had clad the earth now boreas blastes down blewe and small fowls flocking in their song did rewe the winters wrath wherewith each thing defaste in woeful wise bewayld the summer paste hawthorne had lost his motley lyverye the naked twigges were shivering all for cold and droppinge down the tears abundantly each thing methought with weping ye me told the cruel season bidding me witholde myself within for i was gotten out into the feldes where as i walked about when lo the night with mistie mantels spread began dark the day and dim the azure skies etc the altered scene of things the flowers and verdure of summer deformed by the frosts and storms of winter and the day suddenly overspread with darkness remind the poet of the uncertainties of human life the transient state of honor and the instability of prosperity  and sorrowing i to see the summer flowers the lively green the lusty leas forlorn the sturdy trees so shattred with the showers the fields so fade that floorisht so beforne it taught we well all earthly things be borne to dye the death for naught long time may last if sommors beauty yields to winters blast then looking upwards to the heavens beams with nights stars thickpowdred every where which erst so glistened with the golden streams that cheerful phoebus spread down from his sphere beholding dark oppressing day so near the sudden sight reduced to my mind the sundry chaunges that in earth we find immediately the figure of sorrow suddenly appears which shows the poet in a new and bolder mode of composition  and strayt forth stalking with redoubled pace for that i saw the night drew on so fast in black all clad there fell before my face a piteous wight whom woe had all forwast forth from her iyen the crystal tears outbrast and syghing sore her haunds she wrong and fold tare al her hair that ruth was to behold her body small forwithered and forespent as is the stalk that summers drought oppressed her wealked face with woeful tears besprent her color pale and as it seemed her best in woe and playnt reposed was her rest and as the stone that drops of water wears so dented were her cheeks with fall of tears  i stood aghast beholding all her plight tween dread and dolor so distreynd in heart that while my hears upstarted with the sight the tears outstreamde for sorrow of her smatt but when i saw no end that could aparte the deadly dole which she so sore did make with doleful voice then thus to her i spoke unwrap thy woes whatever wight thou be and stint betime to spill thyselfe with playnt tell what thou art and whence for well i see thou can not dure with sorrow thus attaynt and with that word of sorrow all forfaynt she looked up and prostrate as she lay with piteous sound lo thus she began to say alas i wretch whom thu thou eest distrayned with wasting woes that never shall aslake sorrow i am in endeles torments payned among the furies in the infernal lake where pluto god of hell so grisly blake does hold his throne and lethes deadly taste does reive remembrance of che thing forepast whence come i am the drery destiny and luckles lot for to bemone of those whom fortune in this maze of misery of wretched chance most woeful myrrours chose that when thou eet how lightly they did lose their pomp their power and that they thought most sure thou may soon deem no earthlye joye may dure sorrow then conducts the poet to the classical hell to the place of torments and the place of happiness  i shall thee guide first to the griesly lake and thence unto the blissfull place of rest where thou shall see and hear the playnt they make that whilom here bare swinge sway among the best this shall thou see but great is the unrest that thou must bide before thou can attain unto the dreadful place where those remain and with these words as i upraysed stood and began to follow her that straight forth paste ere i was ware into a desert wood we now were come where hand in hand embraced she led the way and through the thick so traced as but i had been guyded by her might it was no way for any mortal wight but lo while thus amid the desert dark we passed on with steps and pace unmeete a rumbling roar confusde with howl and bark of dogs shook all the ground under our feet and struck the din within our ears so deep as half distraught unto the ground i fell besought return and not to visit hell  an hydeous hole al vast withouten shape of endless depth orewhelmde with ragged stone with oughly mouth and griesly jaws does gape and to our sight confounds itself in one here entered we and yeding going forth anon an horrible lothly lake we might discern as black as pitche that cleped called is averne a deadly gulf where naught but rubbish grows with foul blake swelth in thickened lumpes that lies which upp in the air such stinking vapor throws that over there may fly no foul but dies choakt with the noysom vapors that arise hither we come whence forth we still did pace in dreadful fear amid the dreadful place our author appears to have felt and to have conceived with true taste that very romantic part of virgils eneid which he has here happily copied and heightened the imaginary beings which sat within the porch of hell are all his own i must not omit a single figure of this dreadful groupe nor one compartment of the portraitures which are feigned to be sculptured or painted on the shield of war indented with gashes deep and wide  and first within the porch and jaws of hell sat deep remorse of conscience all besprent with tears and to herself often would she tell her wretchedness and cursing never stent to sob and sigh but ever thus lament with thoughtful care as she that all in vain would wear and waste continually in pain her eyes unstedfast rolling here and there whirled on each place as place that vengeance brought so was her mind continually in fear tossed and tormented with the tedious thought of those detested crimes which she had wrought with dreadful cheer and looks thrown to the sky wishing for death and yet she could not die next saw we dread all trembling how he shook with foot uncertain proferd here and there benumbed with speech and with a ghastly look searched every place all pale and dead for fear his cap born up with with staring of his hair stoind and amazed at his own shade for dread and fearing greater dangers than was need and next within the entry of this lake sat fell revenge gnashing her teeth for ire devising means how she may vengeance take never in rest till she have her desire but frets within so far forth with the fire of wreaking flames that now determines she to die by death or vengd by death to be when fell revenge with bloody foul pretense had showed herself as next in order set with trembling limbs we softly parted thence till in our eyes another sight we met when fro my heart a sigh forthwith i fet ruing alas upon the woeful plight of misery that next appeared in sight his face was lean and somedeal pined away and eke his hands consumed to the bone but what his body was i cannot say for on his carcass raiment had he none save clouts and patches pieced one by one with staff in hand and scrip on shoulders cast his chief defense against the winters blast his food for most was wild fruits of the tree unless sometime some crumbs fell to his share which in his wallet long god wot kept he as on the which full daintly would he fare his drink the running stream his cup the bare of his palm closed his bed the hard cold ground to this poor life was misery ybound whose wretched state when we had well beheld with tender ruth on him and on his feers in thoughtful cares forth then our pace we held and by and by another shape appears of greedy care still brushing up the breers his knuckles knobd his flesh deep dinted in with tawed hands and hard ytanned skin the morrow gray no sooner has begun to spread his light even peeping in our eyes but he is up and to his work yrun but let the nights black misty mantles rise and with foul dark never so much disguise the fair bright day yet cease he no while but has his candles to prolong his toil by him lay heavy sleep the cousin of death flat on the ground and still as any stone a very corpse save yielding forth a breath small keep took he whom fortune frowned on or whom she lifted up into the throne of high renown but as a living death so dead alive of life he drew the breath the bodys rest the quiet of the heart the travels ease the still nights feer was he and of our life in earth the better part rever of sight and yet in whom we see things often that chance and often that never be without respect esteemed equally king croesus pomp and irus poverty and next in order sad old age we found his beard all hoar his eyes hollow and blind with drooping cheer still poring on the ground as on the place where nature him assigned to rest when that the sisters had untwind his vital thad and ended with their knife the fleeting course of fastdeclining life there heard we him with broken and hollow plaint rue with himself his end approaching fast and all for naught his wretched mind torment with sweet remembrance of his pleasures past and fresh delights of lusty youth forewaste recounting which how would he sob and shriek and to be young again of jove beseek but an the cruel fates so fixed be that time forepast cannot return again this one request of jove yet prayed he  that in such withered plight and wretched pain as eld accompanied with her loathsome train had brought on him all were it woe and grief he might a while yet linger forth his lief and not so soon descend into the pit where death when he the mortal corpse has slain with rechless hand in grave does cover it thereafter never to enjoy again the gladsome light but in the ground ylain in depth of darkness waste and wear to naught as he had never into the world been brought but who had seen him sobbing how he stood unto himself and how he would bemoan his youth forepast  as though it wrought him good to talk of youth all were his youth foregone  he would have mused and marveld much whereon this wretched age should life desire so fain and knows full well life does but length his pain crookbackd he was toothshaken and bleareyed went on three feet and sometimes crept on four with old lame bones that rattled by his side his scalp all pild and he with eld forelore his withered fist still knocking at deaths door fumbling and driveling as he draws his bread for brief the shape and messenger of death and fast by him pale malady was placed sore sick in bed her color all foregone bereft of stomach savor and of taste ne could she brook no meat but broths alone her breath corrupt her keepers every one abhorring her her sickness past recure detesting physic and all physicks cure but o the doleful sight that then we see we turned our look and on the other side a grisly shape of famine might we see with greedy looks and gaping mouth that cried and roared for meat as she should there have died her body thin and bare as any bone whereto was left naught but the case alone and that alas was gnawn on every where all full of holes that i ne might refrain from tears to see how she her arms could tear and with her teeth gnash on the bones in vain when all for naught she fain would so sustain her starven corpse that rather seemed a shade than any substance of a creature made

no law gnawing alas her carcass all in vain where you may count each sinew bone and vein on her while we thus firmly fixed our eyes that bled for ruth of such a dreary sight lo suddenly she shright in so huge wise as made hell gates to shiver with the might wherewith a dart we saw how it did light right on her breast and therewithal pale death enthrilling it to reve her of her beath and by and by a dumb dead corpse we saw heavy and cold the shape of death aright that daunts all earthly creatures to his law against whose force in vain it is to fight ne peers ne princes nor no mortal wight no towns ne realms cities ne strongest tower but all perorce must yield unto his power his dart anon out of the corpse he took and in his hand a dreadful sight to see with great triumph tsoons the same he shook that most of all my fears affrayed me his body dight with naught but bones pardy the naked shape of man there saw i plain all save the flesh the sinew and the vein lastly stood war in glittering arms yclad with visage grim stern looked and blackly hued in his right hand a naked sword he had that to the hilts was all with blood imbrued and in his left that kings and kingdoms rued famine and fire he held and therewithal he razed towns and threw down towers and all cities he sacked and realms that whilom flowered in honor glory and rule above the rest he overwhelmed and all their fame devoured consumed destroyed wasted and never casd till he their wealth their name and all oppressed his face forehewd with wounds and by his side there hung his targe with gashes deep and wide in mids of which depainted there we found deadly debate all full of snaky hair that with a bloody fillet was ybound outbreathing naught but discord every where and round about were portrayed here

since in this world i think was never wight could have set forth the half not half so fine i can no more but tell how there is seen fair ilium fall in burning red gledes down and from the soil great troy neptunus town these shadowy inhabitants of hellgate are conceived with the vigor of a creative imagination and described with great force of expression they are delineated with that fullness of proportion that invention of picturesqu tributes distinctness animation and amplitde of which spenser is commonly supposed to have given the first specimens in our language and which are characteristical of his poetry we may venture to pronounce that spenser at least caught his manner of designing allegorical personages from this model which so greatly enlarged the former narrow bounds of our ideal imagery as that it may justly be deemed an original in that style of painting for we must not forget that it is to this induction that spenser alludes in a sonnet prefixed to his pastorals in      addressed to the right honorable the lord of buckhurst one of her majestys privy council  in vain i think right honorable lord by this rude rhyme to memorize thy name whose learned muse has writ her own record in golden verse worthy immortal fame thou much more fit were leisure for the same thy gracious sovereigns praises to compile and her imperial mjestie to frame in lofty numbers and heroic style the readers of the faerie queen will easily point out many particular passages which sackvilles induction suggested to spenser  from this scene sorrow who is well known to charon and to cerberus the hideous hound of hell leads the poet over the loathsome lake of rude acheron to the dominions of pluto which are described in numbers too beautiful to have been relished by his cotemporaries or equalled by his successors  thence come we to the horror and the hell the large great kingdoms and the dreadful raygne of pluto in his trone where he did dwell the wide waste places and the hugie plain the waylinges shrykes and sundry sorts of pain the syghes the sobbes the deep and deadly groan earth air and all resounding playnt and moan the two next stanzas ar not in the first edition of      but instead of the the following stanza here pulled the babes and here the maids unwed with folded hands their sorry chance bewayld here wept the guiltles slain and lovers dead that slew themselves when nothing else avayld a thousand sorts of sorrows here that wayld with sighs and tears sobs shricks and all yfere that o alas it was a hell to here etc   thence did we pass the threefold emperie to the utmost bounds where rhadamanthus reigns where proud folk wail their woeful misery where dreadful din of thousand dragging chains and baleful shrikes of ghosts in deadly pains torturd eternally are heard most brim breme i  curel  through silent shades of night so dark and dim from hence upon our way we forward pass and through the groves and uncoth paths we go which lead unto the cyclops walls of brass and where that main broad flood for aye does floe which parts the gladsome fields from place of woe whence none shall ever pass to elysium plain or from elysium ever turn again here they are surrounded by a troop of men the most in arms bedight who met an untimely death and of whose destiny whether they were sentenced to eternal night or to blissfull peace it was uncertain  lo here quoth sorrow princes of renown that whilom sat on top of fortunes wheel now laid full low like wretches whurled down even with one frown that staid but with a smile etc they pass in order before sorrow and the poet the first is henry duke of buckingham a principal instrument of king richard the third  then first came henry duke of buckingham his cloak of black all

that all his breast beraynde on cruel fortune weping thus he playnde nothing more fully illustrates and ascertains the respective merits and genius of different poets than a juxtaposition of their performances on similar subjects having examined at large sackvilles descent into hell for the sake of throwing a still stronger light on his manner of treating a fiction which gives so large a scope to fancy i shall employ the remainder of this section in setting before my reader a general view of dantes italian poem entitled commedia containing a description of hell paradise and purgatory and written about the year    0 in the mean time i presume that most of my readers will recollect and apply the sixth book of virgil to which however it may be necessary to refer occasionally  although i have before insinuated that dante has in this poem used the ghost of virgil for a mystagogue in imitation of tully who in the somnium scipionis supposes scipio to have shown the other world to his ancestor africanus yet at the same time in the invention of his introduction he seems to have had an eye on the exordium of an old forgotten florentine poem called tesoretto written in frottola or a short irregular measure exhibiting a cyclopede of theoretic and practic philosophy and composed by his preceptor brunetto latini about the year    0 see supr vol ii      brunetto supposes himself lost in a wood at the foot of a mountain covered with animals flowers plants and fruits of every species and subject to the supreme command of a wonderful lady whom he thus describes her head touched the heavens which served at once for a veil and an ornament the sky grew dark or serene at her voice and her arms extended to the extremities of the earth see supr vol ii      this bold personification one of the earliest of the rude ages of poetry is nature she converses with the poet and describes the creation of the world she enters upon a most unphilosophical and indeed unpoetical detail of the physical system developes the head of man and points out the seat of intelligence and of memory from physics she proceeds to morals but her principles are here confined to theology and the laws of the church which she couches in technical rhymes brunettos tesoretto was abstracted by himself from his larger prose work on the same subject written in old french and never printed entitled tesoro see supr vol ii         and hist acad inscript tom vii     seq the tesoro was afterward translated into italian by one bono giamboni and printed at trevisa viz il tsoro di messer brunetto latino fiorentino precettore del divino poeta dante nel qual si tratta di tutte le cose che a mortali se appartengeno in trivisa      fol after a table of chapters is another title qui inchomincia el tesoro di s brunetto latino di firenze e parla del nascimento e della natura di tutte le cose it was printed again at venice by marchio sessa      octavo mabillon seems to have confounded this italian translation with the french original it italic p     see also salviat avertis decam ii xii dante intoduces brunetto in the fifteenth cano of the inferno and after the colophon of the first edition of the italian tesoro abovementioned is this insertion risposta di dante a brunetto latino ritrovado da lui nel quintodecimo canto nel suo inferno the tesoretto or little treasure mentioned above in the text has been printed but is exceedingly scarce   dante like his master brunetto is bewildered in an unfrequented forest he attempts to climb a mountain whose summit is illuminated by the rising sun a furious leopard pressed by hunger and a lion at whose aspect the air is affrighted accompanied by a shewolf oppose his progress and force him to fly precipitately into the profundities of a pathless valley where says the poet the sun was silent  mi ripingeva dovel sol tace inf cant i the same bold metaphor occurs below cant v evenni in luogo dogni luce muto   in the middle of a vast solitude he perceives a spectre of whom he implores pity and help the spectre hastens to his cries it was the shade of virgil whom beatrix dantes mistress had sent to give him courage and to guide him into the regions of hell see supr vol ii p      virgil begins a long discourse with dante and expostulates with him for choosing to wander through the rough obscurities of a barren and dreary vale when the top of the neighboring mountain afforded every delight the conversation of virgil and the name of beatrix by degrees dissipate the fears of the poet who explains his situation he returns to himself and compares this revival of his strength and spirits to a flower smitten by the frost of a night which again lifts its shrinking head and expands its vivid colors at the first gleamings of the morningsun  qual il fioretti dal notturno gelo chinati et chiusi etc cant ii in another part of the inferno virgil is angry with dante but is soon reconciled hre the poet compares himself to a cottager in the early part of a promising spring who looks out in the morning from his humble shed and see the fields covered with a severe and unexpected frost but the sun soon melts the ground and he drives his goats aield cant xxiv this poem abound in comparisons not one of the worst is a comic one in which a person looking sharply and eagerly is compared to an old tailor threading a needle inp cant xv   dante under the conduct of virgil penetrates hell but he does not on this occasion always avail himself of virgils descriptions and mythologies at least the formation of dantes imageries are of another school he feigns his hell to be a prodigious and almost bottomless abyss which from its aperture to its lowest depth preserves a rotund shape or rather an immense perpendicular cavern which opening as it descends into different circles forms so many distinct subterraneous regions we are struck with horror at the commencement of this dreadful adventure  the first object which the poet perceives is a gate of brass over which were inscribed in characters of a dark hue di color oscuro these verses  per me si va nella citta dolente per me si va nel eterno dolor per me si va tra la perduta gente giustizia mossel mio alto fattore fece me li divina potestate la somma sapienzia e lprimo amore he means the platonic  the italian expositors will have it to be the holy ghost  dinanzi a me non fur cose create se non eterne el io duro eterno lassate ogni speranza voi chentraste cant iii  that is by me is the way to the woeful city by me is the way to the eternal pains by me is the way to the damned race my mighty maker was divine justice and power the supreme wisdom and the first love before me nothing was created if not eternal i shall eternally remain put away all hope ye that enter  there is a severe solemnity in these abrupt and comprehensive sentences and they are a striking preparation to the scenes that ensue but the idea of such an inscription on the brazen portal of hell was suggested to dante by books of chivalry in which the gate of an impregnable enchanted castle is often inscribed with words importing the dangers or wonders to be found within over the door of every chamber in spensers necromantic palace of busyrane was written a threat to the champions who presumed to attempt to enter fair qu iii xi     this total exclusion of hope from hell here so finely introduced and so forcibly expressed was probably remembered by milton a disciple of dante where he describes  regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell hope never comes that comes to all par l i      i have not time to follow dante regularly through his dialogues and adventures with the crowds of ghosts ancient and modern which he meets in the course of this infernal journey in these interviews there is often much of the party and politics of his own times and of allusion to recent facts nor have i leisure particularly to display our authors punishments and phantoms i observe in general that the groundwork of his hell is classical yet with many gothic and extravagant innovations the burning lakes the fosses and fiery towers which surround the city of dis and the three furies which wait at its entrance are touched with new strokes see cant ix vii  the gorgons the hydra the chimera cerberus the serpent of lerna and the rest of virgils or rather homers infernal apparitions are dilated with new touches of the terrible and sometimes made ridiculous by the addition of comic or incongruous circumstances yet without any intention of burlesque because virgil had mentioned the harpies in a single word only gorgones harpyiaeque vi      in one of the loathsome groves which dante passes consisting of trees whose leaves are black and whose knotted boughs are hard as iron the harpies build their nests cant xiii   non frondi verdi ma di color fosco non rami schietti ma nodosi envolti non pomi veran ma stecchi con tosco cacus whom virgil had called semifer in his seventh book appears in the shape of a centaur covered with curling snakes and on whose neck is perched a dragon hovering with expanded wings cant xxv  it is supposed that dante took the idea of his inferno from a magnificent nightly representation of hell exhibited by the pope in honor of the bishop of ostia on the river arno at florence in the year   0  this is mentioned by the italian critics in extenuation of dantes choice of so strange a subject but why should we attempt to excuse any absurdity in the writings or manners of the middle ages dante chose this subject as a reader of virgil and homer the religious mystery represented on the river arno however magnificent was perhaps a spectacle purely orthodox and perfectly conformable to the ideas of the church and if we allow that it might hint the subject with all its inconsistencies it never could have furnished any considerable part of this wonderful compound of classical and romantic fancy of pagan and christian theology of real and fictitious history of tragical and comic incidents of familiar and heroic manners and of satirical and sublime poetry but the grossest improprieties of this poem discover an originality of invention and its absurdities often border on sublimity we are surprised that a poet should write one hundred cantos on hell paradise and purgatory but this prolixity is partly owing to the want of art and method and is common to all early compositions in which every thing is related circumstantially and without rejection and not in those general terms which are used by modern writers  dante has beautifully enlarged virgils short comparison of the souls lingering on the banks of lethe to the numerous leaves falling from the trees in autumn  come dautumno si levan le foglie lun appresso delaltra infin chel ramo vede a la terre tutte le sue spoglie similmente il mal seem dadamo getta si di quel lito ad una ad una per cenni comaugel per suo richiamo cant iii  in the fields inhabited by unhappy lovers he sees semiramis achilles paris and tristan or sir tristram one of the old italian commentators on this poem says that the last was an english knight born in cornovaglio or cornwall a city of england in the sixteenth canto of the paradiso king arthurs queen geneura who belongs to ir tristrams romance is mentioned   among many others of his friends he sees francisca the daughter of guido di polenta in whose palace dante died at ravenna and paulo one of the sons of malatesta lord of rimini this lady fell in love with paulo the passion was mutual and she was betrothed to him in marriage but her family chose rather that she should be married to lanciotto paulos eldest brother this match had the most fatal consequences the injured lovers could not dissemble or stifle their affection they were surprised and both assassinated by lanciotto dante finds the shades of these distinguished victims of an unfortunate attachment at a distance from the rest in a region of his inferno desolated by the most violent tempests he accosts them both and francisca relates their history yet the conversation is carried on with some difficulty on account of the impetuosity of the storm which was perpetually raging dante who from many circumstances of his own amors appears to have possessed the most refined sensibilities about the delicacies of love enquires in what manner when in the other world they first communicated their passion to each other francisca answers that they were one day sitting together and reading the romance of lancelot where two lovers were represented in the same critical situation with themselves their changes of color and countenance while they were reading often tacitly betrayed their yet undiscovered feelings when they came to that passage in the romance where the lovers after many tender approaches are gradually drawn by one uniform reciprocation of involuntary attraction to kiss each other the book dropped from their hands by a sudden impulse and an irresistible sympathy they are tempted to do the same here was the commencement of their tragical history  noi leggiavam un giorno per diletto di lancilotto comme amor le strinse soli eravamo et senza alcun sospetto per piu fiae gli occhi ci sospinse quella lettura et scolorocc il viso ma sol un punto fu qual che ci vinse quando legemmo il disiato riso esser baciato da cotanto amante questi che may da me no fia diviso la bocca mi bascio tutto tremante galeotto he is one of the knights of the round table and is commonly called sir galhaad in arthurs romance fu il libro et chi lo scrisse quel giorno piu non vi legemmo avante cant v  but this picture in which nature sentiment and the graces are concerned i have to contrast with scenes of a very different nature salvator rosa has here borrowed the pencil correggio dantes beauties are not of the soft and gentle kind   through many a dark and dreary vale they passed and many a region dolorous over many a frozen many a fiery alp milton par l ii      a hurricane suddenly rising on the banks of the river styx is thus described  et gia venia su per le torbid onde un fracasso dun suon pien di spavento per cui tremavan amendue le sponde non altrimenti fatto che dun vento impetuoso per gli avversi ardori che fire la salva senz alcun rattento gli rami schianta i abatte et porta i fiori dinanzi polveroso va superbo et fa fuggir le fiere et glipastori cant ix  dante and his mystagogue meet the monster geryon he has the face of a man with a mild and benign aspect but his human form ends in a serpent with a voluminous tail of immense length terminated by a sting which he brandishes like a scorpion his hands are rough with bristles and scales his breast back and sides have all the rich colors displayed in the textures of tartary and turkey or in the labors of arachne to speak in spensers language he is  a dragon horrible and bright fair qu i ix     no monster of romance is more savage or superb  lo dosso el petto ad amenduo le cost dipinte avea di nodi e di rotelle con piu color sommesse e soppraposte non fur man in drappo tartari ne turchi ne fur tar tale per aragne imposte cant xvii dante says that he ay on the banks of a river like a beaver the castor but this foolish comparison is affectedly introduced by our author for a display of his natural knowledge from pliny or rather from the tesoro of his mster brunetto  the conformation of this heterogeneous beast as a fabulous hell is the subject perhaps immediately gave rise to one of the formidable shapes which sat on either side of the gates of hell in milton although the fiction is founded in the claics  the one seemed woman to the waste and fair but ended foul in many a scaly fold voluminous and vast a serpent armed with mortal sting par l ii       virgil seeming to acknowledge him as an old acquaintance mounts the back of geryon at the same time dante mounts whom virgil places before that you may not says he be exposed to the monsters venomous sting virgil then commands geryon not to move too rapidly for consider what a new burden you carry   gerion muoviti omai le ruote large e lo scender sia poco pensa la nuova soma che tu hai cant xvii  in this manner they travel in the air through tartarus and from the back of the monster geryon dante looks down on the burning lake of phlegethon this imagery is at once great and ridiculous but much later italian poets have fallen into the same strange mixture in this horrid situation says dante  i sentia gia dalla man destra il gorgo far sotto noi un orribile stroscio perch con gli occhi in giu la testa sporsi allor fu io piu timido allo scoscio perioch i vidi fuochi e sent pianti oud io tremando tutto mi rancosco ibid  this airy journey is copied from the flight of icarus and phaeton and at length produced the ippogrifo of ariosto nor is it quite improbable that milton although he has greatly improved and dignified the idea might have caught from hence his fiction of satan soaring over the infernal abyss at length geryon having circuited the air like a faulcon towering without prey deposits his burden and vanishes in the thirtyfourth canto dante and virgil return to light on the back of lucifer who like miltons satan ii     is described as having wings like sails vele di mar non vid io may est celi and again  quando lale uro aperte assai this canto begins with a latin line vexilla regis prodeunt inferni    while they are wandering along the banks of phlegethon as the twilight of evening approaches dante suddenly hears the sound of a horn more loud than thunder or the horn of orlando or roland the subject of archbishop turpins romance see supr vol i       ma io senti sonare alto corno  non sono si terribilimente orlando cant xxxi  dante descries through the gloom what he thinks to be many high and vast towers molte alti torri these are the giants who warred against heaven standing in a row half concealed within and half extant without an immense abyss or pit  gli orribili giganti cui minaccia giove del cielo ancora quando tuona ibid  but virgil informs dante that he is deceived by appearances and that these are not towers but the giants  sappi che non son torri ma giganti e son nel pezzo intorno della ripa dall umbilico in guiso tutti quanti ibid  one of them cries out to dante with horrible voice another ephialtes is clothed in iron and bound with huge chains dante wishes to see briareus he is answered that he lies in an interior cavern biting his chain immediately ephialtes arose from another cavern and shook himself like an earthquake  non fu tremuoto gia tanto rubesto che schotesse una torri cosi forte come fialte a scuotersi fu presto ibid  dante views the horn which had sounded so vehemently hanging by a leathern thong from the neck of one of the giants antaeus whose body stands ten else high from the pit is commanded by virgil to advance they both mount on his shoulders and are thus carried about cocytus the giant says the poet moved off with us like the mast of a ship dante says if i understand the passage right that the face of one of the giants resembled the cupola shaped like a pineapple of saint peters church at rome ibid cant xxxi come la pina di san pietro a roma   one cannot help observing what has been indeed already hinted how judiciously milton in a similar argument has retained the just beauties and avoided the childish or ldicrous excesses of these bold inventions at the same time we may remark how dante has sometimes heightened and sometimes diminished by improper additions or misrepresentations the legitimate descriptions of virgil  one of the torments of the damned in dantes inferno is the punishment of being eternally confined in lakes of ice  eran lombre dolenti nell ghiaccia mettendo i denti in nota di cicogna cant xxxii  the ice is described to be like that of the danube or tanais this species of infernal torment which is neither directly warranted by scripture nor suggested in the systems of the platonic fabulists and which has been adopted both by shakespeare and milton has its origin in the legendary hell of the monks the hint seems to have been taken from an obscure text in the book of job dilated by saint jerome and the early commentators job xxiv     the torments of hell in which the punishment by cold is painted at large had formed a visionary romance under the name of saint patricks purgatory or cave long before dante wrote see supr vol ii     and add emend ibid  the venerable bede who lived in the seventh century has framed a future mansion of existence for departed souls with this mode of torture in the hands of dante it has assumed many fantastic and grotesque circumstances which make us laugh and shudder at the same time  in another department dante represents some of his criminals rolling themselves in human ordure if his subject led him to such a description he might at least have used decent expressions but his diction is not here less sordid than his imagery i am almost afraid to transcribe this gross passage even in the disguise of the old tuscan phraseology   quindi giu nel foso vidi gente attuffata in uno sterco che dagli uman privati para mosso et mentre che laggiu con locchio cerco vidi un col capo si da merda lordo che non parea sera laico o cherco cant xviii  the humor of the last line does not make amends for the nastiness of the image  it is not to be supposed that a man of strong sense and genius whose understanding had been cultivated by a most exact education and who had passed his life in the courts of sovereign princes would have indulged himself in these disgusting fooleries had he been at all apprehensive that his readers would have been disgusted but rude and early poets descib every thing they follow the public manners and if they are either obscene or indelicate it should be remembered that they wrote before obscenity or indelicacy became offensive  some of the guilty are made objects of contempt by a transformation into beastly or ridiculous shapes this was from the fable of circe in others the human figure is rendered ridiculous by distortion there is one set of criminals whose faces are turned round toward their backs   el piante de gli occhi le natiche bagnava per lo fesso cant xx  but dante has displayed more true poetry in describing a real event than in the best of his fictions this is in the story of ugolino count of pisa the subject of a very capital picture by reynolds the poet wandering through the depths of hell sees two of the damned gnawing the sculls of each other which was their daily food he enquires the meaning of this dreadful repast  la bocca sollevo dal fiero pasto quel peccator forbendola a capelli del capo chegli havea di retro guasto cant xxxiii they are both in the lake of ice  ugolino quitting his companions halfdevoured scull begins his tale to this effect we are ugolin count of pisa and archbishop ruggieri trusting in the perfidious counsels of ruggieri i was brought to a miserable death i was committed with four of my children to the dungeon of hunger the time came when we expected food to be brought instead of which i heard the gates of the horrible tower more closely barred i looked at my children and could not speak   lhora sappressava chel cibo ne soleva essere adotto e per suo sogno ciascun dubitava ed io senti chiavar luscio di sotto a lorribile torre ondio guardai nel viso a miei figliuoli senza far metta i could not complain i was petrified my children cried and my little anselm anselmuccio mio said father you look on us what is the matter  tu guardi si padre che hai i could neither weep nor answer all that day and the following night when the scanty rays of the sun began to glimmer through the dolorous prison comun poco di raggio si fu messo nel doloroso carcere  and i could again see those four countenances on which my own image was stamped i gnawed both my hands for grief my children supposing i did this through a desire to eat lifting themselves suddenly up exclaimed o father our grief would be less if you would eat us ambo le mani per dolor mi morsi e quei pensando chiol fessi per voglia di manicar di subito levorsi et disser padre assai ci fia men doglia se tu mangi di noi  i restrained myself that i might not make them more miserable we were all silent that day and the following ah cruel earth why did thou not swallow us up at once quel di et laltro stemmo tutta muti ahi dura terra perch non lapristi the fourth day being come gaddo falling all along at my feet cried out my father why do not you help me and died the other three expired one after the other between the fifth and sixth days famished as you see me now and i being seized with blindness began to crawl over them sovra ciascuno on hands and feet and for three days after they were dead continued calling them by their names at length famine finished my torments having said this the poet adds with distorted eyes he again fixed his teeth on the mangled scull ibid see supr vol i   0 and essay on pope p      it is not improbable that the shades of unfortunate men who described under peculiar situations and with their proper attributes are introduced relating at large their histories in hell to dante might have given the hint to boccaces book de casibus virorum illustrium on the misfortunes of illustrious personages the original model of the mirror of magistrates  dantes purgatory is not on the whole less fantastic than his hell as his hell was a vast perpendicular cavity in the earth he supposes purgatory to be a cylindric mass elevated to a prodigious height at intervals are recesses projecting from the outside of the cylinder in these recesses some higher and some lower the wicked expiate their crimes according to the proportion of their guilt from one department they pass to another by steps of stone exceedingly steep on the top of the whole or the summit of purgatory is a platform adorned with trees and vegetables of every kind this is the terrestrial paradise which has been transported hither we know not how and which forms an avenue to the paradise celestial it is extraordinary that some of the gothic painters should not have given us this subject  dante describes not disagreeably the first region which he traverses on leaving hell the heavens are tinged with sapphire and the star of love or the sun makes all the orient laugh he sees a venerable sage approach this is cato of utica who astonished to see a living man in the mansion of ghosts questions dante and virgil about the business which brought them hither y purgat cant i virgil answers and cato advises virgil to wash dantes face which was soiled with the smoke of hell and to cover his head with one of the reeds which grew on the borders of the neighboring river virgil takes his advice and having gathered one reed sees another spring up in its place this is the golden bough of the eneid uno avulso non deficit alter the shades also as in virgil crowd to be ferried over styx but an angel performs the office of charon admitting some into the boat and rejecting others this confusion of fable and religion destroys the graces of the one and the majesty of the other  through adventures and scenes more strange and wild than any in the pilgrims progress we at length arrive at the twentyfirst canto a concussion of the earth announces the deliverance of a soul from purgatory this is the soul of statius the favorite poet of the dark ages although a very improper companion for virgil he immediately joins our adventurers and accompanies them in their progress it is difficult to discover what pagan or christian idea regulates dantes dispensation of rewards and punishments statius passes from purgatory to paradise cato remains in the place of expiation and virgil is condemned to eternal torments  dante meets his old acquaintance forese a debauchee of florence on finishing the conversation forese asks dante when he shall have the pleasure of seeing him again this question in purgatory is diverting enough dante answers with much serious gravity i know not the time of death but it cannot be too near look back on the troubles in which my country is involved cant xxiv  the dispute between the pontificate and the empire appears to have been the predominant topic of dantes mind this circumstance has filled dantes poem with strokes of satire every reader of voltaire must remember that lively writers paraphrase from the inferno of the story of count guido in which are these inimitable lines a franciscan friar abandoned to beelzebub thus exclaims   monsieur de lucifer je suis un saint voyes ma robe grise je fus absous par le chef de leglise jaurai toujours repondit le demon un grand respect pour labsolution on est lave de ses vielles sotises pourvu quapres autres ne soient commises jai fait souvent cette distinction a tes pareils et grace a

fouet dont bien fort il me cuit que dieu le rend a boniface huit dante thus translated would have had many more readers than at present i take this opportunity of remarking that our authors perpetual reference to recent facts and characters is in imitation of virgil yet with this very material difference the persons recognized in virgils sixth book for instance the chiefs of the trojan war are the cotemporaries of the hero not of the poet the truth is dantes poem is a satirical history of his own times  dante sees some of the ghosts of purgatory advancing forward more meagre and emaciated than the rest he asks how this could happen in a place where all live alike without nourishment virgil quotes the example of meleager who wasted with a firebrand on the gradual extinction of which his life depended he also produces the comparison of a mirror reflecting a figure these obscure explications do not satisfy the doubts of dante statius for his better instruction explains how a child grows in the womb of the mother how it is enlarged and by degrees receives life and intellect the drift of our author is apparent in these profound illustrations he means to show his skill in a sort of metaphysical anatomy we see something of this in the tesoretto of brunetto unintelligible solutions of a similar sort drawn from a frivolous and mysterious philosophy mark the writers of dantes age  the paradise of dante the third part of this poem resembles his purgatory its fictions and its allegories which suffer by being explained are all conceived in the same chimerical spirit the poet successively views the glory of the saints of angels of the holy virgin and at last of god himself  heaven as well as hell among the monks had its legendary description which it was heresy to disbelieve and which was formed on perversions or misinterpretations of scripture our authors vision ends with the deity and we know not by what miraculous assistance he returns to earth  it must be allowed that the scenes of virgils sixth book have many fine strokes of the terrible but dantes coloring is of a more gloomy temperature there is a sombrous cast in his imagination and he has given new shades of horror to the classical hell we may say of dante that  hell grows darker at his frown par l ii   0   the sensations of fear impressed by the roman poet are less harrassing to the repose of the mind they have a more equable and placid effect the terror of virgils tremendous objects is diminished by correctness of composition and elegance of style we are reconciled to his gorgons and hydras by the grace of expression and the charms of versification  in the mean time it may seem a matter of surprise that the italian poets of the thirteenth century who restored admired and studied the classics did not imitate their beauties but while they possessed the genuine models of antiquity their unnatural and eccentric habits of mind and manners their attachments to system their scholastic theology superstition ideal love and above all their chivalry had corrupted every true principle of life and literature and consequently prevented the progress of taste and propriety they could not conform to the practices and notions of their own age and to the ideas of the ancients at the same time they were dazzled with the imageries of virgil and homer which they could not always understand or apply or which they saw through the mist of prejudice and misconception their genius having once taken a false direction when recalled to copy a just pattern produced only constraint and affectation a distorted and unpleasing resemblance the early italian poets disfigured instead of adorning their works by attempting to imitate the classics the charms which we so much admire in dante do not belong to the greeks and romans they are derived from another origin and must be traced back to a different stock nor is it at the same time less surprising that the later italian poets in more enlightened times should have paid so respectful a compliment to dante as to acknowledge no other model and with his excellencies to transcribe and perpetuate all his extravagancies  sect xxxii i now return to the mirror of magistrates and to sackvilles legend of buckingham which follows his induction  the complaynt of henrye duke of buckingham is written with a force and even elegance of expression a copiousness of phraseology and an exactness of versification not to be found in any other parts of the collection on the whole it may be thought tedious and languid but that objection unavoidably results from the general plan of these pieces it is impossible that soliloquies of such prolixity and designed to include much historical and even biographical matter should every where sustain a proper degree of spirit pathos and interest in the exordium are these nervous and correct couplets whom flattering fortune falsely so beguilde that lo she slew where erst full smooth she smilde again and paynt it forth that all estates may know have they the warning and be mine the woe   buckingham is made to enter thus rapidly yet with much address into his fatal share of the civil broils between york and lancaster  but what may boot to stay the sisters three when atropos perforce will cut the thread the doleful day was come when you might see northampton field with armed men orespred in these lines there is great energy  o would to god the cruel dismal day that gave me light first to behold thy face with foul eclipse had reft my sight away the unhappie hour the time and eke the day etc and the following are an example of the simple and sublime united  and thou alecto feed me with thy food let fall thy serpents from thy snaky hear for such relief well fits me in my mood to feed my plaint with horroure and with fear with rage afresh thy renomd worm areare many comparisons are introduced by the distressed speaker but it is common for the best poets to forget that they are describing what is only related or spoken the captive proteus has his simile of the nightingale and eneas decorates his narrative of the disastrous conflagration of troy with a variety of the most labored comparisons  buckingham in his reproaches against the traitorous behavior of his ancient friend banastre utters this forcible exclamation which breathes the genuine spirit of revenge and is unloaded with poetical superfluities  hatd be thou disdainde of every wight and pointed at wherever thou shall go a traitorous wrtch unworthy of the light be thou esteemde and to increase thy woe the sound be hateful of thy name also and in this sort with shame and sharp reproach lead thou thy life till greater grief approach the ingenious writers of these times are perpetually deserting propriety for the sake of learned allusions buckingham exhorts the peers and princes to remember the fate of some of the most renowned heroes of antiquity whose lives and misfortunes he relates at large and often in the most glowing colors of poetry alexanders murder of clitus is thus described in stanzas pronounced by the poet and not by buckingham  and deeply grave within your stony hart the dreerie dole that mighty macedo with tears unfolded wrapped in deadly smarts when he the death of clitus sorrowed so whom erst he murdered with the deadly blow raught in his rage upon his friend so dear for which behold lo how his panges appear the launced spear he writhes out of the wound from which the purple blood spins in his face his heinous guilt when he returned found he throws himself upon the corpse alas and in his arms how often does he embrace his murdered friend and kissing him in vain forth flow the floudes of salt repentant rain his friends amazde at such a murder done in fearful flocks begin to shrink away and he thereat with heaps of grief fordone hates imselfe wishing his latter day  he calls for death and loathing longer life bent to his bane refseth kindly food and plungde in depth of death and dolours strife had queld killed manqueller is murderer himself had not his friends withstoode lo he that thus has shed the guiltless blood though he were king and keeper over all yet chose he death to guerdon death withal this prince whos peer as never under sun whose glistening ame the earth did overglide which with his power the world welnigh had won his bloody hands himsele could no abide but folly bent with famine to have did the worthy prince deemed in his regard that death for death could be but just reward our mirror having had three new editions in      this edition printed by thomas marshe has clx leaves with a table of contents at the end       and      this edition printed also for t marshe is improperly enough entitled the last part of the mirror for magistrates etc but it contains all that is in the foregoing editions and ends with jane shore or shores wife it has     leaves in the title page the work is said to be newly corrected and amended they are all in quarto and in black letter  was reprinted in quarto in the year      but in the preface higgins says h began to prepare it twelve years before in imitation of the title a storybook was published called the mirrur of mirth by r d      bl let  to also the mirror of the mathematikes a mirror of monstrs etc  with the addition of many new lives under the conduct of john higgins  higgins lived at winsham in somersetshire dedication ut inr  he was educated at oxford was a clergyman and engaged in the instruction of youth as a preceptor of boys on the plan of a former collection by nicholas udal a celebrated master of eton school he compiled the flosculi of terence a manual famous in its time and applauded in a latin epigram by the elegant latin encomiast thomas newton of cheshire in terent flosculos n udalli et j higgini opera decerptos encom fol     it also preixed to the book with others  in the pedagogic character he also published holcots dictionarie newly corrected amended set in order and enlarged with many names of men towns beasts fowls etc by which you may find the latin or french of any english word you will by john higgins late student in oxeforde perhaps at trinity college where one of both his names occurs in       in an engraved title page are a few english verses it is in folio and printed for thomas marshe at london      the dedication to sir george peckham knight is written by higgins and is a good specimen of his classical accomplishments he calls peckham hisprincipal friend and the most eminent patron of letters a recommendatory copy of verses by churchyard the poet is prefixed with four latin epigrams by others another of his works in the same profession is the nomenclator of adrian junius translated into english in conjunction with abraham flemming and printed at london for newberie and durham in      octavo  it is dedicated in latin to his most bountiful patron doctor valentine master of requests and dean of wells from winsham the ddication of his mirror to magistrates is from the same place       from this dedication higgins seems to have been connected with the school of ilminster a neighboring town in somersetshire he says that he translated it in london quo facto novus interpres waldenus ilmstiae gymnasiarcha moriens priusquam manum peri summam admovisset me amium veterm suum omnibs libri suis et hoc imprimis nomnclatore his translation donavit but higgins ound his own vrsion better which he therefore published yet with a part of his friends  he appears to have been living so late as the year   0  for in that year he published an answer to william perkins a forgotten controversialist concerning christs descent into hell dedicated from winsham  to the mirror of magistrates higgins wrote a new induction in the octave stanza and without assistance of friends began a new series from albanact the youngest son of brutus and the first king of albanie or scotland continued to the emperor caracalla at ol  0   the two lst lives in the lattr or what may be called bldwins part of this edition are jane shore and cardinal wolsey by churchyard colophon imprinted at london by henry marshe being the assign of thomas marshe near to saint dunstanes church in fleetestreete      it has     leaves the last signature is m m    in this edition by higgins among the pieces after the conquest first appeared the life of cardinal wolsey by churchyard fol     b  of sir nicholas burdet by baldwine fol     a  and of eleanor cobham fol   0 b  and of humfrey duke of gloucester fol     a

dingley fol     b  the name of a poet who has not otherwise occurred prefixed is a recommendatory poem in stanzas by the abovementioned thomas newton of cheshire subscribed thomas newtonus cystrshyrius       who understood much more of latin than of english poetry  the most poetical passage of higginss performance in this collection is in his legend of queen cordila or cordelia king lears youngest daughter fol      being imprisoned in a dungeon and coucht on straw she sees amid the darkness of the night a griesly ghost approach eke nearer still with stealing steps she drew she was of color pale and deadly hew her garment was figured with various sorts of imprisonment and pictures of violent and premature death her clothes resembled thousand kinds of thrall and pictures plain of hastened deaths withal cordelia in extreme terror asks   what wight art thou a foe or fawning rend if death thou art i pray thee ake an end  but the art not death  art thou some fury sent my woeful corpse with pains more to torment with that she spoke i am thy friend despair            now if thou art to dye no whit afraid here shall thou choose of instruments behold shall rid thy restless life  despair then throwing her robe aside shows cordelia a thousand instruments of death knives sharp swords and ponyards all bedyde with blood and poisons she presents the sword wit which queen dido slew herself  lo here the blade that ddo of carthage hight etc cordelia takes this sword but doubtful yet to dye despair then represents to her the state and power which she enjoyed in france her troops of attendants and the pleasures of the court she had left she then points out her present melancholy condition and dreary situation  she shewde me all the dongeon where i sat the dankish walls the darkes and bade me smell and bide the avour if i like it well cordelia gropes fr the sword or fatal knife in the dark which despair places in her hand despair to aid my senceless limbs was glad and gave the blade to end my woes she bad at length cordelias sght fails her so that she can see only despair who exhorts her to strike and by her elbowe death for me did watch despair at last gives the blow the temptation of the rdcrosse knight by despair in spenser faerie queen seems to have been copied yet with high improvements from this scene these stanzas of spenser bear a strong resmblance to what i have cited from cordelias legend  then began the villain that i dspair him to oueraw and brought unto him swords rope poisons fire and all that might him to perdition draw and bade him choose what death he would desire for death was due o him that had prouokt gods ire but when as none of them he saw him take he to him raught a dagger sharp and keen and gave it him in hand his hand did quake and tremble like a lease of aspin green and troubled blood through his pale face was seen to come and go with tydinges from the heart as it a running messenger had been at last resolved to work his final smart he lifted up his hand that back again did start faer qu i x  0  the three first books of the faerie queen were published in    0 higginss legend of cordelia in       at length the whole was digested anew with additions in    0 by richard niccols an ingenious poet of whom more will be said hereafter under the following title  a mirror for magistrates of the early use in the middle ages of the word spculum as the title of a book see joh finnaeuss dissrtatiohistoricalittraria prefixed to the kongsskuggsio or royal mirror an ancient prose work in norvegian written about    0 printed in       to fol xviii  being a true chroniclehstory of the untimely falls of such unfortunate princes and men of note as have happened since the first entrance of brute into this island until this our age newly enlarged with a last part called a winter nights vision being an addition of such tragedies especially famous as are exempted in the former history with a poem annexed called englands eliza at london imprinted by felix kyngston    0 a thick quarto  niccols arranged his edition thus higginss induction is at the head of the lives from brutus to the conquest those from the conquest to lord cromwells leged written by drayton and now first added drayton wrote three other legends on this plan robert duke of normandy matilda and pierce gaveston of which i shall pe more particularly under that writer  are introduced by sackvilles induction after this are placed such lives as had been before omitted ten in number written by niccols himself with an induction fol      as it illustrates the history of this work especially of sackvilles share in it i will here insert a part of niccolss preface prefixed to those tragedies which happened after the conquest beginning with that of robert tresilin having hitherto continued the story from the first entrance of brvte into this island with the falls of svch princes as were never before this time in one volume comprised i now proceed with the rest which take their beginning from the conquest whose penmen being many and diverse all diversely affected in the method of this their mirror i purpose only to follow the intended scope of that most honorable personage who by how mvch he did surpass the rest in the eminence of s noble condition by so mvch he has exceeded them all in the excellency of his heroical style which with golden pen he has limmed out to posterity in that worthy object of his mind the tragedy of the duke of buckingham and in his preface then intitled master sackils induction this worthy president of learning intended to perfect all this story of himself from the conquest being called to a more serious expense of his time in the great state affairs of his most royal lady and sovereign he left the dispose thereof to m baldwine m ferrers and others the composes of these tragedies who continving their method which was by way of dialogue or interlocvtion betwixt every tragedy gave it only place before the dvke of bvckinghams complaint which order i since having altered have placed the induction in the beginning with every tragedy following according to svccession and just compvtation of time which before was not observed fol     compare baldwynes prologue at fol cxiv b dit      ut supr   in the legend of king richard the thir niccols appears to have copied some passages from shakespeares tragedy on that history in the opening of the play richard says  now are our brows bound with victorious weaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisagd war has smoothed his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute act i sc i  these lines evidently gave rise to part of richards soliloquy in niccolss legend   the battles fought in field before were turned to meetings of sweet amity the wargods thundering cannons dreadful rore and rattling drumsounds warlike harmony to sweettund noise of pleasing mintralse  god mars laid by his lance and took his lute and turned his rugged frowns to smiling looks in stead of crimson fields wars fatal fruit he bathed his limbs in cypres warbling brooks and set his thoughts upon her wanton looks page      part of the tentscene in shakespeare is also imitated by niccols richard starting from his horrid dream says  methought the souls of all that i had murdered came to my tent and every one did threat to morrows vengeance on the head of richard act v sc ult drayton has also described these visionary terrors of richard polyol s xxii when to the guilty king the black orerunning night appear the dreadful ghosts of henry and his son of his own brother george and his two nephews done most cruelly to death and of his wife and friend lord hastinges with pale hands prepared as they would rend him peacemeal at which ot he roart in his sleep the polyolion was published in      fol   so niccols  i thought that all those murdered ghosts whom i by death had sent to their untimely grave with balefull noise about my tent did cry and of the heavens with sad complaint did crave that they on guilty wretch might vengeance have to whom i thought the idge of heaven gave ear and against me gave a judgment full of fear page      but some of the stanzas immediately following which are formed on shakespeares ideas yet with some original imagination will give the reader the most favorable idea of niccols as a contributor to this work  for lo eftsoons a thousand hellish hags leaving the abode of their infernal cell seasing on me my hateful body drags from forth my bed into a place like hell where fiends did naught but bellow howl and yell who in stern strife stood against each other bent who should my hateful body most torment tormented in such trance long did i lie till extreme fear did rouse me where i lay and caused me from my naked bed to fly alone within my tente i durst not stay this dreadful dream my soul did so affray when wakt i was from sleep i for a space thought i had been in some infernal place about mine ears a buzzing fear still flew my fainting knees languish for want of might upon my body stands an icie dew my heart is dead within and with affright the hair upon my head does stand upright each limb about me quaking does resemble a rivers rush that with the wind does tremble thus with my guilty souls sad torture torn the dark nights dismal hours i past away but at cocks crow the message of the morn my fear i did conceal etc page      if internal evidence was not a proof we are sure from other evidences that shakespeares tragedy preceded niccolss legend the tragedy was written about      niccols at eighteen years of age was admitted into magdalene college in oxford in the year   0  registr univ oxon he retired to magdalene hall where he was graduated in arts   0  ibid  it is easy to point out other marks of imitation shakespeare has taken nothing from seagarss richard the third printed in baldwines collection or first edition in the year      shakespeare however probably catched the idea of the royal shades in the same scene of the tragedy before us appearing in succession and speaking to richard and richmond from the general plan of the mirror of magistrates more especially as many of shakespeares ghosts there introduced for instance king henry the sixth clarence rivers hastings and buckingham are the personages of five of the legends belonging to this poem  sect xxxiii by way of recapitulating what has been said and in order to give a connected and uniform view of the mirror of magistrates in its most complete and extended state its original contents and additions i will here detail the subjects of this poem as they stand in this last or niccolss edition of    0 with reference to two preceding editions and some other incidental particularities  niccolss edition after the epistle dedicatorie prefixed to higginss edition of      an advertisement to the reader by niccols a table of contents

then follows a sonnet to the virtuous lady the lady elisabeth clear wife to sir francis clear and an epistle to the reader a very poetical induction is prefixed to the eliza which contains the history of queen elisabeth then just dead in the octave stanza niccols however has not entirely preserved the whole of the old collection although he made large additions he has omitted king james the first of scotland which appears in baldwynes edition of      at fol xlii b  and in higginss of      fol     b  he has also omitted and probably for the same obvious reason king james the fourth of scotland

higginss edition fol     a  niccls has also omitted seagarss king richard the third which first occurs in baldwynes edition of      fol cxlvii b  and afterward in higginss of      fol   0 b  but niccols has written a new legend on this subject cited above and one of the best of his additional lives page   0  this edition by niccols printed by felix kyngston in    0 i believe was never

properly belong to this collection and are only on the same plan rosamond is daniels complaint of rosamond and gaueston is draytons monologue on that subject  that it should have been the object even of an ingenious satirist is so far from proving that it wanted either merit or popularity that the contrary conclusion may be justly inferred it was however at length superseded by the growing reputation of a new poetical chronicle entitled albions england published before the beginning of the reign of james the first that it was in high esteem throughout the reign of queen elisabeth appears not only from its numerous editions but from the testimony of sir philip sidney and other cotemporary writers sydney says i esteem the mirror of magistrates to be furnished of beautiful parts

that sensible old english critic edmund bolton in a general criticism on the style of our most noted poets before the year   00 places the mirror of magistrates in a high rank it is under that head of his hypercritica entitled prime gardens for gathering english according to the true gage or standard of the tongue about fifteen or sixteen years ago the extract is a curious piece of criticism as written by a judicious cotemporary having mentioned our prose writers the chief of which are more sidney queen elisabeth hooker saville cardinal alan bacon and raleigh he proceeds thus in verse there are edmund spensers hymns the pieces mentioned in this extract will be considered in their proper places  i cannot advise the allowance of other his poems as for practick english no more than i can jeffrey chaucer lydgate pierce plowman or laureate skeleton it was laid as a fault to the charge of salust that he used some old outworn words stolen out of cato in his books de originibus and for an historian in our tongue to affect the like out of those our poets would be accounted a foul oversight  my judgment is nothing at all in poems or poesy and therefore i dare not go far but will simply deliver my mind concerning those authors among us whose english has in my conceit most propriety and is nearest to the phrase of court and to the speech used among the noble and among the better sort in london the two sovereign seats and as it were parliament tribunals to try the question in brave language are chapmans iliads  the works of samuel daniel contain somewhat aflat but yet withal a very pure and copious english and words as warrantable as any mans and fitter perhaps for prose than measure michael draytons heroical epistles are well worth the reading also for the purpose of our subject which is to furnish an english historian with choice and copy of tongue queen elizabeths verses those which i have seen and read some exstant in the elegant witty and artificial book of the art of english poetry the work as the fame is of one of her gentlemenpensioners puttenham are princely as her prose never must be forgotten st peters complaint and those other serious poems said to be father southwells the english whereof as it is most proper so the sharpness and light of wit is very rare in them noble henry constable was a great master in english tongue nor had any gentleman of our nation a more pure quick or higher delivery of conceit witness among all other that sonnet of his before his majestys lepanto i have not seen much of sir edward dyers poetry among the lesser late poets george gascoignes works may be endured but the best of these times if albions england be not preferred for our business is the mirror of magistrates and in that mirrour sackvils induction the work of thomas afterward earl of dorset and lord treasurer of england whose also the famous tragedy of gordobuc was the best of that time even in sir philip sidneys judgment and all skillful englishmen cannot but ascribe as much thereto for his phrase and eloquence therein but before in age if not also in noble courtly and lustrous english is that of the songs and sonnettes of henry howard earl of surrey son of that victorious prince the duke of norfolk and father of that learned howard his most lively image henry earl of northampton written chiefly by him and by sir thomas wiat not the dangerous commotioner but his worthy father nevertheless they who commend those poems and exercises of honorable wit if they have seen that incomparable earl of surrey his english translation of virgils eneids which for a book or two he admirably renders almost line for line will bear me witness that those other were foils and sportives the english poems of sir walter raleigh of john done of hugh holland but especially of sir foulk grevile in his matchless mustapha are not easily to be mended i dare not presume to speak of his majestys exercises in this heroic kind because i see them all left out in that which montague lord bishop of winchester has given us of his royal writings but if i should declare mine own rudeness rudely i should then confess that i never tasted english more to my liking nor more smart and put to the height of use in poetry than in that vital judicious and most practicable language of benjamin jonsons poems boltons hypercritica or a rule of judgment for

collection by allot to charles fitzjeffry abovementioned a poet before and after   00 and author of the affaniae but i will quote woods words fitzjeffrey has also made as ti said a collection of choice flowers and dsriptions a well out of his as the works of several others the most renowned poets of our nation collected about the beginning of the reign of king james i but this tho i have been years seeking after yet i cannot get a sight of it ath oxon p  0  but the most comprehensive and exact commonplace of the works of our most eminent poets thrughout the reign of queen elisabeth and afterward was published about forty years ago by mr thomas hayward of hungerford in berkshire viz the british muse a collection of thoughts moral natural and sublime of our english poets who flourished in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with several curious topics and beautiful passages never before extracted from shakespeare jonson beaumont fletcher and above a hundred more the whole digested alphabetically etc in three volume london printed for f cogan etc        mo the preface of twenty pages was written by mr william oldys with the supervisal and corrections of his friend doctor cambell this aneodote i learn from a manuscript isertion by oldy in my copy of allot englands parnassus abovementioned which once belonged to oldys  at the latter end of the reign of queen elisabeth as i am informed from some curious manuscript authorities a thin quarto in the black letter was published with this title the mirror of mirrovrs or all the tragedys of the mirrovr for magistrates abbreuiated in brief histories in prose very necessary for those that have not the cronicle london imprinted for james roberts in barbican      from manuscripts of mr coeter of trinity college oxford lately in the hands of mr wise radclivian librarian at oxford containing extracts from the copyrights of our old printers and registers of the stationers with several other curious notices of that kind ames had many of coxeters papers he died in lonon about       this was an attempt to familiarise and illustrate this favorite series of historic soliloquies or a plan to present its subjects which were now become universally popular in rhyme in the dress of prose  it is reasonable to suppose that the publication of the mirror of magistrates enriched the stores and extended the limits of our drama these lives are so many tragical speeches in character we have seen that they suggested scenes to shakespeare some critics imagine that historical plays owed their origin to this collection at least it is certain that the writers of this mirror were the first who made a poetical use of the english chronicles recently compiled by fabyan hall and hollinshed which opened a new field of subjects and events and i may add produced a great revolution in the state of popular knowledge for before those elaborate and voluminous compilations appeared the history of england which had been shut up in the latin narratives of the monkish annalists was unfamiliar and almost unknown to the general reader  sect xxxiv in tracing the gradual accessions of the mirror of magistrates an incidental departure from the general line of our chronologic series has been incurred but such an anticipation was unavoidable in order to exhibit a full and uninterupted view of that poem which originated in the reign of mary and was not finally completed till the beginning of the seventeenth century i now therefore return to the reign of queen mary  to this reign i assign richard edwards a native of somersetshire about the year      he is said by wood to have been a scholar of corpus christi college in oxford but in his early years he was employed in some department about the court this circumstance appears from one of his poems in the paradise of dainty devises a miscellany which contains many of his pieces  in youthful years when first my young desires began to prick me forth to serve in court a slender tall young man my fathers bessing then i asked upon my knee who blessing me with trembling hand these words began say to me my son god guide thy way and shield thee from mischaunce and make thy just desartes in court thy poor estate to advance etc edit       to carm    in the year      he was appointed a senior student of christchurch in oxford then newly founded in the british museum there is a small set of manuscript sonnets signed with his initials addressed to some of the beauties of the courts of queen mary and of queen elisabeth mss cotton tit a xxiv to some court ladies  pr howarde is not hawghte etc  hence we may conjecture that he did not long remain at the university about this time he was probably a member of lincolns end in the year      he was constituted a gentleman of the royal chapel by queen elisabeth and master of the singing boys there he had received his musical education while at oxford under george etheridge george etheridge born at them in oxfordshire was admitted scholar of corpus christi college oxford under the tuition of the learned john shepreve in      fellow in      in      he was made royal professor of greek at oxford in      he was recommended by lord williams of them to sir thomas pope founder of trinity college in oxford to be admitted a fellow of his college at its first foundation but etheridge choosing to pursue the medical line that scheme did not take effect he was persecuted for popery by queen elisabeth at her accession but afterward practiced physic at oxford with much reputation and established a private seminary there for the instruction of catholic youths in the classis music and logic notwithstanding his active perseverance in the papistic persuasion he presented to the queen when she visited oxford in      an ecomium in grek verse on her father henry now in the british museum mss bl reg    c x he prefixed a not inelegant preace in latin verse to his tutor sheprev hypolytus an answer to ovids phaedra which he published in      pits his cotemporary says he was an able mathematician and one of the most excellent vocal and instrumental musicians in england but he chiefly delighted in the lute and lyre a most elegant poet and a most exact composer of english latin greek and hebrew verses which he used to set to his harp with the greatest skill angl script p     paris      pits add that he translated several of davids psalms into a short hebrew meter for music wood mentions his musical compositions in manuscript his familiar friend leland addresses him in an encomiastic epigram and asserts that his many excellent writings were highly pleasing to king henry the eighth encom land      p     his chief patrons seem to have been lord williams sir thomas pope sir walter mildmay and robertson dean of durham he died in      at oxford i have given theridge so long a note because he appears from pits to have been an english poet compare fox martyolog iii  00

queen he probably wrote many other dramatic pieces now lost puttenham having mentioned lord buckhurst and master edward ferrys or ferrers as most eminent in tragedy gives the prize to edwards for comedy and interlude art of english poetry fol     the word interlude is here of wide extent for edwards besides that he was a writer of regular dramas appears to have been a contriver of masks and a composer of poetry for pageants in a word he united all those arts and accomplishments which minister to popular pleasantry he was the first fiddle the most fashionable sonnetteer the readiest rhymer and the most facetious mimic of the court in consequence of his love and his knowledge of the histrionic art he taught the choristers over which he presided to act plays and they were formed into a company of players like those of saint pauls cathedral by the queens license under the superintendency of edwards see supr vol ii       the most poetical of edwards ditties in the paradise of dainty

play of palamon and arcite before queen elisabeth at oxford in      miles winsore of the same college was another actor in that play and i suppose his performance was much liked by the queen for when her majesty left oxford after this visit he was appointed by the university to speak an ortion before her at lord windsors at bradenham in bucks and when he had done speaking the queen turning to gama

of balladmaking as well as of balladsinging was in high repute about the metropolis and in the country fairs signat c when i was liked says anthony there was no thought of that idle vpstart generation of balladsingers neither was there a printer so lewd that would set his finger to a lascivious line but now he adds ballads are abusively chanted in every street and from london this evil has overspread essex and the adjoining counties there is many a tradesman of a worshipull trade yet no stationer who after a little bringing up apprentices to singing brokerie takes into his shop some fresh men and trustes his old servauntes of a two months standing with a dossen groates worth of ballads in which if they prove thriftie he makes them pretty chapmen able to spread more pamphlets by

no small profit of the bowlinge alleys in bedlam and other places that were are wont in the afternoones to be left empty by the recourse of good fellows into that unprofitable recreation of stageplaying and it were not much amiss would they join with the dicinghouses to make suit again for their longer restrainte though the sickness cease  while plays are usde half the day is by most youths that have liberty spent upon them or at least the greatest company drawn to the places where they frequent etc this is all in pure irony the last address is from william cuckowe a famous master of legerdemain on the tricks of juglers i could not suffer this opportunity accidentally offered to pass of giving a note to a forgotten old writer of comedy whose name may not perhaps occur again but i must add that the initials h c to pieces of this period do not always mean henry chettle in englands helicon are many pieces signed h c probably for henry constable a noted sonnetwriter of these

chettle is mentioned as a player i think in the last page of dekkers knights conjuring printed in   0   puttenham the author of the art of english poeie mentions the earl of oxford and master edwardes of her majestys chapel for comedy and interlude lib i chapter xxxi fol    a   among the books of my friend the late mr william collins of chichester now dispersed was a collection of short comic stories in prose printed in the black letter under the year    0 set forth by master richard edwardes master of her majestys revels undoubtedly this is the same edwards who from this title expressly appears to have been the general conductor of the court festivities and who most probably succeeded in this office george ferrers one of the original authors of the mirror of magistrates who had certainly qitted that office before the year      for in george gascoignes narrative of queen elisabeths splendid visit at kenilworthcastle in warwickshire entitled the princely pleasures of kenilworthcastle the octav stanzas spoken by the lady of the lake are said to have been devised and penned by m master ferrers sometime lord of misrule in the court signat a iij see also signat b ij this was george ferrers mentioned in the text a contributor to the mirror of magistrates i take this opportunity of insinuating my suspicions that i have too closely followed the testimony of philips wood and tanner in supposing that this george ferrers and edward ferrer a writer of plays were two distinct persons see supr p     i am now convinced that they have been confounded and that they are one and the same man we have already seen and from good authority that george ferrers was lord of misrule to the count that is among other things of a like kind a writer of court interludes or plays and that king edward the sixth had great delight in his pastimes see supr vol ii     the confusion appears to have originated from puttenham the author of the art of english posie who has inadvertently given to george the christian name of edward but his account or character of this edward ferrers has served o lead us to the truth but the principal man in this profession poetry at the same time of edward the sixh was master edward ferrys a man of no less mirth and feliciie that way but of much more skill and magnificence in his meeter and therefore wrate for the most part to the stage in tragedy and sometimes in comedy or interlude wherein he gave the king so much good recreation as he had thereby many good rewards lib i chapter xxxi page    edit      and again for tragedy the lord buckhurst and master edward ferrys for such doings as i have seen of theirs deserve the highest price ibid p    his tragedies with the magnificent meeter are perhaps nothing more than the stately monologues in the mirror of magistrates and he might have written others either for the stage in general or the more private entertaiment of the court now lost and probably never printed his comedy and interlude are perhaps to be understood to have een not so much regular and professed dramas for a theater as little dramatic mummries for the courtholidays or other occasional festivities the courtshows like this at kenilworth were accompanied with personated dialogues in verse and the whole pageantry was often styled an interlude this reasoning also accounts for puttenhams seming omission in not having enumerated the mirror of magistrates by name among the shining poems of his age i have before observed what is much to our purpose that no plays of an edward ferrers or ferrys which i the same in print or manuscript are now known to exist nor are mentioned by any writer of the times with which we are now concerned george ferrers at least from what actually remains of him has some title to the dramatic character our george ferrers from the part he bore in the exhibitions at kenilworth appears to have been employed as a writer of metrical speeches or dialogues to b spoken in character long after he had left the office of lord of misrule a proof of hi reputed xcellence in composition of this nature and of the celebrity with which he filled that department  i also take this opportunity the earliest which has occurred of retracting another slight mistake see supr p     there was a second edition of niccolss mirror of magistrates printed for w aspley land       to    among these tales was that of the induction of the tinker in shakespeares taming of the shrew and perhaps edwardss storybook was the immediate source from which shakespeare or rather the author of the old taming of a shrew drew that diverting apologue see six old plays land        mo  if i recollect right the circumstances almost exactly tallied with an incident which heuterus relates from an epistle of ludovicus vives to have actually happened at the marriage of duke philip the good of burgundy about the year    0 i will give it in the words either of vives or of that perspicuous

ingenious writer of the reign of king james the first when as by reason of unseasonable weather he could neither hawke nor hunt and was now tired with cads and dice and such other domestical sports or to see ladies dance with some of his courtiers he would in the evening walk disguised all about the town it so fortuned as he was walking late one night he found a country fellow dead drunk snorting on a bulk he caused his followers to bring him to his palace and then stripping him of his old clothes and attyring him in the courtfashion when he wakened he and they were all ready to attend upon his excellency and persuaded him he was some great duke the poor fellow admiring how he came there was served in state all day long after supper he saw them dance heard music and all the rest of those courtlike pleasures but late at night when he was well tipled and again fast asleep they put on his old robes and so conveyed him to the place where they first found him now the fellow had not made there so good sport the day before as he did now when he returned to himself all the jest was to see how he looked upon it in conclusion after some little admiration the poor man told his friends he had seen a vision constantly believed it would not otherwise be persuaded and so the joke ended burtons anatomy of melancholy part ii   page     fol oxon      there is an older edition in quarto  if this is a true story it is a curious specimen of the winterdiversions of a very polite court of france in the middle of the fifteenth century the merit of the contrivance however and comic effect of

utility and which produced one of the most beautiful poems of antiquity the vicissitudes of this mans life have uncommon variety and novelty for the life of an author and his history conveys some curious traces of the times as well as of himself he seems to have been alike the sport of fortune and a dupe to his own discontented disposition and his perpetual propensity to change of situation

choir for the use of the chapel of king edward the sixth under the year    0 says strype there was a grant of a commission to philip van wilder gentleman of the privy chamber in any churches or

xi      as the word minstrel is of an extensive signification and is applied as a general term to every character of that species of men whose business it was to entertain either with oral recitation music gesticulation and singing or with a mixture of all these arts united it is certainly difficult to determine whether singers only more particularly singers for the royal chapel were here intended

and especially in common schools where diverse heathen poets are ordinarily read and taught from which the youth of the realm does rather receive infection in manners than advancement in virtue in place of some of which poets we think this book fit to read and taught in the grammar schools we have therefore thought as well for the encouraging the said ocklande and others that are learned to bestow their travel and studies to so good purposes as also for the benefit of the youth and the removing of such lascivious poets as are commonly read and taught in the said grammarschooles the matter of this book being heroical and of good instruction to pray and require you upon the sight hereof as by our special order to write your letters unto all the bishops throughout this realm

it is unlucky that bale by disguising his name should have contributed to conceal this writer so long from the notice of posterity and even to counteract his own partiality lucas shepherd however

nearly resembling the superstitions of popery  sect xxxvii it appears however that the cultivation of an english style began to be now regarded at the general restoration of knowledge and taste it was a great impediment to the progress of our language that all the learned and ingenious aiming at the character of erudition wrote in latin english books were written only by the superficial and illiterate at a time when judgment and genius should have been exerted in the nice and critical task of polishing a rude speech long after the invention of typography our vernacular style instead of being strengthened and refined by numerous compositions was only corrupted with new barbarisms and affectations for want of able and judicious writers in english unless we except sir thomas more whose dialogue on tribulation and history of richard the third were esteemed standards of style so low as the reign of james the first roger ascham was perhaps the first of our scholars who ventured to break the shackles of latinity by publishing his toxophilus in english chiefly with a view of giving a pure and correct model of english composition or rather of showing how a subject might be treated with grace and propriety in enlish as well as in latin his own vindication of his conduct in attempting this great innovation is too sensible to be omitted and reflects light on the revolutions of our poetry as for the lattine or greek tongue every thing is so excellentlye done in them that none can do better in the english tongue contrary every thing in a manner so meanlye both for the matter and handelinge tha no man can do worse for therein the learned for the most part have been always most redye to write and they which had least hope in lattine have been most bold in english when surely every man that is most ready to talk is not most able to write he that will write well in any tongue must follow this counsel of aristotle to speak as the common people do to think as wise men do and so should every man understand him and the judgment of wise men allow him many english writers have not done so but vsinge strange words as lattine french and italian do make all things dark and hard ones i communed with a man which reasoned the english tongue to be enriched and increased thereby saying who will no praise that feast where a man shall drink at a dinner both wine ale and beer truly quoth i they be al good every one taken by himself alone but if you put malmesye and sack red wine and white ale and beer and al in one pot you shall make a drink neither easy to be known nor yet wholesome for the body cicero in following isocrates plato and demosthenes increased the lattine tongue after another sort this way because diverse men that write do not know they can neither follow it because of their ignorance nor yet will praise it for uery arrogance two faults seldom the one out of the others company english writers by diversity of time have taken diverse matters in hand in our fathers tim nothing was red but books of feigned cheualrie wherein a man by readinge should be led to none other end but only to manslaughter and baudrye if any man suppose they were good enough to pass the time withal he is deceived for surely vain words do work no small thing in vain ignorant and young minds specially if they be given any thing thereunto of their own nature these books as i have heard say were made the most part in abbayes and monasteries a very likely and fit fruit of such an idle and blind kind of living he says in his schoolmaster written soon after the year      there be more of these ungracious books set out in print within these few monehes than have been seen in england many score years before b i fol    a edit       to  in our time now when every man is given to know much rather than live well very many do write but after such a fashion as very many do shoot some shooters take in hand stronger bows than they be able to maintain this thing makes them sometime to ouershoote the mark sometime to shoot far wide and perchance hurt some that look on other that never learned to shoot nor yet knows good shaft nor bow will be as busy as the best to all the gentlemen and yomen of england prefixed to toxophilus the schole or partition of shooting land       to   aschams example was followed by other learned men but the chief was thomas wilson who published a system of logic and rhetoric both in english of his logic i have already spoken i have at present only to speak of the latter which is not only written in english but with a view of giving rules for composing in the english language it appeared in      the first year of queen mary and is entitled the art of rhetorike for the use of all such as are studious of eloquence set forth in english by thomas wilson land       to dedicated to john dudley earl of warwick in the dedication he says that he wrote great part of this treatise during the last summer vacation in the country at the house of sir edward dimmoke and that it originated from a late conversation with his lordship emonge other talk of learning it was reprinted by jhon kynston in    0 land  to with a prologue to the reader dated dec      0 again       to and       to in the prologu he mentions his escape at rome which i have above related and adds if others never get more by books than i have done it were better be a carter than a scholar for worldly proite  leonarde cox a schoolmaster patronised by farringdon the last abbot of reading had published in    0 as i have observed an english tract on rhetoric which is nothing more than a technical and elementary manal wilsons treatise is more liberal and discursive illustrating the arts of eloquence by example and examining and ascertaining the beauties of composition with the speculative skill and sagacity of a critic it may therefore be justly considered as the first book or system of criticism in our language a few extracts from so curious a performance need no apology which will also serve to throw light on the present period and indeed on our general subject by displaying the state of critical knowledge and the ideas of writing which now prevailed  i must premise that wilson one of the most accomplished scholars of his times was originally a fellow of kings college admitted scholar in      a native of lincolnshire ms hatcher  where he was tutor to the two celebrated youths henry and charles brandon dukes of suffolk being a doctor of laws he was afterward one of the ordinary masters of requests master of saint katharines hospital near the tower a frequent ambassador from queen elisabeth to mary queen of scots and into the low countries a secretary of state and a privy counselor and at length in      dean of durham he died in      his remarkable diligence and dispatch in negotiation is said to have resulted from an uncommon strength of memory it is another proof of his attention to the advancement of our english style that he translated seven orations of demosthenes which in    0 he dedicated to sir william cecill which had been also translated into latin by nicholas carr to whose version hatcher prefixed this distich mss more  0  carr autograph ms haec adem patrio thomas sermon polivit wilsonus patrii gloria prima soli wilson published many other things in gabriel harveys smithus dedicated to sir walter mildmay and printed by binneman in      he is ranked with his learned cotemporaries see signat d iij  e ij  i j   under that chapter of his third book of rhetoric which treats of the four parts belonging to elocution plainness aptness composicio exornacion wilson has these observations on simplicity of style which are immediately directed to those who write in the english tongue among other lessons this should first be learned that we never affect any strange ynkehorne terms but to speak as is commonly received neither seking to be over fine nor yet living over careless using our speech as most men do and ordering our wits as the fewest have done some seek so far for outlandishe english that they forget altogether their mothers language and i dare swear this if some of their mothers were alive they were not able to tell what they say and yet these fine english clerks will say they speak in their mother tongue if a man should charge them for counterfeityng the kings english some far iournied gentlemen at their return home like as they love to go in foreign apparel so they will powder their talk with ouersea language he that comes lately out of france will talk french english and never blushe at the matter another choppes in with english italianated and applies the italian phraise to our english speaking the which is as if an oration that professes to utter his mind in plain latin would needs speak poetry and far fetched colors of strange antiquity the lawier will store his stomach with the prating of pedlers the auditour in making his account and reckenyng comes in with sise sold and cater denere for vj s and iiij d the fine courtier will talk nothing but chaucer the mystical wisemen and poetical clerks will speak nothing but quainte proverbs and blind allegories delightyng much in their own darkness especially when none can tell what they do say the unlearned or folishe fantastical that smelles but of learning svche fellows as have seen learned men in their days will so latin their tongues that the simple cannot but wonder at their talk and think surely they speak by some reuelacion i know them that think rhetorike to stand wholly upon dark words and he that can catch an ynkehorne term by the tail him they count to be a fine englishman and a good rhetorician puttenham in the art of english poesy where he treats of style and language brings some illustrations from the practice of oratory in the reign of queen mary in whose court he lived and although his book is dated      it was manisestly written much earlier he refers to sir nicholas bacon who began to be high in the departments of the law in queen marys time and died in      having told a story from his own knowledge in the year      of a ridiculous oration made in parliament by a new speaker of the house who came from yorkshire and had more knowledge in the affairs of his county and of the law than gracefulness or delicacy of language he proceeds and though grave and wise counselors in their consultations do not use much superstitious loquence and also in their judicial hearings do much mislike all scholasticall rhetoricks yet in such a case as it may be and as this parliament was if the lord chancelour of england or archbishop of canterbury himself were to speak he ought to do it cunningly and eloquently which cannot be without the use of figures and nevertheless none impeachment or blemish to the gravity of their persons or of the cause wherein i report me to them that knew sir nicholas bacon lord keeper of the great seal or the now lord treasurer of england and have been conversant in their speeches made in the parliament house and star chamber from whose lips i have seen to proceed more grave and natural eloquence than from all the orators of oxford and cambridge  i have come to the lord keeper sir nicholas bacon and found him sitting in his gallery alone with the works of quintilian before him in deed he was a most eloquent man and of rare learning and wisdom as ever i knew england to breed and one that ioyed as much in learned men and men of good wits lib iii chapter ii page     seq what follows soon afterward is equally apposite this part in our maker or poet must be heedyly looked unto that it hislanguage be natural pure and the most usual of all his countray and for the same purpose rather that which is spoken in the kings court or in the good towns and cities within the land than in the marches or frontiers or in port towns where strangers haunt for traffike sake or yet in universities where scholars use much peevish affectation of words out of the primitive languages or finally in any vplandish village or corner of the realm etc but he shall follow generally the better brovght up sort such as the greeks call charintes men civil and graciously behauored and bred our maker theresoe at these days shall not follow pers plowman nor gower nor lydgate nor yet chaucer for their language is now out of use with us neither shall he take the terms of northern men such as they use in daily talk whether they be noblemen or gentlemen or of their best clerks all is a matter etc ye shall therefore take the usual speech of the court and that of london and the shires lying about london within lx miles and not mvch above i say not this but that in every shyre of england there be gentlemen and others that speak but specially write as good sovtherne as we of middlesex and surrey do but not the common people of every shire to whom the gentlemen and also their learned clerks do for the most part condescend but herein we are ruled by the english dictionaries and other books written by learned men albeit peradventure some small admonition be not impertinent for we find in our english writers many words and speeches amendable and ye shall see in some many inkhorne terms so ill affected brought in by men of learning as preachers and schoolemasters and many strange terms of other languages by secretaries and marchaunts and traueillours and many dark words and not usual nor well sounding though they be daily spoken at court ibid chapter iii fol   0      and the rather to set out this folly i will add here svche a letter as william summer king henrys jester in another place he gives us one of somners jests william summer seying much ado for accomptes making and that henry the eight wanted money such as was due to him and please your grace qoth he you have so many frauditours so many conueighers and so many deceivers to get up your money that they get all to themselves that is auditors surveyors and receivers fol  0  b i have seen an old narrative of a progress of king henry the eighth and queen katharine to newbery in berkshire where somner who had accompanied their majestys as courtbuffoon sell into disgrace with the people for his impertinence was detained and obliged to submit to many ridiculous indignities but extricated himself from all his dissiculties by comic expedients and the readiness of his wit on returning to court he gave their majestys who were inconsolable for his long absence a minute account of these low adventures with which they were infinitely entertained what shall we think of the manners of such a court himself could not make a better for that purpose  devised by a lincolnehire man for a void benefice viz ponderyng expendyng and reuolutyng with myself your ingent affability and ingenious capacity for mundane affairs i cannot but celebrate and extol your magnificall dexterity above all other for how could you have adapted such illustrate prerogative and dominiall superiority if the ecunditie of your ingenie had not been so fertile and wonderful pregnaunt etc it is to the lord chancellor see what is said of a bordess style supr p     this point he illustrates with other familiar and pleasant instances b iii fol    b edit        in enforcing the application and explaining the nature of fables for the purpose of amplification he gives a general idea of the iliad and odyssey the saying of poets and al their fables are not to be forgotten for by them we may talk at large and win men by persuasion if we declare before hand that these tales were not fained of such wisemen without cause neither yet continued until this time and kept in memory without good consideracion and thereupon declare the true meaning of all svche writynge for undoubtedly there is no one tale among all the poets but under the same is comprehended somethyng that perteyneth either to the amendment of manners to the knowledge of truth to the setting forth natures work or else to the understanding of some notable thing done for what other is the painful travail of ulysses described so largely by homere but a lively picture of mans misery in this life and as plutarche says and likewise basilius magnus in the iliades are described strength and valiantness of body in odissea is set forth a lively pattern of the mind the poets are wisemen and wisshed in heart the redress of things the which when for fear they durst not openly rebuke they did in colors paint them out and told men by shadows what they should do in good sothe or else because the wicked were unworthy to hear the truth they spoke so that none might understand but those unto whom they please to utter their meaning and knew them to be men of honest conversation lib iii fol    b   wilson thus recommends the force of circumstantial description or what he calls an evident or plain setting forth of a thing as though it were presently done an example if our enemies shall invade and by treason win the victory we shall all die every mothers son of us and our city shall be destroyed stick and stone i se our children made slaves our daughters ravished our wives carried away the father forced to kill his own son the mother her daughter the son his father the sucking child slain in his mothers bosom one standing to the knees in another blood churches spoiled houses plucte down and al set on fire round about us every one cvrsing the day of their birth children criyng women wailing etc thus where i might have said we shall al be destroyed and say no more i have by description set the evil forth at large fol    a  it must be owned that this picture of a sacked city is literally translated from quintilian but it is a proof that we were now beginning to make the beauties of the ancients our own  on the necessity of a due preservation of character he has the following precepts which seem to be directed to the writers of historical plays in describyng of persons there ought always a comeliness to be used so that nothing be spoken which may be thought is not in them as if one should describe henry the sixth he might call him jentle mild of nature led by perswacion and ready to forgive careless for wealth suspecting none merciful to al fearful in adversity and without forecast to epsy his misfortvne again for richard the third i might bring him in cruel of heart ambicious by nature envious of mind a deep dissembler a close man for weighty matters hardy to revenge and fearful to lose his high estate trusty to none liberal for a purpose castyng still the worste and hoping ever for the best richard the third seems to have been an universal character for exemplifying a cruel disposition our author meaning to furnish a chamber with persons famous for the greatest crimes says in another place in the bedstede i will set richard the third king of england or somelike notable murderer fol  0  b shakespeare was not the first that exhibited this tyrant upon the stage in      a ballad was printed called a tragic report of king richard the iii registr station b fol   0 b  by this figure lively description also we imagine a talk for some one to speak and according to his person we frame the oration as if one should bring in noble henry the eight of famous memory to enuegh against rebels thus he might order his oration what if henry the eight were alive and saw such rebellion in the realm would he not say thus and thus yea methinkes i hear him speak even now and so set forth such words as we would have him to sy fol    b  shakespeare himself has not delineated the characters of these english monarchs with more truth and the first writers of the mirror of magistrates who imagine a talk for some one to speak and according to his person frame the oration appear to have availed themselves of these directions if not to have catched the notion of their whole plan from this remarkable passage  he next shows the advantages of personification in enlivening a composition some times it is good to make god the countray or some one town to speak and look what we would say in our own person to frame the whole tale to them such variety does much good to avoid tediousness for he that speaks all in one sort though he speak things never so wittily shall sone weary his hearers figures therefore were invented to avoid satietie and cause delight to refresh with pleasure and quicken with grace the dullness of mans brain who will look on a white wall an hour together where no workemanshippe is at all or who will eat still one kind of meat and never desire change fol    b    a   prolix narratives whether jocose or serious had not yet ceased to be the entertainment of polite companies and rules for telling a tale with grace now found a place in a book of general rhetoric yet he has here also a reference to the utility of tales both at the bar and in the pulpit for in another place professedly both speaking of pleadings and sermons he says if time may so serve it were good when men be wearied to make them somewhat merry and to begin with some pleasant tale or take occasion to ieste wittelie etc fol    b again men commonly tarry the end of a merry play and cannot abide the half hearing of a sower checkyng sermon therefore even these aunciente preachers must now and then play the fools in the pulpite to serve the tickle ears of their fletyng audience etc fol   a i know not if he means latimer here whom he commends there is no better preacher among them al except hugh latimer the father of al preachers fol    a and again i would think it not amiss to speak much according to the nature and fancy of the ignorant that the rather they might be won through fables to learn more weighty and grave matters for all men cannot brook sage causes and ancient collations but will like earnest matters the rather if some be spoken there among agreeing to their natures the multitude as horace does say is a beast or rather a monster that has many hedde and therefore like unto the diversity of natvres variety of invention must always be used talk altogether of most grave matters or deppely searce out the ground of things or use the quiddities of duns scotus to set forth gods mysteries you shall se the ignorant i warrant you either fall aslepe or else bid you farewell the multitude must needs be made merry and the more foolish your talk is the more wise will they count it to be and yet it is no foolishnes but rather wisdom to win men by telling of fables to hear gods goodness fol  0  a see also fol    a    a much to the same purpose he says even in this our time some offend much in tediousness whose part it were to comfort all men with cherefulnesse yea the preachers of god mind so much ediiyng of souls that they often forgette we have any bodies and therefore some do not so much good with tellyng the truth as they do harm with dullyng the hearers being so far gone in their matters that oftentimes they cannot tell when to make an end fol  0 a yet still he allows much praise to the preachers in general of his age yea what tell i now of such lessons seeing god has raised such worthy preachers in this our time that their godly and learned doings may be a most just example for all other to follow fol    b by the way although a zealous gospeller in another place he obliquely censures the rapacity with which the reformation was conducted under edward the sixth see supr vol ii p     i had rather said one make my child a cobbler than a preacher a tankardbearer than a scholar for what shall my son seek for learning when he shall never get thereby any livyng set my son to that whereby he mai get somewhat do you not see how every one catches and pulls from the church what they can i fear me one day they will pluke down church and all call you this the gospel when men seek only for to provide for their bellies and care not a groate though their souls go to hell a patron of a benefice will have a poor yngrame soul to bear the name of a parsone for twenty mark or ten pound and the patron himself will take up for his snapshare as good as an hundred mark thus god is robbed learning decayed england dishonored and honesty not regarded fol   a  in treating of pleasant sport made rehearsyng of a whole matter he says they that can lively tell pleasant tales and merry deeds done and set them out as well with gesture as with voice leaving nothing behind that may serve for beautifying of their matter are most mete for this purpose whereof assuredly there are but few and whatsoever he is that can aptly tell his tale and with countenance voice and gesture so temper his report that the hearers may still take delight him coompte i a man worthy to be highly esteemed for undoubtedly no man can do any such thing except that they have a great mother wit and by experience confirmed such their comeliness whereunto by nature they were most apt many a man reads histories hears fables sees worthy acts done even in this our age but few can set them out accordingly and tell them lively as the matter self requires to be told the kinds of delityng in this sort are diverse whereof i will set forth many  sport moved by tellyng of old tales  if there be any old tale or strange history well and wittelie applied to some man living all men love to hear it of life as if one were called arthure some good fellow that were well acquainted with king arthures book and the knights of his round table would want no matter to make good sport and for a need would dubbe him knight of the round table or else prove him to be one of his kynne or else which were much prove him to be arthur himself and so likewise of other names merry panions companions a cant word would make mad pastyme oftentimes the deformity of a mans body gives matter enough to be right merry or else a picture in shape like another manne will make some to laugh right hartelye fol    a  etc this is no unpleasing image of the arts and accomplishments which seasoned the mirth and enlivened the conversations of our forefathers their wit seems to have chiefly consisted in mimicry see ol  0 a   he thus describes the literary and ornamental qualifications of a young nobleman which were then in fashion and which he exemplifies in the characters of his lamented pupils henry duke of suffolk and lord charles brandon his brother he gives a curious reason why a young nobleman had better be born in london than any other place the shire or town helps somewhat toward the increase of honor as it is much better to be borne in paris than in picardie in london than in lincoln for that both the air is better the people more civil and the wealth much greater and the men for the most part more wise fol   a  i may commend him for his learning for his skill in the french or in the italian for his knowledge in cosmographie for his skill in the laws in the histories of al countrees and for his gift of enditing again i may commend him for playing at weapons for running upon a great horse for chargyng his staff at the tilt for vauting for plaiyng upon instruments yea and for painting or drawing of a plat as in old time noble princes much delited therein fol   a  and again such a man is an excellent fellow says one he can speak the tongues well he plays of instruments few men better he feigneth to the lvte marveilous sweetly he mentions the lute again the tongue gives a certain grace to every matter and beautiieth the cause in like manner a a sweet soundyng lute much sets forth a mean devised ballade fol     a  he ndites excellently but for all this the more is the pitee he has his faults he will be drunk once a day he loves women well etc fol    a   the following passage acquaints us among other things that many now studied and with the highest applause to write elegantly in english as well as in latin when we have learned usual and accvstomable words to set forth our meaning we ought to join them together in apt order that the ear may delight in hearing the harmony i know some englishemen that in this poinct have such a gift in the english as few in latin have the like and therefore delight the wise and learned so much with their pleasant composition that many rejoice when they may hear such and think much learning is got when they may talk with them this work is enlivened with a variety of little illustrative stories not ill told of which the following is a specimen an italian havyng a suit here in england to the archbusshoppe of york that then was and coming to york when one of the prebendaries there brake his bread as they term it and thereupon made a solemn long diner the which perhaps began at eleven and continued well nigh till four in the afternoon at the which dinner this bisshoppe was it fortvned that as they were set the italian knocked at the gate unto whom the porter perceiving his errand answered that my lord bisshoppe was at diner the italian departed and returned betwixt twelve and one the porter answered they were yet at dinner he came again at two of the clock the porter told him they had not half dined he came at three a clock unto whom the porter in a heat aswered never a word but churlishlie did shut the gates upon him whereupon others told the italian that there was no speaking with my lord almost all that day for the solemn diner sake the gentilman italian wonderyng much at such a long sitting and greatly grieved because he could not then speak with the archbysshoppes grace departed straight toward london and leauyng the dispatche of his matters with a der friend of his took his journey toward italy three years after it hapened that an englishman came to rome with whom this italian by chance falling acquainted asked him if he knew the archbisshoppe of york the englishman said he knew him right well i pray you tell me quoth the italian has that archbishop yet dined the italian explaining himself they both laughed heartily fol    b    a  he commends dr haddons latinity which is not always of the purest cast there is no better latin man within england except gualter haddon the lawier fol    a

dark devised sentences fol  0 a again for furnishing similitudes the proverbs of heiwood help wonderful well for this purpose fol    b  he condemns in an example the growing practice of mothers who do not suckle their own children which he endeavors to prove to be both against the law of nature and the will of god fol    a here is an early proof of a custom which may seem to have originated in a more luxurious and delicate age  to these miscellaneous extracts i shall only add that our author who was always esteemed a sincere advocate for protestantism and never suspected of leaning to popry speaking of an artificial memory ha this theory concerning the use of images in churches when i see a lion the image thereof abides faster in my mind than if i should hear some report made of a lion among all the senses the iye eye sight is most quick and contains the impression of things more assuredly than any of the other senses do and the rather when a man both hears and sees a thing as by artificial memory he doth almost s things lively he does remember it much the better the sight printeth things in a mans memory as a seal does printe a mans name in wax and therefore heretofore imas were sett up for remembrance of saints to be lai ennes books that the rather by seying seein the pictures of such men they might be stirred to follow their good living  marry for this purpose whereof we now write this would have served gaily well fol     a    but he adds the faults which were sometimes now to be found in english composition among which he censures the excess of alliteration  some will be so short and in such wise curtall their sentences that they had need to make a commentary immediately of their meaning or else the most that hear them shall be forced to keep counsel some will speak oracles that a man can not tell which way to take them some will be so fine and so poetical withal that to their seming there shall not stand one hear hair amiss and yet every body else shall think them meter fitter for a ladies chamber than for an earnest matter in any open assembly  some use overmuche repetition of one letter as pitiful poverty prays for a penie but pued presumpcion passes not a poinct pamperyng his panche with pestilent pleasure procuryng his passeport to post it to hell pit there to be punished with pains perpetual others he blames for the affectation of ending a word with a vowel and beginning the next with another some he says end their sentences al alike making their talk style rather to appear rimed meter than to seem plain speech  i heard a preacher preaching and controversial tracts occasioned much writing in english after the reformation delityng much in this kind of composicion who used so often to end his sentence with words like unto that which went before that in my judgment there was not a dosen sentences in his whole sermon but they ended all in rhyme for the most part some not best disposed wished the preacher a lute that with his rimed sermon he might use some pleasant melody and so the people might take pleasure diverse ways and dance if they list some writers he observes disturbed the natural arrangement of their words others were copious when they should be concise the most frequent fault seems to have been the rejection of common and proper phrases for those that were more curious refined and unintelligible fol    a b    a one thomas wilson translated the diana of montomayer a pasoral spanish romance about the year      which has been assigned as the original of the two gentlemen of verona he could hardly be

seven sages of greece see verdier ii     from an ingenious correspondent who has not given me the honor of his name and who appears to be well acquainted with the manners and literature of spain i have received the following notices relating to this institution of which other particulars may be seen in the old french history of languedoc at the end of the second volume of mayans origines de la lingua espanola printed in duodecimo at madrid in      is an extract from a manuscript entitled libro de la art de trovar o gaya sciencia por don enrique de villena said to exist in the library of the cathedral of toledo and perhaps to be found in other libraries of spain it has these particulars  the trovadores had their origin at toulouse about the middle of the twelfth century a consistorio de la gaya sciencia was there founded by ramon vidal de besalin containing more than one hundred and twenty celebrated poets and among these princes kings and emperors their art was extended throughout europe and gave rise to the italian and spanish poetry servio el garona de hippocrene to ramon vidal de besalin succeeded jofre de foxa monge negro who enlarged the plan and wrote what he called continuacion de trovar after him belenguer de troya came from majorca and compiled a treatise de figuras y colores rhetoricos and next gul vedal of majorca wrote la suma vitulina to support the gaya sciencia at the poetical college of toulouse the king of france appropriated privileges and revnues appointing seven matenedores qu liciessen lyes these constituted the laws of love which were afterward abridged by guill moluier under the title tratado de las flores next fray ramon framed a system called doctrinal which was censured by castilnon from thence nothing was written in spanish on the subject till the time of don enrique de villena  so great was the credit of the gay science that don juan the first king of arragon who died      sent an embassy to the king of france requesting that some troubadours might be transmitted to teach this art in his kingdom accordingly two mantenedores were dispatched from toulouse who founded a college for poetry in barcelona consiting of four mantenedores a cavalier a master in theology a maser in laws and an honorable citizen disputes about don juans successor occasioned the removal of the college to tortosa but don ferdinand being elected king don enrique de villena was taken into his service who restored the college and was chosen principal the subjects he proposed were sometimes the praises of the holy virgin of arms of love

  he mentions another edition in      both at paris   mo  it contains remarks on the versification of mysteries and farces and throws many lights on the old french writers  but the french had even an art of poetry so early as the year      in that year thomas sibilet published his art poetique at paris veuve francois regnault in   mo  this piece preserves many valuable anecdotes of the old french poetry and among other particulars which develope the state of the old french drama has the following sensible strictures the french farce contains little or nothing of the latin comedy it has neither acts nor scenes which would only serve to introduce a tedious prolixity for the true subject of the french farce or sottie is every sort of foolery which has a tendency to provoke laughter  the subject of the greek and latin comedy was totally different from every thing on the french stage for it had more morality than drollery and often as much truth as fiction our moralities hold a place indifferently between tragedy and comedy but our farces are really what the romans called mimes or priapees the intended end and effect of which was excessive laughter and on that account they admitted all kinds of licentiousness as our farces do at present in the mean time their pleasantry does not derive much advantage from rhymes however flowing of eight syllables live ii chapter viii at the end of sibilets work is a critical piece of quintil against chapter fontaine first printed separately at paris        mo  sibilets work is chiefly founded on horace his definitions are clear and just and his precepts well explained the most curious part of it is the enumeration of the poets who in his time were of most repute jacques pelletier du mans a physician a mathematician a poet and a voluminous writer on various subjects both in prose and verse also published an art poetique at lions in      by jean de tournes  vo  this critic had sufficient penetration to perceive the false and corrupt taste of his cotemporaries instead of the regular ode and sonnet our language is sophisticated by ballads roundeaux lays and triolets but with these we must rest contented till the farces which have so long infatuated our nation are converted into comedy our martyrplays into tragedy and our romances into heroic poems chapter de lode  and again we have no pieces in our language written in the genuine comic form except some affected and unnatural moralities and other plays of the same character which do not deserve the name of comedy the drama would appear to advantage did it but resume its proper state and ancient dignity we have however some tragedies in french learnedly translated among which is the hecuba of euripides by lazare de baif etc chapter de la comedy et de la tragedy see also to the same purpose collettet sur la poesy morale and guillaume des autels repos dn plus grand travail  of rhyme the same writer says sil netoit question que de parler ornement il ne

 his chapters on imitation and translation have much more philosophy and reflection than are to be expected for his age and contain observations which might edify modern critics see live i chapter v and vi  nor must i forget that pelletier also published a french translation of horaces art of poetry at paris in      par michel vascosan  vo  i presume that joachim du bellays deffense et illustration de la langue francoise was published at no great distance from the year    0 he has the same just notion of the drama as to tragedies and comedies if kings and states would restore them in their ancient glory which has been usurped by farces and moralities i am of opinion that you would lend your assistance and if you wish to adorn our language you know where to find models live ii chapter iv   the italian vernacular criticism began chiefly in commentaries and discourses on the language and phraseology of dante petrarch and boccace i believe one of the first of that kind is le tree fontane di nicolo liburnio sopra la grammatica e leloquenza di dante del petrarcha e del boccacio in venezia per gregorio gregori      in quarto again per marchio sessa       vo  numerous expositions lectures annotations and discourses of the same sort especially on dantes inferno and the florentine dialect appeared soon afterward immediately after the publication of their respective poems ariosto whose orlando furioso was styled the nuova poesia and tasso were illustrated or expounded by commentators more intricate than their text one of the earliest of these is sposizione de simon fornari da reggio sopra lorlando furioso di lodovico ariosto in firenze per lorenzo torrentino      in  vo the second party appeared ibid    0  vo  perhaps the first criticism on what the italians call the volgar lingua is by pietro bembo prose di pietro bembo della volgar lingua divise in tree libri in firenze per lorenzo torrentino      in quarto  but the first edition seems to have been in      this subject was discussed in an endless succession of regole grammaticali osservazioni avvertimenti and ragionamenti here might also be mentioned the annotations although they are altogether explanatory which often accompanied the early translations of the greek and latin classics into italian but i resign this labyrinth of research to the superior opportunities and abilities of the french and italian antiquaries in their native literature to have said nothing on the subject might have been thought an omission and to have said more impertinent i therefore return to our own poetical annals  our three great poets chaucer gower and lydgate seem to have maintained their rank and to have been in high reputation during the period of which we are now treating splendid impressions of large works were at this time great undertakings a sumptuous edition of gowers confessio amantis was published by berthelette in      on the same ample plan in      robert braham printed with great accuracy and a diligent investigation of the ancient copies the first correct edition of lydgates troyboke nothing can be more incorrect than the first edition in       i have before incidentally remarked see supr vol ii p     that nicholas briggam a polite scholar a student at oxford and at the inns of court and a writer of poetry in the year      deposited the bones of chaucer under a new tomb erected at his own cost and inscribed with a new epitaph in the chapel of bishop blase in westminster abbey which still remains undoubtedly chaucer was originally buried in this place leland ites a latin elegy or naenia of thirtyfour lines which he says was composed by stephanus surigonius of milan at the request of william caxton the printer and which leland adds was written on a white tablet by surigoniu on a pillar near chaucers grave in the south i will at westminster script brit galprid chaucerus see caxtons epilogue to chaucers book of fame in caxtons chaucer wood says that briggam exercid his muse much in poetry and took great delight in the works of jeffrey chaucer for whose memory he had so great a respect that he removed his bones into the south crossile or transept of s peters church etc ath oxon i   0 i do not apprehend there was any removal in this case from one part of the abbey to another chaucers omb has appropriated this aile or transept to the sepulture or to the honorary monuments of our poets  wilson as we have just seen in a citation from his rhetoric records an anecdote that the more accomplished and elegant courtiers were perpetually quoting chaucer yet this must be restricted to the courtiers of edward the sixth and indeed there is a peculiar reason why chaucer exclusive of his real excellence should have been the favorite of a court which laid the foundations of the reformation of religion it was that his poems abounded with satirical strokes against the corruptions of the church and the dissolute manners of the monks and undoubtedly chaucer long before a lively and popular writer greatly assisted the doctrines of his cotemporary wickliffe in opening the eyes of the people to the absurdities of popery and exposing its impostures in a vein of humor and pleasantry fox the martyrologist a weak and a credulous compiler perhaps goes too far in affirming that chaucer has undeniably proved the pope to be the antichrist of the apocalypse tom ii p    edit        of the reign of queen mary we are accustomed to conceive every thing that is calamitous and disgusting but when we turn our eyes from its political evils to the objects which its literary history presents a fair and flourishing scene appears in this prospect the mind feels a repose from contemplating the fates of those venerable prelates who suffered the most excruciating death for the purity and inflexibility of their faith and whose unburied bodies dissipated in ashes and undistinguished in the common mass have acquired a more glorious monument than if they had been interred in magnificent shrines which might have been visited by pilgrims loaded with superstitious gifts and venerated with the pomp of mistaken devotion  sect xxxviii the first poem which presents itself at the commencement of the reign of queen elisabeth is the play of gordobuc written by thomas sackville lord buckhurst the original contriver of the mirror of magistrates it is scarcely worth observing that one thomas brice at the accession of elisabeth printed in english meter a register of the martyrs and confessors under queen mary land for r

plan accurately to ark the progress of our drama much less to examine the merit of particular plays but as this piece is perhaps the first specimen in our language of an heroic tale written in blank verse divided into acts and scenes and clothed in all the formalities of a regular tragedy it seems justly to deserve a more minute and a distinct discussion in this general view of our poetry  it was first exhibited in the great hall of the inner temple by the students of that society as part of the entertainment of a grand christmas and afterward before queen elisabeth at whitehall on the eighteenth day of january in      it was never intended for the press but being surreptitiously and very carelessly printed in      an exact edition with the consent and under the inspection of the

bodleian copy of this edition are bound up four pamphlets against the papists by thomas norton  in the edition of      it is called the tragedy of gordobuc the whole title of that edition runs thus

printed before that of      for it retains all the errors of griffiths first or spurious edition of      in the preface prefixed to the edition of      is the following passage where whereas this tragedy was for furniture of part of the grand christmasse in the inner temple first written about nine years ago by the right honorable thomas now lord buckhurst and by t norton and afterward showed before her majesty and never intended by the authors thereof to be published yet one w g getting a copy thereof at some young mans hand that lacked a little money and much discretion in the last great plague anno      about five years past while the said lord was out of england and t norton far out of london and neither of them both made privy put it forth exceedingly corrupted etc w g is william griffith the printer in fleet street abovementioned mr garrick had another old quarto edition printed by alde in    0  these are the circumstances of the fable of this tragedy gordobuc a king of britain about six hundred years before christ made in his lifetime a division of his kingdom to his sons ferrex and porrex the two young princes within five years quarrelled for universal sovereignty a civil was ensued and porrex lew his elder brother ferrex their mother viden who loved ferrex best revenged his death by entering porrexs chamber in the night and murdering him in his sleep the people exaperated at the cruelty and treachery of this murder rose in rebellion and killed both viden and gordobuc the nobility then assembled collected an army and destroyed the rebels an intestine war commenced between the chief lords the succession of the crown became uncertain and arbitrary for want of the lineal royal issue and the country destitute of a king and wasted by domestic slaughter was reduced to a state of the most miserable desolation  in the dramatic conduct of this tale the unities of time and place are eminently and visibly violated a defect which shakespeare so frequently commits but which he covers by the magic of his poetry the greater part of this long and eventful history is included in the representation but in a story so fertile of bloodshed no murder is committed on the stage it is worthy of remark that the death of porrex in the bedchamber is only related perhaps the players had not yet learned to die nor was the poniard so essential an article as at present among the implements of the propertyroom nor is it improbable that to kill a man on the stage was not now avoided as a spectacle shocking to humanity but because it was difficult and inconvenient to be represented the writer has followed the series of facts related in the chronicles without any material variation or fictitious embarrassments and with the addition only of a few necessary and obvious characters  there is a chorus of four ancient and sage men of britain who regularly close every act the last excepted with an ode in longlined stanzas drawing back the attention of the audience to the substance of what has just passed and illustrating it by recapitulatory moral reflections and poetical or historical allusions of these the best is that which terminates the fourth act in which prince porrex is murdered by his mother viden these are the two first stanzas  when greedy lust in royal seat to reign has reft all care of gods and eke of men and cruel heart wrath treason and disdain within the ambicious breast are lodged then behold how mischief wide herself displaies and with the brothers hand the brother slaies when blood thus shed does stain the heavens face crying to joue for vengeance of the deed the mighty god even moves from his place with wrath to wreak then sendes he forth with speed the dreadful furies daughters of the night with serpents girt carrying the whip of ire with hair of stinging snakes and shining bright with flames and blood and with a brande of fire these for revenge of wretched murder done do make the mother kill her only son blood asks blood and death must death requite joue by his just and everlasting doom justly has ever so required it etc act iv sc ult  in the imagery of these verses we discern no faint traces of the hand which drew the terrible guardians of hellgate in the induction to the mirror of magistrates  the moral beauties and the spirit of the following ode which closes the third act will perhaps be more pleasing to many readers  the lust of kingdom kingdoms edit      knows no sacred faith no rule of reason no regard of right no kindly love no fear of heavens wrath but with contempt of gods and mans despite through blodie slaughter does prepare the ways to fatal scepter and accursed reign the son so lothes the fathers lingerynge days ne dreads his hand in brothers blood to stain o wretched prince ne do thou yet record the yet fressh murders done within the land of thie forefathers when the cruel sword bereft morgain his liefe with cosyns hand thus fatal plagues pursue the guilty race whose murderous hand imbrued with giltles blood asks vengeance still still omit edit       before the heavens face with endless mischiefs on the cursed brood the wicked child thus this edit      bringes to woeful ier the mournful plaintes to waste his weary very a worse reading in edit      life thus do the cruel flames of civyll ier destroy the parted reign with hateful strife and hence does spring the well from which does flo the dead black streams of mourning mournings edit       plaint and woe act iii sc ult  every act is introduced as was the custom in our old plays with a piece of machinery called the dumb show shadowing by an allegorical exhibition the matter that was immediately to follow in the construction of this spectacle and its personifications much poetry and imagination was often displayed it is some apology for these prefigurations that they were commonly too mysterious and obscure to forestal the future events with any degree of clearness and precision not that this mute mimicry was always typical of the ensuing incidents it sometimes served for a compendious introduction of such circumstances as could not commodiously be comprehended within the bounds of the representation it sometimes supplied deficiencies and covered the want of business our ancestors were easily satified with this artificial supplement of one of the most important unities which abundantly filled up the interval that was necessary to pass while a hero was expected from the holy land or a princess was imported married and brought to bed mean time the greater part of the audience were probably more pleased with the emblematical pageantry than the poetical dialogue although both were alike unintelligible  i will give a specimen in the domme show preceding the fourth act first the music of howeboies began to play duringe which there came forth from under the stage as though out of hell three furies alecto megera and ctesiphone tisiphone  clad in black garments sprinkled with blood and flames their bodies girt with snakes their heds spread with serpents instead of hear the one bearing in her hand  snake the other a whip and the third a burning firebrande each driuynge before them a king and a queen which moved by furies unnaturally had slain their own children the names of the kings and queens were these tantalus medea athamas ino cambises althea after that the furies and these had passed about the stage thrice they departed and then the music ceased hereby was signified the unnatural murders to follow that is to say porrex slain by his own mother and of king gordobuc and queen viden killed by their own subjectes here by the way the visionary procession of kings and queens long since dead evidently resembles our author sackvilles original model of the mirror of magistrates and for the same reason reminds us of a similar train of royal specter in the tentscene of shakespeares king richard the third  i take this opportunity of expressing my surprise that this ostensible comment of the dumb show should not regularly appear in the tragedies of shakespeare there are even proofs that he treated it with contempt and ridicule although some critics are of opinion that because it is never described in form at the close or commencement of his acts it was therefore never introduced shakespeares aim was to collect an audience and for this purpose all the common expedients were necessary no drmatic writer of his age has more battles or ghosts his representations abound with the usual appendages of mechanical terror and he adopts all the superstitions of the theater this problem can only be resolved into the activity or the superiority of a mind which either would not be entangled by the formality or which saw through the futility of this unnatural and extrinsic ornament it was not by declamation or by pantomime that shakespeare was to fix his eternal dominion over the hearts of mankind  to return to sackville that this tragedy was never a favorite among our ancestors and had long fallen into general oblivion is to be attributed to the nakedness and uninteresting nature of the plot the tedious length of the speeches the want of a discrimination of character and almost a total absence of pathetic or critical situations it is true that a mother kills her own son but this act of barbarous and unnatural impiety to say nothing of its almost unexampled atrocity in the tender sex proceeds only from a brutal principle of sudden and impetuous revenge it is not the consequence of any deep machination nor is it founded in a proper preparation of previous circumstances she is never before introduced to our notice as a wicked or designing character she murders her son porrex because in the commotions of a civil dissension in selfdefence after repeated provocations and the strongest proofs of the basest ingratitude and treachery he had slain his rival brother not without the deepest compunction and remorse for what he had done a mother murdering a son is a fact which must be received with horror but it required to be complicated with other motives and prompted by a cooperation of other causes to rouse our attention and work upon our passions i do not mean that any other motive could have been found to palliate a murder of such a nature yet it was possible to heighten and to divide the ditress by rendering this bloody mother under the notions of human frailty an object of our compassion as well as of our abhorrence but perhaps these artifices were not yet known or wanted the general story of the play is great in its political consequences and the leading incidents are important but not sufficiently intricate to awaken our curiosity and hold us in suspense nothing is perplexed and nothing unravelled the opposition of interests is such as does not affect our nicer feelings in the plot of a play our pleasure arises in proportion as our expectation is excited  yet it must be granted that the language of gordobuc has great purity and perspicuity and that it is entirely free from that tumid phraseology which does not seem to have taken place till playwriting had become a trade and our poets found it their intrest to captivate the multitude by the false sublime and by those exaggerated imageries and pedantic metaphors which are the chief blemishes of the scenes of shakespeare and which are at this day mistaken for his capital beauties by too many readers here also we perceive another and a strong reason why this play was never popular  sir philip sydney in his admirable defense of poesy remarks that this tragedy is full of notable morality but tragedies are not to instruct us by the intermixture of moral sentences but by the force of example and the effect of the story in the first act the three counselors are introduced debating about the division of the kingdom in long and elaborate speeches which are replete with political advice and maxims of civil prudence but this stately sort of declamation whatever eloquence it may display and whatever policy it may teach is undramatic unanimated and unaffecting sentiment and argument will never supply the place of ation upon the stage not to mention that these grave harangues have some tincture of the formal modes of address and the ceremonious oratory which were then in fashion but we must allow that in the strain of dialogue in which they are professedly written they have uncommon merit even without drawing an apology in their favor from their antiquity and that they contain much dignity strength of reflection and good sense couched in clear expression and polished numbers i shall first produce a specimen from the speech of arostus who is styled a counellor to the king and who is made to defend  specious yet perhaps the least rational side of the question  and in your life while you shall so behold their rule their virtues and their noble deede such as their kind behighteth to us all great be the profits that shall grow thereof your age in quiet shall the longer last your lasting age shall be their longer stay for cares of kings that rule as you have ruled for public wealth and

their will an open prey to traitorous flattery the greatest pestilence of noble youth which peril shall be past if in your life their tempred youth with aged fathers awe be brought in ure of skillful staiedness etc act i sc ii  from an obsequious complaisance to the king who is present the topic is not agitated with that opposition of opinion and variety of arguments which it naturally suggests and which would have enlivened the disputation and displayed diversity of character but eubulus the kings secretary declares his sentiments with some freedom and seems to be the most animated of all our three political orators  to part your realm unto my lords your sons i think not good for you ne yet for them but worst of all for this our native land within for with edit      one land one single rule is best divided reigns do make divided hearts but peace preserues the country and the prince such is in man the gredie mind to reign so great is his desire to climb alot in wordly stage the stateliest parts to bear that faith and justice and all kindly natural love do yield unto desire of sovereignty where egall state does raise an egall hope to win the thing that either would attain

      to join again the sondred unity what wast of towns and people in the land what treasons heaped on murders and on spoils whose just revenge even yet is scarcely ceased ruthful remembrance is yet raw had edit      in mind etc ibid  the illustration from brutus is here both apposite and poetical  spence with a reference to the situation of the author lord buckhurst in the court of queen elisabeth has observed in his preface to the modern edition of this tragedy that it is no wonder if the language of kings and statesmen should be less happily imitated by a poet than a privy counselor this is an insinuation that shakespeare who has left many historical tragedies was less able to conduct some parts of a royal story than the statesman lord buckhurst but i will venture to pronounce that whatever merit there is in this play and particularly in the speeches we have just been examining it is more owing to the poet than the privy counselor if a first minister was to write a tragedy i believe the piece will be the better the less it has of the first minister when a statesman turns poet i should not wish him to fetch his ideas or his language from the canbinet i know not why a king should be better qualified than a private man to make kings talk in blank verse  the chaste elegance of the following description of a region abounding in every convenience will gratify the lover of classical purity  yea and that half which in within edit      abounding store of things that serve to make a welthie realm in stately cities and in fruitful soil in temperate breathing of the milder heaven in things of nedeful use which friendly sea transportes by traffike from the foreign parts ports edit       in flowing wealth in honor and in force etc act ii sc i  the close of marcellas narration of the murder of porrex by the queen which many poets of a more enlightened age would have exhibited to the spectators is perhaps the most moving and pathetic speech in the play the reader will observe that our author yet to a good purpose has transferred the ceremonies of the tournament to the court of an old british king  o queen of adamante o marble breaste if not the favor of his comely face if not his princely chere and countenance his valiant active arms his manly breaste if not his faier and semelie personage his noble lymmes in such proporcion in the edition

tied on thy helm and charge thy staff to please thy ladies eye that bowed the head piece of thy friendly foe how often in arms on horse to bend the mace the shat of the lauce  how often in arms on foot to break the sword which never now these eyes may see again act iv s ii  marcella the only lady in the play except the queen is one of the maids of honor and a modern writer of tragedy would have made her in love with the young prince who is murdered  the queen laments the loss of her eldest and favorite son whose defeat and death had just been announced in the following oliloquy the ideas are too general although happily expressed but there is some imagination in her wishing the old massy palace had long ago fallen and crushed her to death  why should i live and linger forth my time in longer liefe to double my distress o me most woeful wight whom no mishap long ere this day could have bereued hence might not these hands by fortune or by fate have perst this breast and life with iron re or in this pallaice here where i so long have spent my days could not that happy hour ones ones have hapt in which these hugie frames with death by fall might have oppressed me or should not this most hard and cruel soil so often where i have pressed my wretched steps sometime had ruthe of mine accursed liefe to rend in twain and swallowe me therein so had my bones possessed now in peace their happy grave within the closed ground and greadie worms had gnawen this pyned heart without my feelynge pain so should not now this lyvynge breast remain the ruthefull tomb wherein my heart yelden to death is graued etc act iv sc i  there is some animation in these imprecations of prince ferrex upon his own head when he protests that he never conceived any malicious design or intended any injury against his brother porrex act ii sc i   the wrekefull gods pour on my cursed head eternal plagues and never dyinge woes the hellish prince pluto adiudge my dampened ghost to tantales tantalus edit      thirste or proud ixions wheel or cruel gripe the vulture of prometheus  to gnaw my growing heart to during torments and unquenched flames if ever i conceived so foul a thought to wish his end of life or yet of reign it must be remembered that the ancient britons were supposed to be immediately descended from the trojan brutus and that consequently they were acquainted with the pagan history and mythology gordobuc has a long allusion to the miseries of the siege of troy act iii sc i   in this strain of correct versification and language porrex explains to his father gordobuc the treachery of his brother ferrex  when thus i saw the knot of love unknitte all honest league and faithful promise broke the law of kind nature and trothe thus rent in twain his heart on mischief set and in his breast black treason hid then then did i dispaier that ever time could win him friend to me then saw i how he smyled with slaying knife wrapped under cloak then saw i deep deceit lurk in his face and death prepared for me etc act iv sc ii  as the notions of subordination of the royal authority and the divine institution of kings predominated in the reign of queen elisabeth it is extraordinary that eight lines inculcating in plain terms the doctrine of passive and unresisting obedience to the prince which appeared in the fifth act of the first edition of this tragedy should have been expunged in the edition of      published under the immediate inspection of the authors see signat d v edit       it is well known that the calvinists carried their ideas of reformation and refinement into government as well as religion and it seems probable that these eight verses were suppressed by thomas norton sackvilles supposed assistant in the play who was not only an active and i believe a sensible puritan but a licencer of the publication of books under the commission of the bishop of london for insance  seven steps to heaven also the seven palmes reduced into meter by w hunnys the honny succles etc by hunnys nov        to denham registr station b fol     a also in the same year  the picture of two pernicious varlettes called prig pickthank and clem clawbacke described by a peevishe painter ibid fol     a all under the hands of mr thomas norton et alibi pasim the stage of popish toys written by t n perhaps the same is licenced to binneman feb       0 ibid fol     a   as to nortons assistance in this play it is said on better authority than that of antony wood who supposes gordobuc to have been in old english rhyme that the three first acts were written by thomas norton and the two last by sackville but the force of internal evidence often prevails over the authority of assertion a testimony which is diminished by time and may be rendered suspicious from a variety of other circumstances throughout the whole piece there is an invariable uniformity of diction and versification sackville has two poems of considerable length in the mirror of magistrates which fortunately furnish us with the means of comparison and every scene of gordobuc is visibly marked with his characteristical manner which consists in a perspicuity of style and a command of numbers superior to the tone of his times the same may be said of sackvilles sonnet prefixed to thomas hobys english version of castiglios i cortegiano first printed in      the third part on the behavior of courtladies appears to have been translated in      at the request of the marchioness of northampton  thomas nortons poetry is of a very different and a subordinate cast and if we may judge from his share in our metrical psalmody he seems to have been much more properly qualified to shine in the miserable mediocrity of sternholds stanza and to write spiritual rhymes for the solace of his illuminated brethren than to reach the bold and impassioned elevations of tragedy  sect xxxix this appearance of a regular tragedy with the division of acts and scenes and the accompaniment of the ancient chorus represented both at the middle temple and at whitehall and written by the most accomplished nobleman of the court of queen elisabeth seems to have directed the attention of our more learned poets to the study of the old classical drama and in a short time to have produced vernacular versions of the jocasta of euripides as it is called and of the ten tragedies of seneca i do not find that it was speedily followed by any original compositions on the same legitimate model  the jocasta of euripides was translated by george gascoigne and francis kinwelmersh both students of grays inn and acted in the refectory of that society in the year      gascoigne translated the second third and fifth acts and kinwelmersh the first and fourth it was printed in gascoignes poems of which more will be said hereafter in      under the following title jocasta a tragedy written in greek by euripides translated and digested into act by george gascoigne and francis kinwelmershe of graies inn and there by them presented an      the epilogue was written in quatraines by christopher yelverton then one of their brother students so strongly were our audiences still attached to spectacle that the authors did not venture to present their play without introducing a dumb show at the beginning of every act for this however they had the example and authority of gordobuc some of the earliest specimens of inigo joness grecian architecture are marred by gothic ornaments  it must however be observed that this is by no means a just or exact translation of the jocasta that is the phoenissae of euripides it is partly a paraphrase and partly an abridgement of the greek tragedy there are many omissions retrenchments and transpositions the chorus the characters and the substance of the story are entirely retained and the tenor of the dialogue is often preserved through whole scenes some of the beautiful odes of the greek chorus are neglected and others substituted in their places newly written by the translators in the favorite address to mars see phoeniss page   0 edit barnes     etc   gascoigne has totally deserted the rich imagery of euripides yet has found means to form an original ode which is by no means destitute of pathos or imagination  o fierce and furious mars whose harmefull heart reioiceth most to shed the giltlesse blood whose headie will does all the world subvart and does envy the pleasant merry mood of our estate that erst in quiet stood why do thou thus our harmless town annoy which mighty bacchus governed in joy father of war and death that do remove with wrathful wrecke from woeful mothers breast the trusty pledges of their tender love so grant the gods that for our final rest dame venus pleasant looks may please thee best whereby when thou shall all amazed stand the sword may fall out of thy trembling hand so tibullus where he cautions mar not to gaze on his mistress lib iv ii   at tu violente caveto ne tibi miranti turpiter arma cadant   and thou may prove some other way full well the bloody prowess of thy mighty spear wherewith thou raisest from the depth of hell the wrathful sprites of all the furies there who when they wake do wander every where and never rest to range about the costs to enrich that pit with spoil of damned ghostes and when thou have our fields forsaken thus let cruel discord bear thee company engirt with snakes and serpents venomous even she that can with red vermilion die the gladsome green that florisht pleasantly and make the greedy ground a drinking cvp to sup the blood of murdered bodies up yet thou return o joy and pleasant peace from whence thou did against our wills depart ne let thy worthy mind from travel cease to chase disdain out of the poysned heart that raised war to all our pains and smart even from the breast of oedipus his son whose swelling pride has all this jar begone etc act ii sc ult  i am of opinion that our translators thought the many mythological and historical allusions in the greek chorus too remote and unintelligible perhaps too cumbersome to be exhibited in english in the ode to concord which finishes the fourth act translated by kinwelmershe there is great elegance of expression and versification it is not in euripides  o blissful concord bred in sacred breast of him that rules the restlesserolling sky that to the earth for mans assured rest from height of heavens vouchsafest down to fly in thee alone the mighty power does lie with sweet accord to keep the frowning stars and every planet else from hurtful wars in thee in thee such noble virtue bydes as may command the mightiest gods to bend from thee alone such sugared friendship slydes as mortal wights can scarcely

antigone the rival in filial fidelity of lears cordelia to touch the dead and murdered bodies of his queen jocasta and his sons eteocles and polynices it appears to be the chief fault of the translators that they have weakened the force of the original which consists in a pathetic brevity by needless dilatations and the affectations of circumlocution the whole dialogue in the original is carried on in single lines such however is the pregnant simplicity of the greek language that it would have been impossible to have rendered line for line in english  oedipus daughter i must commend

about sixty verses of his own invention in the beginning of the second act he has added a new scene in which he introduces the spectre of achilles raised from hell and demanding the sacrifice of polyxena this scene which is in the octave stanza has much of the air of one of the legends in the mirror of magistrates to the chorus of this act he has subjoined three stanzas instead of translating the chorus of the third act which abounds with the hard names of the ancient geography and which would both have puzzled the translator and tired the english reader he has substituted a new ode in his

severely reproached and universally proscribed i will instance only in the affectionate shepherd of richard barnefielde printed in      here through the course of twenty sonnets not inelegant and

play called gallathea played before the queen at greenwich on new years day by the choristers of saint pauls  it will perhaps be sufficient barely to mention spensers culex which is a vague and arbitrary paraphrase of a poem not properly belonging to virgil from the testimony of many early latin writers it may be justly concluded that virgil wrote an elegant poem with this title nor is it improbable that in the cuex at present attributed to virgil some very few of the original phrases and even verses may remain under the accumulated incrustation of critics imitators interpolators and paraphrasts which corrupts what it conceals but the texture the character and substance of the genuine poem is almost entirely lost the ceiris or the fable of nisus and scylla which follows although never mentioned by any writer of antiquity has much fairer pretensions to genuineness at least the ceiris allowing for uncommon depravations of time and transcription appears in its present state to be a poem of the augustan age and is perhaps the identical piece dedicated to the messala whose patronage it solicits it has that rotundity of versification which seems to have been studied after the roman poetry emerged from barbarism it has a general simplicity and often a native strength of coloring nor is it tinctured except by the casual innovation of grammarians with those sophistications both of sentiment and expression which afterward of course took place among the roman poets and which would have betrayed a recent forgery it seems to be the work of a young poet but its digressions and descriptions which are often too prolix are not only the marks of a young poet but of early poetry it is interspersed with many lines now in the eclogues georgics and eneid here is an argument which seems to assign it to virgil a cotemporary poet would not have ventured to steal from poems so well known it was natural at least allowable for virgil to steal from a performance of his youth on which he did not set any great value and which he did not scruple to rob of a few ornaments deserving a better place this consideration excludes cornelius gallus to whom fontanini with much acute criticism has ascribed the ceiris nor for the reason given would virgil have stolen from gallus the writer has at least the art of virgil in either suppressing or throwing into shade the trite and uninteresting incidents of the common fabulous history of scylla which were incapable of decoration or had been preoccupied by other poets the dialogue between the young princess scylla who is deeply in love and her nurse has much of the pathos of virgil there are some traces which discover an imitation of lucretius but on the whole the structure of the verses and the predominant cast and manner of the composition exactly resemble the argonautica of catullus or the epithalamium of peleus and thetis i will instance in the following passage in which every thing is distinctly and circumstantially touched and in an affected pomp of numbers he is alluding to the stole of minerva interwoven with the battle of the giants and exhibited at athens in the magnificent panathenaic festival the classical reader will perceive one or two interpolations and lament that this rich piece of embroidery has suffered a little from being unskilfully darned by another and a more modern

tale deae velum solemni in tempore portant ver    seq  the same stately march of hexameters is observable in tibulluss tedious panegyric on messala a poem which if it should not be believed to be of tibulluss hand may at least from this reasoning be adjudged to his age we are sure that catullus could not have been the author of the ceiris as messala to whom it is inscribed was born but a very few years before the death of catullus one of the chief circumstances of the story is a purple lock of hair which grew on the head of nisus king of megara and on the preservation of which the safety of that city now besieged by minos king of crete entirely depended scylla nisuss daughter falls in love with minos whom she sees from the walls of megara she finds means to cut off this sacred ringlet the city is taken and she is married to minos i am of opinion that tibullus in the following passage alludes to the ceiris then newly published and which he points out by this leading and fundamental fiction of nisuss purple lock  pieridas pueri doctos et amate poetas aurea nec superent munera pieridas carmine purpurea est nisi coma carmina ni sint ex humero pelopis non nituisset ebur eleg lib i

that he consulted the prose latin version more than the greek original he says sensibly enough it is the part of every knowing and judicious interpreter not to follow the number and order of words but the material things themselves and sentences to weigh diligently and to clothe and adorn them with words and such a style and form of oration as are most apt for the language into which they are converted the danger lies in too lavish an application of this sort of clothing that it may not disguise what it should only adorn i do not say that this is chapmans fault but he has by no means represented the dignity or the simplicity homer he is sometimes paraphrastic and redundant but more frequently retrenches or impoverishes what he could not feel and express in the mean time he labors with the inconvenience of an awkward inharmonious and unheroic measure imposed by custom but disgustful to modern ears yet he is not always without strength or spirit he has enriched our language with many compound epithets so much in the manner of homer such as the silverfooted thetis the silverthroned juno the triplefeathered helm the highwalled thebes the faireaired boy the silverflowing floods the hugelypeopled towns the grecians navybound the strongwinged lance and many more which might be collected dryden reports that waller never could read chapmans homer without a degree of transport pope is of opinion that chapman covers his defects by a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine homer himself to have writ before he arrived to years of discretion but his fire is too frequently darkened by that sort of fustian which now disfigured the diction of our tragedy  he thus translates the comparison of diomed to the autumnal star at the beginning of the fifth book the lines are in his best manner  from his bright helm and shield did burn a most unwearied fire like rich autumnus golden lamp whose brightness men admire past all the

longer than chapmans if chapman affected the reputation of rendering line for line the specious expedient of choosing a protracted measure which concatenated two lines together undoubtedly favored his

title of this work zodiacus vitae written in latin hexameters by marcello palingeni an italian about the year      the reader at least expects some astronomical allusions but it has not the most distant connection with the stars except that the poet is once transported to the moon not to measure her diameter but for a moral purpose and that he once takes occasion in his general survey of the world and in reference to his title to introduce a philosophic explanation of the zodiacal system b i aquarius  the author meaning to divide his poem into twelve books chose to distinguish each with a name of the celestial signs just as herodotus but with less affectation and inconsistency marked the nine books or divisions of his history with the names of the nine muses yet so strange and pedantic a title is not totally without a conceit as the author was born at stellada or stellata a province of ferrara and from whence he calls himself marcellus palingenius stellatus it should have been stellatensis   this poem is a general satire on life yet without peevishness or malevolence and with more of the solemnity of the censor than the petulance of the satirist much of the morality is couched under allegorical personages and adventures the latinity is tolerably pure but there is a mediocrity in the versification palingeniuss transitions often discover more quickness of imagination and fertility of reflection than solidity of judgment having started a topic he pursues it through all its possible affinities and deviates into the most distant and unnecessary digressions yet there is a facility in his manner which is not always unpleasing nor is the general conduct of the work void of art and method he moralizes with a boldness and a liberality of sentiment which were then unusual and his maxims and strictures are sometimes tinctured with a spirit of libertinism which without exposing the opinions must have offended the gravity of the more orthodox ecclesiastics he fancies that a confident philosopher who rashly presumes to scrutinize the remote mysteries of nature is shown in heaven like an ape for the public diversion of the gods a thought evidently borrowed by pope see essay on pope p     although he submits his performance to the sentence of the church he treats the authority of the popes and the voluptuous lives of the monks with the severest acrimony it was the last circumstance that chiefly contributed to give this poem almost the rank of a classic in the reformed countries and probably produced an early english translation after his death he was pronounced an heretic and his body was taken up and committed to the flames a measure which only contributed to spread his book and disseminate his doctrines  googe seems chiefly to have excelled in rendering the descriptive and flowery passages of this moral zodiac he thus describes the spring  the earth again does florishe green the trees repair their spring with pleasant notes the nightingale

now circumscribed within the bounds of the classics whether poets historians orators or critics of greece and rome  i have before observed that with our frequent tours through italy and our affectation of italian manners about the middle of the sixteenth century the italian poets became fashionable and that this circumstance for a time at least gave a new turn to our poetry the italian poets however were but in few hands and a practice of a more popular and general nature yet still resulting from our communications with italy now began to prevail which produced still greater revolutions this was the translation of italian books chiefly on fictitious and narrative subjects into english  the learned ascham thought this novelty in our literature too important to be passed over without observation in his reflections on the course of an ingenuous education it will be much to our purpose to transcribe what he has said on this subject although i think his arguments are more like the reasonings of a rigid puritan than of a man of liberal views and true penetration and that he endeavors to account for the origin and to state the consequences of these translations more in the spirit of an early calvinistic preacher than as a sensible critic or a polite scholar these be the inchauntments of circe brought out of italy to mar mens manners in england much by example of ill life but more by precepts of fond books of late translated out of italian into english sold in every shop in london commended by honest titles the sooner to corrupt honest manners dedicated over

circumspect herein than they are ten sermons at pauls cross do not so much good for moving men to true doctrine as one of these books does harm with enticing men to ill living yea i say farther these

wantonness do now boldly contene all severe books that sound to honesty and godliness in our forefathers time when papistrie as a standing poole covered and ouerflowed all england few books were red in our tongue saving certain books of chivalry as they said for pastime and pleasure which as some say were made in monasteries by idle monks or wanton chanons as one for example morte arthur the whole pleasure of which book stands in two special points in open mans slaghter and bold bawdrie in which book those be counted the noblet knights that do kill most men without any quarrel and commit fowlest aduoulteries by sutlest shifts as sir launcelote with the wife of king arthure his master sir tristram with the wife of king mark his vnle sir lamerocke with the wife of king lote that was his own aunte this is good stuff for wise men to laughe at or honest men to take pleasure at yet i know when gods bible was banished the court and morte arthur received into the princes chamber what toys the daily reading of such a book may work in the will of a young ientleman or a young maid that lives welthely and idly wife men can judge and honest men do pity and yet ten morte arthures do not the tenth part so much harm as one of these books made in italy and translated in england they open not fond and common ways to vice but such subtle cunning new and diverse shifts to carry young wills to vanity and young wits to mischief to teach old bawdes new school points as the simple head of an englishman is not hable to invent nor never was heard of in england before yea when papistrie ouerflowed all suffer these books to be read and they shall soon displace all books of godly learning for they carrying the will to vanity and marring good manners shall easily corrupt the mind with ill opinions and false judgment in doctrine first to think ill of all true religion and at last to think nothing of god himself one special point that is to be learned in italy and italian books and that which is most to be lamented and therefore more needful to be looked to there be more of these ungracious books set out in print within these few months than have been seen in england many score years before and because our englishmen made italians cannot hurt but certain persons and in certain places therefore these italian books are made english to bring mischiee enough openly and boldly to all states conditions of life  great and mean young and old every where  our english men italianated have more in reverence the triumphs of petrarche in such universal vogue were the triumphs of petrarch or h trionfi d amor that they were made into a public pageant at the entrance i think of charles the fifth into madrid  than the genesis of moses they make more account of tullies offices

exactly in the style of prynnes histriomastix it must indeed be confessed that by these books many pernicious obscenities were circulated and perhaps the doctrine of intrigue more accurately taught and exemplified than before but every advantage is attended with its inconveniences and abuses that to procure translations of italian tales was a plot of the papists either for the purpose of facilitating the propagation of their opinions of polluting the minds of our youth or of diffusing a spirit of skepticism i am by no means convinced but i have nothing to do with the moral effects of these versions i mean only to show their influence on our literature more particularly on our poetry although i reserve the discussion of this point for a future section at present my design is to give the reader a full and uniform view of the chief of these translations from the italian which appeared in england before the year   00  i will begin with boccace the reader recollects boccaces theseid and troilus many of his tales and large passages from petrarch and dante translated by chaucer but the golden mine of italian fiction opened by chaucer was soon closed and forgotten i must however premise that the italian language now began to grow so fashionable that it was explained in lexicons and grammars written in english and with a view to the illustration of the three principal italian poets so early as    0 were published principal rules of the italian grammar with a dictionarie for the better understanding of boccase petrarche and dante gthered into this tongue by william

fidelity than judgment and industry but his memory failing in his last calamitous indisposition he probably gave me the name of one novel for another i remember he added a circumstance which may lead to a discovery that the principal character of the romance answering to shakespeares prospero was a chemical necromancer who had bound a spirit like ariel to obey his call and perform his services it was a common pretense of the dealers in the occult sciences to have a demon at command at least aurelio or orelio was probably one of the names of this romance the production and multiplication of gold being the grand object of alchemy taken at large the magical part of the tempest is founded in that sort of philosophy which was practiced by john dee and his associates and has been called the rosicrusian the name ariel came from the talmudistic mysteries with which the learned jews had infected this science  to this head must also be referred the collections which appeared before   00 of

plin epist viii      sect xliii enough has been opened of the reign of queen elisabeth to afford us an opportunity of forming some general reflections tending to establish a full estimate of the genius of the poetry of that reign and which by drawing conclusions from what has been said and directing the reader to what he is to expect will at once be recapitulatory and preparatory such a survey perhaps might have stood with more propriety as an introduction to this reign but it was first necessary to clear the way by many circumstantial details and the regular narration of those particulars which lay the foundation of principles and suggest matter for discursive observation my sentiments on this subject shall therefore compose the concluding section of the present volume  the age of queen elisabeth is commonly called the golden age of english poetry it certainly may not improperly be styled the most poetical age of these annals  among the great features which strike us in the poetry of this period are the predominancy of fable of fiction and fancy and a predilection for interesting adventures and pathetic events i will endeavor to assign and explain the cause of this characteristic distinction which may chiefly be referred to the following principles sometimes blended and sometimes operating singly the revival and vernacular versions of the classics the importation and translation of italian novels the visionary reveries or refinements of false philosophy a degree of superstition sufficient for the purpose of poetry the adoption of the machineries of romance and the frequency and improvements of allegoric exhibition in the popular spectacles  when the corruptions and impostures of popery were abolished the fashion of cultivating the greek and roman learning became universal and the literary character was no longer appropriated to scholars by profession but assumed by the nobility and gentry the ecclesiastics had found it their interest to keep the languages of antiquity to themselves and men were eager to know what had been so long injuriously concealed truth propagates truth and the mantle of mystery was removed not only from religion but from literature the laity who had now been taught to assert their natural privileges became impatient of the old monopoly of knowledge and demanded admittance to the usurpations of the clergy the general curiosity for new discoveries heightened either by just or imaginary ideas of the treasures contained in the greek and roman writers excited all persons of leisure and fortune to study the classics the pedantry of the present age was the politeness of the last an accurate comprehension of the phraseology and peculiarities of the ancient poets historians and orators which yet seldom went farther than a kind of technical erudition was an indispensable and almost the principal object in the circle of a gentlemans education every young lady of fashion was carefully instituted in classical letters and the daughter of a duchess was taught not only to distill strong waters but to construe greek among the learned females of high distinction queen elisabeth herself was the most conspicuous roger ascham her preceptor speaks with rapture of her astonishing progress in the greek nouns and declares with no small degree of triumph that during a long residence at windsorcastle she was accustomed to read more greek in a day than some prebendary of that church did latin in one week schoolmaster p    b edit       to  and although perhaps a princess looking out words in a lexicon and writing down hard phrases from plutarchs lives may be thought at present a more incompatible and extraordinary character than a canon of windsor understanding no greek and but little latin yet elisabeths passion for these acquisitions was then natural and resulted from the genius and habitudes of her age  the books of antiquity being thus familiarised to the great every thing was tinctured with ancient history and mythology the heathen gods although discountenanced by the calvinists on a suspicion of their tending to cherish and revive a spirit of idolatry came into general vogue when the queen paraded through a countrytown almost every pageant was a pantheon when she paid a visit at the house of any of her nobility at entering the hall she was saluted by the penates and conducted to her privychamber by mercury even the pastrycooks were expert mythologists at dinner select transformations of ovids metamorphoses were exhibited in confectionary and the splendid iceing of an immense historic plumbcake was embossed with a delicious bassorelievo of the destruction of troy in the afternoon when she condescended to walk in the garden the lake was covered with tritons and nereids the pages of the family were converted into woodnymphs who peeped from every bower and the footmen gamboled over the lawns in the figure of satyrs i speak it without designing to insinuate any unfavourable suspicions but it seems difficult to say why elisabeths virginity should have been made the theme of perpetual and excessive panegyric nor does it immediately appear that there is less merit or glory in a married than a maiden queen yet the next morning after sleeping in a room hung with the tapestry of the voyage of eneas when her majesty hunted in the park she was met by diana who pronouncing our royal prude to be the brightest paragon of unspotted chastity invited her to groves free from the intrusions of acteon the truth is she was so profusely flattered for this virtue because it was esteemed the characteristical ornament of the heroines as fantastic honor was the chief pride of the champions of the old barbarous romance it was in conformity to the sentiments of chivalry which still continued in vogue that she was celebrated for chastity the compliment however was paid in a classical allusion  queens must be ridiculous when they would appear as women the softer attractions of sex vanish on the throne elisabeth sought all occasions of being extolled for her beauty of which indeed in the prime of her youth she possessed but a small share whatever might have been her pretensions to absolute virginity notwithstanding her exaggerated habits of dignity and ceremony and a certain affectation of imperial severity she did not perceive this ambition of being complimented for beauty to be an idle and unpardonable levity totally inconsistent with her high station and character as she conquered all nations with her arms it matters not what were the triumphs of her eyes of what consequence was the complexion of the mistress of the world not less vain of her person than her politics this stately coquet the guardian of the protestant faith the terror of the sea the mediatrix of the factions of france and the scourge of spain was infinitely mortified if an ambassador at the first audience did not tell her she was the finest woman in europe no negotiation succeeded unless she was addressed as a goddess encomiastic harangues drawn from this topic even on the supposition of youth and beauty were surely superfluous unsuitable and unworthy and were offered and received with an equal impropriety yet when she rode through the streets of the city of norwich cupid at the command of the mayor and aldermen advancing from a groupe of gods who had left olympus to grace the procession gave her a golden arrow the most effective weapon of his wellfurnished quiver which under the influence of such irresistible charms was sure to wound the most obdurate heart a gift says honest hollinshed which her majesty now verging to her fiftieth year received very thankfully chron iii f       in one of the fulsome interludes at court where she was present the singingboys of her chapel presented the story of the three rival goddesses on mount ida to which her majesty was ingeniously added as a fourth and paris was arraigned in form for adjudging the golden apple to venus which was due to the queen alone  this inundation of classical pedantry soon infected our poetry our writers already trained in the school of fancy were suddenly dazzled with these novel imaginations and the divinities and heroes of pagan antiquity decorated every composition the perpetual allusions to ancient fable were often introduced without the least regard to propriety shakespeares mrs page who is not intended in any degree to be a learned or an affected lady laughing at the cumbersome courtship of her corpulent lover falstaff says i had rather be a giantess and lie under mount pelion merry w act ii sc i  this familiarity with the pagan story was not however so much owing to the prevailing study of the original authors as to the numerous english versions of them which were consequently made the translations of the classics which now employed every pen gave a currency and a celebrity to these fancies and had the effect of diffusing them among the people no sooner were they delivered from the pale of the scholastic languages than they acquired a general notoriety ovids metamorphoses just translated by golding to instance no farther disclosed a new world of fiction even to the illiterate as we had now all the ancient fables in english learned allusions whether in a poem or a pageant were no longer obscure and unintelligible to common readers and common spectators and here we are led to observe that at this restoration of the classics we were first struck only with their fabulous inventions we did not attend to their regularity of design and justness of sentiment a rude age beginning to read these writers imitated their extravagancies not their natural beauties and these like other novelties were pursued to a blameable excess  i have before given a sketch of the introduction of classical stories in the splendid show exhibited at the coronation of queen anne boleyn but that is a rare and a premature instance and the pagan fictions are there complicated with the barbarisms of the catholic worship and the doctrines of scholastic theology classical learning was not then so widely spread either by study or translation as to bring these learned spectacles into fashion to frame them with sufficient skill and to present them with propriety  another capital source of the poetry peculiar to this period consisted in the numerous translations of italian tales into english these narratives not dealing altogether in romantic inventions but in real life and manners and in artful arrangements of fictitious yet probable events afforded a new gratification to a people which yet retained their ancient relish for taletelling and became the fashionable amusement of all who professed to read for pleasure they gave rise to innumerable plays and poems which would not otherwise have existed and turned the thoughts of our writers to new inventions of the same kind before these books became common affecting situations the combination of incident and the pathos of catastrophe were almost unknown distress especially that arising from the conflicts of the tender passion had not yet been shown in its most interesting forms it was hence our poets particularly the dramatic borrowed ideas of a legitimate plot and the complication of facts necessary to constitute a story either of the comic or tragic species in proportion as knowledge increased genius had wanted subjects and materials these pieces usurped the place of legends and chronicles and although the old historical songs of the minstrels contained much bold adventure heroic enterprise and strong touches of rude delineation yet they failed in that multiplication and disposition of circumstances and in that description of characters and events approaching nearer to truth and reality which were demanded by a more discerning and curious age even the rugged features of the original gothic romance were softened by this sort of reading and the italian pastoral yet with some mixture of the kind of incidents described in heliodoruss ethiopic history now newly translated was engrafted on the feudal manners in sydneys arcadia  but the reformation had not yet destroyed every delusion nor disinchanted all the strong holds of superstition a few dim characters were yet legible in the mouldering creed of tradition every goblin of ignorance did not vanish at the first glimmerings of the morning of science reason suffered a few demons still to linger which she chose to retain in her service under the guidance of poetry men believed or were willing to believe that spirits were yet hovering around who brought with them airs from heaven or blasts from hell that the ghost was duly released from his prison of torment at the sound of the curfue and that fairies imprinted mysterious circles on the turf by moonlight much of this credulity was even consecrated by the name of science and profound speculation prospero had not yet broken and buried his staff nor drowned his book deeper than did ever plummet sound it was now that the alchymist and the judicial astrologer conducted his occult operations by the potent intercourse of some preternatural being who came obsequious to his call and was bound to accomplish his severest services under certain conditions and for a limited duration of time it was actually one of the pretended feats of these fantastic philosophers to evoke the queen of the fairies in the solitude of a gloomy grove who preceded by a sudden rustling of the leaves appeared in robes of transcendent luster lillys life p      the shakespeare of a more instructed and polished age would not have given us a magician darkening the sun at noon the sabbath of the witches and the cauldron of incantation  undoubtedly most of these notions were credited and entertained in a much higher degree in the preceding periods but the arts of composition had not then made a sufficient progress nor would the poets of those periods have managed them with so much address and judgment we were now arrived at that point when the national credulity chastened by reason had produced a sort of civilized superstition and left a set of traditions fanciful enough for poetic decoration and yet not too violent and chimerical for common sense hobbes although no friend to this doctrine observes happily in a good poem both judgment and fancy are required but the fancy must be more eminent because they please for the extravagancy but ought not to displease by indiscretion leviath part i chapter viii   in the mean time the gothic romance although somewhat shook by the classical fictions and by the tales of boccace and bandello still maintained its ground and the daring machineries of giants dragons and enchanted castles borrowed from the magic storehouse of boiardo ariosto and tasso began to be employed by the epic muse these ornaments have been censured by the bigotry of precise and servile critics as abounding in whimsical absurdities and as unwarrantable deviations from the practice of homer and virgil the author of an enquiry into the life and writings of homer is willing to allow a fertility of genius and a felicity of expression to tasso and ariosto but at the same time complains that quitting life they betook themselves to aerial beings and utopian characters and filled their works with charms and visions the modern supplements of the mavelous and sublime the best poets copy nature and give it such as they find it when once they lose sight of this they write false be their talents ever so great sect v p     but what shall we say of those utopians the cyclopes and the lestrigons in the odyssey the hippogrif of ariosto may be opposed to the harpies of virgil if leaves are turned into ships in the orlando nymphs are transformed into ships in the eneid cacus is a more unnatural savage than caliban nor am i convinced that the imagery of ismenos necromantic forest in the gierusalemme liberata guarded by walls and battlements of fire is less mavelous and sublime than the leap of junos horses in the iliad celebrated by longinus for its singular magnificence and dignity ilad v   0 longin ix  on the principles of this critic voltaires henriad may be placed at the head of the modern epic but i forbear to anticipate my opinion of a system which will more properly be considered when i come to speak of spenser i must however observe here that the gothic and pagan fictions were now frequently blended and incorporated the lady of the lake floated in the suite of neptune before queen elisabeth at kenilworth ariel assumes the semblance of a seanymph and hecate by an easy association conducts the rites of the weird sisters in macbeth  allegory had been derived from the religious dramas into our civil spectacles the masks and pageantries of the age of elisabeth were not only furnished by the heathen divinities but often by the virtues and vices impersonated significantly decorated accurately distinguished by their proper types and represented by living actors the ancient symbolical shows of this sort began now to lose their old barbarism and a mixture of religion and to assume a degree of poetical elegance and precision nor was it only in the conformation of particular figures that much fancy was shown but in the contexture of some of the fables or devices presented by groupes of ideal personages these exhibitions quickened creative invention and reflected back on poetry what poetry had given from their familiarity and public nature they formed a national taste for allegory and the allegorical poets were now writing to the people even romance was turned into this channel in the fairy queen allegory is wrought upon chivalry and the feats and figments of arthurs round table are moralized the virtues of magnificence and chastity are here personified but they are imaged with the forms and under the agency of romantic knights and damsels what was an afterthought in tasso appears to have been spensers premeditated and primary design in the mean time we must not confound these moral combatants of the fairy queen with some of its other embodied abstractions which are purely and professedly allegorical  it may here be added that only a few critical treatises and but one art of poetry were now written sentiments and images were not absolutely determined by the canons of composition nor was genius awed by the consciousness of a future and final arraignment at the tribunal of taste a certain dignity of inattention to niceties is now visible in our writers without too closely consulting a criterion of correctness every man indulged his own capriciousness of invention the poets appeal was chiefly to his own voluntary feelings his own immediate and peculiar mode of conception and this freedom of thought was often expressed in an undisguised frankness of diction a circumstance by the way that greatly contributed to give the flowing modulation which now marked the measures of our poets and which soon degenerated into the opposite extreme of dissonance and asperity selection and discrimination were often overlooked shakespeare wandered in pursuit of universal nature the glancings of his eye are from heaven to earth from earth to heaven we behold him breaking the barriers of imaginary method in the same scene he descends from his meridian of the noblest tragic sublimity to puns and quibbles to the meanest merriments of a plebeian farce in the midst of his dignity he resembles his own richard the second the skipping king who sometimes discarding the state of a monarch mingled his royalty with carping fools first p henry iv act iii sc ii  he seems not to have seen any impropriety in the most abrupt transitions from dukes to buffoons from senators to sailors from counselors to constables and from kings to clowns like virgils majestic oak  quantum vertice ad auras aetherias tantum radice in tartara tendit geor ii       no satires properly so called were written till toward the latter end of the queens reign and then but a few pictures drawn at large of the vices of the times did not suit readers who loved to wander in the regions of artificial manners the muse like the people was too solemn and reserved too ceremonious and pedantic to stoop to common life satire is the poetry of a nation highly polished  the importance of the female character was not yet acknowledged nor were women admitted into the general commerce of society the effect of that intercourse had not imparted a comic air to poetry nor softened the severer tone of our versification with the levities of gallantry and the familiarities of compliment sometimes perhaps operating on serious subjects and impeceptibly spreading themselves in the general habits of style and thought i do not mean to insinuate that our poetry has suffered from the great change of manners which this assumption of the gentler ex or rather the improved state of female education has produced by giving elegance and variety to life by enlarging the sphere of conversation and by multiplying the topics and enriching the stores of wit and humor but i am marking the peculiarities of composition and my meaning was to suggest that the absence of so important a circumstance from the modes and constitution of antent life must have influenced the cotemporary poetry of the state of manners among our ancestors respecting this point many traces remain their style of courtship may be collected from the lovedialogues of hamlet young percy henry the fifth and master fenton their tragic heroines their desdemonas and ophelias although of so much consequence in the piece are degraded to the background in comedy their ladies are nothing more than merry wives plain and cheerful matrons who stand upon the chariness of their honesty in the smaller poems if a lover praises his mistress she is complimented in strains neither polite nor pathetic without elegance and without affection she is described not in the address of intelligible yet artful panegyric not in the real colors and with the genuine accomplishments of nature but as an eccentric ideal being of another system and as inspiring sentiments equally unmeaning hyperbolical and unnatural  all or most of these circumstances contributed to give a descriptive a picturesque and a figurative cast to the poetical language this effect appears even in the prose compositions of the reign of elisabeth in the subsequent age prose became the language of poetry  in the mean time general knowledge was increasing with a wide diffusion and a hasty rapidity books began to be multiplied and a variety of the most useful and rational topics had been discussed in our own language but science had not made too great advances on the whole we were now arrived at that period propitious to the operations of original and true poetry when the coyness of fancy was not always proof against the approaches of reason when genius was rather directed than governed by judgment and when taste and learning had so far only disciplined imagination as to suffer its excesses to pass without censure or control for the sake of the beauties to which they were allied  end of the third volume
