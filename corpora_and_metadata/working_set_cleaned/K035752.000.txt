an epistle from a lady in england to a gentleman at avignon    london printed for j tonson at shakespearshead overagainst katharinestreet in the strand       an epistle from a lady in england to a gentleman at avignon to thee dear rover and thy vanquished friends the health she wants thy gentle chloe sends though much you suffer think i suffer more worse than an exile on my native shore companions in your masters flight you roame unenvied by your haughty foes at home forever near the royal outlaws side you share his fortunes and his hopes divide on glorious schemes and thoughts of empire dwell and with imaginary titles swell say for thou know i own his sacred line the passive doctrine and the right divine say what new succors does the chief prepare the strength of armies or the force of prayer does he from heaven or earth his hopes derive from saints departed or from priests alive nor saints nor priests can brunswicks troops withstand and beads drop useless through the zealots hand heaven to our vows may future kingdoms owe but skill and courage win the crowns below ere to thy cause and thee my heart inclined or love to party had seduced my mind in female joys i took a dull delight slept all the morn and punted half the night but now with fears and public cares possessed the church the church forever breaks my rest the postboy on my pillow i explore and sift the news of every foreign shore studious to find new friends and new allies what armies march from sueden in disguise how spain prepares her banners to unfold and rome deals out her blessings and her gold then over the map my finger taught to stray cross many a region marks the winding way from sea to sea from realm to realm i rove and grow a mere geographer by love but still avignon and the pleasing coast that holds thee banished claims my care the most often on the wellknown spot i fix my eyes and span the distance that between us lies let not our james though foiled in arms despair whilst on his side he reckons half the fair in britains lovely isle a shining throng war in his cause a thousand beauties strong the unthinking victors vainly boast their powers be theirs the musket while the tongue is ours we reason with such fluency and fire the beaux we baffle and the learned tire against her prelates plead the churchs cause and from our judges vindicate the laws then mourn not hapless prince thy kingdoms lost a crown though late thy sacred brow may boast heaven seems through us thy empire to decree those who win hearts have given their hearts to thee what dames what doctors in thy cause combine what petticoats in either sex are thine have thou not heard that when profusely gay our welldrest rivals graced their sovraigns day we stubborn damsels met the public view in loathsome wormwood and repenting rue what whig but trembled when our spotless band in virgin roses whitened half the land who can forget what fears the foe possessed when oaken boughs marked every loyal breast less scared near medways stream the norman stood when cross the plain he spied a marching wood till near at hand a gleam of swords betrayed the youth of kent beneath it is wandering shade those who the succors of the fair despise may find that we have nails as well as eyes thy female bands o prince by fortune crossed at least more courage than thy men may boast our sex has dared the mugghouse chiefs to meet and purchased fame in many a wellfought street from drury lane the region of renown the land of love the paphos of the town fair patriots sallying often have put to flight with all their poles the guardians of the night and bore with screams of triumph to their side the leaders staff in all its painted pride nor fears the hawker in her warbling note to vend the discontented statesmans thought though red with stripes and recent from the thong sore smitten for the love of sacred song the tuneful sisters still pursue their trade like philomela darkling in the shade poor trott attends forgetful of a fare and hums in concert over his empty chair mean while regardless of the royal cause his sword for james no brother sovrain draws the pope himself surrounded with alarms to france his bulls to corfu sends his arms and though he hears his darling sons complaint can hardly spare one tutelary saint but lists them all to guard his own abodes and into ready money coyns his gods the dauntless suede pursued by vengeful foes scarce keeps his own hereditary snows nor must the friendly roof of kind lorrain with feasts regale our garterd youth again safe barleduc within thy silent grove the pheasant now may perch the hare may rove the knight who aims unerring from afar the adventurous knight now quits the sylvan war thy brinded boars may slumber undismayd or grunt secure beneath the chestnut shade inconstant orleans still we mourn the day that trusted orleans with imperial sway far over the alps our helpless monarch sends far from the call of his desponding friends such are the terms to gain britainnias grace and such the terrors of the brunswick race was it for this the suns whole luster failed and sudden midnight over the noon prevailed for this did heaven display to mortal eyes aerial knights and combats in the skies was it for this northumbrian streams looked red and thames driven backward showed his secret bed false auguries the insulting victors scorn even our own prodigies against us turn o portents construed on our side in vain let never tory trust eclipse again run clear ye fountains be at peace ye skies and thames henceforth to thy green borders rise to rome then must the royal wanderer go and fall a suppliant at the papal toe his life in sloth inglorious must he wear one half in luxury and one in prayer his mind perhaps at length debauched with ease the proffered purple and the hat may please shall he whose ancient patriarchal race to mighty nimrod in one line we trace in solemn conclave sit devoid of thought and poll for points of faith his trusty vote be summoned to his stall in time of need and with his casting suffrage fix a creed shall he in robes on stated days appear and english heretics curse once a year garnet and faux shall he with prayers invoke and beg that smithfield piles once more may smoke forbid it heaven my soul to fury wrought turns almost hanoverian at the thought from james and rome i feel my heart decline and fear o brunswick twill be wholly thine yet still his share thy rival will contest and still the double claim divides my breast the fate of james with pitying eyes i view and wish my homage were not brunswicks due to james my passions and my weakness guide but reason sways me to the victors side though grieved i speak it let the truth appear you know my language and my heart sincere in vain did falsehood his fair fame disgrace what force had falsehood when he showed his face in vain to war our boastful clans were led heaps driven on heaps in the dire shock they fled france shuns his wrath nor raises to our shame a second dunkirk in another name in britains funds their wealth all europe throws and up the thames the worlds abundance flows spite of feigned fears and artificial cries the pious town sees fifty churches rise the hero triumphs as his worth is known and sits more firmly on his shaken throne to my sad thought no beam of hope appears through the long prospect of succeeding years the son aspiring to his fathers fame shows all his sire another and the same he blessed in lovely carolinas arms to future ages propagates her charms with pain and joy at strife i often trace the mingled parents in each daughters face half sickening at the sight too well i spy the fathers spirit through the mothers eye in vain new thoughts of rage i entertain and strive to hate their innocence in vain o princess happy by thy foes confessed blessed in thy husband in thy children blessed as they from thee from them new beauties born while europe lasts shall europes thrones adorn transplanted to each court in times to come thy smile celestial and unfading bloom great austrias sons with softer lines shall grace and smooth the frowns of bourbons haughty race the fair descendents of thy sacred bed widebranching over the western world shall spread like the famed banian tree whose pliant shoot to earthward bending of it is self takes root till like their mother plant ten thousand stand in verdant arches on the fertile land beneath her shade the tawny indian roves or hunts at large through the wide echoing groves o thou to whom these mournful lines i send my promised husband and my dearest friend since heaven appoints this favored race to reign and blood has drenched the scottish fields in vain must i be wretched and thy flight partake or wilt not thou for thy loved chloes sake tired out at length submit to fates decree if not to brunswick o return to me prostrate before the victors mercy bend what spares whole thousands may to thee extend should blinded friends thy doubtful conduct blame great brunswicks virtues will secure thy fame say these invite thee to approach his throne and own the monarch heaven vouchsafes to own the world convinced thy reasons will approve say this to them but swear to me twas love finis
