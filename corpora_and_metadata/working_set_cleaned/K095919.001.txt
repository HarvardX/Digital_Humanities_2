the fair hibernian  vol    the fair hibernian  what ignorance shall think or malice say to me are trifles  if the knowing few who can see faults but can see beauties too applaud that genius which themselves partake in two volumes volume the first  london printed by john crowder for g g j and j robinson paternoster row mdcclxxxix  the fair hibernian to mrs wentworth  england paris you make me happy by saying that my letters afford you comfort how often have i been on the point of throwing them in the fire lest their gaiety should seem to impeach my sensibility of your misfortunes if i have consoled you i believe it was by not attempting to offer you consolation i have not with the cruel insolence of cold philosophy pretended to assign reasons why you should not grieve for the loss of an amiable husband first alienated by causeless jealousy and then snatched away by an early and untimely death my dear sister i have left you to reason  i have left you to heaven you know as well as i that grief is unavailing that it ought to be struggled with and i am sure you do struggle but alas the feelings of the heart are not always obedient to the dictates of reason or why cannot i conquer a hopeless passion why does my heart revolt against the friendship i have vowed to valeria obryen a friendship she in no way deserves to forfeit true she has deeply injured me but twas without design she knew not that i loved st clair and o pride forbid that she ever should know it  you say very justly if the marquis de st clair once loved you you ought now to despise him for his inconstancy if he never loved you he never ought to enter your thoughts very true harriet very true but did i ever tell you that i believed i did right to love him no i am sensible of the folly of my attachment yet cannot even resolve to overcome it i am not accustomed to restrain my passions from the time i came under the care of my uncle and aunt de villemar to this moment i have not been used to the least contradiction it appears ungenerous  perhaps in this case it is ungrateful  to plead the faults of others as an excuse for my own but i cannot help thinking i should have had more firmness of mind and more command over my passions if i had been educated less tenderly  you reprove me for mentioning people you never heard of as familiarly as if i thought you acquainted with them and then you ask  shall i say you have the cruelty to ask  who is this miss obryen and who is lady enmore i suppose you expect to have your questions answered well i will gratify you let us proceed methodically i know you love method  when i was in the country last summer lady enmore her daughter and miss obryen arrived here from ireland  lady enmore who it seems passed the greater part of her youth in france was formerly an acquaintance of my aunts and on my return to town i found them extremely intimate  her ladyship seems to be about fifty and is a genteel pleasing woman  lady mary enmore is an illnatured envious ugly deformed little creature accomplished sensible and shrewd but intolerably selfsufficient  miss obryen is  i must confess she is  the finest woman i ever saw la belle irlandoise the men here call her  her father was an irish baronet who being on a visit to some friends in england in the neighborhood of one of the duke of granvilles country seats fell in love with lady charlotte sedley only daughter to his grace sir william was handsome wild and profuse qualities which too often engage our thoughtless sex he soon insinuated himself into lady charlottes affections her father however rejected his proposals with an irritating haughtiness though gay and thoughtless he was proud to excess and could ill support treatment he thought so injurious provoking expressions ensued on both sides the duke forbade him his house and commanded his daughter never to see him more  lady charlotte divided between love and duty yielded  as is perhaps generally the case in such conflicts  to love and fled to ireland with sir william  after her marriage she made many ineffectual attempts to reconcile herself to her family she had no mother to plead for her and her father was so severe as even to forbid her only brother lord carisbrook to hold any correspondence with her  valeria obryen the sole offspring of this marriage was left an orphan at seventeen her parents died within a short time of each other leaving her tenderly and liberally educated accustomed to elegance and profusion without any other dependence than the friendship of mrs chetwynd sir williams sister who is married to a clergyman however as they are very worthy people and fortunately for her have no children of their own she probably has not much reason to be dissatisfied at her lot with them she has lived about three years and is come here merely for amusement with lady enmore who is mrs chetwynds very particular friend  her ladyship has shown her friendship very much at the expense of her discretion in providing such a companion for her daughter i imagine that if lady mary had been left to herself she would not have made so imprudent a choice yet if she has not like me had every fondlycherished hope blasted by the charms of this fatal obryen i know not how she can shut her heart against such an amiable disposition such seducing manners  ever superior to envy i soon distinguished her i sought her for my friend fool that i was i could not live without her it was at the hotel de villemar she was first seen by st clair  i tire you my harriet i will quit this subject but i cannot write on any other i know not what is become of all those agreeable nothings that used to present themselves to my imagination with so much facility adieu  ever your affectionate leonora marchmont  to mrs chetwynd  ireland paris yes you are in the right my dear mrs chetwynd your valeria has   set the world on fire the ringlets that shade her snowy forehead are not so numerous as the sighing swains that compose her train  while her high pride does scarce descend to mark their follies seriously my dear caroline this lovely creature although she has not an atom of vanity is rather too lofty allow me to say that she has rather too much of her father in her disposition she has lately refused two very advantageous matches her objections which i took the liberty to ask were quite frivolous and romantic this minute i expatiate on the enjoyments of a splendid fortune the next i threaten her with willow garlands leading apes etc but all to no purpose she smiles equally unmoved at both pleas however i am not without hopes that the marquis de st clair will in time find means to warm her icy heart she seems already to prefer him to all his competitors i have exerted my utmost influence in his favor but all i could obtain for him was a promise of not immediately refusing him  i told the marquis i should write to miss obryens friends and i ventured to assure him he would find them his zealous advocates  now i earnestly recommend it to you to write immediately and strongly to your niece on this subject she cannot make one reasonable objection to st clair he bears an universal good character he is polite handsome very rich and of a noble extraction  if this marriage takes place you may leave every thing to my management and depend upon my acting for your valeria as i should for my own daughter  your very sincere friend matilda enmore  to the countess dowager enmore  france chetwynd villa i have great obligations to you my dear friend for your care of my lovely child i have written to her according to your desire as strongly too as i thought i ought your ladyship must be sensible there would be an indelicacy in my urging her to marry would it not seem as if i wanted to be freed from my charge how such a thought would wound her high spirit  i had another reason for not pressing valeria on this subject the marquis may not be the kind of man with whom she could think herself happy i have the highest respect for your ladyships judgment without question you are abundantly capable of distinguishing an amiable man but valeria herself can alone distinguish the man in whose society she might wish to spend her life a man may be worthy and not pleasing he may be pleasing and yet want something we cannot dispense with in short it is impossible to explain the secret magic that draws our affection to one man more than to another although it is probable even our partial selves do not discover any extraordinary merit in that dear one we feel the toutensemble irresistible without being able to define the particular charms that attract us i have often thought that parents do not sufficiently consider the importance of this point when they have provided a young man of a good family suitable fortune and fair character  truly nothing more is necessary  and if to these advantages he adds a tolerable share of beauty and agreeableness the poor girl is downright perverse and obstinate if she does not immediately fall in love with him yet were she to give her heart without their knowledge to one fifty times more engaging no reproaches would be thought adequate to her misconduct is not this to suppose love quite voluntary when heaven knows it is not always in a young persons power to preserve her heart it never is to bestow it for my part i think those who love improperly have many excuses and those who do not love where they are importuned want none  i insist  pardon the peremptoriness of the expression  i insist upon your leaving my niece entirely to her own direction in the important point before us o may the only direction superior to her own be vouchsafed to her i confess to you i cannot reconcile myself to the thought of her being settled in france both mr chetwynd and i have set our hearts upon this girl far from repining at our not having children we are pleased at a circumstance that will enable us to provide the more amply for our darling  never lady enmore never will that solemn scene be erased from my memory when the dear child was committed to my care by her last surviving parent  my poor valeria said he gazing on her mournfully as she knelt weeping by his bed my poor child i have undone you i have made you a beggar  a dependant must my daughter descend to serve upstart greatness for bread  she never shall said i with firmness  dear sir william softly interposed my charles i beseech you to be calm o let no anxious thought for valeria disturb the peace of such an hour as this be assured that in me she will find a father is not caroline already her mother  my dear lost charlotte cried my brother with a heartrending sigh lost perhaps to all eternity i do not deserve to participate your bliss my follies opened an early grave for you my extravagance has beggared your child  you have indeed been extravagant and unthinking said mr chetwynd this is not a time to palliate your errors but i trust that a merciful being will not too severely mark a foolish prodigality that brought its punishment here as a husband and a father you were affectionate and indulgent a sincere friend  a better brother  cried charles squeezing his hand no man ever was  your voice my dear chetwynd replied sir william is ever the voice of comfort as a brother indeed i have nothing to reproach myself with not even to the brother whose too great anxiety for what i have valued too little has ruined my affairs whose unkindness perhaps has not a little contributed to make that child an orphan  while i live said i scarely able to speak valeria is not quite an orphan  give me your hand my amiable my beloved caroline said my dying brother and yours my dear charles we each of us put one of our hands in both his to you my friends i leave valeria  a sacred trust  a bequest of which only minds like yours know the value  we gave him the most solemn assurances that it should be the business of our lives to protect and chersh his valeria  mr chetwynd raised the fainting valeria in his arms  poor child said her father  i cannot give you an idea of the pathos with which he pronounced that  poor child  caroline said he after a pause let her know as she values my last blessing she must never accept any thing from the duke of granville if i must leave my daughter dependant i have at least the consolation to think she will depend on my own family  i do not my dear lady enmore defend such resentful pride at such a time but he probably called to mind that the gentle lady charlotte had often said  dear valeria should you ever see my father on your knees entreat him not to curse my memory  and he feared not without reason that the haughty duke whom he hated would look upon this mournful submission as the abject scheme of want  it is highly probable that poor lady charlotte who too well knew the desperate situation of her husbands affairs did by this means intend to recommend her child to the care of her father and such conduct in her was very natural and laudable the duke notwithstanding his overstrained pride and detestable implacability is a man of the most respectable character  my dear brother survived this melancholy scene but two days and i bore my drooping ward from obryen castle so many centuries the residence of her ancestors  although my esteem for my younger brother was wholly destroyed by his rigorous exaction of the large sums his parsimony had enabled him to lend sir william yet it was a satisfaction to my family pride to see him become possessor of obryen castle rather than any other creditor  i shared with my valeria a satisfaction of a better kind when i saw that the shattered remains of her fathers fortune were sufficient to pay his debts  the loss of an excellent mother of a kind though an imprudent father the total disappointment of her just expectations of affluence  these were not gentle trials for a girl of seventeen but what she felt with sensibility she bore with fortitude  o lady enmore she is the pride of my heart the delight of my life you know not what i feel at the thought of her being separated from me but i must not will not be selfish  i can by no means agree with your ladyship that my dear child has too much of her father in her disposition she does resemble him but not too much she has sir williams lofty soul generous spirit high passions and piercing wit with a still deeper penetration and a much more solid judgment than he ever possessed his loftiness was pride here is is dignity he spent a noble fortune in supporting an extravagant parade and gave to those that asked rather than to them that wanted she knows how to steer between the extremes of avarice and prodigality and is careful to exercise her beneficence on proper objects her high passions do not govern her her reason governs them his wit was not under the check of discretion it was often illnatured a twoedged sword that at once wounded his neighbor and himself here is is exerted only to amuse never to give pain its severity is pointed against wickedness and folly not against the vicious or the weak or if she does attack the vicious the weak her generous tongue never assaulted is she not careful to give due praise to the amiable part of the character when did valeria expose a personal defect a natural imperfection to conclude valeria is her fathers picture but the picture is softer sweeter has more grace and elegance than the original  i entreat your ladyships forgiveness if i have seemed overforward to contradict your sentiments throughout this tedious letter you know i am a plaindealer and always speak my opinion a liberty i think very consistent with our friendship  your ladyships obliged and affectionate caroline chetwynd  to mrs chetwynd  ireland paris how in the name of every thing mavelous did st clair procure your interest sure the man has some familiar spirit to run of his errands a sylph i suppose no spirit less pure dared approach you ah my good lady enmore i fancy you are at the bottom of this affair it does not please my aunt to say who was her intelligencer yet she accuses me of overreservedness how could you say i seemed to want confidence in you my best my dearest friend whom should i confide in but you you know your valeria would not assert an untruth and i assure you on my honor the only reason i did not acquaint you with the addresses i am tormented with was the apprehension of your imputing the communication of them to my vanity have you not observed how fond some women  and perhaps some men too  are of publishing their conquests i have been made the confidante of a great many young ladies who i am certain had not the least friendship for me but told me their affairs merely to let me know they were admired when any of my female acquaintance tell me that my lord or mr suchaone is in love with them but that they would not have it mentioned for the world i am the only person they would trust to etc i conclude what they mean to say is i shall be obliged to you for assisting me to make this matter as much known as possible and accordingly i have found that the best way to get rid of such trifling communications is to keep them secret excuse me if my contempt for a conduct so wretchedly vain and ridiculous has thrown me rather into the opposite extreme  you tell me i have a great many lovers i do not mention to you true  i have praters and suitors and danglers great store but they are a set of insignificants i have not the conscience to take up your attention with however that you may not again call me reserved well just take a look at two of them lady enmore thought me imprudent to refuse  en premier lieu monsieur le compte de chaumont a tall lean man of about fifty whose greatest ambition next to pleasing me is to be thought a gay foppish young fellow a fop he is his bitterest enemy cannot deny it and if he would be contented to converse only with the blind he might be thought young indeed but mon vieillard would please both the eyes and ears and so alas pleases neither verifying the proverb grasp all lose all what could recommend this count to lady enmore you ask be it far from me to display the bad only though i could find precedents let us turn to the bright side bright it must be owned  noble descent large fortune splendid equipage court favor agreeable trifles these if joined to some more solid advantages it is needless to observe to a person of your just and refined way of thinking how very little it is in the power of such extrinsic merit in a husband to secure the happiness of a woman who pretends to any sentiment  the second choice lady enmore had made for your valeria is the chevalier dolonne he has great connections is rich strikingly beautiful has an infinity of wit and vivacity and then he has du sang jusqu aux ongles no mortal man could look straight in dolonnes face with impunity  the chevalier is more admired by the ladies than almost any other man in paris and certainly owes not a little of his consequence with them to his being a duellist  that bravery which promises protection to our weakness and timidity has a just and natural claim to our esteem but we are too apt to be dazzled by an inconsiderate rashness  for women born to be controlled stoop to the forward and the bold but my valeria you will say what think you of lady enmores present favorite the marquis de st clair  dear madam i have not sufficiently considered the subject allow me to refer you to my next for an answer  with unbounded gratitude and love your valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland paris i deferred communicating my resolutions with regard to the marquis de st clair because i did not well know them myself i am little less to seek than ever i cannot bring myself either to accept or refuse him how like a coquet this i have hitherto been above the meanness and cruelty of playing with the happiness of a man that loved me it lowers me very much in my own esteem to find myself capable of it now  were st clair to live in ireland i believe i should not hesitate a moment but i cannot bear the thought of settling at such a distance from my dear uncle and you  you tell me that to give my hand to the marquis unless i can give him my whole heart will be making myself unhappy and acting a dishonorable part toward him you likewise justly censure the gross notion of marrying first and loving afterward i entirely agree with you in all this i have a reasonable regard for my own happiness i would rather die than do a dishonorable thing by any one but here rests the difficulty  do i or do i not love him  surely valeria it is you must answer that question  true my dear aunt but honestly and seriously i dont know how to answer it i really think him very amiable and certainly prefer him  i should not deliberate if i did not  to all the men i ever knew i like his conversation except when he importunes me on a certain subject i am generally best pleased when he is present and sometimes regret his absence i pity him more tenderly than i do any other man to whom i am unhappy enough to give pain  tell me my heart if this be love if i form my opinion of that passion from what i have read of it in novels i shall be obliged to pronounce my sentiments for the marquis only  friendship for i am positive if he were to forsake me this moment and even to wed another i should preserve my reason yes and my peace of mind too yet i confess his dereliction would sensibly pique and perhaps wound me  love it seems can observe no faults in  or at least glosses over the faults of  its object now i think st clair wants vivacity and if the expression be not too bold fire there is a soft gentleness in his manners that would be more suitable to a female character and might be insipid even in that i would not be supposed to like roughness no not in the least approach to it but i would have a certain degree of life and spirit accompany the softness of a man  thus have i ingenuously told you the state of my heart let my dear parents determine for me i shall remain in suspense till your advice turns the balance and it is in your power to turn it to which side you please if you would be happier  and your unbounded tenderness gives me room to imagine you would  in my living with you speak the word i shall instantly break off this match i shall return to dear ireland and my beloved friends this last resolution will surprise you to say the truth i begin  or rather continue  to sigh at our long separation besides my situation here is a little disagreeable i plainly see lady mary enmore hates me she does not treat me with incivility but i easily read her sentiments for me notwithstanding she is unhappy when in the same party with me imagining the undesired court that is paid me a slight to her it must appear vain in me to impute her dislike to envy yet i dont know how otherwise to account for it i have carefully examined into my behavior to her and flatter myself with impartiality in saying it deserved a very different return  lady enmores friendship is almost as unpleasing in its consequences as her daughters hatred she is continually teazing me to marry certainly miss obryen you are very young and very handsome  you will pardon my repeating her own words  and yet you may never have such another offer this speech was first made for chaumont then dolonne and is now repeated at least twice a day for st clair respect to her more advanced years and gratitude for her affection obliges me to attend to her advice and i dont know any thing more irksome than to be forced to listen to counsels one is predetermined not to follow she is undoubtedly a sensible woman i greatly esteem her as well on account of her personal merit as her being your friend but her disposition and notions of things are so opposite to mine that she is by no means qualified to judge for me in so important a point indeed her ladyship wants a little of my dear aunts delicacy were i to put myself under her direction i should be quite a female fortunehunter how would you like madam to see your girl assume such a character to be continually on the catch  allow me that expression  endeavoring to make her fortune by her person  o villainous what a conduct  it would absolutely be unchaste  lady enmore has just told me she is resolved not to importune me any more on the marquiss account i shall leave you entirely to yourself my dear said she because i am convinced you cannot be such a fool as to refuse him this is an odd way of leaving me to myself i told her i had submitted the matter to your decision at which she is very well satisfied  i have written separately to my dear uncle not to exclude him from my confidence but because i thought customs laws etc would have made an awkward appendix to such a letter as this i have answered his several questions according to the best information i could procure if i have pleased him i shall be happy if not put on a saucy look for me and tell him he was mighty curious to give me so much trouble about things that did not concern either of us  his and your valeria obryen  to mrs wentworth  england paris i have received your letter my dear sister and am determined to accept your invitation i know my uncle and aunt will be unwilling to let me go but they are too indulgent to deny me when they find i have set my heart on it i shall plead my impatience to see you after a separation of near five years my desire to behold a brother of whom i have so slight a remembrance here they will tell me that sir edward has given us hopes of seeing him at paris next summer and i shall promise to return with him  i would not on any account remain here one month longer after the conversation i had yesterday with lady mary enmore a restless curiosity  perhaps a latent hope  prompted me to make an enquiry that has ended as i might have supposed it would in despair i did not dare to mention the marquiss name to miss obryen her piercing eyes seem to read ones very soul but affecting an air of careless vivacity i ventured to ask lady mary if her fair companion was not soon to be married to monsieur de st clair she replied i believe so mrs chetwynd has been written to i could hardly stand this shock though i thought i had fortified my mind against it i am afraid i did not entirely conceal my emotion from lady mary she looked i dont know how at me she even had the insolence to sneer i wish to heaven i had been silent  i went this morning to lady enmores hoping by an assumed sprightliness to destroy lady marys suspicions they were abroad i waited for them my spirits began to flag i sat down to the harpsichord and played and sung that i might not think it would not do  a flood of tears interrupted the song what should become of me were they to return at this moment the reflection instantly roused me i started up walked about the room recovered myself and sat down again turning over the leaves of a music book i found some tolerable verses addressed to lady mary on her singing  o ciel that any man should think it worth his while to flatter lady mary enmore i recollected her behavior to me yesterday and could not deny myself the small revenge of scribbling a very satirical couplet on the opposite page i hope the lines will vex her perhaps she may discover the author though i endeavored to disguise my hand i care not if she does let her remember her barbarous sneer why is not valeria obryen such a creature as lady mary enmore that my mean jealousy might not be wholly without excuse i hate myself for my ingratitude to the woman with whom i have interchanged the tenderest professions of friendship she has long since perceived the melancholy i took so much pains to hide and her generous and tender assiduity in consequence of that discovery wounds me to the soul she once hinted a desire to know the cause of my uneasiness you may believe she was the last person i should have chosen for a confidante i was forced to give her an evasive answer she did not press me but with a delicacy peculiar to herself she immediately changed the subject and has never since renewed it why cannot i love her  it is late i am fatigued and sleepy i shall lay down my pen but i am resolved not to close this letter till i have obtained permission to go to england    why do they oppose my going i cannot will not stay here i am disgusted with this place and every body in it i hate the woman i ought to love and i despise myself i am just returned from visiting madame de carignan she had a good deal of company miss obryen was mentioned every one said something in her favor my envious heart died within me i sat sullenly silent while her praises were echoed from mouth to mouth as if the company had been in a conspiracy to punish me  as i deserve o how has this passion narrowed my mind there was a time when i should have received pleasure from such a conversation still i am not so far lost to justice and generosity but that i am ready to acknowledge she is the first of women in short i praise her myself but cannot endure to hear her praised by another were she censured i could listen with secret satisfaction and should warmly defend her notwithstanding  what contemptible caprice  adieu i have not yet relinquished the sweet hope of seeing you    after two days struggle i have prevailed now you my gentle sister would have given up any pleasure rather than have endured so long a contention i see there are some advantages attending obstinacy  you may expect to see me very soon my uncle intends putting me under the protection of mr domville who talks of quitting france every day he is an english gentleman brother to lord linfield married about two years ago to lady lucy melmont daughter to some irish earl she is very pretty ireland is the land of beauty i think  i recall the observation  lady mary enmore is the most hideous little witch any kingdom ever produced  how weak i am would you believe it  i can hardly bear the thought of leaving this place though i would not stay in it for the world though i die to embrace you though i long to see the brother on whose praise i have heard you dwell with so much rapture  but still st clair is here and as yet st clair is free  not the slightest hint to sir edward of the cause of my sudden visit to england i might have spared the caution i know i may depend on your prudence  adien my dear sister leonora marchmont  to mrs chetwynd  ireland paris an unexpected incident occasions me to revoke the power i have placed in the hands of my dear uncle and aunt a power which not my duty and gratitude only but my just consciousness of their very superior understandings induced me to give them i say give for i can never think that parents should have an affirmative voice in these matters a negative one they have an incontestible right to and even of that they sometimes make but too cruel a use i owe more to you than i could to a father and mother they would have a natural obligation and a natural desire to support to love me and to seek my welfare all these you do not necessarily but freely and voluntarily which beyond doubt very much enlarges my sphere of duty yet i frankly own i could allow you no more than a negative  and i well know you are both too generous to claim even that  in an affair of such momentous concern to the future happiness of my life  where has my rambling pen led me i was going to tell you that an unexpected incident had fixed my intentions in respect to the marquis it is without further preface as follows  i have since i came here contracted a friendship with a miss marchmont which i believe i might have mentioned to you in some of my former letters till within the past month i had every reason to suppose that this amiable girl amply returned the very lively tenderness i entertained for her but during that period there was an unusual coldness and constraint in her behavior to me i could not think she was of a fickle disposition and was positive i had given her no cause of displeasure so attributed the alteration rather to a melancholy she wished to conceal than to any diminution of affection to me from being the liveliest creature imaginable she became quite the reverse convinced that such a change was the effect of some extraordinary misfortune i was exceedingly alarmed for her i sought to know the occasion of her sorrow not from an impertinent curiosity but the better to enable me to pour the soothing balm of consolation on her wounded mind she avoided my enquiry which seemed to give her so much pain that i extremely condemned myself for making it though conscious of the justifiableness of my intention i think there are very few secrets that can justly be denied to perfect friendship but some there certainly may be and i doubted not miss marchmont had proper reasons for her silence i therefore was not offended though chagrined at her reserve it was her advantage not my own gratification i sought and she best knew whether it was in my power to be serviceable to her or not as far as my friends please to trust me they shall find me faithful but i have no notion of overearnestly soliciting a persons confidence as it always has more the appearance of design or curiosity than of affection with these sentiments you may imagine i was no encroacher on the tenderness of my friend since she would not put it in my power to comfort or to advise i endeavored to amuse her but was not so happy as to succeed still was the dear girl melancholy and sometimes a little captious and out of humor i seemed not to perceive it they have an ill temper that cannot bear with the infirmities of those they love  things continued in this train for some time  about a week ago she came to spend a morning at lady enmores during her stay one of the footmen brought a letter to her ladyship as there was no company but miss marchmont with whom we are on so intimate a footing she made some apology and opened it  who is that from madam asked lady mary who has a reasonable portion of curiosity  from the marquis de st clair  miss marchmont turned paler for she has some natural complexion in spite of the vile rouge a smelling bottle of mine which i had shown her for its remarkable beauty fell from her hand and was broken to pieces i rallied her for being so much discomposed at such a trisling accident she instantly laid hold of this pretense as i had designed she should apologized for the little mischief she had done me and observed that her nerves were so weak that the sudden breaking of any thing always threw her into disorder  well my dear said i music will set you to rights in a moment lady mary will you favor us with a song  she immediately complied which gave my fair friend time to recover herself and so the matter passed off but i frequently afterward revolved it in my mind with great perplexity that she loved the marquis was the only probable solution of the mystery if so i wondered i had not observed it sooner but i recollected i had seldom seen them together and as it is to be supposed her behavior was carefully guarded at such times it is not surprising it deceived one wholly unsuspicious if she had placed her affections on a man she knew to have attached himself to another her deep melancholy was no longer unaccountable i called to mind several circumstances which appeared to favor this opinion particularly her referve to me  what could be more natural who would make a rival a confidante pride forbade it and even generosity since if i loved st clair  and her own passion would incline her to imagine i did  she reduced me to the terrible necessity of either acting an unfeeling and unfriendly part by her or of making myself wretched i flatter myself i need not tell you which side even in that case i would have taken  i must break off here as my lovely countrywoman lady lucy domville has just called on me to take a ramble with her she is going to make some purchases wherein she politely wishes to profit by my fancy  devotedly your valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland paris i shall now my dear madam resume the subject of yesterday  it highly concerned me to find out miss marchmonts sentiments but how was i to penetrate them it required an infinity of address to question her on so nice a subject i was apprehensive of hurting her delicacy her pride of appearing ungenerous in short i never was so embarrassed in my life  in this situation it was fortunate for me that the marquis was out of town this leads me to mention the purport of his letter to lady enmore it was to inform her  or rather me through her  that he was confined to the country where he had not intended to stay above four days at the most by his attendance on the chevalier daumont his particular friend who had been desperately wounded in a duel you will easily suppose this was accompanied by a number of complaints compliments etc three days after this letter had annihilated my poor smelling bottle lady mary told me that miss marchmont had been enquiring from her whether i was to be married to st clair i declare said her ladyship i believe she has a penchant for him herself she looked so confused while she spoke of him and dont you remember her disorder the other day when my mother received his letter  i am astonished a person of your ladyships discernment could harbor so ridiculous a supposition the place i have the honor to hold in miss marchmonts friendship sufficiently confutes your error  the word error offended her and it was unpolite or rather it was inconsiderate in me to use it she repeated it twice with emphasis then added it is true i am not blessed with the penetration and profound judgment of miss obryen pronouncing my name with a sneer and tossing her little conceited head she needed not to have done so it was an ancient and honorable name ages before her own was drawn from obscurity with an intention to provoke me she said i request you will excuse my having communicated my observations to you i really did not know you would be displeased that any body but yourself should presume to love him  as my talents for wrangling are by no means a match for here is i thought it most prudent not to answer a speech that might have produced a quarrel  if you please lady mary said i we shall dismiss this subject but first let me conjure you never to divulge your very unjust suspicions as you may thereby greatly injure my leonora  i was heartily sorry the malicious creature had made this discovery though it confirmed my own surmise i was now determined to come to an eclaircissement immediately especially as i found miss marchmont intended to go to england with the domvilles i did not get an opportunity of conversing with her in private till the day before yesterday thus it was  i called at the hotel de villemar in the morning madame de villemar her aunt told me she was in her own apartment and was going to send for her i saved her the trouble by stepping up stairs myself i found her weeping she started on seeing me  why these tears my dear leonora asked i assectionately taking her hand  excuse me answered she averting her face i am a little lowspirited this morning  ah miss marchmont it is not particularly this morning you are lowspirited you are always so yet miser as you are you hoard all your griefs within your own breast and refuse to share them with your friend  no more miss obryen for pitys sake importune me not  i must i must my leonora ah wherefore do you mock me with the name of friend while you treat me with a reserve incompatible with friendship  i waited her reply she spoke not she seemed greatly agitated i endeavored to put an end to her distress as soon as possible  permit me miss marchmont to ask you one question a question which i entreat and conjure you to answer with sincerity  what question  what would you ask she demanded with fearful hastiness  am i said i bashfully looking down am i so unfortunate as to be directly or indirectly the cause of your   insulter interrupted she coloring with resentment and starting from her seat she moved toward the door with quickness by a still quicker movement i got between her and it  call me not insulting and i threw my arms about her heaven be my witness i intended not to insult still less if possible to grieve you will not you pardon me leonora apprehensive that the compassion which was written on my heart might be legible on my countenance i reclined my face on her shoulder  unwilling to offend her even by a look she burst into tears and besought me to forgive her then recollecting herself as it were she half pushed me from her exclaiming too charming creature fatal beauty  would i had never known you  ah form not so cruel a wish if i have been your rival twas ignorantly and undesignedly i never ceased to be your friend nor ever shall no longer view me in the former odious light condescend to accept me in the latter can you divest yourself of  what you will allow me to call  a narrow pride and place your considence in one incapable of abusing it the marquis de st clair must never be any thing to me is it in my power  i stopped not finding words delicate enough to express my desire of making him here is  o nobleminded valeria cried she how little do i merit this generosity cast me for ever from a heart too worthy to entertain an affection for such an ingrate i have hated  i have envied you   do not condemn yourself answered i for the natural effects of the most uncontrollable of all passions you have hated me does not this imply that you do not now hate me endeavor to love me for the future as sincerely as i shall endeavor to deserve it and let us mutually forget the injuries we have involuntarily done each other and remember leonora remember i expect an unlimitted trust in my honor if it be possible for me to serve you if not let me ever remain a stranger to the situation of your heart rather than that heart should feel an addition to its sorrow by my knowing it  the sweet girl was quite oppressed by her too lively gratitude she wept  she was unable to speak to relieve her and perhaps in some measure to relieve myself for i was exceedingly affected i abruptly feigned an engagement and tenderly embracing quitted her  i must now conclude pretty briefly having already given my pen a greater portion of my time than i can well afford when i tell you that i leave paris three days hence you will imagine i must be extremely hurried  i have saved myself the fatigue of farewell visits by not mentioning my intention to any one except monsieur and madame de villemar miss marchmont lady enmore and lady mary and mr domville and his lady whom i am to accompany  lady enmore is to make my apologies to my acquaintance that the suddenness of my departure may not be thought mysterious she thinks fit it should appear in consequence of some letters from ireland  her ladyship has said every thing in her power to dissuade me from going and i really had occasion for all the little address i am mistress of to keep her from being offended i could not tell her the true motive that actuated me in this sudden resolve i was obliged to pretend that my impatience to see my irish friends would not permit me to stay another winter and she had no design to return sooner i should have been happy i said to stay with her three or four months longer only the opportunity of going with the domvilles was so peculiarly tempting all my rhetoric could hardly reconcile her to parting with me she is a most sincere and affectionate friend i do not quit her without regret and shall never forget what i owe her  lady mary is immeasurably afflicted at losing so agreeable a companion pass pour cela  it is scarcely necessary to inform you that miss marchmont does not go to england her uncle and aunt who are excessively fond of her are delighted at her changing her mind though they do not know why she did so  she has engaged me to visit a sister of here is of whom she has given me an interesting history which i shall communicate to you when i have more leisure  i do not expect to see the marquis before i go as the chevalier daumont is considerably worse poor st clair i grieve to think what his gentle nature may suffer on my account i sincerely hope his passion will expire when he no longer beholds its object i have desired leonora to assure him of my gratitude and unalterable esteem but at the same time to tell him that was all he had ever to expect from me you will readily perceive that the reason i chose to make her the bearer of this message rather than lady enmore was because it would naturally lead to an intimacy between them i please myself with thinking the attention he will experience from her joined to her merit her beauty her agremens will in some little time accomplish what i so ardently wish  adieu adieu my dearest madam i have not time to reperuse this long letter  ever your dutiful etc valeria obryen direct your next to lord linfields london    to lord methuen  london marchmonthouse dame prudence took me by the hand and led me here to look after my estate i never supposed she had any thing further in view but mark her treachery who could have suspected it in such a grave gentlewoman she had most devilishly contrived and complotted with the gods hymen and cupid to introduce me to the acquaintance of miss ormsby a merchants daughter  it is true  but what of that  she has forty thousand pounds  shall i tell you all how and about it  i will  mr matthias ormsby  it is necessary for the exactitude of the thing that you should be told his christian name  mr matthias ormsby a london merchant has two fair daughters videlicet emily and hannah the former it pleased sir james conway to take unto him in quality of wife leaving the latter for me his friend and brother baronet very kind and considerate you will say that he did not take both why so it was and to make my acknowledgments i posted to his mansion house which is but three miles from my own the second day after i came down  was most hospitably received by sir james  introduced to his bride and her sister  requested to accept a general invitation of which i have frequently availed myself my house being then as at present utterly destitute of inhabitants save only self and servants and i am entirely of opinion that it is not good for man to be alone  in the course of my visits sir james has sometimes dropped hints that i should do well to countenance his example and clear my estate  what does your lordship think of this advice my estate you know is worth about ten thousand a year my father involved it extremely i have been clearing ever since i came to it and have now reduced the debts to thirtysix thousand pounds by living within the bounds i have prescribed to myself i shall pay off the whole in less than ten years but suppose i take a more expeditious method  miss ormsbys fortune will more than settle my affairs and her father will likewise leave her a considerable sum at his death i assure you the economy of this scheme has struck me forcibly  may i boast to you that miss ormsby treats me with distinction if she did not perhaps i should not think of her the dear charmer should consider however that   a heart by kindness only gained will a dear conquest prove and to be kept must be maintained at vast expense of love call it vanity or gratitude which you will methuen but assuredly there is something irresistibly engaging in being beloved when a woman seems ready to jump into ones arms indeed it is quite another matter i admire her who    in striving to hide   reveals all her flame this is exactly hannahs case she fixes her mild eyes filled with dying langour on my face instantly draws them off with great confusion when their glances meet mine she practices a number of other pretty contrivances so natural to her wily sex when they would ensnare our hearts  doubtless you expect a description of my fair one  here it follows then  she is tall slender and straight but to show you my impartiality  a rare virtue in a lover  i must confess her limbs are rather coarse than delicate stiff than elastic but on the whole she has something very genteel and degagee in her appearance  now for her face   o face industriously contrived by heaven to fix my eyes and captivate my soul shall i dissect her features perchance they will not bear it though they do very well together let me tell you her forehead cheeks nose and chin are unexceptionable o most unloverlike thus negatively to praise them in the aggregate i should have separated them and bestowed a poetical simile or two on each well to make amends for my negligence   her radiant eyes the bright celestial blue that paints the skies by the way i have no passion for blue eyes they are generally soft sometimes bright but almost always want life  her mouth is rather wide but her teeth are white and even her hair is a pretty lightbrown very thick and glossy her skin white as the newblown lily but her complexion not blooming enough for my taste there is a sweetness and sensibility in her looks with a tincture of indolence  her understanding is good enough for her sex but she possesses not a single spark of what we call wit i cannot say i lament that as i think wit a most unamiable and dangerous quality when it is not joined to an uncommon strength of judgment and goodness of heart  a note from lady conway  i fly to attend them  edward marchmont  to sir edward marchmont bart  marchmonthouse london marchmont i tell you frankly i do not approve your precipitate choice it is a prudent one with regard to fortune but as to birth i could wish you had been a little more nice i have been making enquiries about miss ormsbys family her father i find has the character of a worthy honest rich man but he may have dropped from the heavens above or  more applicable indeed  ascended from the earth beneath for any thing i know to the contrary for in spite of my strictest researches i cannot possibly learn he had a single forefather mrs ormsbys family it seems is tolerably genteel  had i no knowledge of your disposition except what your letter conveyed to me i should certainly conclude you were one of the greatest misers on earth and so impute your  i believe i misapply the word  passion for this girl wholly to avaricious motives but i well know you are greatly above such meanness your estate is encumbered yet it surely is a competence nay much more than a competence and he who possessing enough sighs for more is a despicable fellow the votaries of plutus are more wretched and far more contemptible than those of any other god in the whole pagan theology  there is still another consideration  of which i apprehend you have not been sufficiently mindful  of more weight than either high descent or riches i mean the interests of the heart you call yourself a lover yet there is not a sentence throughout your letter that appears to me to savor of a passion of which i am bold enough to think myself an excellent judge you will allow me likewise to know something of matrimony as i have been almost four years a husband and believe me marchmont that love  love alone can make that state desirable you have often laughed at what you call my romantic notions but i still maintain them and shall to the end of my days in defiance of all your lively raillery i know you have the many on your side i care not i am by no means ashamed of being singularly in the right what because most minds are too dull or too coarse to feel the lively and delicate sensations that warm and purify my heart must i therefore give up an opinion founded not on imagination but experience and joining mine to the vulgar voice call love romantic its joys evanescent and delusive no i neither can nor will conceal from myself or others that i am supremely happy and that it is love which makes me so  if i thought you one of those grovelling wretches into whose narrow souls love cannot force an entrance i should not have touched on this subject but i am convinced your generous enlarged mind is capable of entertaining this passion in its utmost sublimity and that the insensibility you have preserved to your twentyfourth year is wholly accidental or perhaps in a great measure owing to the quickness of your penetration which enables you so easily to develope the insignificance which i acknowledge does but too much abound in the female character  miss ormsby you tell me has sense enough for her sex you should rather have said for her education for certainly sir edward it is false and illiberal to suppose the natural capacities of women much  if at all  inferior to our own undeniably there are numbers of them very triflers but may not the same be said of the men and how many ladies do we see overcoming all the disadvantages they have to contend with make a distinguished figure in conversation let me ask you  i know you will smile at the question  did you ever hear lady methuen make an observation you would have blushed to pronounce  i am running into a greater length than i intended when i began this letter i designed only to put you upon considering whether the personal attractions of miss ormsby will make her an agreeable companion for life you dont seem to be in very violent raptures with them even at present and i caution you not to suppose that your inclination will be lasting because it is moderate  it is in its own nature perishable an attachment founded entirely on outside beauty can never hold a man of sense  nor perhaps any man  for an length of time  i am confident you have no sentiments for miss ormsby that pity does not inspire you see her unhappy  know yourself the cause and wish to relieve her is not this the whole matter though your scrupulous generosity did not allow you to speak thus plainly  it is generally thought arrogant to return pity for love i cannot conceive why it is brutal not to feel for the distressed doubly so when we ourselves are  though ever so innocently  the cause of their uneasiness therefore i think it impossible in such cases to divest ones self of compassion and both unnecessary and inexpedient to conceal it i would not have a gentleman or even a lady say  i pity you  but i think they may  nay ought  to express pity by their looks softened voice perhaps tears and indirectly by their words a man certainly with rather more circumspection than need be observed by a woman compassion when delicately shown is far from being offensive it is grateful  i hope what i have said on this subject will be sufficient to induce you to treat me in this affair with the same unreserve you do in all others though certainly to any other than a longtried faithful friend  in which light i dare to think you regard me  it would be dishonorable in you to communicate your sentiments for miss ormsby because it would be exposing her to censure custom having  i believe very rightly  made it improper for the fair sex to love first they should     be wooed and not unsought be won whether you think fit to trust me or not with the situation of your heart i conjure you be careful not to hide it from yourself be assured it is not sufficient for you merely to give this young lady a preference to others it is requisite you should love her a preference in a disengaged heart is not of much consequence if circumstances favor it may probably improve into passion but it is not at all certain that it will do so think then  think my dear marchmont what a state of misery would be yours if you should bind yourself to a woman who is little more than indifferent to you and afterward meet one able to teach you the  then dreadful  lesson of love  as you value your happiness make no professions till your heart itself dictates them  with the most fervent friendship yours methuen  to lord methuen  london marchmonthouse never sure was so elaborate an epistle written to so little purpose pity that one who writes so well should ever write in vain  into what a passion has miss ormsbys humble birth thrown my usually temperate friend i am surprised you were generous enough not to bring her father from the waters under the earth however i allow it is a desirable thing to make genteel connections and if i could call back past time and reverse the decrees of fate miss ormsbys descent should be noble but as this is not entirely in my power i am content to let matters stand as they are what a wide field would this subject open to the range of a moralist pity i have no talents that way i could have told you that high birth is merely incidental that the real source of honor is within the mind etc etc  after making so light of what i assure you i look upon as your most important objection you will not expect me to pay much attention to the other the whole force of your arguments turns on this single point  i dont love hannah ormsby the consequence of which is i may hereafter love somebody else i certainly have not that sort of sentiment for her to which alone your romantic imagination would affix the name of love but i esteem and  you have reconciled me to the acknowledgment  i pity her the sweet girl is unhappy it is in my power to make her otherwise  and shall i not methuen i should despise myself were i capable of hesitating between the prudent and the generous yes i will sacrifice my longpreserved liberty to her peace neither do i apprehend any danger from this conduct i am confident i never shall be in love according to your eccentric notions of that passion i doubt not hannah will always be able to maintain the preference i already give her indeed were i to meet a woman equally amiable who joined a very superior understanding to a form more attractively lovely  i know not that i could answer for my heart but i have not the least expectation of ever seeing such a person ninetenths of the young and handsome part of the sex  and positively my wife must be young and handsome  are intolerably affected impertinent and insignificant by the way it is of little consequence whether it be nature or education that makes them so it is sufficient for me to know that the thing is certain and certain it is even by your own confession  to be very serious  it is too late for you to argue against my choice  it is made it is true i have not yet declared myself but i have said more than i would unsay for worlds could i recede from what i had even looked i should hold myself unworthy to be lord methuens friend  i have not written to my sister wentworth on this subject because i expect to see her in a few days i shall be miserable if the dear creature does not approve mes petites demarches  i am interrupted by company farewell  edward marchmont  to miss obryen  london chetwynd villa as your last gives me an account of your arrival at lord linfields i set about answering all your dear letters to begin with the one that desires us to direct your conduct to the marquis you cannot imagine how much it embarrassed and distressed us there is no denying it  it would have half broken our hearts had you settled in france but we did not dare to give you the least hint of such a nature well knowing you would in that case refuse st clair were he ever so dear to you could we have been certain you had no tendresse for him we should not have had any scruple about the matter his rank and fortune would not have biassed us for we were far from fearing with lady enmore that you might never have such another offer our sole difficulty arose from the apprehension of your loving him your uncle indeed was inclined to think the marquis indebted for your confessed predilection only to his superiority over your other admirers and to his softness which excited yours he thought your letter to him supported this opinion do you imagine he would say to me that a girl in love could write on such subjects as these with so much judgment and accuracy he acknowledged however that he apprehended the little frenchman in a fair way of gaining your affections but for my part when i considered that he obviously possessed a larger portion of my dear saucy girls favor than any other gentleman has been fortunate enough to obtain i could not help fearing he had already conquered a heart which has braved so many attacks in this persuasion i wrote to you i begged you to examine your heart and choose whatever was most consonant to its wishes without a thought of us who could not but approve of every thing you did and must be happy in your happiness this letter i suppose you have not received as you do not mention it  you will perhaps be surprised that i once wrote to you about this gentleman in rather a favorable manner the proposal was represented to me to be so advantageous that i was afraid i should be wanting to your interest if i did not seem to approve it i at first slattered myself i should be able to master my selfishness but the more i reflected on the subject the more insupportable became the thought of losing your society  the pleasure we received from your two next letters amply compensated the anxiety conveyed to us by the preceding valeria has acted like herself this sentence only which comprehends every thing noble can sufficiently express our sentiments of your conduct to miss marchmont  we are charmed with the hope of soon seeing you lord melmont says he expects his daughter and mr domville will pay him a visit early in the summer i fancy it would be agreeable to you to wait for them your friend lady lucy will be delighted with your company but if you would rather come to ireland immediately let us know and mr chetwynd will go for you  why did my lovely valeria say in one of her letters  if i am handsome do you really think i can suppose you ignorant of your beauty if you have either eyes or ears you must know it for you have never been debarred the use of lookingglasses nor the conversation of the other sex no man  not even your uncle  ever addressed you but in a style that would have been ridiculous flattery to any other you have subdued more hearts than you have numbered years how then is it possible for you to doubt your being handsome i know you are not vain and when you write to me i insist on your taking no pains to avoid the imputation of vanity i wish to be made acquainted with every thing that concerns you even to the conversations you are engaged in and if you gratify my desire selfpraise is unavoidable i aspire to be treated with the same freedom you would use to a correspondent of your own age nay more for friendship might not be able to exclude misconstruing envy from a younger breast whereas i am prouder even of your exterior charms than it would at all become you to be and fancy to myself a kind of merit in your merits  my brother is violently afflicted with the gout in his head and stomach his physicians have scarcely any hopes of him poor lady obryen is in great distress on his account i own to you i think she has not much reason so sordid and illtempered a husband will be no great loss francis obryen has been apprized of his fathers dangerous state he is now at rome but we expect this intelligence will bring him home  as mr chetwynd is writing to you i shall lengthen this epistle only by the assurance of my being  your ardently affectionate friend caroline chetwynd  to mrs chetwynd  ireland hermitage i write this from the sweetest romantic spot in england but i must go back a little to tell you how i came here the morning after i arrived in london lord and lady methuen  a most amiable pair  paid a visit at lord linfields purposely to see miss marchmont and conduct her to her sister they seemed much disappointed at not finding her more though on mrs wentworths account than their own not being at all acquainted with her i told them monsieur and madame de villemars extreme reluctance to part with their niece had induced her to lay aside her intention of coming to england i added that i had a letter from her to mrs wentworth which i wished for an opportunity of delivering into that ladys own hands as i was extremely desirous of her acquaintance  you must visit her then madam said lady methuen for she never leaves home  the retired and melancholy mrs wentworth observed lord methuen would be no desirable companion to a lady in the full bloom of youth and beauty and who possesses a great deal of vivacity  if i rightly read her animated face  when i have the honor to be better known to lord methuen i dare to think he will judge more favorably of me i have not been wholly nursed in the lap of prosperity and i hope my heart is not naturally so hard but it could have felt for others although it had never found occasion of feeling for itself  i did not in the least mean to question the goodness of your heart madam said his lordship  if you had returned his lady i should have entertained a very poor opinion of your skill in physiognomy now i pretend to be a perfect connoisseuse in that science and i am positive miss obryens fine features express as much goodnature as vivacity i am sure my dear added she addressing me with an agreeable familiarity you will not have any objection to going with me to mrs wentworths tomorrow morning lord methuen cannot accompany us as he is engaged in town my coach will hold us and our women  i readily assented to this proposal telling lady linfield that i hoped she would not be offended with me as she saw that by a noncompliance i should eternally forfeit my reputation for goodnature she made some polite objections but lady methuens earnestness prevailed  we accordingly set out at eleven next day and after a pleasant little journey of about sixteen miles arrived at hermitage before two  mrs wentworth knowing the equipage from the window ran out and getting to the coach side just as we were alighting she exclaimed my sister is here  alas my dear said lady methuen taking her hand she is not here but this young lady can give you some account of her  i felt exceedingly for her disappointment tears of pity filled my eyes  they alarmed her  ah cried she my poor leonora is ill  no i assure you madam she is extremely well at least she was so when i left paris  when we got into the parlour the lovely widow strenuously embraced her friend saluted me and placing herself by me earnestly enquired for miss marchmont i presented her letter saying i should think her very ceremonious if she scrupled reading it before us  perhaps my dear harriet you would rather retire to read it i am sure miss obryen will excuse you  miss obryen echoing my name with much quickness and surprise  i beg her pardon and yours said her ladyship for neglecting to introduce her to you but really my concern for you put it out of my head  you are on your way to ireland i suppose madam said mrs wentworth  i replied not immediately i thought the question extremely abrupt  pleading impatience to peruse her letter she left the room and lady methuen in a very polite manner apologized to me for  what she called  the whimsicalness of her behavior  in some little time she returned  her every feature enlivened by joy and softened by sensibility she flew toward me and clasping me in her arms poured forth a thousand praises and acknowledgments of  what she termed  my generosity to her sister she spoke incoherently and in a style extravagantly beyond my deserts  lady methuen looked on in silence for some minutes then begged mrs wentworth to tell her the cause of those transports but just now said she your behavior to miss obryen was so cold as to border on incivility at present it is as unaccountably warm  at first louisa i regarded this charming lady as the destroyer of a sisters happiness read that letter and see how unjust i have been to her perhaps i ought not to divulge leonoras secrets but i can hide nothing from you  i am summoned to breakfast    i return to finish my letter while the coach is getting ready we are going to take an airing and shall probably meet sir edward marchmont mrs wentworths only brother whom she expects here this morning i am sorry he is coming to break in on our sweet female party i cannot say i dislike either men or mirth yet i never spent two days more to my taste than these last past when both were entirely excluded lady methuens fine understanding makes her a most agreeable companion mrs wentworth has a great deal of good sense and there is a peculiar softness and delicacy in every thing she says that is ineffably pleasing she has the most insinuating gentleness of manners there dwells a melancholy grace about her which touches the heart in a way not easy to describe whenever i look on this beautiful unhappy woman i call to mind those lines  as when a dusky mist involves the sky the moon through all the dreary vapors spreads the radiant vesture of her silver light over the dull face of nature so her charms divinely graceful shone upon her grief brightning the cloud of woe i am afraid she is melancholy to excess when alone for her louisas and my joint endeavors can hardly keep her in tolerable spirits for any length of time amiable unfortunate how deeply do i feel your woes her history which you may remember i promised you will be conveyed to you by this post i have interspersed it with some account of her family when you reflect on my intimacy with miss marchmont  who is of a communicative disposition and showed me several of her sisters letters  you will not be surprised that my information is so particular  lady methuen says sir edward marchmont is a charming fellow and bids me take care of my heart i felt more for st clair than i ever did  or it may be ever shall  experience for any other of his sex yet how readily i resigned him not indeed without regret but that regret abundantly compensated by the pleasure of serving my friend and the delightful consciousness of having acted rightly  always your valeria obryen  mrs wentworths father sir george marchmont was on a tour through france when he became enamoured of mademoiselle de villemar a little lively brunette who had just escaped out of a convent where she had been brought up having lost her mother in her infancy her father whose mind was bent on aggrandizing his family had designed to make her take the veil that he might leave the larger fortune to his son  the gloom of a cloister ill suited the gay temper of angelica but in vain she remonstrated she wept in vain monsieur son pere was inexorable her good genius did not abandon her in this extremity but having made interest with the king of terrors prevailed on his dread majesty to dismiss the old gentleman from all his employments on this side eternity  her brother was too generous to use the advantage a fathers unjust pride had given him he took her home and promised to give her a handsome fortune  her situation became now as agreeable as it had before been the contrary monsieur de villemar was married to a lady who had passed two years in the same convent with her and the tenderest friendship had always subsisted between them  she was soon distinguished by the count de meulan whose addresses were highly approved of by her brother and not objected to by her this nobleman bore a respectable character and though past the bloom of life might still be thought handsome angelica however had no liking to his person but her little heart fluttered at the thought of being a countess  while this match was on the tapis she happened to meet sir george marchmont in the thuilleries he walked with some gentlemen and ladies she knew by which means they became acquainted it is not surprising that two very engaging young persons should draw each others attention pour abreger  a few visits created a lively passion on both sides  he declared himself to her brother who answered mademoiselle was engaged sir george in despair threw himself at his mistresss feet le beau chevalier anglois was not to be resisted she heartily explained her situation assured him of her indifference to meulan and with a modest frankness confessed her attachment to him as she knew her brothers high sense of honor would never permit him to countenance her jilting the count she consented to marry sir george privately and afterward fled with him to england  when monsieur de villemar found his sister was married he rightly judged a pursuit would be improper though he did not endeavor to detain her he was extremely shocked at her marrying a heretic when she forsook the roman catholic communion his indignation was so great he resolved never to see her more  the affection of an amiable husband she found sufficient to console her for the loss of every thing she had sacrificed to him they lived in an uninterrupted course of happipiness for twelve years when lady marchmont died leaving only three children out of seven  edward who was then eleven years old harriet nine and leonora eight  monsieur de villemar was more grieved at this event than might have been expected from his antecedent behavior and having no children of his own readily gave ear to his wifes proposal of adopting one of his late sisters he wrote to sir george earnestly begging him to repair the injury he had done him in depriving him of his sister by giving him up one of her daughters whom he would look on as his own child and leave her every thing he died possessed of stipulating only that she should be entirely resigned to his care and that he must be allowed to bring her up in the roman catholic religion  sir georges notions of religion were extremely liberal he was likewise a good deal in debt so he cheerfully accepted the offer and dispatched the little leonora to paris the dowager lady marchmont having promised to provide for harriet who lived mostly with her  while sir george wholly devoted himself to the education of his son his mother applied herself with no less diligence to that of his daughter she looked on music dancing etc as the mere superficies of education she made her young pupil read she taught her to think she showed her to appretiate the blessings of life justly and patiently to bear its misfortunes her chief care was to implant religion deeply in her mind and not only religion but honor for however insufficient a guide the latter may be without the former it certainly is an excellent auxiliary it gives a superior nobleness to our thoughts and a brighter polish to our actions  at eighteen the lovely allaccomplished harriet marchmont became the wife of mr wentworth this gentleman came recommended by every advantage that birth education and fortune could add to the bounty of nature her friends approved and she adored him but alas he had one ill quality of which she unhappily was ignorant  a most jealous temper strengthened by an unfavourable opinion of female virtue  they lived in the most perfect harmony almost a year nor did she in all that time discover his disposition perhaps she would never have done so had not her brother who was just then returned from italy brought home with him mr methuen eldest son to lord methuen whose overbearing proud and unsocial temper drove his children from his society mr methuen was continually with mr marchmont either at marchmonthouse or wentworthplace mr wentworth looked on his wife as the cause he narrowly watched her actions but in the true spirit of jealousy was careful not to let her perceive he suspected her for fear of putting her on her guard  the innocent harriet saw not the precipice on which she stood she took no pains to conceal her esteem for her brothers friend when present she treated him with distinguished civility and in his absence frequently gave him the praises his merit entitled him to  unfortunately likewise his behavior to her was but too well calculated to confirm her husbands suspicions to all women he was attentive and polite but to mrs wentworth he was even assiduous he admired her  he loved her next to his louisa  miss louisa sydney was the daughter of a clergyman who had left her a very small fortune it was madness to suppose the haughty lord methuen would ever allow his son to make such an alliance mr methuen made both the young lady and her mother sensible that it would be fruitless to propose it to him and without much difficulty obtained their consent to a private union to be kept secret during the old lords life his frequent visits began to be observed the world set him down as miss sydneys lover and for once the world said less than the truth since he was already her husband the report reached his father who roundly told him he must either give up miss sydneys acquaintance or his favor and concluded with reminding him that he had intended some time before to make another excursion to italy which he hoped he had not forgotten this disagreeable intelligence he quickly communicated to his louisa and her mother who concurred in advising him to make the voyage his father proposed he staid but a short time abroad being unable to support the absence of his beloved wife though after his return he dared to make her but short visits and those seldom and private  under such circumstances he found great consolation in complaining to the gentle compassionating harriet whom he made unreservedly his confidante he sought opportunities of conversing with her alone that he might talk of his louisa conscious of the honorable nature of his friendship for her he thought not of concealing it from her husband or any other no wonder then if the magnifying eye of jealousy saw enough to condemn them  she began at length to perceive a considerable abatement in mr wentworths affection in vain she sought the cause for it in her own blameless conduct she was obliged to solve it into inconstancy she would not upbraid him she endeavored to hide her suspicions but she could not hide the grief they occasioned her he perceived it and methuen being in london placed it to the account of his absence he asked her with a kind of sneer why she was lowspirited unused to speak any thing but pure truth she hesitated and appeared confused while she attributed it to a headache  o you want company child you will be better next week mr methuens conversation  he stopped suddenly as recollecting himself but the quickness wherewith he had spoken  the tone and look of angry irony  the emphatical pronunciation of the name of methuen  at once opened her eyes she was all amazement and unable to speak a word in her own justification sat silent confusedly revolving in her mind every circumstance of her conduct to methuen and his to her which could possibly give rise to her husbands displeasure her silence and very apparent disorder had but too much the air of guilt and doubtless was so construed by the selftormenting wentworth  at this very instant a servant came in and delivered a letter to his lady the superscription was a mans hand and like her brothers who being the only gentleman she corresponded with she imagined the letter was from him and very naturally said aloud as she opened it from edward her cheek burned when she found it was from methuen  the occasion of this fatal letter was as slight as its consequences were important miss marchmont had written to her sister to send her some english books mr methuen having a friend going to paris promised to get him to take them to her and mrs wentworth commissioned him when he went to london to buy them he had lost the list she gave him and wrote to her for another  though this was his sole motive for writing he had not entirely confined himself to this subject he could not help mentioning his louisa who was always uppermost in his thoughts  had she been at liberty to show this letter it would have effectually destroyed every suspicion against her but she had too much honor to betray so important a secret and determining with herself to ask mr methuens permission  which she did not doubt of obtaining  to entrust mr wentworth with the knowledge of his marriage she thought it best not to touch on the subject till the next week which was fixed on for their removal to london for the winter she did not therefore contradict the unintentional falsehood she at first uttered of the letter being from her brother  if we do not judge by the event her conduct was not very imprudent and surely it was no great crime by silence to confirm her husband in a mistake she had not intended to lead him into and which she meant should continue but three or four days yet the fatality that seemed to wait on all her actions so ordered it that this little deceit was in a great measure the cause of her ruin for having unthinkingly thrown the cover of the letter on a table that stood by her he found it and easily discovered methuens hand in the direction and his arms in the seal  the little interval between that time and their going to london he was almost continually abroad and she suffered all the uneasiness her situation may be supposed to occasion impatiently longing for the time which she expected would put an end to his jealousy and her own consequent trouble  too soon came the time appointed for this unfortunate journey  the morning after they arrived in town mr methuen came to wait on them mr wentworth was not at home and his lady seized on that opportunity to make her intended request which being immediately granted she in return went to pay a visit to mrs sydney and her daughter to whom she had long before promised her acquaintance  on her return home she found the following note from her grandmother  to mrs wentworth  london hermitage  th november dear harriet i request you will come here instantly on the receipt of this your father  ah my child how shall i soften the dreadful tidings  your dear father is not expected live he was so far on his way to london when overtaken by a violent illness edward who is with him is half distracted i scarcely know what i write perhaps i magnify the danger do not be too much alarmed come to us immediately  sophia marchmont   in all imaginable distress she threw herself again into her coach after giving lady marchmonts billet to a servant with orders to deliver it to his master as soon as he came in  the day after her arrival at hermitage sir george breathed his last a messenger was dispatched with this melancholy news to his soninlaw the fellow returned with an account that he was not to be found that he had left his house very early that morning and nobody had seen him since  the unhappy harriet already sinking under the loss of her father fainted away on receiving this intelligence it rather surprised than affrighted lady marchmont and sir edward yet they instantly sent another servant to london who brought back word that mr wentworth had killed mr methuen in a duel and fled no one knew where he brought the following letter to sir edward which had been found on his unfortunate brothers table  to edward marchmont esquire nov  th five oclock in the morning i should not think myself justified in leaving england for ever without explaining my reasons for taking such a step to a family i am so nearly connected with and for which i have so perfect a respect as sir george is so dangerously ill i think proper to address myself to you  in what words shall i inform you of a sisters infamy but heavens what is your dishonor to mine  o edward who could have supposed that harriet  whose mind seemed as angelic as her form  was capable of betraying a husband who adored her  accursed methuen  but his hearts blood shall wash out the stain he has cast on my honor by the eternal justice it shall  my vengeance has slept too long  i could not believe her personally guilty i thought her heart alone had strayed i endeavored to pay indifference with indifference i even flattered myself i had succeeded  delusive hope  at this very moment when my blood boils with resentment it rends my soul to think  i part with her for ever  i intended to write to you calmly and tell you every circumstance on which i found my opinion of her guilt but my hand refuses to trace the odious particulars let it suffice to say they could not hide their mutual fondness even before my face that they correspond by letters and  can i write it  make assignations this last insupportable injury i neither knew nor suspected till yesterday morning i went to see my friend henderson his servant said he had gone out about an hour before and was expected back every moment i stepped up to the dining room to wait his return where i had not been many minutes when my coach stopped at the opposite door and harriet alighted from it i saw her enter the dining room and sit down an old lady  who doubtless was the confidante of this infamous amor  came in they saluted each other and talked standing for some time the hellhag then advanced toward a window that was open and endeavored to shut it down at the same instant a hackneychair the curtains close drawn on the inside was carried into the hall the door of which was immediately shut  insufficient precautions the old woman had not been able to pull down the sash  i plainly perceived the hated methuen  he bowed to both ladies took hold of harriets hand  that faithless pledge of the love she vowed to me  and seating her on a sofa shut down the window i saw no more but i had already seen too much to need any further proof of my wretchedness  the hour approaches in which i shall rid the world of a villain or from his hand receive insensibility of my wrongs adieu then marchmont  adieu for ever i require it of sir george and you as a last testimony of friendship that if i am the survivor you make no enquiries after me never can i return to this kingdom i will not be pointed at for  my heart bursts with rage  who that valued honor would trust it to a womans keeping by what fatal phrenzy was i induced to renounce my just  my wellgrounded opinion of the sex in favor of such  i will use no epithet of reproach she is your sister and she is  destruction  she is the wife of wentworth  tell her  no tell her nothing i will forget her for ever let her do the same by me  if vice can make her happy  may she be so if she will return to virtue  may the almighty accept her penitence but i never can  i insist on it however she must not be treated with unkindness either by her father or you i took her out of your family her misconduct affects only myself therefore by me only let it be remembered  my will was made when she was innocent or i was deceived were it to be done again i should not alter a tittle or it it makes her mistress of my whole fortune let it take place as if i were dead i would to heaven i were to be past the sense of dishonor  dishonor  the word fires me  i fly to vengeance  henry wentworth   as this letter was delivered before mrs wentworth there was no concealing it from her it is past the power of words to tell the agonies it gave her they were too strong for her tender mind and long and successive fainting fits seemed to promise her gentle spirit a release from its earthly prison  as i fear i have already been too prolix in this melancholy recital and have now brought it to that pitch of distress that description is no longer able to assist the imagination i shall make the conclusion as concise as possible  several months were spent in ineffectual search after mr wentworth sir edward supposing he might have gone to spain where he had formerly passed two years wrote to cadiz to don juan dalmagro whom he had often heard his brother mention with friendship here follows the translation of don juans answer  to sir edward marchmont bart  england cadiz i was honored signior with your letter some time ago and should have answered it immediately if your brother  who was then my guest  had not been in a dangerous fever occasioned by a fall from his horse by which likewise he received a severe contusion on his head i would not inform you he was here lest your pleasure at finding him should if he died add the sting of disappointment to the sorrow of losing him for ever unhappily the event justifies my precaution  it is with sincere grief i tell you  he is dead  he left me no orders of any nature whatsoever and indeed he was not capable of doing so not being entirely in his senses during the whole time of his illness which lasted more than three weeks  i find no papers after him and no more money than will suffice to defray the necessary expenses  as the distance between spain and england makes it inconvenient to wait your directions about his burial i have taken the conduct of it on myself and you may expect his body to arrive in england some little time after you receive this  i have the honor to be etc   the innocent victim of misplaced jealousy was in so weak a state both of body and mind that lady marchmont thought it advisable to keep from her the knowledge of her husbands death but her brother was of a different opinion and with a proper degree of caution communicated it to her he was undoubtedly in the right great as must have been the first shock of this dreadful uncertainty it was hardly more difficult to support than the cruel suspense from which it delivered her her passions which had been so long wound up to the highest pitch now all at once lost their tension she sunk into a sort of stupid despair  lady marchmonts days were shortened by the too tender sympathy with which she beheld the miseries of her favorite child her death roused mrs wentworth from her lethargy and sharpened that sensibility whose fine selfpointed edge had been worn off by too rough an use  religious considerations assisting her good understanding after some time her tenderly attentive brother had the satisfaction to see her assume a degree of tranquillity  all her letters to her sister speak the resignation of a pious mind yet they sometimes contain such lively touches of sorrow as would wring compassion from the hardest heart  wentworthplace together with all her husbands large fortune is here is but she resides entirely at hermitage which her grandmothers will bequeathed to her being unable to bear the sight of a place where every object would so strongly call to remembrance happiness  for ever lost  though he is now near three years dead a sable robe  which on others but too frequently veils a joyful heart  still continues to make this faithful mourners person correspond with her mind  she has caused the most sumptuous monumental honors to grace her henrys tomb  those honors which greatness with mimic woe so often gives to vice  the hand of virtuous sorrow raised them over the remains of the noble illfated wentworth  i have been unpardonably negligent in leaving you all this time to suppose mr methuen was killed he was only dangerously wounded his father died of an apoplexy during his indisposition which left him at liberty to declare the marriage that had proved so fatal to mrs wentworth she had nevertheless so much greatness of mind as to continue her friendship to them both  to lord methuen  london hermitage i was met within four miles of hermitage this morning by your lady and my two lovely sisters is not leonora a most charming creature i cannot express how much i admire her what an elegant height and shape just that air which the spectator so finely calls recitative dancing  a symmetry of features how beautiful and exact  un teint de lis et de rose  such eyes bright eloquent and  as some french writer prettily says  just ready to be tender ah mon dieu what eyes they are nor france nor england can boast such another pair it is well for miss ormsby and it is well for myself that this little divinity is my sister  now i mention miss ormsby  you must know my affair goes on rapidly a declaration made  graciously received  and i am actually on my way to london to propose the matter to her father but enough of this for the present  do you recollect a dispute i once held with you and lady methuen you both against and i for natural affection now my lord if there be no such thing as natural affection between brothers and sisters on what principle will you account for the warmth wherewith i love a sister i am but a few hours acquainted with my present feelings would enable me to point out the fallacy of all your arguments surely i have no obligations to leonora nor is my selflove satisfied with the recollection of any services done to her the distance at which we have lived has prevented the exchange of kindnesses as a brother i cannot be supposed to love her for her beauty she seems to possess a cultivated understanding and a worthy heart but i am by no means a competent judge of either  particularly the latter  in so short a time how comes it then my friend but from the mere impulses of fraternal love that i felt  as i swear to you i did  a livelier emotion when i pressed this enchanting creature to my bosom than i experienced in receiving a parting embrace from the woman i mean to make my wife  how i should triumph over you if mv sisters sentiments did not seem to favor your opinion perhaps lady methuen has been poisoning her mind with her cold philosophy the dear girl does not at all return my tenderness her behavior to me is extremely polite but not affectionate  she just suffers my caresses apparently from the consideration of my being her brother i shall really be very unhappy if she will not love me my dear father was a little capricious in not allowing me to visit my mothers relations harriet was twice in france with her grandmother so she has the good fortune to possess leonoras friendship  it is late i am fatigued and sleepy adieu  i had intended to go to london tomorrow but have changed my mind and shall remain here a week or ten days  yours edward marchmont  to mrs chetwynd  ireland hermitage i have just received your letter my dear madam enclosed in one from lady lucy domville who scolds me unconscionably for staying here so long i mean to appease her by returning to town tomorrow as i should be sorry to make the linfield family think i slighted them  lady methuen went home eight days ago but mrs wentworths being a good deal indisposed with a cold induced me to remain with her indeed it is not easy to leave her i never in my life conceived such an enthusiastic regard for any person in so short a time i was delighted with miss marchmont  but mrs wentworth melts my whole soul to friendship pity and admiration  what a dangerous mixture of borh is sir edward  the attractive gaiety of miss marchmont  the irresistible sostness of mrs wentworth  i have promised the lovely harriet another visit before i leave england you cannot imagine how much she is obliged to me for devoting that time to her which she thinks i could spend more agreeably at lord linfields she seems extremely fond of my company and kindly expresses abundance of regret at parting with me this morning  sweetly extravagant  she exclaimed how can i live without you valeria her brothers fine eyes softly languishing seemed to repeat and how can i live without you valeria  i told you in my last that to humor a whim of lady methuens i was  a good deal against my inclination  passed on sir edward for his sister leonora her ladyship had the cruelty to keep him a whole day in his mistake in order she said to convince him he was misled by the vivacity of his imagination in an opinion he maintained against her lord and her she had taken the trouble to write down a conversation they had on this subject which as i know my uncle loves argumentative pieces i enclose  mrs wentworth sends to me to propose a walk some new project i suppose for improving the gardens etc not that they require it  the place is a perfect paradise already but having more leisure and more money than she well knows how to employ she is ever creating new beauties around her  tell my kind uncle i cannot think of giving him the trouble of coming for me and shall therefore wait for lady lucy  adieu  valeria obryen  enclosed in the preceding letter lady methuen throwing down a book it is surprising how the whole tribe of novel writers have fallen into this error  sir e marchmont what error does your ladyship reprehend  lady methuen that of supposing that a parent and child will feel a reciprocal affection while they are ignorant of the relationship that subsists between them  sir edward and do you think such a matter impossible i take the liberty to differ from you madam the ties of nature are wonderfully strong and almost imperceptibly fine i do believe that parents and children brothers and sisters or such near relations would by a secret sympathy an involuntary and irresistible impulse of the mind find themselves attached to each other without knowing why  lord methuen my dear sir edward you talk more like a poet than a philosopher that is to say with more elegance than sound reasoning for my part i am inclined to think that after we pass the brute creation we shall find natural affection to be extremely limited the parsimony of nature has not thought fit to bestow the same perfect instinct upon us as upon other animals trusting our preservation to our higher powers of mind  sir edward what then my friends you will not allow that the human species possess any of that unerring sympathy which directs the newdropt lamb to the teat designed for its preservation while a hundred other fleecy mothers bleat unheeded round  lord methuen no my flowery friend i will not allow it i must maintain that natural affection does not exist at all with us uncoupled with knowledge  lady methuen if a child should be changed at nurse the supposed parents will take the same care of it and feel for it the same fondness they would have done to their proper offspring and the substitute will experience the same reverence and affection for them it would have entertained for its own father and mother  sir edward i believe your ladyship may be right so far but this only proves what lord methuen seemed to hint just now  that other causes combine to attach us to our offspring although these causes might  in the case you have mentioned  seem to supply the place of nature yet i do not thereby perceive why these very parents if they afterward became acquainted with their own child might not love it tenderly without discerning the cause though they might still prefer the imaginary child to the real one from the necessary effects of custom and prejudice  lady methuen i fear sir edward your sympathy stands on a slippery foundation  sir edward well my lord what causes do you suppose to cooperate with natural affection for i presume you had some such meaning when you said that our preservation was partly trusted to our higher powers of mind  lord methuen first then i will mention  selflove that strongest affection of the mind which governs us with the most uniform and uninterrupted influence which teaches us to set a peculiar value on an estate a house a horse a dog or any other possession merely because it is our own children are our property in a more particularly manner than any thing else they are part of ourselves they owe their being to us and entirely depend on us i must not omit that we always extend good will to a person we have served and kind and tender parents may reasonably think they have laid great obligations on their children the conferring of favors is a very powerful incentive to love even more than the receiving of them strange as this observation is its justness cannot be contested if this part of our tempers is not to be accounted for from selflove i believe it is wholly unaccountable  sir edward there is some truth and some imagination in your observations but why will you refer the dear unaccountable generosities of our nature to selflove you confuse my ideas i no longer know what you mean by the term surely there is nothing so disinterested as parental affection  lady methuen it is indeed difficult to mark where selflove runs into the social but my lord sir edward expects you to find some more amiable auxiliaries to natural affection  lord methuen a sense of duty must powerfully influence any mind not utterly depraved compassion softly induces us to love an infant in its helpless state and as it grows up we admire its beauty esteem its merit and are grateful for its gratitude  sir edward there are instances of parents loving children without beauty merit or gratitude  lady methuen if the parents are unworthy themselves it is little more surprising that they should love their unworthy offspring than that bad people should love themselves besides you must allow a great deal for the force of habit a parent loves a child many years before it can be guilty of vices for which youth may not form a sufficient excuse and though you deny the power of selflove you must grant that a sense of duty and of compassion still remains to aid the powerful instinctive fondness of nature which will operate in favor of the child whether deserving or undeserving  lord methuen let us admire the wisdom of providence which has not left the care of the infant to depend on the goodness of the parent the love of children to their parents arises almost entirely from their own virtue and the desert on the other side the love of parents toward their children is an instinct not materially differing from the instinct of brutes like all other instincts impelling from feeling to action without any deductions of reason we see that the parent who has not virtue to nourish the soul by education guided by unerring instinct protects and cherishes the helpless body  lady methuen i must own myself inclined to think that natural affection does not subsist at all at least not with any considerable force except from the parent to the child  sir edward from what source do you derive our affection to our parents if they be good you say from gratitude and esteem but suppose them bad  lady methuen habit and a sense of duty may create all the affection they can be imagined to feel  sir edward if the parent has been always bad a habit of loving them could scarcely ever have taken place and as to duty  it rules the actions only not the heart it gives the external marks of affection but cannot possibly inspire it now from what but the secret workings of nature arises love to a parent whose character we cannot esteem and from whom we have received no obligations  lord methuen my dear marchmont you are supposing a mere chimera there are very few such parents as you describe and those few you may depend on it are not loved by their children  sir edward well my friends i hope you will at least allow that fraternal affection is something more than friendship  lady methuen perhaps fraternal affection is only friendship i grant you we generally feel a more lively tenderness for our brothers and sisters than for any other friends yet this may not be occasioned by the sympathy of nature but because we have had more opportunities of knowing them and exchanging obligations with them  lord methuen our love to our brothers sisters and relations in general may in a great measure be attributed to our having lived constantly amongst them and being for that reason better acquainted with them than with other people  lady methuen i fancy we shall end our dispute as disputes are generally ended  with all parties retaining their own opinions i must still condemn the absurdity of the novel writer who shall describe unknown relations distinguishing each other by an irresistible impulse and sir edward will still maintain his beloved sympathy  natural affection to all degrees of relationship etc  sir edward i acknowledge that my opinion has been opposed by strong arguments yet still i must persuade myself that were i by any accident to meet my sister leonora whom i have not seen since we were both children my heart would instantly distinguish her  lady methuen if you did not know her you would give her but the same portion of esteem that you would accord to the same degree of merit in another and if you conceived a friendship for her immediately on finding her to be your sister it would be wholly the effect of a strong imagination biassed by prejudice operating on a good and tender heart  to lord methuen  poplarhill london this day i attended the too charming miss obryen to lord linfields i was not a little chagrined on calling at your house to find you had already forsaken the gaieties of the town for the serener pleasures of poplarhill why did you go methuen i never wanted a friend so much as at this period your advice  but why do i talk of your advice  you would give me such as i have not fortitude to take how little have i already profited by your wise counsel you warned me not to engage myself to miss ormsby  i did and severely repent it  you bade me fly miss obryen  i did not and am irretrievably undone  what a number of little circumstances conspired against me  i gave free admittance to love under the disguise of fraternal affection and far from resisting the dangerous intruder i fancied there was a merit in cherishing it the deceit indeed lasted only a day but what will not such attractions do in a single day the manner of my introduction to her naturally prevented the stiffness and formality that is apt to attend a beginning acquaintance and placed us on the most easy and agreeable footing imaginable i gave myself up without reflection to the seducing charms of her conversation i thought i listened to her with delight only because she spoke the strongest sense adorned by the softest eloquence and gazed on her with rapture only because she was exquisitely beautiful your friendly letter brought me the first intimationof my danger i then saw there was a necessity for my quitting her but deceived myself so far as to think it would be more prudent to stay at hermitage  where she was to remain but two days  than to go to london where she was going i did not think of the affair that should have called me there nor how easy it is in fuch a place to avoid a person that does not seek you harriets illness prolonged her stay i ought to have gone  it was impossible  so firmly had love in silken fetters bound my soul  at first my conscience reminded me of my engagements and reproached me with giving to another what was miss ormsbys due but i soon learned to stifle its admonitions and the lovely valerias tender and affectionate care of my poor sister though little more than a stranger to her her unremitting endeavors to amuse her afforded me so many opportunities of admiring the goodness of her heart that i almost thought i was in the right to love her ah how cautious ought we to be of familiarizing ourselves to what we disapprove since we thereby confound the notions of right and wrong in our minds and utterly lose that nice discernment which at first marked out the boundaries of each and that delicate sensibility which shrunk from the appearance of evil  cruel powers  a letter from lady conway  impertinent woman  i have not patience to write another word  edward marchmont  to sir edward marchmont bart  london meadowvale a fortnight away and not been with my father yet o thou frosty spirited fellow were i hannah i should revoke the soft consent you are so slow to take advantage of  we shall soon be in town if we can spirit up this stupid sir james to come with us or prevail on him to let us go without him o if women were wise they would never part with liberty as long as they retained youth and beauty to be cooped up in the country when one has a mind to flaunt about in the metropolis  insufferable  we are immersed in stupidity not a man to flirt with or a woman worth railing at  sir james is now trotting about his grounds hannah sauntering through the garden where i suppose she would say  if it had not been said a thousand times already   the hills the groves the streams remain but damon here i seek in vain for my part i do nothing at all and this dull scene is repeated day after day so for any thing i can see to the contrary the vapors must soon put an end to the existence of  emily conway  to sir edward marchmont bart  london poplarhill it is impossible to express my concern for you my dear friend is there no way of freeing you from this fatal engagement if it be in my power to serve you i entreat you to command me without reserve suppose i was to pay a visit to miss ormsby and pretend from a concern for your happiness to betray your secrets to her by heartily informing her of your situation  has she do you think generosity enough to resign you or louisa i fancy could manage this nice affair with more delicacy and address  if you are determined to marry her i conjure you if you have the slightest regard for your future repose forbear to visit her rival the more such a woman as miss obryen is known the more she must be loved  i should have gone to you instead of writing but my poor little boy is not well and louisa very uneasy about him let me know however if i can do any thing for you and depend upon it my tenderness for them shall not render me indifferent to the interests of my friend  sincerely yours methuen  to lord methuen  poplarhill london what a project let me add  how unworthy of my friend  heavens did you think me capable of acting such an ungenerous part  i am resolved to marry her in other words i am resolved to be miserable better to be any thing than a scoundrel i forged the galling fetters for myself  honor inexorable honor commands me to wear them and i must obey her yes i will bind myself to one woman whilst i burn languish  die for another let not these unguarded expressions lead you to think i love miss obryen in a manner unworthy of her o my passion for her is as pure as the dewdrops that rest on the bosom of the lily  i have written to lady conway to apologize for my negligence i ventured to defer my wretchedness a little by postponing my application to mr ormsby till she comes to town  while i was at hermitage i had not the courage to think of miss ormsby my sister therefore was totally ignorant of my affairs as i did not think it would be using her well to suffer her to remain so any longer i wrote to her yesterday evening i would not let her perceive i was melancholy but on the contrary affected a gaiety that was far  oh very far  from my heart nor did i once mention miss obryens too dear name not that i should hesitate to confide in her but because i know her unbounded affection for me would make her miserable if she knew the half of what i suffer and i would not add a feathers weight to the load of woe she bears to be for ever exempt from sorrow by the return of my servant this morning i have her answer what penetration women have let me give you an extract from her letter  though to see you united to some worthy woman has long been the favorite wish of my heart yet i own i am far from being pleased to find you so much nearer matrimony than i imagined you were miss ormsby may  nay since she is your choice she must be amiable but i am positive she is not equal to my dear valeria indeed edward you have deceived me strangely never will i pretend to read the heart again since miss obryen is not the mistress of yours you have greatly disappointed me i had absolutely set my heart on an union between you and this lovely girl till i knew her i never wished you to attach yourself to a beauty as i believe they have generally more foibles than fall to the share of almost any other denomination of females but she seems to have no faults how was it possible for you when you saw and heard her to retain a thought of miss ormsby i am certain you did forget her for the time and i heartily wish you had forgotten her for ever such a superior creature as valeria would have justified inconstancy though she has no fortune i had rather see you married to a descendant of the families of sedley and obryen than to a merchants daughter with millions  and has not my valeria a fortune o ye unpitying powers why am i not at liberty to lay mine at her feet what value has money compared to her worth i cannot describe to you the variety of tormenting sensations every passage of harriets letter excites between it and my own reflections i am really little less than distracted i am almost reduced to envy those holiday coxcombs that i meet dancing up and down the streets whose superficial minds admit not of anxious thoughtfulness insensibility it is true shuts out refined and delicately pleasurable sensations but secures them likewise from their attendant pains insipid state however and to be wished for only by wretches who like me are doomed to misery that can end but with life  to be in london and not to go to lord linfields is impossible i shall take a ride to poplarhill tomorrow and stay with you till lady conway etc come to town i hope to find your sweet arthur recovered o methuen how blessed is your situation possessed of such a son and such a wife  a wife who was the woman of your choice  my god i shall set myself mad at last  farewell my dear augustus do not think i envy you be assured envy never yet had a place in the breast of  edward marchmont  to miss obryen  england paris o valeria why did i suffer you to go why accept your too generous resignation of the most amiable of men  unavailing resignation you did not  could not  resign his heart he is miserable  how i reproach myself for being the cause he makes me the confidante of his sorrows says he has no consolation but in my friendship injured st clair  if you knew all how must you despise and hate me my dear generous valeria i entreat and conjure you never let him know my mean selfishness but i am convinced you will not you are too nobleminded to seek to raise your own merit by comparing it with anothers baseness what a presumptuous creature i was to suppose it possible for me to supplant you do not triumph over me alas i am but too much humbled already  i must endeavor to make my future conduct atone for my past i will strive to suppress a passion so unworthy of its object  a passion that has ruined him oh the smart of this reflection is not to be borne  remove it  my tender pitying friend  remove this agonizing thought i have proposed to the marquis to follow you to england promising to write to you and to entreat my brother and sister in his favor i have already written to my brother yet surely it was unnecessary  can st clair want any eloquence but his own to plead for him if you have pity if you have gratitude if you know how to distinguish merit if all the graces that can adorn a human being can move you  speak peace to this charming mourner i adjure you by all the sacred friendship you have promised me make this deserving lover happy the marchioness his mother is ill as soon as she recovers he will hasten to throw himself at your feet if you refuse him  never again account yourself the friend of  leonora marchmont you will be sorry to hear lady mary enmore is married against her mothers consent she has left france with her husband i know not whether they went to england or ireland but i believe it was to the former lady enmore is greatly incensed against her    to miss marchmont  france london i triumph over you ah leonora how little do you know me nor do i think i have cause to triumph  sensible as i am that love much oftner flows from the caprice of a lover than the merit of the object beloved but why my dear girl are you so soon discouraged did you think he could transfer his affection in a few days you must give him time to forget his first passion  you must steal imperceptibly into his heart have patience my friend continue your friendship to him console him but forbear to cherish his hopes it was your wild project of sending him to england that has thus far impeded your success if you will pursue the plan i take the liberty to trace out to you i am persuaded you cannot fail of attaching him to you and that more strongly than he ever was to me gratitude that amiable affection which so powerfully sways the generous mind will exert all its influence for you and give you on his understanding on his honor and his heart a tie  additional to any i ever could have had  may i tell you miss marchmont you are industrious to torment yourself why else those extravagant selfaccusations what is the mighty injury you have done mons de st clair  deprived him of a woman who has not a shilling of fortune in the world  a woman who felt no tenderer sentiments for him than those which friendship dictated and in exchange you give him riches and love  i shall now take a separate paper which i insist on your showing to the marquis    how my leonora have i forfeited the place i held in your affection or rather how has monsieur de st clair attained a higher one and a higher one he certainly does possess or you would never have thought of making my acceptance of him the condition of the continuance of your friendship to me you are cruel my friend you are unjust can i command the emotions of my heart does not the marquiss giving way to a passion he ought for every reason to conquer tell you that love is involuntary and if it be so hard to destroy  is it do you think easy to create i esteem him i admire him  but still it is only esteem  it is only admiration  without a single spark of love i shall venture to leave it even to your partial decision whether or not with these cold unchangeably cold sentiments i ought to give him my hand  when i first knew him i preferred him to every other male acquaintance the friendship he professed for me pleased and flattered me he spoke not of love and if his behavior sometimes indicated it i attributed it to the gallantry of his nation he kept me a long time in this agreeable error i believe by lady enmores advice who knew my disposition and rightly supposed that a declaration on his part would be followed by a refusal on mine at length she thought proper to propose him to me as a match every way desirable and greatly above any thing my circumstances in life could warrant me to expect her arguments were chiefly drawn from prudence yet she did not fail to do justice to his merit though without positively asserting  like another fair advocate of his  that he had all the graces that can adorn a human being ah leonora i would to heaven he had twould be well for my peace if  but to return to my subject  wearied by lady enmores importunities i with difficulty consented to deliberate on the matter for a month i exacted in return for this concession that she would not let him know she had mentioned the affair to me at all in this however i have good reason to believe she did not keep her word with me for he  flattered without doubt by my conduct  threw off the restraint he had hitherto worn and talked to me incessantly of his passion i was so far moved by my sensibility of his worth that i determined with myself to endeavor to love him but instead of being able to effect this i found i liked him less after i had made the resolution than before i was used to welcome him as a friend  i now shunned him as a creditor who demanded of me what he had a just title to but what it was not in my power to pay him the promise which had been extorted from me constrained me to listen to him my indefatigable friend lady enmore took advantage of the time she had gained to write to my aunt chetwynd whose ascendant over my mind she was no stranger to in effect my aunt wrote to me and approved the marquiss addresses but it was only on condition if i approved them myself and lest her letter should influence me too much she even advised me not to marry him unless i loved him i balanced no longer but determining to break off the matter at once i left france thinking i could not take a more effectual method of restoring st clair that peace which i was sincerely grieved to have in any measure deprived him of after this decisive step i am astonished to be told he can entertain any hopes of me even though you should have left him to imagine my going was occasioned by my aunt chetwynds writing to me to come home with the domville family which you know was the ostensible reason of my departure  i cannot help thinking you have greatly softened the refusal i commissioned you to give him it was polite indeed  at least i intended it should be so  but it was peremptory it was such as would not have encouraged him to follow me if he chooses to come to england i cannot prevent him but that i may not in any respect be the object of his voyage i declare solemnly if he comes i will not see him  i slatter myself you are too just to be offended at my paying so little regard to your threats and entreaties on this subject when i tell you that my uncle and aunt chetwynd have acknowledged to me it would have made them miserable had i married a foreigner after this i should refuse monsieur de st clair without hesitating were he dearer to me than the ruddy drops that warm my heart i am sure he himself would confess that i ought to do so if he knows any thing of my obligations to them they have been more than parents to me ever since it pleased the almighty to deprive me of my father and mother their pecuniary favors to me only considered  without mentioning their affection their indulgence the graceful manner of giving which doubles the gift  i say their pecuniary favors only considered i should be the basest and most ungrateful of human kind were i capable of voluntarily giving a moments pain to the honorable donors  it has just come into my head to desire you to let the marquis peruse this letter if he be offended at the freedom wherewith i have treated him let him consider that the subject required plain dealing i set a high value on his friendship but i would rather lose it than possess his love  notwithstanding your threats my dear leonora i am bold enough to subscribe myself  your affectionate friend valeria obryen i grieve for poor lady mary i have a letter from her mother which gives me much reason to fear it will be no easy matter to reconcile them excluding the most unhappy circumstance of being at variance with a parent the little runaway will still be a considerable sufferer as she has but ten thousand pounds independent of lady enmore    to mrs chetwynd  ireland london does sir edward marchmont love my valeria  dear madam why did you ask this question you know not how sensibly it mortified me yet i will answer it with sincerity  he does not and i had believed he did  let me my honored my beloved friend confess to you all my folly  while i was at hermitage sir edwards behavior to me was such that it was almost impossible for me not to imagine myself dear to him this fatal persuasion made me little careful to shut my heart against him mrs wentworths insinuations confirmed my error but she i am convinced was very far from having any intention to deceive me she was deceived herself the tender and constant attention the delicate compliments he paid me seemed to have their source in his heart he followed me every where without appearing to know that he did so it could not be mere chance that always placed his chair next mine if his hand accidentally touched mine he trembled he would frequently heave deep sighs even in the midst of a cheerful conversation and look on me with a tenderness which unnecessarily borrowed from melancholy an additional power to touch the soul this description far from being exaggerated is really imperfect judge from it if i had not reason to think he loved me  to apologize in some sort for my weakness i will draw you a faint picture  for a faint one it must be  of this accomplished man  sir edward marchmont is indisputably one of the best made men in england tall rather slender and inimitably proportioned his person gives the joint ideas of strength and activity dignity and gracefulness his face is strikingly handsome though not regularly so a clear brown complexion rosy lips white and even teeth open forehead arched brow and dark hazel eyes penetrating sparkling with vivacity and good humor and when he pleases seducingly tender his address is most polite manly but not forward no pen can describe the varied charms of his conversation would you form an idea of it  imagine every thing that sound sense extensive knowledge lively wit and generously warm feelings can dictate dressed in the most elegant words that language can furnish  allow me to add a most romantic excuse for a romantic passion  hermitage is the very land of love nature has dealt it beauties with a lavish hand which have been heightened and improved by the taste of its owner the wild variety of the scene delights and surprises the eye  the spring had thrown her verdant mantle over the lawns and those early flowers of hasty duration  messengers of spring to announce the coming summer  shed their grateful perfumes around the pleasing stillness of the new  and then but halfdressed groves was interrupted only by cascades gurgling streams and the notes of euphony and gladness poured forth by the little feathered songsters  rural delights create a placid serenity in the mind which is wonderfully favorable to love and the sweet sadness inspired by pity in beholding the unfortunate mistress of this charming place gives a softness to the heart which disposes it easily and deeply to receive the impressions of a virtuous passion    i wrote the above yesterday and have read it over this morning with blushes i was going to destroy it but restrained myself my friend my parent you have a right to my confidence and never will i defraud you of it i have ever found you a far more indulgent monitor than that within my own breast i have erred deeply but not inexcusably and i will  yes madam i will recover my past involuntary misconduct your valeria will act like herself with pride i quote this sentence from one of your affectionate letters  to spare myself the pain of renewing this dangerous subject i send you a letter of mrs wentworths she has been my correspondent ever since i left her  is it not surprising that sir edward did not fix his choice on a woman of family  and why surprising a merchants daughter in the eyes of reason and religion   but in the eyes of the world madam she will disgrace the marchmont blood  such things are done every day  true but for what are they done necessity or avarice the first cannot be sir edwards motive and he has a soul above the last he loves her then it is very plain he can have no other inducement  i relapse into folly  forgive me  it is the last time  i now quit the subject for ever nor my pen nor my thoughts shall dwell on him more  i cannot tell you what stay i shall make here mr domville talks of setting out soon for ireland but the linfield family will not hear of our going observe i include myself i have the honor to stand very high in lady linfields good grace and am a singular favorite with his lordship who very confidently swears i am the handsomest woman in the world  you ask me news of lady mary enmore  webster i mean  i know nothing more concerning her than her mother has already told you i flatter myself i need not say what answer i intend to give to lady enmores too generous proposition god forbid i should ever accept what ought to be the property of another far from the meanness of usurping lady marys place in her mothers favor i shall do every thing in my power to restore her to it even at the hazard of disobliging lady enmore for whom i have a high consideration  adieu i am going with lady linfield and lady lucy to pay half a hundred formal visits do you not envy  your valeria obryen  to the countess dowager enmore  france london when mere compliments daily exhaust the language that should be sacred to friendship and unfelt and undue thanks are given in the most weighty and significant form of words it becomes impossible for a sincere and justly grateful heart to express its feelings i must then my dear lady enmore forbear to make you those acknowledgements i owe to your generosity conscious of my utter incapacity to pay them as i ought but i expect you will do me the justice to believe i have the deepest sense of your kindness to me  i entreat you not to be offended that i frankly tell you i cannot accept your offer  i dare not it would be robbery while you have a child or a grandchild in the world nothing shall prevail on me to take any part of your fortune  i have a long time honored myself by regarding you on the equal ground of friendship excuse me that i am unwilling now to descend from this height and look up to you as a benefactress it is true you seek to soften the idea of dependence by calling me daughter but it will not do pardon the pride of noble blood it was not till after many painful struggles i could consent to be supported by my uncle chetwynd the inexpressible delicacy of his conduct to me at length reconciled me to receiving unreturnable obligations and at present my gratitude is even pleasurable but i must say i should not choose to have any other hand bestow the like favors  wrong me not so much as to suppose i at all doubt your delicacy but relationship makes a wide difference in this case between mr chetwynd and your ladyship  were it necessary to multiply excuses for my unavoidable refusal i might add that my aunt chetwynd would have good reason to accuse me of ingratitude were i to choose any other mother than herself see madam i have both a father and a mother  poor lady mary has no father and you would deprive her of her mother  i am sensible that it must be a very trying thing when the object of the tender cares and fond anxieties of years by an imprudent marriage blasts all those longcherished high expectations which a parent naturally entertains for a beloved child but who is the person injured by this rash step  the party who takes it undoubtedly will it be justifiable then my friend to punish your daughter with your everlasting displeasure because she has ruined herself  mr webster you say is meanly born has dissipated his fortune and reputation  a dreadful character what countenance will be necessary to lady mary to screen her from the censures of the world  from the contempt and illtreatment of the very man to whom she has sacrificed so much can you who have hitherto been her best friend forsake her in that critical conjuncture when she most wants your assistance  yes more than in the helpless days of infancy i beg you to consider how much your neglect will put her in her husbands power and by your own account of him it is too probable he will abuse his advantages  o do not by your severity increase all the miseries that may be consequent on her misconduct  i ask no more for this giddy couple at present than forgiveness and friendship i would by no means recommend it to you to give them up any part of your fortune nor even to promise it only forbear to say you will not make them your heirs and mr webster must naturally suppose you will the consideration of his own interest will induce him to behave well to his wife and perhaps his respect esteem and gratitude may empower you to influence him to a reformation of his life i strongly advise you to make no disposition of your fortune at present settle it at your death on lady mary and her children if you do not give it to her to whom will you give it the persons that would accept it in prejudice to her rights would by that single action prove themselves unworthy of it and sure you will at least show a preference to your daughter amongst the undeserving can you with a safe conscience bequeath an estate you received from lord enmore to any other than lord enmores only child the discretionary power he left you was not i imagine in any case to deprive lady mary of his fortune but solely to restrain her from the very fault which notwithstanding his caution she has unhappily committed he doubtless depended on your tenderness for her will you then betray the trust reposed in you by one of the best and fondest of husbands would it not be dishonorable would it not be dishonest  pardon me dearest lady enmore that for a moment waving the respect due to your superior understanding and maturer years i have presumed to offer you my advice be assured the very great liberties i have taken with you were dictated by real esteem  by that honest affection and warm gratitude with which i have the honor to be  your ladyships much obliged valeria obryen  to miss obryen  london madam poplarhill the letter which i have the honor to enclose will i hope sufficiently apologize for this liberty  i cannot blame miss marchmont for seeking to form a connection between you and a man who appears to her so amiable but i wish  i very much wish  she had not fixed on me for his advocate i possess none of the persuasive powers of eloquence and if i did neither my honor nor my conscience would allow me to use them in the cause of a person whose character i know only by the report of a  perhaps partial  friend on such grounds i could not recommend a man to any ladys choice much less to miss obryen  the woman on earth  in whose happiness i am most interested  you may perhaps be surprised that i did not make an earlier application to you as you will perceive by the date of my sisters letter that i must have been in possession of it several days i was embarrassed  extremely embarrassed  how to interfere in a matter of such nicety i came at last to the resolution of sending you the letter itself nothing need be added to what miss marchmont says of the marquis de st clair  i dare not  cannot plead for him  it would be highly presumptuous to desire to know your determination yet madam allow me to request  most earnestly and respectfully to request  this mark of your confidence i shall esteem it as a singular favor  have the goodness the condescension to relieve my anxious heart i am deeply concerned  you know not  alas you will never know  how deeply i am concerned pardon the confusion of my style i find no expressions to do justice to the warmth of my friendship  may the happy  the supremely happy man you shall honor with your regard have as lively a sense of you transcendant merit as  edward marchmont  to sir edward marchmont bart  poplarhill london it is a sensible satisfaction to me that you did not join with miss marchmont  to have been unmoved by your united persuasions must have given me an air of obstinacy  give me leave sir edward to set you right in your opinion of the marquis de st clair my friend is not partial she is only just to his merit which is really uncommon gratitude obliges me to make this acknowledgment though it reproaches my insensibility  your professions of friendship demand my warmest thanks be assured your esteem is essential to the happiness of  valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london support me my inestimable friend  pride has hitherto been my chief prop on that weak side where most our nature fails and pride no longer aids me i blushed at the meanness of bestowing my heart on a man to whom i was indifferent who even loved another fatally for my peace i am now convinced that i am the mistress of his affections although forsome cause to me unknown he is obliged to give his hand to miss ormsby i enclose you the copy of a letter i received from him this morning i dare not make any comments  yet pardon me i must it is evident to me that sir edwards mind was ill at ease when he wrote that letter every expression betrays disquiet  he was extremely embarrassed  there was nothing in the affair that could have embarrassed an indifferent person does he not seem displeased with his sister yet he is not used to take offense without a cause  why should he  the most generousminded of men  suspect her of partiality in praising a gentleman whom he has no reason to suppose undeserving of her encomiums then his extreme desire to know my determination  does he not even intimate that he is deeply concerned in it  relieve my anxious heart  i would to heaven it was in my power what  oh what would i not do to restore him that tranquillity which must for ever be a stranger to my own breast  i cannot write  my tears blot the paper  pity  your valeria obryen  to sir edward marchmont bart  poplarhill london we came to town yesterday sir james called at your house this morning and there learned you were at lord methuens seat are you not a strange fellow sir edward upon my life one would almost imagine you were shunning us however i suppose you will now venture to london as we are here to introduce you to mr ormsby you were too shamefaced to introduce yourself  dear how modest it is  on your allegiance marchmont by all your hopes i do command you come a fine girl worth forty thousand pounds is not an object to be trifled with i am already astonished that hannah has not forgotten you so many weeks as you have been absent now two hours in a city four in a country town and two days in solitude would be the utmost limits to the constancy of a woman of spirit of an  emily conway  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill london time ever flies on leaden wings when my louisa is absent i have been but a week away from you so says the almanac but my heart contradicts it how solitary is this house without you  how silent without my prattling boy  our dear marchmont is with me i would not suffer him to go to his own house i do not leave him a moment alone his is not the kind of grief that should be indulged i endeavor to lead him into agreeable company  into amusing dissipation all will not do a settled melancholy has taken possession of his mind in presence of the ormsby family he strives to assume an air of sprightliness but with so little success that i am astonished they do not discover his affectation miss ormsby must have very little penetration or a great deal of vanity if she can believe he loves her from my soul i pity him condemned to feign a passion that he does not feel and to conceal one that preys  ah my louisa i fear  upon his life he reproaches himself with weakness for my part i am astonished at the noble firmness wherewith he sacrifices the dearest wishes of his heart to motives of generosity and honor yet i sincerely wish he had been less determined now indeed it is too late to retract but before he came to town i think he might have made an effort to free himself from this most irksome bondage i could not bring him over to my opinion perhaps he was in the right in his situation i should probably have thought  though i might not have been able to act  like him if i have any knowledge of my heart it would be apter to dupe my judgment in my friends favor than in my own  you ask my opinion of the ormsby family  to begin with mr ormsby  he is a plain sensible good kind of man has rather more of the merchant than the gentleman in his manners  mrs ormsby has more politeness and less understanding than her husband she has been very pretty in her time and unfortunately thinks herself so still pays the most critical attention to her dress and gives herself several little airs that would better suit her daughters  every one allows that youth is the monopolizer of beauty how comes it then that women who have been handsome in their younger years carry the idea of their loveliness into advanced life yet how indeed can it be expected they should perceive the gradual decay of their beauty when they are insensible of the progress of their years  it is greatly wise to know before we are told the melancholy news that we grow old aye or to believe it when told why cannot womens ambition be directed rather to the embellishment of their minds than their forms what a happiness it would be if the beauty of all females was like lady methuens eclipsed by the superior brightness of their understandings age then instead of stealing away all their charms would only deprive them of some trifling extrinsic advantages and bestow some intrinsically valuable ones in their room time is in the main a generous robber with one hand indeed he wrests from us part of our property whether we will or not but with the other he offers us more than double the worth of what he takes it is at our own option to accept or refuse his liberality but if we refuse it we have only ourselves to blame  amongst those who have more to fear from the predatory hand of time than to hope for from his bounteous one i think we may fairly rank lady conway she is what her mother has been and if i do not mistake will be what her mother is i would not be united to such a woman for kingdoms  so volatile so gay so vain and inconsiderate so politely inattentive to her husband and at the same time so very attentive to other men  take care of your forehead my good sir james if horns will grow out of lead you have but a sorry chance of escaping such an ornament it is a fashionable one however and that is some consolation luckily he does not care threepence for his wife which for the repose of my sex i heartily wish was the case of every honest man who has the ill fortune to be married to a coquette  as to miss ormsby herself i need say little more than that sir edwards description of her  which without doubt you remember  was a very just one i really believe her to be an amiable girl yet still still she is not worthy of marchmont there is nothing exalted in her character her talents her understanding are not above the common level  in a word she is not an obryen he would never have distinguished her but from the persuasion that he was necessary to her happiness a few more such examples and your sex would no longer accuse mine of the ingratitude or caprice or cruelty of continually despising the woman who loves unasked  yesterday  marchmont being fortunately engaged at mr ormsbys  i dined with our friend dean domville the company was composed of his elder brothers lord linfield and mr domville their ladies miss obryen the young countess dowager of severn mr and mrs warner and two or three young gentlemen who vied with each other in rendering the lowliest homage to the awecreating but allattractive charms of the fair hibernian who treated them all with equal politeness and equal indifference in vain did the majestic beauty disregard their attention in vain did the languishing eyes of the right honorable widow court it twas impossible for miss obryen to be unnoticed twas impossible for any other woman to be taken notice of in her presence  i perfectly agree with you louisa that this fine young creature possesses a mind equal to her form she spoke but little at the deans and that on common topics but i want no other proof of her good sense than her being so totally devoid of vanity how unconscious does she appear of her superlative loveliness how undesirous of admiration what a dignified modesty in her deportment certainly she is a most charming woman ah why was she not destined for my deserving friend  i should not forget to tell you miss obryen enquired for you in such a manner as convinces me you have a place in her friendship i am sorry very sorry you cannot cultivate it it is well you are not in town you could not avoid visiting her and i would not for any consideration sir edward should see her again yet i doubt that he could love her to a greater excess than he does already or be more deeply involved in consequential misery i know not whether to pity or admire him most to be obliged to resign the object he adores to wed another  with so much sensibility so much delicacy as he possesses  how painful must be the conflict  how great the resolution that enables him to make the fearful sacrifice  the marriage preparations are not begun and i conjecture will proceed slowly i shall not be the person to hurry them i shall regard them with an eye of horror o ye immortal powers that watch over the interests of the virtuous  why do you sleep  my wretched friend  louisa my dearest louisa let us join in prayer to heaven to avert the woes that threaten him  doubly difficult to borne as they insultingly approach under the mock visage of joy a wedding  a grave would be preferable to such a wedding this subject harrows up my soul adieu write to me  console me  here is a long illconnected letter i shall look on a concise regular answer as a tacit reproof of my prolixity and ramblings  ever your devoted methuen  to miss obryen  london dublin your tears blot the paper alas my dearest valeria so do mine come to me my gentle suffering girl we shall weep together  we shall console one another you will condemn yourself  you will call yourself weak i will vindicate you  i will praise your fortitude leave that fatal place mr domvilles stay is uncertain allow me to send your uncle for you he shall not suspect that i have any particular motive in desiring your speedy return write to me immediately i shall not ask him to go till i have your permission i do not  need i tell you i do not  seek to control you  i am at sir john obryens he is not expected to live many days i acknowledge i have but little solicitude about him yet as my brother or rather as my fellow creature i am shocked to see him tottering on the verge of eternity shortly will he be deprived of the wealth he has been laying up with unremitted assiduity for so many years  driven from all his loved possessions on earth and sent into a world for which he has made no provision it is true his character has not been marked by any of those black actions to which we usually affix the appellation of crimes his sins have been rather those of omission but a series of those negative sins are  if i dare form a judgment of them  more dangerous  at least they make a man more despicable  than great and positive trangressions counterbalanced by active virtue  i am called away  sir john is worse    when i was obliged to break off yesterday evening our unhappy relation was thought to be at the point of death he is better today but not so much as to warrant the slightest hope of his recovery  i received a letter from you this morning i find it dictated by the natural loftiness of your mind as your former one by that natural tenderness of heart which so finely attempers it suffer me to expostulate  my beloved you are too severe why impose silence on yourself on the subject of your peculiarly unfortunate  but not in the least degree blameable  passion complaint is a sweet mental anodyne why would you deny yourself the use of it never can you tell your griefs to a more sympathetic heart than that of her you so often endearingly call your parent do not think i wish you to cherish a sentiment that must be destructive to your happiness far from it but to overcome this sentiment will not be the work of a moment you cannot command your thoughts do not then create for yourself unnecessary pain by endeavoring to command your pen or rather tongue for i trust i shall soon be blessed with your society return thou darling of my soul your dear mind is wounded can the balsamic language of friendship heal it o return and it shall be poured out from the very heart of  your inexpressibly affectionate caroline chetwynd  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london i told you briefly in my last my dear madam of my meeting with lady mary webster i have been to see her twice or thrice since she receives me with cordiality and seeming friendship i say seeming  for i am sure she does not love my person but knows she may depend on my principles being unhappy she stands in need of a friend to console her and is obliged to attach herself to me for want of a more desirable one for my part i sincerely wish her well i pity her i shall do every thing in my power for her benefit but i cannot say i esteem her when i first knew her i was inclined to love her acquaintance discovering to me the unamiableness of her disposition i found i could not while we lived together in france my dislike to her daily increased  it really made me miserable it is a most painful thing to hate any body and i own to you i almost hated her she had so many mean malicious nameless ways of provoking that had i not despised her and respected her mother so much as i did i should have found it very difficult to have constantly kept guard over a temper so impatient of affront as mine naturally is we parted with great civility on both sides but i confess i carried away a sense of her injurious treatment i am not revengeful which i owe rather to education and principle than to nature i never return an injury but i feel it strongly and rarely forgive it till the person is in some species of distress or that i have done them a kindness which i catch at an opportunity of doing with more eagerness than i should exert in favor of one who had done me neither good nor harm when lady enmore proposed to adopt me for her daughter and to settle her fortune on me in prejudice to lady mary all my little animosities against her died within my breast i felt myself interested in her welfare i pleaded for her as i should have done for a friend since the recommencement of our acquaintance in england i find her in distress which excites my pity and consequently strengthens my desire of being serviceable to her she seems heartily to repent her rashness and complains in general of mr websters behavior to her she particularly resents his not giving way to her desire of living in ireland i have no friends in england said she to me and very few acquaintances except some that are worse than none  a lady below to wait on me     it was lady mary she is just gone i have not yet recovered my surprise i must give you our conference  observing she was very melancholy i chid her in a tender manner for indulging low spirits i cannot help it  i cannot help it said she striking her hand with some degree of violence against the arm of the sofa on which she leaned  come come my friend cried i be wise at least be consistent you thought too little before marriage dont think too much after  too little indeed i was infatuated would that past time could be recalled  hasty actions retrieved  why will you torment yourself by vainly wishing for impossibilities consult your good sense and you will find that when an evil is without remedy we have nothing to do but to endeavor to bear it in the best manner we are able  true but there are some things not to be borne  ingratitude for instance did i sacrifice my fortune and my friends  sure she might have added her duty  only to be a slave  ah my dear your pride is illtimed our sex was not born to rule while we are in a single state we may take some airs on us but when we are married we can have no degree of merit without meekness and submission  heavens do i hear this slavish maxim from the lips of my spirited countrywoman  but you are not married  if being married i should act in opposition to this slavish maxim as you call it i should be wrong even in my own opinion and consequently my example ought not to be followed  she was silent for some minutes and then as if unable to contain her resentment any longer cried could you submit to coldness slights and insults could you bear to visit and be incessantly visited by a rival  o lady mary be cautious of giving way to jealousy  that cruel destructive selfdeluding passion i know at this moment such an instance of its deadly effects as were i at liberty to divulge to you would oblige you to drive the fell intruder from your breast  hear me miss obryen only hear me and judge if i have not cause for my suspicions about ten days ago mr webster brought a lady conway and miss ormsby to pay their respects to me he told me they were daughters to a great merchant of this city to whom he had been formerly apprenticed but had quitted on an uncle bequeathing him a fortune that set him above trade a fortune by the way of which i dont believe he has at present a single shilling i did not decline an acquaintance with these ladies but he obliged me to return their visit sooner than i intended lady conway has since been twice at my house and her sister very frequently though i never invite nor welcome her but on the contrary treat her with as much coldness as it is possible to show without being downright rude she comes in the morning  webster asks her to spend the day  i say nothing  yet she stays then their mutual looks their whole behavior their very words   she paused as expecting i should speak  it was totally beyond my power  she went on   my woman tells me there was a strong attachment between my husband and miss ormsby and that some improper  she believes not absolutely criminal  familiarities had passed between them which being discovered by the father miss was sent away to a sister of her mothers who is married to a clergyman that lives near a hundred miles from london and her lover compelled to leave the house his uncle dying some little time after he made proposals for her and was refused by her father six months ago my evil genius led him to paris and not till then was his mistress permitted to return home  i had now collected my scattered spirits  and how demanded i could your woman come by such particular information of transactions which it is to be supposed were kept very secret  she has a cousin that waits on mrs ormsby and is much in her confidence  so mrs ormsby has the weakness to trust her servant with matters of such importance the servant betrays her lady to her cousin the cousin betrays the waiting woman to you  how can you depend on such creatures  my own observations confirm their veracity  you should distrust your own observations the most sensible people when under the influence of jealousy often both think and act very absurdly i beg your ladyships pardon for my freedom but i am too much your friend to flatter you in this pernicious error consider the story may have no other foundation than the malice of mrs ormsbys maid perhaps the young lady has disobliged her and she takes this method of being revenged or possibly the whole has been fabricated by your own servant in order to make herself of consequence to you  pshaw said she peevishly indeed indeed valeria you cannot think yourself as you would have me do  why my dear lady mary if these young people had a liking for each other what could have prevented their marrying when mr webster had a competent independent fortune  ormsby would not give his consent she answered  however said i his disapprobation must have been the only obstacle to their union and if such a powerful temptation could not induce his daughter to break through her duty to him can you suppose she would be guilty of the far greater crime of endeavoring to ensnare the affections of a married man  but why should you think he ever asked her to marry him against her fathers consent i dare say he would not have taken her without a fortune i know you will catch at this as a proof of his not loving her but it proves no more to me than that his passion was not a generous one  you may be in the right thought i it is probable enough he would not marry the woman he liked without money since he married one he could not like for the sake of it  here a pause of several minutes ensued during which she looked on me with unealy earnestness and i sat in a posture of melancholy attention  my thoughts i own to you extremely distuibed alas i need not say why they were so my god thought i is the amiable marchmont destined to an union with such an infamous coquette  the cruel the ungenerous reflection was condemned as soon as formed i blamed myself for suffering my opinion of a stranger to be influenced by one i knew to be prejudiced slight is the foundation on which a jealous temper can build suspicion  has not the spotless purity of harriet wentworth been suspected i dare not do not doubt that miss ormsby is perfectly innocent i felt my mind expand beyond the narrowness of partiality my conscious heart was elated with honest triumph  not over lady mary  but over my own wayward passions it is mean to glory in our superiority over others  great to overcome ourselves  i exerted all the strength of reasoning i am mistress of to argue her ladyship out of her unwarrantable jealousy  my endeavors were quite fruitless  you talk very plausibly said she but while i have so much reason to think as i do it is not in my power to think otherwise wherefore am i detained in england so much against my inclination he drew me here at first on the thinspun pretense that his affairs required his presence i did not then ask what these affairs were and if i now enquire receive only the most evasive answers  we were here interrupted by the entrance of lady lucy domville  now my dear aunt are you not surprised to find lady mary trusting the formerly hated and envied valeria with a secret of a nature so mortifying to herself i am convinced she did not come to me with that intention but being accidentally led into the subject was incapable of restraining the impetuosity of her temper she has treated me with the confidence of a friend however let her motives for it be what they will and i must endeavor to return it by the good offices of one i shall go to her tomorrow on purpose to give her the best advice in my power i am apprehensive she will be so unguarded as to say something to provoke her husband an imprudence which cannot but have disagreeable consequences i shall strive to make her believe the behavior she thinks so reprehensible is only the effect of a friendship contracted in younger years or at most of a tenderer passion subsided into friendship this is my own opinion of the matter were i to form any other i should consider myself wanting in candor and generosity the most innocent are frequently the most liable to the malevolence of slander sensible of the rectitude of their intentions they dream not of becoming the objects of censure and consequently take no pains to guard against it prudence with regard to this world is perhaps a more necessary qualification than virtue itself  although i have already swelled this letter to an enormous size i cannot close it without informing you i had the honor to please the duke of granvilles eye the other night at a play he protested with great warmth i was the most perfect beauty he had ever beheld with a good deal more to the same purpose dean domville lord linfields youngest brother who is very well acquainted with the duke happened to be beside him and said pleasantly if i could introduce your grace to that young lady might i reckon upon your interest for the first vacant bishopric he asked my name and upon being told repeated it twice with eagerness and emotion pray sir do you know her family the dean replied that he did not but told him i was an irishwoman upon which he asked no more questions but appeared remarkably reserved and thoughtful for the rest of the evening frequently looking on me with earnestness but drawing off his eyes and affecting to appear unconcerned when he thought himself observed by the dean who was extremely puzzled to what motive to impute a behavior that seemed to him so strange from pure curiosity he came to lord linfields the next morning gave the above recital to lady lucy and made some enquiries about me she explained the mystery to him and he very kindly offered his assistance to reconcile me to his grace i wish much to be on terms of friendship with so near a relation but i shall not stoop to any mean submission to bring it about i have never done any thing to disoblige him my mother married without his consent but she married a gentleman  a man of honor of family one who was  nearly at least  her equal the fault if it becomes me to call it one in her did by no means justify his severity to her and even if it did i am not in any degree answerable for it the truth is i think he ought rather to seek me than i him yet i shall be contented to pay him this compliment as he is my mothers father but trust me i shall not forget i am the haughty sir william obryens daughter with all this pride you will believe i have no great chance of succeeding with this proud nobleman the affair is not of much consequence however i have great reason to be thankful that it is not on him i am dependant but on those who possessed of a just degree of spirit themselves know how to forgive even an exuberance of it in another i ought to be pardoned for being proud because i am poor  rich people are without excuse affluence should give humility  but poverty elevates the wellborn soul i feel i should be much less lofty if i was rich  apropos to rich  mr domville tells me he has my uncles orders to accommodate me with what money i may want i have no occasion for any at present i have always three times as much as i know what to do with i am resolved i will not be extravagant if i can help it though my uncle does all he can to spoil me it is not easy for me here to suppress such expressions of gratitude as neither his nor your delicate generosity will allow me to make use of my best friends i do not wish my obligations to you cancelled it is impossible they should ever be so but i pray that they may be paid by the giver of all good things  infinite bounty only can pay them for  valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london i have seen her the happy ormsby lady marys rival ah is she no other persons rival  down rising mischief  i found lady mary a little indisposed she did not see company i sent up my name however and was admitted we had near half an hours conversation on the last subject her jealousy is too deeply rooted for me to be able to pluck it up but i hope my counsel  to which she seems to pay a deference  will assist her to conduct herself with prudence yet when i consider her irascible temper and the mad passion that wholly possesses her mind i cannot help fearing she will say or do something extravagant  i thought it expedient to inform her miss ormsby was on the point of being married  i would not tell her to whom  while i staid with her her servant entered miss ormsby is below stairs my lady and begs to know if   impertinent animal did not i tell you i would not see any body  i told her so madam but    be gone  i will not    give your ladys compliments to miss ormsby said i and tell her she will be glad to see her  the woman looked doubtful i nodded toward the door an imperial nod i suppose  she left the room immediately i apologized for the liberty i had taken and convinced her ladyship it would have been in all respects improper to have refused the visit  with shame i confess to you my indulgent friend the visit was little less painful to me than to her my heart beat as miss ormsby came up stairs  twas a certain malicious sort of beating that i cannot describe i felt a kind of predetermination to hate her  the impulse was involuntary as such i hope it was not quite unpardonable it was attended with exquisite pain may that atone for it  i am convinced we can be happy only in proportion as we are good we should cultivate benevolent dispositions in our own defense  if hatred envy  any evil passion  does but glance upon my mind it disturbs my internal peace i shall remember this and henceforth when any person does me an injury i shall forgive them on account of the misery their own malignity occasions them  you will expect me to say something of miss ormsby  she is a fine girl tall well made and genteel very fair her features handsome a softness and modesty in her looks and behavior that sufficiently refute the black charge against her but indeed that charge scarce needs any other refutation than its improbability can the woman who is honored by the addresses of such a man as marchmont throw away a thought on any other of his sex impossible impossible  webster is handsome  nay very handsome lively yet tender and insinuating apparently goodhumoured has an inexhaustible fund of chitchat  but sir edward  ah i cannot bear the comparison  sir edward is a being of a superior order  adieu my woman tells me i have not half an hour to dress for dinner    it would be more fit for me to go to bed after one oclock in the morning than to sit down to scribble but my mind is not sufficiently at ease to allow me to sleep the most distressing incident  but i need not enter into particulars  poor hamilton i respect your worth am grateful for your love i weep for your affliction  but alas it is not in my power to do more i too    drag a hopeless chain and all that i inflict endure what a painful thing it is to give pain and yet madam how many of our sex are there who make it the business of their lives to excite wishes they never mean to gratify the censure indeed must not solely fall on us  the men are equally culpable each sex delights to ensnare the other such o vanity is thy power over the mind that many a young person who would shed tears of unfeigned compassion over a distress far inferior to the pangs of slighted love sacrifices without compunction the peace of a fellow creature to the trifling contemptible pleasure of being admired how cruel and base it is to inflict the most poignant anguish the sensible heart is capable of feeling only to procure a very worthless and unwarrantable gratification  coquetry is so common a vice we are not apt to look on it with the detestation it deserves but a crime loses nothing of its original nature by becoming general let guilt be divided and subdivided ten thousand thousand times its specific properties will still be contained within the portion of each individual  i cannot speak of coquetry without thinking of poor lady mary webster  would not one have imagined that nature had effectually secured such a piece of studied deformity from the influence of vanity no such thing  she was determined to be thought handsome in spite of nature let her lookingglass contradict her as much as it pleased it is none of the least pernicious attributes of vanity that she is continually misleading her senseless votaries to seek applause where they are worst qualified to obtain it lady mary possessed a genius which had she cultivated would have given her a rational claim to admiration but she preferred the mere semblance of beauty to the reality of understanding and art was called in to supply the parsimony of nature with inefficacious profusion but dearly has she paid for her illjudged choice health the first of earthly blessings was the price of a complexion alone that abominable paint has hurt her constitution extremely strange it is that any body in their senses should barter health even for real beauty  lady enmore had apprehensions of her being consumptive before i left paris and very rationally imputed it to her use of paint which however she could not prevail on her to lay aside i fear the continuance of this destructive practice joined to the present inquietude of her mind may have very bad effects probably she dares not now appear in her natural colors  excuse a pun  for fear of disgusting her husband yet were i a man and a husband i should think paint more disagreeable than the most tawny skin africas sun ever shone on  after saying so much against artificial complexions it behooves me not to lay myself open to the temptation of using one by keeping such bad hours  bon soir ma tender amie valeria obryen  to mrs chetwynd  ireland london thou kindest tenderest best of friends  my more than mother  in what words shall i acknowledge your generous indulgence to my follies you dont blame me  you allow me to complain  you dont expect me to conquer my unhappy love immediately would that i were this moment with you that i might on my knees pour out the overflowings of my gratitude how amiable is it thus to condescend to the errors of youth when attained to the calm of life thus to cast back a pitying eye to hold out a helping hand to those who are still tossed by stormy passions  i will fly to you  my heart will not know peace till it reposes itself on your affectionate bosom i told lady lucy you intended sending my uncle for me whereupon she very obligingly limited her stay here to a fortnight i wish the time was shorter i would not be in this kingdom when  my god what does it signify where i am  when that fatal ceremony  oh my heart my breaking heart  may he be happy  no thought of me  i was dear to him once  do not think me vain  i am convinced he loved me  but it is now a long time since he has seen me not since he escorted me from hermitage to lord linfields doubtless he sees miss ormsby every day i hardly know what i would write  o make him happy heaven  my spirits sicken  i must lay down my pen    i had an interview with the duke of granville this morning thus it happened  lady linfield and i went to see mrs domville on entering the drawing room we found only her the dean and a handsome majestic looking old gentleman the dean arose from his seat with alacrity and taking hold of my hand come miss obryen you will plead your cause more successfully yourself than i can do the duke of granville madam leading me up to him  i knelt  it was the dying command of the best of mothers that if i ever had the honor to see your grace i should thus entreat you  not to curse her memory  he seemed much agitated and surprised at this uncommon address and remained silent for some time then assuming a stern aspect  rise cried he without even presenting his hand to raise me your mother was the most ungrateful   i started up  hold my lord you shall not abuse my mother  she was devoid of gratitude said he fiercely she was devoid of duty i renounced her and i renounce her daughter  i bowed my head respectfully as acquiescing in his determination and tears filled my eyes in spite of my endeavors to suppress them mrs domville who is one of the sweetest and best natured women in the world embraced me and wept  the duke of granville said lady linfield warmly is the only man in the kingdom that would not be happy to call miss obryen his relation  the dean in a resolute tone said my lord i should consider myself unworthy of the sacred character i bear if i neglected to   the duke did not care to hear a remonstrance that opened so formidably and interrupted it by addressing himself to me  i do not mean to treat you with rudeness young lady nevertheless i must tell you plainly that i am determined never to admit into my family a person that bears the name of obryen  this insult roused all my fathers spirit  and yet my lord answered i it is a name that will always confer honor on the person that bears it and i boast less of the sedley than the obryen blood  though i dont look on you as my relation rejoined he i shall be your friend dean domville has told me in what circumstances your father has left you i shall take care to make a genteel provision for you  my pride was inconceivably raised and i haughtily said i am sorry your grace thought proper to make me such an offer in a manner that puts it out of my power to thank you do not think my lord that i inherit as little of sir william obryens pride as of his fortune i derive from him a spirit  equal to your own and will never condescend to receive obligations from those who treat me with contempt i sought your friendship only  you deny me that  i disdain your wealth i had no mercenary views i could have none for my father with his last breath conjured me never to accept any thing from you and the utmost degree of indigence could not tempt me to break his command nor do i need your assistance i have an uncle on whom i depend with the same ease and confidence i should do on a father who supports me not only in affluence but splendor and give me leave to inform your grace i should never have made myself known to you if i had not been so circumstanced that it is impossible to misinterpret my motives i curtsied and left the room with an air lady linfield was pleased to call gracefully majestic both the ladies followed me into another room where we presently took leave of mrs domville and returned home  i know my uncle will be pleased with his girls boldness on this occasion and though you are not so proud as either he or i i think you will not disapprove it perhaps i ought to have expressed some gratitude for the provision his grace would have made for me but i own i was more hurt than obliged by his intention i have been almost four years supported by friendship  but i have not yet learned to give thanks for charity    i had a letter this evening from the duke of granville  it surprised me beyond measure  to miss obryen madam the more i reflect on your behavior this morning the more i am charmed with your spirit  a spirit so becoming my granddaughter  whatever enmity i may have had against your parents i cannot but approve the respect you bear to their memories your mother probably deserved it from you and if your father did not your merit is the greater in paying it  your seeking a reconciliation with me from motives of disinterested duty raises you very high in my esteem i shall never desire you to disobey your fathers injunction but i shall find a way notwithstanding of expressing the interest i take in your welfare  lady carysbrook and i shall wait on you tomorrow morning and hope to prevail on you lord and lady linfield mr domville and lady lucy to spend some time with us at granvillepark where we shall go on friday next  granville   how mutable is the human mind the man that six hours ago rejected my acquaintance with scorn now courts it with respect i never expected through my own pride to find an advocate in his i think myself extremely fortunate in having thus ignorantly taken the readiest  perhaps the only  way to his favor  i believe we shall all accept his invitation  farewell my dear dear aunt i long to embrace you  valeria obryen i need hardly tell you that my sentiments with respect to sir johns illness are quite similar to yours    to miss obryen  london chetwynd villa i am sorry to tell you  deuce take this cant  no i am neither glad nor sorry to tell you that sir john obryen has departed this life  truly sir you will say a very feeling and polite manner of informing me of the death of so near a relation  come my dear no affectation i know you never loved him nor had you ever any reason indeed very few people had  he lived unloved and died unlamented your father  pardon me valeria  your father was a libertine yet he was loved and respected and deserved to be so he had a soul  sir john had none one would not be so uncharitable as to say he has probably by this time found out to his cost that he had one of all sinners i take a miser to be the farthest out of the road to heaven avarice is the worst of vices  the most incompatible with any degree of virtue it blunts all the finer feelings destroys every great and generous principle stifles the social dispositions that bind man to man sours the temper and narrows the heart in comparison with avarice i could call other vices the pardonable effects of human frailty but the miser breaks that grand law of benevolence which was originally written by gods own finger on his heart  francis obryen  i beg his pardon  sir francis obryen is come home he has apparently profited well by the liberal education he has received and acquired a knowledge of the world without being corrupted by it it is with singular pleasure my caroline sees this only surviving male of her illustrious family so well qualified to support the dignity of his house his father has left him a fortune not unworthy of his name this without doubt will be a great advantage to him but had he been of a different character it could have been none the sunshine of wealth only serves to display a mans virtues and expose his vices to a larger number of beholders  it may dazzle the view of fools but the steady eye of reason easily penetrates the false glare how often have i lamented the folly and shortsightedness of those men whom i have seen heaping up riches for their children while they denied them such an education as would have enabled them to become a fortune how cruel it is to suffer a youth to grow up in ignorance  perhaps in vice too  and then place him in a conspicuous point of view that all the world may perceive his defects for my part i think grandeur becomes a clown as ill as a fine suit of clothes would a monkey  but all this time i tell you nothing of your legacy  five hundred pounds i refused this pitiful bequest for you as proudly as you could have done yourself sir francis said it was a mistake that the sum ought  you observe the equivocating ought  to have been five thousand pounds which he would pay into my hands immediately and begged i would keep the error of the will a secret i was pleased with his generosity and still more with the manner of it but i absolutely refused to deceive you and assured him that your delicacy would not permit you to receive such an obligation from so young a man he was much chagrined and dissatisfied at my refusal  said he did not know how to offer you money himself but he hoped there would be no impropriety in his entreating you to accept some jewels he must suppose i thought meanly of him if i did not prevail on you to take them he owed you some reparation for the injury his father had done yours i observed that though sir john had undoubtedly hurt his brother it was only by exacting a just debt  a just debt sir replied the spirited youth there may be debts which the law calls just that no man of honor would exact  this indirect censure on sir john is the only one   ever heard him pronounce on the contrary he treats his memory with great respect though he neither is  nor affects to appear  much afflicted but as to lady obryen her grief hardly knows any bounds god forgive me for suspecting her of a little hypocrisy yet perhaps i wrong her  when a tender connection is broken the memory retains and exaggerates all the advantages and pleasures of it and the anxieties are totally forgotten many a person i believe has unaffectedly wept for a relation they would not wish to recall to life  sir francis has brought a friend with him from italy he is a frenchman but has none of that vivacity which is supposed to characterise his nation he rather suits our ideas of the spaniards  grave stately and reserved is it not something surprising that obryen whose temper is warm frank and sprightly should choose a man of so opposite a character for his bosom friend it would be hard to tell by what sympathy they are so closely united the chevalier du mornai has a fine understanding has thought read and seen a great deal but the qualities of the heart are more necessary to excite and preserve affection than those of the head i know however i am too apt to judge  though i am seldom mistaken in judging  of the interior by the exterior the coldness of du mornais manners is perhaps the result of misfortunes if so his reserved behavior does not disqualify him for friendship though it must prove an obstacle to his forming it  may i ask you my sweet girl what is the meaning your aunt does not show me your letters as she used to do but only reads me passages here and there and i observe neither these passages nor the letters you write to me are dictated by your usual sprightliness ah valeria i suspect  how often have i told you that the little deity would some time or other claim his rightful sovereignty over your rebellious heart but why may not i be trusted as well as mrs chetwynd believe me she cannot be more tenderly interested in any thing that concerns you than i am i do not recommend my sex in general to the confidence of yours  men to say the truth are rough gross and insensible creature but i am willing to think that your conversation and so many years passed in the society of my caroline must have polished my manners and softened my heart sure my love you are not afraid of my raillery if i have joked with you upon this or that admirer twas only because i knew you were indifferent to them i do love to be merry myself and to make others so but never at the expense of any ones feelings  when a jest becomes illnatured it is no longer a jest to me my dearest valeria if you will admit me into your confidence i shall esteem it as the highest proof you can give me of your friendship  perhaps too it may be some way in my power to serve you  but if you choose to exclude me you have nothing to do but to pass over this part of my letter without notice i shall not think i have a shadow of right to be offended  i shall acquiesce in silence  i shall be convinced you are actuated in this case as in every other by the best and properest motives nor need you fear that i will endeavor to find out any thing from your aunt i never expect nor wish my friends to betray theirs to me  when may we expect to fee you i have no patience with the dilatoriness of these domvilles  other men may tell you what they will valeria but positively your complexion is so far from disgracing the lily or the rose  your breath so little steals their sweets  that my flowers blow not half so fair in your absence come charmer and restore them their color and fragrance  come and bring smiling peace and sweet social joys to your fond uncle  charles chetwynd  to miss ormsby i wanted to speak to you hannah and intended to call at my fathers this morning for that purpose  am prevented and therefore take this method of informing you etc  i abhor the part of a censor but shall act it for your benefit  you are wretchedly imprudent to suffer your passion for that webster to transport you thus beyond the bounds of decorum dont laugh child at my preaching up decorum i may do things that will not fuit you  my man is noosed  yours free  freer perhaps than you think i am strangely out in my politics if he be over strongly attached to you should your connection with webster take air you infallibly lose marchmont  a divine fellow  and a title too then if wise papa comes to know by what means you have lost him  packed off to the country immediately  another visit of half a century to the parsonage  remember the triste parsonagehouse  old snuffiing uncle with his long nose and long sermons  our good formal lady aunt with her receipts cordials plasters and prayerbooks  prim cousin jenny  but there is no enumerating half the horrors of this dismal abode of religion and ravens  remember them hannah i say remember them and be discreet besides you will be the butt of raillery censure etc  you are not of sufficient consequence at present to forsake the simple path of virtue when you are lady marchmont do as you please  yet upon honor it would be a pity to deform so fair a forehead for my part though i will give my company and allow a certain degree of familiarity to any pretty fellow that is willing to purchase them at the expense of a little flattery i know how to keep clear of crim con certainly one of you grave sober misses has five  aye five and fifty times more craft and mischief in her composition than such a gay rattling thing as i am how artfully you contrived to make me believe you were in love with sir edward nay ma petite rusee did not you make him believe so too then you desired me to visit lady mary only that you might have the opportunity of mortifying webster by your contempt and indifference in revenge for his forsaking you i was an egregious simpleton to suffer myself to be so easily taken in i might have known either that you were deceived yourself or sought to deceive me absolute indifference and a violent desire of revenge  prodigiously consistent  but my reasoning comes too late the mischief is done and i cannot remedy it this is the misfortune of being giddy  ones prudence is mere afterthought foresight say the grave ones makes a very important part of that comprehensive thing we call wisdom  a very gay character then can never be a perfect one fly to your escritoir  ransack all the letters you ever received from me  and try if you can find a single passage in any of them to match the gravity of this i must conclude before i disgrace it by a line of levity  emily conway  to the right honorable lady methuen  poplarhill london ah my louisa how shall i tell you that the thursday after next is fixed for the marriage of my unfortunate friend  may the merciful hand of providence turn aside the miseries my foreboding heart tells me await him i cannot  and to you i need not  describe what i suffer on his account it would afflict me to see a stranger with a twentieth part of his merit in circumstances of such peculiar unhappiness  but when the sufferer is the friend of my heart  a man so singularly worthy  oh louisa   miss ormsby goes into the country tomorrow with a mrs jephson a gay genteel enough young widow her mothers relation she does not return till the day before that appointed for the wedding sir edward means to spend the intermediate space at hermitage and need i say i shall seize this opportunity of returning to my adored louisa  i would have had marchmont come to poplarhill that he might avoid the painful restraint he must impose on himself through the apprehension of giving uneasiness to a sister that is so justly dear to him he would gladly have complied but feared mrs wentworth would think he neglected her and you well know his generous heart never allows his own ease or satisfaction to enter into competition with that of others  i have a thousand things to tell you but would rather speak than write them expect me at dinner tomorrow  kiss arthur for me  adieu  methuen  to lady conway in what a style do you write to me emily you are the last person on earth from whom i expected such a lecture surely some people think the folly of others brings an accession of wisdom to themselves  you know how to keep clear    yes yes your virtue stands very secure because not assaulted  i have read over your letter again i believe you meant rather to give me a warning than a reprimand i ought to excuse you then and i do  you need be under no fear of my losing my intended this very morning our wedding was fixed for next week  you accuse me of deceiving sir edward  what you a coquette and disallow a little necessary hypocrisy believe me however the tenderness i manifested to him was at first far from being the effect of artifice when he visited you at meadowvale i was struck with his beauty the easy majesty of his fine person his polished manners his wit his vivacity and perhaps in some measure with his rank resentment of mr websters cruelty bade my heart seek a kinder master the apprehension that my unhappy guilty connection with him though known only to ourselves and you might by some unforeseen means become public induced me to seek a shelter in matrimony sir edwards charms  rendered more conspicuous by his extreme superiority to your other visitors  pointed him out to my choice i endeavored to please him  succeeded  and was delighted with my conquest i determined to banish his rival from my mind and give him the preference he deserved these were my sentiments when he left us his tedious visit to his oldfashioned sister his illtimed excursion to lord methuens seat his coldly polite answer to your letter his unnecessarily and unaccountably delaying to declare himself to my father  all conspired to stifle the newborn flame when the first possessor of my affections returned to claim them he swore that he loved me with unabated ardour  that nothing but the fear of bringing me into distress could have prevented his marrying me  and that necessity alone had compelled him to give his hand to a woman who was not only indifferent but disagreeable to him he besought me to visit her  i had long forgotten how to deny him any thing  i complied  found her below my jealousy and insensibly resumed my first sentiments for this too engaging man still sir edward is as he ever must be the object of my esteem and admiration there is no man on whose honor or generosity i should so confidently rely  more than this i cannot grant him nor does he deserve i should for i am well convinced he is not more attached to me than i am to him he is very polite to me and even attentive but it is a forced sort of attention  there is an aukwardness in his tenderness that betrays the affectation of it to say the truth i suspect him to be pretty much in the same predicament with myself  videlicet  his heart engaged in a wrong place  this morning when i mentioned my intended jaunt to jephsonlodge my father desired i would first name the wedding day which i did after some little hesitation  marchmont turned pale as ashes  bowed and spoke not a word about a quarter of an hour after he thanked me in a confused manner and begged to know how long i should stay in the country he did not ask to visit me there  he did not bid me hasten my return  he expressed no curiosity to know who was to be of my party  he did not so much as hint a wish for a nearer day  emily do you think my heart can melt to such an icy lover as this the sprightliness that made him so agreeable is entirely flown his behavior is so grave  his looks his language so cold  but smiles for ever play on my adorable fredericks face his words are the warmest that ever cupid dictated  o his breath would thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dians lap  bab jephson has very innocently invited him to spend a few days with her dont shake your head lady conway here is no indiscretion no risk  his being married and my approaching marriage sufficiently screen us from suspicion but emily i feel that something more than prudence is necessary to secure the minds peace i do not think a discovery possible yet notwithstanding i am tortured with the fear of it rightly do the moralists say that guilt is it own avenger yet am i not rather unfortunate than criminal is not my frederic rather my husband than lady marys of what signification is an idle ceremony  before true passion all those views remove his first vows were addressed to me i was  and am  sole mistress of his heart would that this declamation could satisfy conscience o that i had timely foreseen into what an abyss of sin and wretchedness my first error would plunge me when once we have oerleapt the fearful mound that separates virtue from vice  how hard is it to set bounds to the deadly career i have not fortitude to forsake the flowery path of guilt why then must busy reflection cruelly scatter thorns  conscience avaunt  my joys are gloomy but withal are great heighho  how melancholy the stillness of the night makes one the family are all asleep i hate silence i wish i slept in one of the street rooms  adieu sister susan will bring you this tedious scribble in the morning i shall call on you before i leave town if i have time if not you will excuse me  hannah ormsby  to lord methuen  poplarhill hermitage i was in the right to come here the retiredness of this place suits the gloomy state of my mind my sweet melancholy sister is the fittest companion in the world for me  my heart seeks the society of the mourner my presence too would have cast a damp over your enjoyments o augustus beware of feeling my misfortunes too deeply i shall never be happy myself  let me always have the consolation of seeing you so enlarge your treasure of felicity as much as possible it must for the future maintain both yourself and me  harriet is not surprised to see me serious at the eve of so solemn an event the sweet creature puts on cheerfulness to entertain me she often talks to me of  of miss obryen that dear that lovely woman is her correspondent happy harriet they love each other with a warmth of friendship which refined minds alone are capable of my sister delights to speak of her  to dwell on her praises the subject gives me pain but it is a pain that is dear to my heart i would not exchange it for pleasure  how did you find lady methuen and your smiling arthur my warmest thanks are due to her for having spared you to me so long you will meet me in london on wednesday really my friends i trespass on your generosity but i cannot spare you on thursday  thursday o god  my anguish deepens as that fatal day approaches i begin to doubt the principles on which i act shall i not do a great and lasting injury to miss ormsby in making her my wife incapacitated as i am from ever loving her ought i not rather to have ingenuously acknowledged my unalterable attachment to another yet how could i do so would it have been delicate  honorable alas my error  my irretrievable  and may i say my unavoidable error lay in my inconstancy  inconstancy  i wrong myself no methuen till i saw that angel my heart was ignorant of love  that dear that cruel passion was totally unknown to me infatuating passion miserable as it has made me i hardly wish  dont think me mad  i hardly wish it to be extinguished a fine writer says extremely well   there is a pleasure sure in being mad which none but madmen know yes in my very pains there is a soft inexpressible something i could almost call pleasure o love sharp and barbed are thy arrows but they are dipped in smooth oil with what idlypleasing dreams does fancy cheat me a few days more and this bright flame will be dimmed by guilt  here here my friend is the extremest malice of my fate i can never never cease to love her and o that i might always love with innocence although it should always be without hope    good heaven  my sister has this moment received a letter from miss obryen she is going to ireland  i shall never see her more  i am afraid harriet must have perceived the agitation with which i received this cruel intelligence  the letter came from granvillepark where she is at present she returns to lord linfields in a few days and from thence will come to hermitage to take her final leave of mrs wentworth  o methuen to lose even the sight of her for ever  but i merit it i ought to have visited her in london what could she think of my apparent negligence  and that after she had most kindly and politely assured me my esteem was essential to her happiness  the dear creature  can i expect she will remember me with friendship ah no i shall be  perhaps i already am  the forgotten thing i deserve to be shortly may some happier man  the pen drops from my fingers    i have spent this evening in straying through these silent woods endeavoring to reason down my passions why do i lament her departure thought i situated as i am ought i not rather to desire it just then i entered a little arbor  here i was once blessed with her society i threw myself  or indeed i rather fell  on the verdant turf i laid my face on the place where she had sat and  do not despise me augustus  i wept after a long time i raised my head and accidentally cast my eyes on a shrub that grew at the back of the grassy seat whose tender root her friendly care had sheltered i leaned over it with affection  it looked drooping i will refresh you with my tears said i  but her tears have fallen over you  how can you ever wither  my sister the angelic valeria and myself were sitting in this bower listening to the birds that perched on the branches around us warbled forth the praises of that charming season when nature like the phoenix arises with renewed beauty and vigor from her own ruins miss obryen praised their wild melody in words as sweet as their own notes the gentle harriets mind was melted even beyond its usual softness with a countenance at once expressive of resignation and woe and a tone that knew its way directly to the heart she repeated those plaintive lines of the melancholy gray   to warm their little loves the birds complain i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear and weep the more  because i weep in vain valerias eyes shone through the trembling tears of pity she turned away her beauteous face  poor little shrub said she in a low and interrupted voice you are exposed to the weather her white hand gathered up the earth about it perhaps her fancy at that moment drew a sort of comparison between it and harriet  and o thou fair and pining flower thought she would that i knew how to reanimate thee or rather would that my hand could thus have timely screened thee from the blighting winds of affliction  o my loved sister how hard has been thy fate what could have brought down so much wrath on thy innocent head  when this white lamb has bled on sorrows altar how shall such an unworthy victim as i am dare to murmur  i see mrs wentworths carriage coming up the lawn she has been visiting a sick family in the neighborhood i must attend her farewell my ever dear friend  edward marchmont  to the right hon lady methuen  poplarhill hermitage as i know the affectionate part my dear lady methuen bears in all my sorrows i fly to pour out my full heart to her  my brother  my dear my amiable edward  must he be unhappy this is too much ye cruel powers i have hardly a wish that does not center in him he supplies to me all the dear relations i have lost  my parents husband brother all in one must he whose study and delight is to promote the felicity of all around him  whose generosity is the source of happiness to numbers  must he be miserable himself  louisa  lord methuen  i conjure you both assist me to extricate him he shall not marry her i would go any lengths to prevent it but what can i do unacquainted as i am with the nature of his engagements to her advise me tell me what i shall do for something i must and will do be it ever so extravagant i cannot be a passive spectator of his wretchedness write to me instantly and inform me of all you know i am certain he would not conceal any thing from my lord or you  a too generous a compassion for my weakness is probably the motive of his reserve to me but if you are not his confidante in how unintelligible a manner am i writing to you  let me explain myself  when my charming young friend miss obryen honored my little retirement with her presence i imagined my brothers heart was fully sensible of her uncommon perfections and i really took great pains to incline her in his favor i was equally vexed and surprised when he informed me of his intended alliance with miss ormsby which i thought myself in honor bound to make known to miss obryen i did so and reluctantly gave up the pleasing hope of seeing an union between two persons i thought eminently calculated for each other  since he came here last i perceived he was far from having his usual flow of spirits and though it appeared strange enough that an event which brings joy to others should be an occasion of sadness to him i was so well convinced that i had been mistaken in his sentiments that i suspected nothing  i had this morning a letter from miss obryen which informed me that she was to leave england immediately i expressed my concern in lively terms edward hardly said any thing but his looks were to the last degree discomposed and he left the parlour abruptly  he did not come down stairs till summoned to dinner when he affected to appear cheerful though he scarcely eat any thing and disquiet and melancholy were visibly marked on his countenance  i was much to my regret obliged to spend the evening abroad  on my return home i found him still less himself than he had been in the morning his looks spoke neither contentment nor health he was absent silent and almost stupid  when the servants were withdrawn after supper i took a chair by him filled his glass and put it into his hand he bowed and drank the wine without speaking  you are ill edward said i  my head aches a little  alas  i fear your heart aches too  he spoke not but sighed  deeply sighed  and leaned his dear face on my shoulder  something preys on your mind  nothing my dear sister  indeed there does and you shall not hide it from me you have been a sharer in all my sorrows you taught me to support them  have i not then a right to partake of yours  he raised his head with some degree of briskness  harriet you can remove the grief you seek to know i have a very lively friendship for miss  he stopped and faulteringly pronounced  obryen you have told me she is dependant i cannot bear that she should remain so i dare not offer to make her otherwise she would refuse me perhaps i should even offend  when i die i cannot leave her any thing considerable without subjecting her to the censures of an illnatured misconstruing world i should be inexpressibly happy if i could transfer miss ormsbys fortune to her will you endeavor to prevail on her to accept forty thousand pounds as from yourself at least the greatest part of that sum less than twenty would be nothing i need not tell you that you must proceed in the most genteel and delicate manner  i looked on him earnestly  if you love me if you value my peace oblige me in this so saying he arose and hastily wished me a good night  he has a lively friendship for her i doubt it not for i feel that she has every qualification both of understanding and heart requisite to inspire and preserve that refined sentiment but think you not my dear louisa that this lively friendship is joined to a much more lively passion can his tumultuous sensations flow from tranquil friendship why do i ask he unquestionably loves her he has too much fire to love with moderation  too much stability to leave one room to doubt the durableness of his passion  and i may very justly add that miss obryen is too charming and too worthy not to be loved with ardour and constancy what then but certain and unceasing misery can await his union with any other woman however amiable  this marriage shall never be if i can prevent it i am sorry for the pain i must give miss ormsby but it is impossible for me to consider her interest  or any bodys interest  in opposition to edwards a hand without a heart could not be acceptable to her if she be a woman of delicacy and honor if not she is little worth being anxious about and very very unworthy such a husband as sir edward marchmont  i have ordered thomas who is to carry this letter to set off for poplarhill by daybreak tomorrow let me have your answer immediately direct me my sensible friend i am wholly at a loss how to proceed matters have been carried so far  but the happiness of my dear  unspeakably dear  brother is at stake nothing shall discourage me  it is needless to assure lady methuen how truly i am her friend  harriet wentworth  end of the first volume
