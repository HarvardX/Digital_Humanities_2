the duellist  price one shilling and sixpence  the duellist a comedy  as it is acted at the theater royal in covent garden  written by w kenrick ll d  london printed for t evans near york buildings in the strand  preface extract from the public advertiser of monday november         on saturday last a new comedy called the duellist was performed for the first time at covent garden theater previous to the curtain being drawn up the following written handbill was dispersed about the house  mr macklin has been pursued by a malicious party to such a pitch of rancour that at last they have succeeded so far in their cursed designs as to get him discharged this theater and thereby have deprived him of the means of a livelihood therefore if the public have any spirit they will not suffer the new play to begin till mr colman promises that mr macklin shall be engaged again this handbill found its way into the greenroom and had a very visible effect on the performers as was plainly evident from their confusion the piece was received with great marks of approbation and given out again for monday which was attended with some hissing but that was greatly overpowered by the general applause of the audience the overture to thomas and sally being attended to with silence the greatest part of the authors friends quitted the theater which being taken advantage of by a party in the gallery a riot ensued and the entertainment was not suffered to go on till another play was given out for monday  to the above concise relation of the circumstances attending the representation of the following comedy as it is given by one of the most respectable of our diurnal historians the author of the duellist makes no exception or addition he would be wanting however in that respect which he has ever professed and shown for the public opinion did he not endeavor to obviate some objections that have been made to his piece and to account as well as he is able for the unprecedented severity of its treatment  as to the authors pretensions to merit in this species of writing it is not for him to boast were there cause for boasting because sensible of the necessity of a dramatic writers making the theater the constant scene of his observation he can without mortification admit that an author whose study is the stage bids fairer for success on it than another who engaged at a distance in more scientific researches makes its amusements only his occasional relaxation from severer and more laborious pursuits not that he is without reason to be flattered with the applause his performance met with in representation though were it otherwise he should not have the vanity to copy after a corneille who in the preface to his pertharite which was universally condemned avows boldly that in spite of censure his play was a good one and well written he would have confidence enough however in imitation of as great a writer of our own country to declare with dryden that the town had received with applause as bad and as uncorrect plays from other men as a writer by profession therefore whose family depends on his industry he conceives it not only prudential in him to convert his amusements to profit but that he has a right to expect the theaters should be as open to receive his productions as those of others it is true he has not found it so and is singularly unlucky in having his pieces performed with impartial applause and then partially banished the stage he is not ashamed to declare he writes plays not from inclination but from expediency the object in his view being not dramatic reputation but theatrical emolument to which while he writes no worse than others which can hardly be though it should not be allowed he writes better he presumes he is equally entitled  to account for his disappointment in the present instance will not be difficult some just exceptions may be made to the piece itself the scene between the lawyers in the fourth act appeared too long in deference however to the opinion of mr colman who thought its effect would depend greatly on the action it was risked and is here printed at length  as to the passage objected to on account of its supposed indelicacy it is entirely omitted the author must do mr colman also the justice to say that he constantly excepted against it and had his more cautious judgment been attended to it would have been omitted in the representation  another exception has been made to the whole of the representation on account of the confusion i might say distress of some of the performers but if the circumstances that caused it be attended to such performers were so far from being the objects of reprehension for playing ill that it is a wonder they acquitted themselves so well  to mr macklin the author has nothing nor ever will have any thing farther to say than that he imputes the ill success of this unfortunate comedy wholly to that performers resentment against the managers for having discharged him the theater as it was doubtless their duty to do at the requisition of the the majority of an audience that illsuccess indeed has been imputed to causes which to admit would be to cast an injurious reflection on persons who the author is well persuaded by no means deserve it  it has been said that the gentlemen of the law took offense at the liberties taken with their profession and practice in the characters and dialogue of witmore and nonplus they must have too much knowledge and good sense however to be seriously offended at what was designed as a mere laugh on the stage or a satire on what the best of them regret as much as their clients without having it in their power to remedy it  a club of booksellers and a crew of authors are said to have formed a formidable phalanx of opposition the writer doubts not the good intentions of both he has endeavored to serve the cause of literature too much to have the good will of those who are laboring by every possible means to ruin it what injury either party might do him in the theater the author knows not but the scribblers have shown so little discretion in the zeal to abuse him from the press that he gives them hearty thanks for the service they have undesignedly done him  with respect to individuals it has been mistakenly or perhaps maliciously propagated that the piece was calculated to ridicule persons or characters for whom the author has either the greatest respect or to whom he is an entire stranger they who read mr fieldings amelia will see from what source the author has drawn some of the principal characters and incidents as the rest of the piece is original the candid must also admit that he has made no greater use of that writer than dramatic authors have ever been allowed to do with novelists from the practice of shakespeare to that of mr colman  it has been suggested that mr garrick had privately planted a party in the house to oppose the performance this the author cannot believe as having long since declared himself that gentlemans open and avowed enemy he cannot after what has publicly passed between them think so meanly even of mr garrick as to suppose he would act otherwise than as an enemy equally open and avowed  it has even been said that the friends of a certain dramatist whose name the author forbears to mention as it is disgusting to the remembrance of his friends were powerful in the opposition on this head he will only give a little anecdote as it was related to him by an auditor who sat in the boxes  during the tumult in the theater about the repetition of the duellist a lady who asked a thing that had the appearance of a gentleman what was the reason of it was answered that the man meaning the author was obnoxious and therefore his piece must be condemned yes madam added a gentleman who sat by there are a multitude of animals in this town to whom the spirit of a man is as obnoxious as the person of a woman  may the author of the duellist be ever obnoxious to such critics  lastly it has been urged that the author had not friends enough in the house to support the piece if by this is meant that the piece had not merit enough to make itself friends it is false as appears from the above cited relation while its friends remained in the house it was applauded by a great majority but when a considerable number of these went away and their places were supplied by riotous partisans who could not before get into the house and had not seen it it is no wonder that both the piece and the author should fatally feel the want of friends  if this want on the other hand be imputed to the authors neglect of introducing people into the theater to influence the judgment of the impartial part of the audience in his favor he takes a pride in having ever paid in this respect a proper deference to the public whom he should think he insulted had he acted otherwise and made personal interest to support his pretensions to literary merit  too proud to beg too modest to demand by merit only would he fall or stand nor enmity nor friendship interfering he only asks a fair and candid hearing prol to the widowed wife this indeed is cruelly denied him by the interruption of his play but he hopes will not be so on a future occasion the author having another piece accepted at the same theater the parts of which being already written out and the whole ready for rehearsal he doubts not the manager will give him an early opportunity of repairing the loss attending his present disappointment indeed he still places so much confidence on the justice and generosity of the public as to slatter himself he shall not ultimately suffer by trusting without party or cabal to the candor and impartiality of his auditors  prologue written by the author and spoken by mr smith  deaf to the bar the pulpit and the throne and awed if awed by ridicule alone the daring duellist in captious pride has long his friend his king his god defied thrice happy we if laughter from the stage should cure this frantic folly in the age happy the father sister mother wife who prize a sons a brothers husbands life should we dethrone the tyrant whose caprice so often endangers and destroys their peace whose fell despotic sway does even enslave the great the good the generous and the brave nay arrant cowards forced into a fray now fight because they fear  to run away our modish heroes it is true may bluster take heart of grace and all their spirits muster this peaceful reformation to oppose and take in talk our author by the nose  but when the comic muse true humor fires and zeal the poignant fatirist inspires against absurdity to set his wit and follys mark although in mirth to hit there lies more peril in his pointed words than lies alack in twenty of their swords encouraged hence the poet of to night against these angry boys has dared to write for by the way it is on you he reckons natures own cause espousing as his seconds on this presumption does he take the field hoping to make the stoutest blusterer yield if silent they who neither love nor fear him consent to sit and patiently will hear him if they do this he doubts not to disperse their present prejudice for carte and tierce their pointless swords to parry with his pen and pistolproof put down these mighty men  dramatis personae general gantlet mr

advise you sir solomon your fatherinlaw still so inflexible say you   booth as positiveness and parsimony can make him it is not above two years since i married and notwithstanding every proper submission on my part the earnest and repeated solicitations of his daughter and the warmest intercessions of our friends he still seems inexorable as ever   wit that is strange time generally softens resentments of this kind but the love of money and an habitual passion for artificial trifles extinguish the sparks of natural affection as i have acquired however some credit with him i will try when he comes to town how far my influence extends and yet boothby this may be carrying my friendship for you too far   booth why so   wit you know he has a niece who came over some time since from india to finish her education   booth i am told he has adopted her for his daughter and in her favor it is supposed will disinherit my wife   wit in which case if i should become her husband    booth you   wit i why not if the lady will have me   booth and have you any serious thoughts of emilia   wit why really i do think seriously of her sometimes the month i spent during the last vacation at sir

with confidence of success   wit i am glad of it  your promotion may have a good effect on sir solomon   booth in the mean time however the pay of a captain of foot witmore is so disproportioned to the way of living in this gay town    wit that you cannot indulge in the pleasures of it   booth nay hardly subsist very creditably and pay the court that is necessary to preferment   wit what think

any thing while he lives   wit well you must comfort yourself then by reflecting that cannot be long he is so fond of duelling that some antagonist or other will soon kill him or he will come to be hanged for killing his antagonist he narrowly escaped the last time he killed his man as he calls it and yet he is as captious and quarrelsome as ever   booth he is indeed unaccountably exceptious but here he comes   enter general gantlet began well barrister how is it  what george boothby by the lord my boy i am heartily glad to see thee   booth i thank you general i hope i have the pleasure of seeing you well today   began never better my dear boy  i have just had the superlative satisfaction of chastising a scoundrel   wit what tilting again general   began a cool thrust only  but twas in him  i paid the rascal home here  here  boothby  here i had him  through  fairly through by the dignity of man   wit not his body i hope   began his midriss that is all   booth you alarm me general  who  where   began nay dont concern thyself my dear boy  the rogue was in luck  a simple persoration the surgeon called it he tells me there is no danger   booth i am glad to hear that   wit and pray general what was the cause of quarrel how did your antagonist offend you   began me barrister he did not offend me  give me thy hand boothby i have done thee an injury which nothing but the height of friendship in me can excuse and the most exalted sublimity of it in thee forgive   booth what is all this how can you have so highly injured me general be how it will i promise you i forgive you with all my heart   began i knew thou wast a goodnatured lad and would overlook it or by the lord thou should have taken him our thyself   booth how general have you been taking up a quarrel of mine  it was obliging in you  but i could wish    began oh sir it is enough i understand you  you are perfectly in the right i should have been more punctilious  it was impertinent in me to be sure  a friend may be sometimes too officious  however sir if you are dissatisfied i am at your service  call me out  you can fight  i draw my sword for no man who dares not draw his own   booth nay but understand me general if you have taken up any cause of mine i am so far from resenting it as an injury that i think myself obliged to you you know i am as tenacious of the punctilio as yourself and would never be so rude as to take up the cause of a stranger but among friends it is quite another thing   began right boy when i commanded in ireland my doublet was pinked like the flounces of a fine ladys silk petticoat and all in the cause of my friends the man who would not be run through the body for his friend ought to be kicked out of the world for a scoundrel   booth an heroic sentiment general  but who was your antagonist i hope for your sake he is really out of danger   began nay the rascal himself i believe is hardly worth the care of the surgeon i should have wiped my contaminated sword and left him to his fate but that it would have been too great an honor for him to die by the hands of a gentlemen   wit and yet general i am afraid your magnanimity will one day or other betray you into the doing some rascal or other that honor   began well sir and what then would you insinuate that a gentleman has not a right to do himself justice by putting to death a scoundrel   wit by the laws general   began by the laws of honor sir   wit yes sir and by the laws of the land too if he have a mind to be hanged for it a man may break all the laws in the statute book if he be disposed to pay the penalties   began how sir shall not i annihilate a rascal do the laws of england afford protection to scoundrels   wit to a great number noble general and so do the laws of honor too by which the scoundrel has as often the advantage of the man of honor as the man of honor of the scoundrel let us suppose general that your antagonists skill or agility had been greater than yours would that have conferred probity on him or reflected infamy on you   began infamy on me sir   wit excuse me general i speak only by way of hypothesis   began hypothesis sir rot your hypothesis sir takes boothby aside boothby have you seen the peer today   booth lord lovemore no sir   began then you dont know how his affair has ended   booth what affair general   began with the fellow that affronted him last night   booth i heard nothing of it   began come come along with me then i must know how it ended turning about to witmore hypothesis ha mr barrister   wit no offense i hope general i think i could put a case in point    began a case in point with the point of honor sir offense sir yes sir there is offense sir  come come along boothby these lawyers of the inns of court know nothing of the laws of honor  hypothesis ha mr barrister come along boothby hypothesis quotha exeunt began and booth   witmore solus ha ha ha what a captious mortal could he find nobody else to quarrel with he would

i contribute to your pleasures i expect you will not control mine   lady love my pleasures as you call them my lord are unexceptionable i have no amusements but what are common to women of quality   lord love nor i any but what are common to men of quality in a word lady lovemore we have been too long married to impose any longer on the world and we ought to know the world too well to impose any longer on ourselves   lady love in what my lord   lord love in keeping up the appearance of domestic harmony which no longer subsists   lady love appearances govern the world my lord and it is they impose on themselves who will not enjoy the shadow because they have lost the substance   lord love then you think we once possessed it   lady love i thought we married for love my lord   lord love i thought so too but i believe we were both mistaken   lady love why so   lord love because there has been so little lost between us and yet there seems to be none left   lady love the want of love my lord should not banish decency   lord love but it should banish jealousy madam   lady love then your lordship thinks me jealous and yet you imagine there is as little love left on my side as yours   lord love the less the better as there is no satisfying the surmizes of a suspicious woman   lady love indeed my lord you are mistaken you do it effectually by converting suspicion into certainty i have learned to support the being an object of private neglect but i am not quite so meek as to sit down exposed to public contempt   lord love you may avoid it madam by retiring from public notice our house in gloucestershire is ready to receive you and if you except to the company i keep in town you may keep what company you please in the country the postcoach shall be ready tomorrow morning unless mrs boothby makes one of our party tonight   lady love my lord my lord i will see my brother gantlet before i determine to stay or go   lord love your brother gantlet madam do you mean to intimidate me with your family bully let that blusterer interfere and i will immure you in the country for life   lady love the country and at this time of year what cruelty is it possible your lordship can be in earnest   lord love your ladyship may put me to the trial if you dislike the alternative i leave you a moment to deliberate on the choice exit   lady lovemore alone barbarous tyrant he knows i dote upon living in town and detest the gloomy solitude of his gloucestershire dungeon i will sometime or other be revenged on him for this treatment my brothers temper indeed is so violent that unless things are carried to extremity his remedy may be worse than the disease but i will dissemble with this insolent intriguer of mine and if i have art enough defeat the execution of his designs by counteracting him  i shall be able to do this the more effectually by staying in town  mrs boothby is at present i believe a woman of honor and loves her husband whom lord lovemore is flattering with favors and feeding with promises in order to effect the seduction of his wife what traitors are men and mine the most insulting of traitors with what an air of assurance did he in fact confess it look you madam while i contribute to your pleasures i expect you will not control mine but if boothby and his wife are not two errant idiots i will control your pleasures my fine scheming lord even while you think i am contributing to them  here echo bring me pens ink and paper   enter echo each pens ink and paper my lady   lady love it is plain you heard mrs pert   each heard mrs pert

residence under the same roof in town   lady love why look you my lord as i know you may plead precedent among a number of our acquaintance if i thought you would pay any tolerable regard to appearances i might compound with you it may be prudent for a neglected wife to seem easy under the indifference of her husband but she must be meek and meanspirited indeed if she can submit to be insulted by his mistress not that i think you will succeed with mrs boothby she is i believe so fond of her husband that i am persuaded i may safely trust her with you   lord love do so then and be satisfied if i keep up appearances as you term it exit   lady love i will my lord and hope to fit you too at the keeping up of appearances exit   scene iii an apartment at sir solomon baubles enter

know not whether i should altogether slight her hints they were given too with such an air of significance there may be more in this business than she has told me for why should so silly a speech give such offense to the general   reenter mrs goodwill mrs good bless me madam i hope you did not say a word of what i hinted to lady lovemore the shortness of her visit alarmed me   mrs booth that would have been indiscreet indeed mrs goodwill as i am convinced however you may be mistaken in her ladyship you meant no ill to me but pray was that idle saying all that passed to provoke the general so highly   mrs good nothing more that i heard except that the gentleman added his lordship chose to procure preferment for his friends abroad that he might occasionally pay a charitable visit to their wives at home   mrs booth then it is plain the reflection could not respect me captain boothby is to have a regiment in england and he has solemnly promised i shall go with him if he be ordered abroad

oversight   g began an oversight did he not look askew at you all the evening   lord love the gentleman general had the misfortune to have a cast in his eye   g began a cast the misfortune eh i would have cast him into the pit of perdition had he so squinted at me  a cast lookye my lord if you think such things to be put up with it is no business of mine my dignity will not suffer by it though my affinity to your lordship makes me solicitous for the preservation of your honor   lord love i am obliged to you general but i am not so captious as to regard such trifles in a serious light   g began mighty well my lord mighty well captious ha yes my lord i am captious and exceptious too and you may think me capricious too if your lordship pleases no matter but while i have the honor to be your lordships brotherinlaw and have the character of a soldier to maintain i will be tenacious too tenacious of the dignity of human nature my lord and i say again if any rascal breathing had squinted at me as that fellow did last night at your lordship i would have tumbled him down the precipice of perdition  and so lord lovemore i bid your lordship good day turning round on his heel and strutting off the stage   g began returning i would my lord by all that is great in man again turning round on his hecl and strutting off his lordship looking after him with a sarcastical smile   g began again

a business too he says of mine but i neither know what it is nor can i get it out of him   lord love then let him keep it to himself the only good quality he has is that of sometimes keeping secret

obliging then as to pay attention to my finances   lord love faith i beg your pardon boothby for the expression such attention is unnecessary i have as good as settled your preferment today there will be soon a general promotion and you are to have the regiment at gibraltar   booth you gave me hopes my lord of being provided for in england   lord love i did so but so many difficulties stood in the way that to prevent delays i acquiesced you will be recalled home in a year or two at most so that it is much the same thing as if you were not to go   booth i know not that my lord in the predicament i stand with my fatherinlaw my absence in the mean time may prove prejudicial to my interest   lord love i cannot see that  mrs boothby will remain in england and perhaps effect a reconciliation the sooner without you i shall be ready to do her any services in my power and if she even chooses a domestic protection lady lovemore will i am sure be happy in so agreeable a companion   booth your lordships friendship is so generously imposing that i shall submit my conduct entirely to you if i can prevail on mrs boothby to acquit me of the promise i have made to take her with me should i be ordered abroad   lord love oh she is too reasonable a woman to insist on it a wife boothby is a very troublesome messmate on shipboard and in a garrison but you will have time enough to reconcile her

wife her affection for him shall plead for the love of her gallant but till it works effect i must be distant and reserved  it were as impolitic to alarm the modesty of a woman till some impression be

solomon has sent for you   wit not particularly some law business i find i wish my dear emilia you would give me leave to talk to him on a more interesting subject   em what subject sir   wit can you be at a loss to guess after the many kind assurances you have flattered me with of a partiality for me   em i hardly know what i have flattered you with mr witmore but whatever was my partiality for you you should have known that a girl at my age had it not in her power to give herself away without the consent of her relations   wit give me but your consent to make openly my addresses and i will do it immediately sir solomon i know regards nothing so much as money but though at present my fortune is not very considerable yet my connections and expectations are such that i make no doubt of obtaining his consent   em for heavens sake hush i hear him hobbling down stairs i have said enough to pave the way  you will soon know more than i have confidence to tell you  exit   enter sir solomon bauble sir sol so mr witmore you have been chatting with my niece emmeline she is a fine girl grown is not she shot up like an arrow and i dare say you think her fit for a husband   wit if she thinks so herself sir solomon miss emmeline is indeed grown a fine woman and i doubt not would make an excellent wife   sir sol you think so eh witmore why to come to the point then it was on that subject i sent to talk with you   wit you do me an honor sir solomon so young a lawyer is seldom thought entitled to aside what will this lead to surely she has not broke the ice herself   sir sol why truly i have so good an opinion of you mr witmore that i fixed my eye upon you as the most proper person i could think of  i have been greatly obliged both to your talents and integrity   wit aside it is certainly so  she said she had paved the way for me  to sir solomon your partiality sir solomon overrates my desert   sir sol not at all  not at all  i have heard the highest commendations of you from the gentlemen of your own profession which is a good sign a very good sign let me tell you mr witmore you are to be sure not yet at the head of it but you are a young man and in time will rise

you would have seen to the making your friend emilias jointure secure though you had done it without a fee   wit confusedly jointure fee sir solomon to be sure i have a friendship for the young lady  but  has she made choice of a husband   sir sol she poor young thing how should she know how to make choice of a husband oh no that trouble was taken off her hands some time ago her friends in india took care of that  governor mammon who came over by the last ships contracted two years ago to marry her on his arrival in england under the penalty of a lack of rupees near twelve thousand pounds sterling so that you see we have long had the husband safe enough we have now only to secure her dowry and pinmoney   wit and the young lady abides by this same contract i suppose   sir sol i will warrant her do you know sir governor mammon is a nabob   wit aside then every woman is a jilt to sir sol pardon me sir solomon i am taken suddenly with a kind of vertigo the effect of setting up over a difficult case last night   sir sol ah the law the law is a vertiginous kind of study but come sit you down sit you down lady bauble is not stirring yet but emmy shall give you a cordial  i shall be back by the time you are recovered and have composed yourself  aside mean time i will go take one peep at her highness this morning here who waits there where is emmy emmy shall bring you a cordial mr

heaven i had never seen you   wit how can you justify yourself madam   em i dont pretend to it sir i confess i have been to blame but i hardly knew the force or reflected on the consequences of the contract i had signed till you had taken advantage of my youth and inexperience to rob me of a heart which i ought to have preserved to give where they say i must give my hand if you love me as you have pretended therefore you will devise some method of delivering me from the bondage to which the will of arbitrary and mercenary parents for so i must call them have destined me   wit and does my emmeline then wish to be freed from her contract with governor mammon   em i detest abhor the proposed union if therefore you can contrive any means to protract or prevent it you may depend on the concurrence of your emmeline   wit my emmeline charming girl thou shall then still be mine he runs to embrace her   enter sir solomon sir sol heyday this is friendly indeed what    wit softly to emm

but must beg he will take sufficient time to make every thing secure and proceed in nothing with precipitation exit   wit you shall be obliged madam even to the minutest punctilio of procrastination   sir sol oh no sir no procrastination i have given my word of honor to the governor that the lawyers shall dispatch their business without delay   wit that is impossible sir a lawyers dispatch always admits of delay   enter lady bauble lady bau what is that sir you talk of delay i beg nothing may be deferred on any account whatever   wit there shall be no more delay than is necessary madam but a little procrastination is always usual on occasions of this kind it looks like a regard for decorum on the part of the lady   lady bau we must dispense a little with decorum sir the governor must be complimented with a short day after such handsome presents a most superb set of ornamental china   sir sol true wife and the mummy of an egyptian princess  no no procrastination   lady bau i think not where is my niece will not matrimony go down with her without procrastination leave her to me sir solomon  womans wit in these cases may do more than mans wisdom  and do you mr witmore consult with sergeant nonplus the governors counsel and come both hither for more particular instructions immediately do the business as securely as possible and no procrastination i beg of you exit   wit i will obey you madam i shall just step into westminster hall to speak to sergeant nonplus and we will call upon you presently sir solomon your servant exit   sir sol in a kind of reverie your fervant sir

good i could indeed tell you such stories of lord lovemore madam   mrs booth i am sufficiently shocked at what i have heard already  indeed i beg your pardon mrs goodwill i yesterday thought you too censorious but after his lordships unguarded behavior at his own house last night i can believe the worst of him and indeed have not the best opinion of his lady would you believe it mrs goodwill he had the confidence to make downright love to me  to rail at mr boothby and even offer me his protection in the very presence of his wife i find too that mr boothby is to be promoted to the command of a regiment abroad   mrs good and have you told the captain your suspicions madam   mrs booth i would not have him know them for the world the consequences would be fatal but what shall i do we are under an engagement to go to the masquerade to night   mrs good to the masquerade madam indeed it requires consideration strange doings have been carried on at masquerades   mrs booth strange doings mrs goodwill you terrify me  it is an entertainment i have the greatest curiosity to be present at but if there be any danger attending it i protest i will stay at home   mrs good that resolution

must advise me  exeunt   enter lord lovemore and boothby booth a fit of the spleen my lord mere vapors it went off immediately on her coming into the air   lord love i am glad to hear that  aside a good omen she has not yet told her husband i sind  to boothby why you were both the favorites of fortune i thought no lady had the spleen while she was winning at cards   booth mrs boothby has delicate nerves my lord and is little used to late hours and the card table your lordship may have your revenge however at any time on me   lord love i intend to have it on both i assure you   booth

thou art the happiest fellow in the world  you have an angel of a woman for your wife and so she did not tell you the reason of her breaking away so suddenly last night i must let you into the secret lest through mistake she think hardly of me   booth why so my lord   lord love you must know that to get rid of the effusions of her gratitude which she took an opportunity to pour out on me for the trouble i have taken to solicit your preferment i in raillery made love to her by telling her how easily she might get rid of the obligation   booth and she took you to be in earnest ha ha ha   lord love even so but it was in the presence of lady lovemore so that twas impossible i could mean any thing you know   lady love no my lord i am very sure you did not  you will excuse mrs boothby   lord love nay you must make my excuse to her she left us so abruptly that she gave me no time to come to an explanation   booth will you apologize for yourself my lord mrs boothby is within   lord love no no it will come better from you i must away to the secretary at war to tell you the truth i heard yesterday of a vacancy at home that may be worth your acceptance and therefore desired an interview with him to day if i succeed in your behalf you shall know what it is if it be already disposed of for there are innumerable solicitants we will think of it as a gem long lost and watch the next opportunity of meeting with its fellow   booth i am infinitely indebted to your lordship for this obliging attention to my interest   lord love i only wish i may be able to serve you as i intend  but i must go  mean time do you hear boothby make my peace with your wife before i see her again exit   booth i will my lord  how noble and generous is it in his lordship to give himself all this trouble of application for me  and yet  when i reflect on mrs boothbys behavior last night and this whimsical tale of a love story  i dont half like it his lordship is a man of intrigue and the liberties which men of rank think themselves authorized to take in this age of gallantry with their inferiors are alarming i must speak to mrs boothby but she will not be open enough to tell me if there should be any thing in it left it should breed a quarrel  phoo hang it it cannot be neither  in the presence of his own wife and she one of the best and most amiable women in the universe i am ashamed of the suspicion  it is to the last degree injurious to so generous so disinterested a friend what a mean contracted heart is this of mine i blush to think i am possessed of such a narrow soul   enter

general but i know no reason for it   began then i would make him give one  colonel basto assures me he has seen him at bath and knows him to be a common gambler lord lovemore should be called to account for introducing such a scoundrel into company at his own house  you know in regard to my sister it would look ill in me or else  but i will carry him a civil message for you   booth to lord lovemore my best friend impossible to think of it general he must have been imposed on in the character of the gentleman or if not gamblers now get into the company of the first people in the kingdom   began not in private parties at their own houses sir  however you may do as you please  you may put up with it  but if any other person had introduced a fellow that bad taken the liberty to put his money into my pocket    booth nay but consider general lord lovemore is my friend my patron and no very distant relation a man of high rank and your brotherinlaw    began were he the first duke in the

advising you challenge lord lovemore indeed my dear there was nothing in the foolish affair of last night that should excite such resentment it was a capricious mistake of my own he could not mean any thing  lady lovemore herself was by and heard every word that was said   booth i know it my dear but why are you so much alarmed the general is not in his dignitystilts this morning upon your account   mrs booth not on my account   booth he took umbrage it seems at losing his money last night and would set every body quarrelling that was concerned in winning it   mrs booth aside how have my curiosity and impatience betrayed me   booth nay child never mind it you have only betrayed a little secret that i knew before but why will you keep such foolish secrets from me a woman should have no confidant in these matters but her husband lord lovemore is much mord open and ingenuous he has confided in me already and has been just now telling the whole story   mrs booth aside specious deceiver but i dare not expose him   booth indeed my dear if your error did not proceed from an amiable cause in which i am so deeply interested i should think you greatly to blame his lordship is so noble so generous a friend that i would not disoblige him for the world even common gratitude should induce us to put the most favorable construction on his behavior would you believe that he is now gone to the secretary at war of his own accord to solicit a post for me which he hears is become vacant at home he seems to take a concern in my interest as if it were his own   mrs booth aside artful villain i can no longer bear it exit bursting into tears   booth tears of gratitude susceptible creature how will she reproach herself now for having harbored an unjust suspicion of our best benefactor enter lady lovemore lady lovemore  what nobody waiting there   lady love nay no ceremony sir i came in without it because i would not disturb mrs boothby i hope her last nights indisposition is attended with no ill consequences   booth your ladyships solicitude is obliging none at all it appears to have been a mere capricio as insignificant as the innocent cause of it   lady love as the cause of it mr boothby   booth yes madam my lord has been here this morning and has related to me the whole circumstance   lady love affecting to laugh he he he and was there ever any thing so ridiculous you may think yourself a happy man mr boothby in so good a wife but i protest if every married woman were as exceptious as mrs boothby there would be no keeping up conversation between people of fashion of different sexes an hour together   booth your ladyship is perfectly in the right mrs boothbys behavior was certainly too exceptious   lady love oh preposterous we must rally her out of this rustic prudery or she will be fit to keep company with nobody but yourself mr boothby i must go and give her a lecture indeed i must teach her to think and act a little more like folks of this world exit   booth how easy spirited and engaging well after all though virtue be a jewel it is like a diamond which of the first water must yet be polished before it displays its luster how admirable is the behavior of this lady lovemore mrs boothby has not less natural goodness of heart or of native beauty but to how much more advantage would they appear if she had her ladyships artificial habit of displaying them she will profit i dare say by so striking an example indeed my wife is as fortunate in having acquired the friendship of lady lovemore as i am in that of his lordship exit   scene iii

hit for a young fellow that has been no longer at the bar   wit with your assistance mr sergeant i hope it will prove so   ser non why lookye brother witmore governor mammon may be a good client so that should it afterward come out that i assisted you in this business    wit i will then sacrifice the first good client i have to you mr sergeant   ser non i expect no less than that stroke of friendship  one good turn you know    wit deserves another mr sergeant   ser non nay if by marrying the young lady you make your fortune and retire from the bar you may give me all your interest too   wit i will do it mr sergeant   ser non yes but i will have no hand in any thing but delay there is no disrepute in the laws delay i would not do any thing disreputable for the world it will hurt me in my practice master witmore   wit disrepute and dishonesty mr sergeant as you shrewdly hint are two things our practice does not depend on our integrity but on our reputation for it   ser non a just distinction true character character is all you may do what you will if you be but artful or lucky enough to preserve your character   wit and if that be neglected or unluckily lost be as honest as one will it will signify nothing   ser non egad mr witmore for a young man you seem to know a good deal of the world it is almost a pity the bar should lose so promising a casuist you would make a figure at nisi prius and pleas of the crown   wit you flatter me mr sergeant but young adventurers at the bar like soldiers of fortune in arms should lose no fair opportunity of advancing themselves out of the line of their profession   ser non egad that is true  a fortunes a fortune no matter how we come by it as our old friend horace says rem facias rem  quocunque modo rem   wit ay mr sergeant

your scheme but i am afraid i shall not be able to set governor mammon so much against me as to make him refuse to fulfill the contract   wit well at the worst he cannot compel you to fulfill it it is an adjudged case that the marriagecontract of a minor is not binding but never fear play but your part with discretion my dear emily and you cannot fail to deter him from the match repel his first attacks with vivacity and you shall find me and sergeant nonplus who is within ready to complete his repulse   em  i would fain have the refusal come from him  and yet    wit nay my dear emmeline start no more objections  i thought i had fully satisfied your scruples when you satisfied mine love knows no bonds no shackles but what it imposes on itself it disdains the formal restrictions imposed on it by others and submits to no obligations but those of the heart   em smiling but is this law mr witmore   wit the law of love my dear emmeline which is the law of liberty   em and is there nothing inequitable in the case eh   wit why to say truth there is some little difference between law and equity in most cases but the court of love my dear emmeline is a court of common law and is governed by ancient customs and usages time immemorial of which none is of longer standing than that of a womans changing her mind we shall certainly carry our point therefore at law which will put me in possession of your charms and then let equity disposess me of them if it can   em how lucky it is that i have fallen into the hands of so great a lawyer exeunt   end of the third act act iv scene i sir solomon baubles enter governor mammon and lady bauble lady bau with a due reciprocation of civilities sir i must needs say that your actions bespeak it there is indeed a generosity in your behavior that has charmed us all except my niece emmeline i cannot think what is come to the girl but she is grown quite hypocondriac as i tell her   g mam thoughtful perhaps on her approaching change of condition madam   lady bau or perhaps governor she expected a present as well as sir solomon and myself we women are all a little mercenary you know and besides she might think it a mark of disrespect that she had none one cannot tell  these young things who know but a little of the world have strange conceptions   g mam i should be sorry madam that miss emmelines inexperience should cause her to censure me for want of respect but i reserved such testimony of my regard for her till i should have the honor of presenting it myself this casket of diamonds    lady bau and have you brought her a casket of diamonds then oh she will brighten up at the diamonds i will warrant her i will send her to you immediately  but here she is enter emilia come niece emmeline here is governor mammon that is to be your husband you know taking hold of her band and leading her toward the governor who advances to salute her as you must have a great deal to say to one another i leave you together governor aside i long to have their confabulation over that i may contemplate the beauty of the diamonds exit   g mam bowing as he retires from faluting her miss emmeline your slave  aside a fine girl grown faith to her you will permit me to present you with this token of my respect before i enter on the subject of my love taking a casket out of his pocket and presenting it to her   em putting aside the casket with her hand by no means sir before i receive any present from you governor it is proper i should know what return i can make you   g mam there needs no return madam   em true governor if i become your wife in which case your present is a mere piece of gallantry and you may almost as well take it out of one hand and put it into the other you style yourself my slave but rather call me yours for i am certain you think so   g mam miss emmeline   em nay sir be not surprised i am not now governor the poor simple girl that was prevailed on to enter into a contract with you in india of which i have but lately understood the impropriety   g man indeed madam there seems to be a great alteration both in your person and sentiments but as i admire the one i presume the other will make no alteration in the nature of our connection   em a groundless hope governor to be plain with you i find that women educated in england not only bestow their persons in marriage but that they have minds also which are interested in the event of that union souls governor of which you asiatic tyrants will hardly allow us women to boast the possession   g mam why really miss emmeline you seem to be possessed of a soul indeed if one may judge by this specimen of your spirit but as the philosophers hold the soul to be of no sex we asiatics as you call us wisely think the best part of a woman is her person   em and you would be mean enough to accept the hand of a woman who had disposed of her heart to another   g mam why look ye madam if a woman takes upon her to dispose of what is not her property but has been made over to another i dont see why the first owner may not without the imputation of meanness reclaim it but is that really the case miss emmeline   em indeed governor it is   g mam then you have dealt disingenuously by me madam putting the casket into his pocket   em how so sir if all you require of a woman be the possession of her person what matters it on whom she bestows her affections   g mam i looked on both in you as equally my property   em why there sir  it is just as i said  you look upon me as your property your purchased slave and would doubtless treat me as such were we married you would be for taking me back to india to make up the number of your zenana your seraglio of female favorites but that is not in your power sir were i even married to you without my own consent and be assured i shall never willingly leave a country in which the privileges of our sex are so well respected and secured an english wife governor    g mam is as great a tyrant    em as an eastern husband   g mam indeed   em she may at least set her husbands tyranny at defiance and repay his neglect of her in kind so beware governor what you do and as you approve the hint precipitate our nuptials exit   g mam hey day what a termagant young devil it is grown yes yes she returned to england to finish her education with a vengeance no no madam i will not marry to go back to india and leave you in england neither if i do marry you i will certainly get divorced before i go or compel you to go with me  the privileges of an english wife truly repay their neglect in kind what a poor devil is an english husband   enter witmore and sergeant nonplus from within ser non governor your servant   g mam well met mr sergeant  egad you are luckily encountered here i must have a little of your advice or my young tartar from bengal will prove too much for me   ser non what is the matter sir   g mam this morning you know i consulted you about the shortest method of fulfilling a certain matrimonial contract and now i believe i must consult you on the shortest way of dissolving it   ser non so suddenly sir   wit what on the first interview governor   g mam why the yonng lady speaks her mind so plainly that i have no need of a second   ser non she is not to your fancy then governor   g mam or rather i am not to hers she has taken a fancy to somebody else it seems   wit and did she own it to you   g mam yes faith she was explicit enough in all conscience i cannot complain of her reserve you must find out some way therefore gentlemen to dissolve this same contract   wit impossible governor without fulfilling the condition of the obligation   g mam what must i be married to such a shrew against my will   wit o no sir on the payment of a lack of rupees you may be excused these are the terms of the contract as i take it   g mam yes but as i take it that forfeiture is too considerable i will marry her though it be to have the pleasure of divorcing her the next day   wit true governor if that pleasure might be so soon had   g mam may it not i understood divorces were now become as frequent in england as in the east   ser non they are pretty frequent indeed governor and when the parties are agreed are easily brought about but if either be refractory they are somewhat dilatory and expensive   g mam and pray gentlemen in what time and expense upon an average now may a man by the laws of england get rid of a refractory wife   wit by the law of reason and therefore by the laws of england sir it should be very soon   ser non but by the practice of them it cannot be at all   g mam how sir   ser non even so sir a new law must be expressly made for that purpose   wit by that means it may be brought about   g mam well no matter for the means the time and expense   ser non let me fee  the time and expense  crim con we must take for granted   g mam ay ay in all appearance we shall want no no proof of that   ser non an action may be prosecuted in the temporal court a reasonable time and a moderate expense brother witmore   wit yes yes we common lawyers have some conscience   ser non verdict obtained at westminster we go into the commons a libel is instituted  recrimination ensues    g mam recrimination what is that mr sergeant   ser non the recrimination of the canonists sir is the antecatagory of the civilians   g mam it is oh ho that makes every thing very plain   wit you must know governor our canonists maintain that a woman may as lawfully go astray from her husband as a man from his wife   g mam the devil   wit yes sir and our married women of course play the devil on the authority   ser non pope boniface the  th sir as the priests had no wives of their own indulgently promulgated this doctrine for them to preach to the wives of others   g mam but what have we to do with pope boniface or his indulgencies   ser non more than you may imagine governor the reformatio legum not taking place the papal cannons continue still in force and si quando mulier maritum  but perhaps i had better speak plain english    g mam by all means mr sergeant if you can  as you are upon a matter of importance i should be glad to understand you   ser non then sir to put the case familiarly thus if jack a being lawfully married to jill b peradventure jill should prove a jade as now a days it is ten to one but she does yet nevertheless and notwithstanding if the said jill make it appear that the said jack is as bad as herself it is in such case to be adjudged that the parties jack and jill are well matched and it were a sin to separate so worthy a couple   g mam confound the pope and all his adherents   ser non with all my heart governor except out brethren in the commons with whom to proceed    wit ay ay proceed proceed mr sergeant   ser non recrimination ended  alimony settled  term probatory over go to trial  cast no matter which side the husband pays costs on both   g mam the devil he does   wit ay governor there is the devil again   ser non an appeal is next lodged in the arches  the ground gone over again  thence an appeal to the delegates a definitive sentence is obtained this being in your favor on settling a handsome separate maintenance on your wife you turn her off a mensa et thoro   g mam and so get fairly rid of her ha   wit not so fast governor only from bed and board   ser non besides sir unless you fly the country your lady if she be industrious may bring you a numerous family of wellbegotten children to all of which you would be the only lawful father   g mam zounds gentlemen can this be law   wit sound law i assure you governor   ser non ay ay found law found law  but to go on with our process    g mam oh confound its prolixity   ser non with sentence for separation a mensa et thoro governor we go next into parliament for a divorce a vinculo matrimonii the last stage   wit where you may carry your point   g mam hell and the devil what a process   ser non let me see brother witmore ay on a moderate computation in about ten years and at the expense of twenty ay twenty or one and twenty thousand pounds the governor may fairly get rid of his wife  that is as i said before crim con taken for granted   wit so you see governor you may marry her as soon as you please   g mam and so i will though cuckoldom be my portion if i cannot get rid of her without suing for a divorce you may proceed therefore gentlemen with the settlements yes i will marry her and ship her for india immediately or perhaps ship her first lest she should give me the slip and run off with her lover exit   the lawyers look at each other with confusion wit ha   ser non how is this brother witmore what cause have we been pleading here   wit ship her for india said he egad we must demur immediately mr sergeant it will be too late to bring a writ of error after execution let us go to chambers and consult   ser non oh a demurrer a demurrer by all means master witmore a demurrer exeunt   scene ii boothbys lodgings enter lady lovemore and mrs goodwill lady love mrs boothby gone abroad say you   mrs good to pritchards to give orders for her habit madam   lady love oh i shall then meet with her ten to one in my round if not tell her i shall call to take her with me in the evening i must run away immediately going out is met by general gantlet   began stopping her dont put yourself in a fluster sister i am sorry for your ladyships situation but these things will happen   lady love happen general  what will happen   began nay madam i thought by your flurry you had heard more than i  but if you have heard nothing and will promise me not to be frightened i will tell you   lady love promise not to be frightened  you have frightened me to death already but indeed you are always terrifying me with some disaster or other what is the matter now   began nay it may come to nothing therefore it is time enough to be alarmed  mrs goodwill   mrs good sir   began what time did mr boothby go out   mrs good i cannot exactly say the hour sir but it was soon after you left him this morning lord lovemore called in again and they went out together   began as i thought that is two or three hours ago mr boothby you find sister is not returned and i am just come from your house where they know nothing of his lordship so that it is plain one or both of them must have dropped   lady love dropped lord lovemore or mr boothby heaven and earth was there any quarrel between them   began quarrel madam was it not unavoidable after the affair of last night   mrs good so this rash general has been fomenting mischief and stirring up strife again   lady love and what brother had you to do with the affair of last night   began i will not suffer the honor of my friends madam to be hurt by their pusillanimity and while i have that of being your husbands brotherinlaw he shall neither give nor take an affront if i can help it without resenting or being called to account for it   lady love your notions of honor brother are ridiculous is it less dishonorable for a man to cut his friends throat than to be civil to his wife   began i am an old bachelor you know and know nothing about wives but if boothby has not cut your husbands throat for the insult offered him at your house laft night he is a    lady love and so you have been setting them to sighting i find oh i shall faint i shall die my poor lord is certainly killed he is murdered she throws herself into the chair and affects to faint away   mrs good running to her assistance and taking smelling bottle from her pocket help help here  pray general lay hold of the ladys hand and keep it open   began me not i madam i know nothing of palmistry   mrs good bless me general how could you go to frighten my lady in this manner   began poh frightened if his lordship be killed he dies like a man of honor and she may the sooner get another husband   lady love recovering talk not to me brother of another husband i shall never live to support the loss of this   enter boothby began ha boothby turns on his heel and walks to the back of the stage   lady love oh mr boothby where  where is my poor lord barbarous man have you indeed then left him dead or shall i see him again alive throwing herself again into the chair   booth aside so so so honor and dignity has been making fine work of it here i find to lady lovemore your poor lord madam i left him rich alive and well not five minutes ago turning over the habits at pritchards   lady love heaven be praised   mrs good so say i my lady let me beg of your ladyship to compose yourself you see nothing has happened that should thus distress you   began having taken boothy aside so nothing came of it ha  what disarmed  a scratch only eh  egad i wish i had said nothing about it   booth i believe indeed it had been better general   lady love rising from her chair inhuman brother why why will you be thus perpetually frightening me you had better draw your sword and pierce my bosom at once than be thus ever terrifying me with false alarms   began fire and furies madam draw upon a woman i that have dared death and destruction at the head of a line of battle what effeminacy have you ever seen in me madam to think i should contaminate my sword with the blood of a woman it is well madam it is not your husband that insults me thus if he had i would have wrung off his neck as i would that of a turkeycock draw my sword on a woman  but it is a womans insult and so i put up with the indignity exit   lady love bless me mr boothby this brother of mine is quite frantic is there no method of curing this ridiculous folly   booth i am afraid not madam but i will make a trial i fancy i could frighten him as much as he has frightened your ladyship   lady love would you could captain boothby it would give me great satisfaction and might have some good effect on him for really his caprices are dreadful   enter servant with a letter for boothby serve a letter sir  the bearer said it required no answer but must be given into your hands immediately   booth your ladyship will excuse me   lady love no apology mr boothby  business must be minded  i must hurry away to assist mrs boothby in the choice of her dress   booth your ladyships humble servant exit lady lovemore now let me see reads to capt boothby  if captain boothby would prevent his wifes ruin and preserve his own honor he will hinder her going to the masquerade with lord lovemore or when there will most carefully watch the behavior of his lordship   the handwriting is a womans and resembles that of lady lovemore but it cannot be hers  she is to accompany my wife and therefore would hardly dissuade me from letting her go besides she seems not to have the least tincture of jealousy in her disposition  yet now i reflect come this notice from whom it will it may not be proper to neglect it mrs boothbys conduct is mysterious her resentment last night at lord lovemores was unaffected and natural and though the passed off the matter slightly to day the manner in which she did it was neither easy nor natural  there may be something more in this business than i am aware of i will take mrs boothby to task roundly for her reserve i will make her believe i know more than i do that she may tell me more than i know  here she comes enter mrs boothby come hither madam i have something to say to you  but first let me shut the door   mrs booth something to say to me and such preparation it must be of importance sure mr boothby   booth it is madam tell me mrs boothby taking her hastily by the hand and tell me truly as you value my future quiet and your own happiness have you dealt fairly by me   mrs booth bless me mr boothby what do you mean you terrify me to death by this earnestness dealt fairly by you   booth ay fairly mrs boothby   mrs booth witness heaven that i have done it ever   booth nay call not heaven to witness a falsehood  you have deceived me mrs boothby  you have treacherously concealed from me a secret which i ought to have known and which had i not by other means discovered it might have proved our ruin   mrs booth of what falsehood what deceit what treachery have i been guilty   booth you told me to day that you thought lord lovemore meant nothing by the behavior you resented last night   mrs booth unkind mr boothby did not you yourself say every thing to persuade me so did you not say that gratitude for the obligations his lordship sought to confer on us required the most favorable construction to be put on his actions   booth obligations madam had he laid obligations on me till he had raised pile to reach the skies the favor he sought to confer by your means would have tumbled them all down and buried them in oblivion  it is in vain to conceal it any longer this letter this letter madam has given me damnable intimations of the favors intended us   mrs booth by all my hopes of happiness both here and hereafter i declare i have concealed nothing from you but out of motives of the most sincere fidelity and affectionate tenderness i knew you to be so jealous of your honor that i dreaded the fatal consequences of telling you all   booth and are not you madam equally jealous of my honor that out of such mistaken tenderness for my personal safety you would betray the most invaluable treasure of my soul i would you from so weak a motive subject me to be pointed at as the credulous dupe the easy fool the wittol of a titled rascal whom i caress as a friend   mrs booth indeed indeed you wrong me mr boothby heaven forbid i should be put to the trial but i think i could sacrifice every thing i hold most dear to the preservation of your honor   booth as far as it is dependent on your fidelity you may think it safe the worst even a bad woman can do is to make herself ridiculous it is on herself only that she can entail infamy but men of honor madam have a degree of it to maintain superior to that which is in a womans keeping   mrs booth i understand you not   booth i will myself madam be the guardian both of my own honor and of yours i have before told you a womans best confidant is her husband   mrs booth will you then promise to command your temper and not be urged by that of others to violence   booth i will   mrs booth then will i positively confide in you and should his lordship make any farther advances acquaint you with it and now my dear let me know the contents of that letter   booth read it gives mrs boothby the letter and looks at her attentively while she reads it well madam what think you of it   mrs booth i think it is the contrivance of a very artful and a very jealous woman   booth my lady lovemore   mrs booth it is her hand  though purposely disguised  i am sure of it i was before this almost tempted to think her base enough to countenance the gallantries of her husband   booth impossible with her you are safe whatever be the designs of his lordship   mrs booth then you would have me still go to the masquerade   booth by all means we cannot with any kind of decency break the appointment without breaking at once with lord lovemore which neither good manners nor prudence will yet justify   mrs booth i will then go in to dress pritchard has promised to send me the habit you so much admired to day exit manet boothby how loose are the principles of men of intrigue and how often do we attribute to motives of humanity and generosity a conduct influenced by the desire of gratifying personal vanity or mere animal appetite  lord lovemore is to sunk in my esteem that i can place no confidence in his honor i shall so far take the letterwriters advice therefore as to watch his motions to night very narrowly enter mrs goodwill oh mrs goodwill if general gantlet should return i have a little plot upon him which you must assist me in lady lovemore wishes to be revenged on him for the fright he has just put her in now the general was duelling yesterday and wounded his antagonist the wounds i understand are not dangerous but it will be easy for us to persuade him that they are mortal   mrs good an excellent device if it should but terrify him to run away his honor and dignity would be finely mortified before he discovered the trick that was put on him   booth egad here he comes  do you be within hearing mrs goodwill and second my attempt as you see necessary   mrs good you may depend on me sir exit   reenter general gantlet began i forgot boothby to ask you if you intend playing the fool at the haymarket to night  i think of going   booth egad general i believe you had better think of a prudent expedition to the continent you acted the part of a man it seems so seriously with your antagonist yesterday that you should be careful how you play the fool to night i understand he lies at the point of death   began zounds the surgeon told me he was in no danger   booth yes but it seems they have called in another of more dangerous practice and he declares otherwise so that if the man dies general the lawyers who know nothing about the point of honor you know    began confound the surgeons and the lawyers too  die let him die and be sepulchred on a dunghill   booth nay but confider general i would have you make off by all means and get out of the kingdom as fast as you can   began make off what like a housebreaker or a highwayman make off   booth nay general dont be angry  but if you stay and matters stand as i hear them related you will run the utmost danger   began but is it not derogatory to a mans dignity to fly from danger   booth if it threatened only from the point of a bayonet or the mouth of a culverin i grant you general but when it appears in the form of a halter and the gallows   began egad you say true boothby there is no dignity in the gallows i will decamp   enter mrs goodwill in haste mrs good bless me gentlemen i am almost frightened out of my wits  here has been two of sir john fieldings people enquiring after general gantlet but as i heard of the ugly affair that happened yesterday i said his honor was not here  the servant says they are still lurking about the street therefore pray take care how you go out general  what a thing it would be if your honors dignity should come to be hanged   g began hell and the devil what shall i do  not that i value my life capt boothby of a button i have shown that at the head of a line of battle but to be throttled with a halter the indignity of it boothby i shall die with shame under the indignity of it   booth let me see  what can be done in this emergency you might escape under disguise and that the more readily as it is masquerade night  but a domino is not sufficient and i have no other at hand   mrs good what think you of womens apparel sir i can furnish his honor with a sack and petticoat   began a petticoat   mrs good yes sir i will run and fetch it immediately exit   began a petticoat i will be taken hanged drawn and quartered ere i put on a petticoat a soldier a commander wear a petticoat   booth pshaw general there is nothing in a petticoat which the bravest man upon earth need he offended at achilles you know who outhectored hector was glad to conceal himself under one of his mothers maids short petticoats nay hercules himself changed his club for a distaff and threw off his lions skin to put on fair omphales petticoat   began by the lord you say true egad i had forgot it a man as you say may be as valiant as hercules and yet be glad sometimes to creep under a petticoat where where is it   enter mrs goodwill with a tete sack and petticoat mrs good here here sir with a ladys tete too to complete the disguise   booth ay this is the very thing mrs goodwill booth and mrs good assist to dress gant   began while he is dressing lookye boothby it is not because i fear to die  i have shown that as i said before in the field of battle  nor that i think i have done wrong in ridding the world of a rascal  i could die with a safe conscience  but the manner of it boothby  the manner of it i would avoid the indignity of being carted with streetrobbers and footpads might i be indulged in the satisfaction of being blown from the mouth of a cannon or plead privilege to have the honor of being decapitated like a gentleman may i be crucified if i would budge a foot  but to be dragged like a calf with a rope about its neck to the slaughter to hear widemouthed hawkers cry my last dyingspeech and confession  come come mrs goodwill make haste with your petticoat  hercules himself wore a petticoat   mrs good there sir twill do very well  now for your tete   booth an admirable disguise  and well fitted   mrs good and very becoming too i protest  oh and here your honor is your ladyships fan taking a fan out of her pocket   began ay ay come give me my truncheon taking the fan   mrs good aside well if this does not cure him of duelling he should have a statute of lunacy taken out against him and be shut up in the hospital of incurables exit   began  after looking at himself for some time so a pretty figure for a general eh boothby i would not have you think my dear boy that it is out of fear i submit to wear this effeminate disguise it is only to avoid suffering an indignity unbecoming a man ever while you live boothby preserve the dignity of man   exeunt began fanning himself and holding up his train end of act the fourth act v scene i capt boothbys lodgings enter boothby and witmore booth how talk of shipping the young lady back to india he dare not attempt it sure   wit it is hard to say what an india governor accustomed to the insolence of asiatic tyranny may not attempt his wealth may promise him impunity and a step of that kind is easier prevented than amended i have prevailed on emilia therefore to give her aunt the slip and take refuge with mrs boothby to night tomorrow we shall seek another asylum   booth i rejoice at the occasion afforded me of obliging my friend as i dare say mrs boothby will at that of assisting my cousin  mrs goodwill enter mrs goodwill please to let mrs boothby know i would speak to her   mrs good she bade me tell you

her ladyship from stirring out to night   booth and did my wife go with his lordship   mrs good no sir but as he was very pressing for her to do it she promised to follow him   booth how it was highly indiscreet of her mrs goodwill to go alone be so obliging as to fetch my domino and mask down stairs madam  i must follow her immediately exit mrs goodwill boothby alone i dont half like lady lovemores staying at home and his lordships officiousness in seconding her messages and pressing my wife to accompany him  and yet there can be no design in it sure  my wife refused to go with him

miserable it has made me i did not think i could have been so suddenly jealous my wife cannot sure encourage lord lnvemore and yet as i watched them about the rooms i surprised her in such familiar conversation with him she did not speak loud enough for me to hear what she said indeed but she seemed to whisper so frequently and her signs were so significantly encouraging her attitudes so

this young barrister is my nephew   wit sir   sir sol how the governor your uncle and you so undutiful at not to know any thing about him   g mam his ignorance of me is excuseable sir solomon it is long since i corresponded with the family  he may possibly have heard of me but there have been so many mammons of late years imported from india that had the name implied affinity he might have expected a cargo of cousins by every fleet but know me now young gentleman for your uncle embracing him   lady bau well but what is to become of our niece   g mam why give her to my kinsman madam i really think the young lady has provided better for herself than her friends had provided for her   sir sol and do you resign her to him governor   g mam why look ye sir solomon i did not choose to forfeit my lack of rupees but as the money will not now go out of the family i can refign the lady without reluctance so that if you consent to their marriage the young folks shall not be disappointed   sir sol well what say you to the proposal my lady   lady bau say sir solomon what is there to be said governor mammon having a right to claim emilia for himself he has a fortiori as the logicians say a right to dispose of her to his nephew   sir sol well then barrister with the governors leave i dont say take her but as you have got you may keep her   wit i thank you sir solomon  but to you sir speaking to governor mammon i know not how to make my acknowledgements   g mam when we are better acquainted nephew you may learn   sir sol ay ay  and as you have got so good an uncle and a wife into the bargain barrister you ought to be satisfied   wit not quite sir you will give me leave to hope you will extend your goodness also to my friend boothby and your daughter   mrs booth may i hope for so great a blessing as your pardon madam to lady bauble   lady bau sir solomon   sir sol nay if it rests with me  there  there take both our blessings between you it is all i can spru at present though take that with you   booth i hope otherwise sir   wit never fear boothby when favor once comes fortune will soon follow   enter general gantlet in his own clothes g began by heavens this is not to be put up with bedizend like a strumpet dogged by thieftakers dragged along like a streetwalker  capt boothby i must have satisfaction for all this i understand it was a plot of yours and my lady sisters to expose me as to her she is a woman and i will have nothing more to do with petticoats   booth faith general i ask your pardon with all my heart but i acted in concert with lady lovemore merely to set this savage custom of duelling you are so absurdly fond of in a ridiculous light   g began yes faith i feel myself ridiculous enough in all conscience but my dignity boothby   booth how general does dignity consist in the brutal custom of cutting throats like cannibals in cold blood did the heroes of antiquity want dignity yet did caesar ever send a challenge to cato or cato to caesar   g began caesar and cato boothby were clever fellows in their day no doubt yes your caesars and catos must have been fine fellows in there time but sword and pistol were not then in vogue and the fighting ones friends was not come in fashion you may call me absurd if you will but how is a man of honor at present to support his consequence without having recourse to the duel   booth by having recourse to his goodnature my dear general believe me there is often more fortitude in forgiving an injury than in revenging it and always more dignity in despising insults than in resenting them   the end epilogue written by the author and spoken by miss barsanti  well men of valor how do ye like our play nothing against it sure the ladies say  to own they are pleased the critics ever loath may cry a duellist with scarce an oath it is like his hat that was without a feather  duels and dammes always go together old sinners loving the licentious joke may think there wants too here and there a stroke round oaths and double meanings strewn between with them the virtues of the comic scene and yet the town in general is so nice it holds these virtues as a kind of vice from the teeth outward chaste their hands before em like reps even demireps are all decorum though gross their thoughts so delicate their hearing they think the very stage should fine for swearing our author therefore scrupled to employ your vulgar damme sir and damme boy nay when by chance a naughty joke came pat in he wrapped it up you know in lawyers latin alluding to a passage in the play which the author in deference to the delicacy of certain ladies who understand latin has omitted  so much refined the scene since former days when congreve vanbrugh wycherly wrote plays the stage so loosely did astrea tread she fairly put all characters to bed though now no bard would venture to deposit a macaroni in a ladys closet lest the srail fair one he be thought to ruin while moon and stars alone  see what they are doing in the old plays gallants take no denial but put the struggling actress to the trial b ess me i shudder even now to think how near even i may stand on dangers brink in modern plays more safe the female station secure as sad our solemn situation no rakish forward spark dares now be rude the comic muse herself grown quite a prude no wonder then if in so pure an age no congreves write for as demure a stage
