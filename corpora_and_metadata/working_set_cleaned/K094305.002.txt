whilst paul was at athens he saw paul at athens the city wholly given to idolatry for which reason he not only preached in the synagogue to the jews and proselytes but in other places of concourse he took occasion to make known the christian doctrine to all the heathens he met  some learned men of athens seeing paul so ready to engage in dispute with every one undertook him but not understanding him some cried he was a prating babbling fellow others that he came to discover some strange god to them because he frequently mentioned jesus and the resurrection  after this they brought him before the magistrates to be examined what new religion it was he taught for all that they had hitherto heard was new and strange and therefore they desired to have a full account of all paul being at full liberty to speak said  i perceive o athenians that ye have a great number of idols for as i passed by and saw your superstitious devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god this god therefore whom you acknowledge not to know yet profess to worship is he whom i preach the invisible god of heaven and earth who cannot be contained in temples of mans making nor can any image made by man be a proper object of his worship he being so far from wanting our help that it is he that gives to all their life and all that they have and from one man he has made a whole world of men appointing times and places in great order and the end of all this is that they should seek after their creator and worship him who is indeed near every one of us even as the soul that animates us  for our life motion and subsistence are wholly through him according to that which one of your own poets has said  god therefore being our creator we cannot in reason suppose him to be the work of our hands such as a piece of gold silver or a stone graved this time of ignorance has lasted long but now god calls you are to repentance having determined the way by which all the world shall be judged that is by receiving or refusing the faith of christ who being raised from the dead is offered to all men to believe in  when they heard him mention the resurrection the epicureans especially who denied a future state fell a laughing at him others said we will hear thee about this another time and so paul left them  this is the representation of the fifth piece of painting in the cupola  conjuring books burnt   chap ii the conjuring books burnt some of the vagabond jewish exorcists seeing the many extraordinary miracles which were wrought by the hand of paul insomuch that he did not only cure them who came to him but by his touching linen clothes and sending them to such as were sick or possessed with devils they were immediately healed the exorcists i say seeing this they also attempted to cast out devils by using the name of jesus among whom were the seven sons of one scaeva a jew one of the chief of the families of the priests who adjuring the evil spirit in the name of jesus were thus answered by the possessed  jesus i know and paul i know but you come not with any authority from jesus who has given it to paul  and the man who was possessed fell furiously upon them and was too hard for them tearing off their clothes and wounding them so that they were glad to sly from him  this being soon rumoured among the jews and natives of ephesus prevailed so with them that they were convinced and converted to the faith  and they that were so happy came to paul and his company confessing their former course of life to know what they should do and many that had studied and practiced magic brought their books out and burnt them publicly though they were of a very high price of so great authority was the word of god as it was preached by paul among the ephesians and those of asia  this latter part of the burning of the books is the subject of the sixth piece of painting  king agrippa   chap iii king agrippa almost persuaded to be a christian paul having been brought before king agrippa to answer to diverse complaints made against him by the jews in general as a most notorious malefactor and after festus a noble orator had opened his case in an elegant speech before the court agrippa told paul he had liberty to speak who desiring silence of the audience began with this apology for himself  i cannot but think my self happy o king agrippa in that i am permitted to make my defense against the accusation laid by the jews before your majesty whom i know to be a perfect master of the jewish laws and customs for which reason i beg your patience  he then acquaints the king with the manner of his life from his youth of his being bred a pharisee of his being accused for asserting the resurrection of the dead appeals to him why it should be thought a thing incredible that god who is omnipotent should raise the dead confesses his own former unbelief the havoc that he made amongst the church his extraordinary conversion and many other things relating both to himself and to the gospel of jesus christ and at last asked king agrippa this question  believe thou the prophets o king i am satisfied thou do and know their predictions to be fulfilled  this was so home a challenge to agrippa that in the public presence he declared that paul had almost persuaded him to be a christian  upon this the assembly broke up and when agrippa and feslus had consulted together about pauls case they freely owned that the accusation laid against him was not punishable by death or imprisonment  this history is the subject of the seventh piece of painting  chap iv pauls voyage and shipwreck on the island of milita or malta paul having appealed unto caesar and an opportunity offering festus sends him to rome st pauls shipwreck under a guard commanded by one julius in a ship belonging to a sea port of mysia in which they set sail and coasted along asia till they arrived at sidon where julius who treated paul very respectfully gave him leave to go ashore and resresh himself  sailing from thence they came in fight of the sland of cyprus where they were to lie by a while but the winds presenting they passed the seas of cilicia and pamphylia and came to mira a maritime city of lycia here julius finding a large ship bound for italy took his prisoners on board her and with much ado made salome a city of crete from whence after they had been long beating at sea with contrary winds and very stormy weather they arrived at fairhavens near lasca where paul would have persuaded captain julius to wait for more seasonable weather but he preferring the master of the ships judgment they put to sea intending to reach phoenice a harbor of creto where there was safe riding and there to winter and they having a light gale of south they questioned not in the least of gaining their point  but they soon found themselves mistaken for the wind suddenly tacking about blew so very hard at north east that they were forced to hand all their sails and let her drive before the wind and coming under a little island called clauda they had like to have lost their boat but with much ado recovering it they hoisted it into the ship  the next day the storm continuing they were forced to cut away their masts and throw all their tackle overboard and lighten their ship the storm still increasing and neither sun nor stars for many days appearing they gave themselves over for lost  which paul perceiving he told them that he had seen a vision which assured him that not a soul of them should be lost though the ship should  the ship thus driving for fourteen days at the mercy of the winds and waves about midnight the sailors fansied they were near land and throwing the lead they sounded and found it twenty fathoms then fifteen and it still shaling and being night they apprehended they might strike upon some shelves in the dark so they let go four anchors astern and waited for day  and now the seamen resolving to shift for themselves had hoisted the boat overboard under pretense of mooring the ship ahead as they had done astern but paul perceiving their design told captain julius that if the sailors were suffered to quit the ship they should be in danger of being all lost upon this the soldiers to prevent their design cut the ropes and let the boat go adrift  now paul persuades them on board to take some refreshment the number of all that were in the ship was two hundred seventy six including soldiers and passengers  in the space between that and daybreak they all eat and drank and were refreshed having had no leisure or thought of eating for a considerable time before after this refreshment they sell cheerfully to work unloading the ship not only of goods but of the provisions and throwing them into the sea  when it was day they discovered a creak and a haven into which they endeavored to put and when they had weighed the anchors they made to the shore and run the ship aground where she soon bulgd the captain then ordered the prisoners that could swim to throw themselves into the sea first and the rest on broken pieces got safe to land where when they were all arrived they knew the place to be the island melita or malta  the islanders seeing them in distress treated them with great humanity making fires to warm their wet and weary limbs but whilst they were drying and warming themselves a viper driven from her hole by the heat of the fire leaped out and fastened upon pauls hand which when the natives saw they concluded him guilty of murder and that divine vengeance had pursued him to that place to die by the bite of this venomous creature but he shook it off into the fire and felt no harm on seeing this they presently altered their opinion and concluded him a god  the latter part of this history is the subject of the eighth and last piece of painting  chap v of the library the model of st peters at rome the great bell and geometrical staircase having quitted the whispering gallery you are next invited to see the above curiosities for which favor each persen pays twopence  the library room is large and beautiful the wainscoting carvings shelves and c are of nice workmanship but notwithstanding there is a large collection of books in it the shelves appear very thin and those locked up in a profound silence some lolling fast asleep one way and some another  these books were designed for the use of the clergy belonging to the cathedral but what from the height of its situation which is half way up the cupola and the dullness of its company consisting mosily of a parcel of antiquated must crabbed old authors makes it very seldom visited by them their chief use now is to be made a public show of like so many monsters to strangers country people and little masters and misses who whenever they come to see this fine library must always take care to go into the room on tiptoe for fear of disturbing any of these drousy old gentlemen  the floor of this room is very curious being imlaid without peg or nail with so much art and ingenuity that it really looks very beautiful  there is also a fine picture in it of the right reverend henry compton late lord bishop of london  the model of st peters at rome  this was taken by sir christopher wren from the church of st peter at rome whilst he resided there and from this with some alterations our cathedral of st paul was built he having took care to correct in the latter what he saw a blemish in the former this model stands in a large room where those who are curious may examine it it is a fine piece though now fallen somewhat to decay  as to the great bell and clock i have spoke of them before in the first volume page    to which i must refer my young readers and shall only add that the way to them is both dark and somewhat difficult to ascend and therefore not advisable for my young readers to venture up without a proper guide besides should the clock happen to strike whilst they are in the bell lost the sound is so surprisingly loud and shocking to those who are unaccustomed to it that they would imagine it would rend the very tower all to pieces  there is one thing more which is observable that this clock is wound up once a day which generally takes up an hours time and as it is then set it is looked upon to be very exact  lastly you are shown the grand geometrical staircase which is a curious and wonderful piece of workmanship and so artfully contrived that the support of the whole principally depends on the footstone only this and the stone staircase at hampton court are the only two of the kind that are to be met with in any of our public buildings  to give a more particular account of its beauties would require the judgment of one who is conversant in the science to which i must ingenuously acknowledge my self a stranger  next we shall proceed to the inside of the church  book ii chap i of the inside of st pauls the pillars of the church that support the roof are two ranges with their entablature and beautiful arches whereby the body of the church and choir are divided into three isles the roof of each is adorned with arches and spacious peripheries of enrichments as shields leaves chaplets etc admirably carved in stone  at the west end of the church there are three doors which lead to the above isles from each of which you have a beautiful prospect the whole length of the church without any interception from the pillars etc  just within the door of the north isle on the left hand is the morning prayer chapel where divine service is performed every day in the week excepting sundays from lady day to michaelmas at six in the morning and from michaelmas to layday at seven in the north tower is the bell for calling people to prayers  the front of this chapel has a very beautiful skreen of curious wainscot and adorned with twelve columns their entablatures arched pediments and the royal arms enriched with cherubims and each pediment between four vases all curiously carved and the skreen is senced with ironwork  next to the morning prayer chapel is the lord mayors vestry to which he generally repairs with his attendants before he takes his seat in the choir and then divine service immediately begins  at the entrance of the south isle on the right hand is the door that leads to the geometrical staircase next to that is the bishop of londons spiritual court which has a beautiful skreen of curious wainscot with columns carvings and other enrichments like those of the morning prayer chapel a little beyond this court on the left hand is a beautiful marble font which for largeness the fineness of its marble and curious workmanship excels all others for which reason i thought the picture of it would not be the marble font unacceptable to my young readers you go up two circular sleps to it  farther on the right hand is the door which leads up to the cupola  chap iii of the fine organcase etc the organcase is magnificent finely ornamented and enriched with the carved figures of several cupids and eight fames with their trumpets standing on the top of the case four looking eastward and four westward each appearing near six feet high  it is also enriched with cherubims fruit leaves etc represented in a very lively manner the organ pipes are very spacious gilt with gold and preserved from dust with fine sashes all which are raised on cight beautiful flured columns of the corinthian order of polished marble white veind with blue  chap iii of the altarpiece etc the altarpiece is adorned with four noble fluted pilasters finely painted and veined with gold in imitation of lapis lazuli with their entableture where the enrichments and also the capitals of the pilasters are double gilt with gold the intercolumns columns are twenty one pannels of figured crimson velvet above all is a glory finely done  the openings north and south into the choir are ascending up three steps of black marble by two iron folding doors liek those under the organ gallery and facing the choir exquisitely wrought into diverse figures spiral branches and other flourishes and there are two others of these fine iron doors the one opening into the south isle the other into the north they were all done by that celebrated artist in his way monsieur tijan  chap iv of the choir the officers of the church their seats etc this cathedral has a bishop a dean a precentor chancellor treasurer and five archdeacons to wit london middlesex essex colchester and st albans it has thirty prebendaries twelve canons and six vicars choral  the north and south sides of the choir have each thity stalls besides the bishops throne and seat on the south side and the lord mayors on the north all which compose one vast body of curious carved work of the finest wainscot done by that excellent artist the late mr gribeline gibbon as was likewise all the other carved work both of the ehoir and church  on the south side of the entrance into the choir is the deans vestry and near that the singing boys vestry and on the noth side the residentiarys and singing mens vestry where they all robe and unrobe  there are four vergers belonging to this church so called from virga a rod which each bears in his hand the deans has the cross daggers at top the others have no ensign at all  the floor of the choir and church is paved with marble but within the rail of the altar with fine porphyry polished and laid in sveral geometrical figures the arabathrum whereon the communion table is placed is sive steps higher than that of the choirs isles  we shall next descend into the vaults under st pauls  chap v of the vaults tombs and st faiths church under st pauls the passage down to these vaults is by a door in the body of the church  these vaults are indeed very spacious but at the same time dark and gloomy and strike a kind of horror in those who descend in order to survey the numerous and massy pillars and arches which support this prodigious pile of buildings of which they may be able to form some idea from the glimmering light that is introduced into it from the small windows that open into the churchyard  however this place is too solemn melancholy and unpleasant for our young readers to roam about in neither indeed are they invited to see it as they are the other curiosities belonging to the church and therefore would advise them to be contented with this account of it rather than st faiths church to gratify their curiosity by taking so gloomy a prospect  under the choir there was formerly the parish church of st faith commonly called st faiths under st pauls of which there is now no remains there is indeed a spot of ground railed in and set apart for the burial of the dead of that parish which is still subsisting and united to that of st austinsso that the notion which is entertained by several persons and by others confidently asserted that there is a parish church now beneath the choir and that there are prayers and preaching still performed therein on some particular days is vulgar error and altogether groundless  there are under the choir in this dark repository the monuments of several eminent persons but as it would be too tedious to give a description of them all and no ways entertaining to the young reader we shall pass them over in silence and take notice only of that of the architect of this grand building who lies interred in a little corner close to the foundation wall on the southeast side next watlingstreet there is a plain stone fixed against the wall at his head with the following inscription in capitals subtus conditor huius ecclesiae et vrbis conditor cristophorus wren qui vinit annos ultra nnaginta non s sed bono publico lector si monumentum requiris circumspice obiit xxv feb anno mdccxxiii et xci  the purpot of which is this here lies the body of christopher wren the architect of this cathedral church etc who lived above ninety years and studied the good of the public and not his own private interest and advantage reader if thou art curious to know where his monument is cast thy eyes all around thee he died    feb      aged     this inscription is much admired for the justness and simplicity of the thought  over his body is a plain stone with the following inscription here lies christopher wren knight the builder of this cathedral church of st paul etc who died in the year of our lord mdccxxiii and of his age xci  the end of the history of st pauls the monument  an account of the monument of the fire of london chap i its situation description and building on the east side of fishstreethill near to the foot of london bridge stands the monument in a square open to the street  it was set up by order of parliament in perpetual memory of the dreadful fire that happened the second day of september      within one hundred and thirty feet of the house where the fire first broke out and upon the spot where the church of st margernets newfishstreet stood  this monument stands upon an ascent from the street of three or four steps upon a large vault of stone arched  the column is of the dorick order built all of excellent portland stone it is erected upon a pedestal or square of about twenty seven feet high the body or shaft of it is fluted and is in height from the pedestal to the balcony a hundred and thirty three feet and from the balcony to the top of the flame is thirty eight feet and the height of the whole monument from the ground besides the vault and foundation to the top of the flame is two hundred and two feet the circumference of the shaft forty seven feet and a half its diameter from without the wall fifteen feet withinside nine feet diameter the thickness of the stone wall of the shaft is three feet  it has three hundred and forty five steps or stairs from the ground up to the balcony and niches in the wall with seats to rest in as people go up and from the balcony upwards is a ladder of iron steps to go into the urn out of which the flame all gilt with godl issues and to the stairs having an open newel there is a rail of iron to rest the hand upon all the way up  this monument is not unlike those two ancient white marble pillars at rome erected in honor of the emperors trajan and antoninus which were built above fifteen hundred years since and are still standing entire  the whole of this monument taken together is a curious piece of workmanship the charge of erecting it is said to amount to thirteen thousand seven hundred pounds and upwards  this building loftily shows itself above the houses and gives a gallant prospect for many miles round to those that are in the balcony so that many people have the curiosity to go up and look about them from thence the person appointed to keep it is allowed a salary for his attendance besides the money people give him the price demanded is twopence each person  it was begun in the may oralty of sir richard ford      and finished in that of sir joseph sheldon       top of the monument   bottom of the monument   chap ii of the careted figures in he west front the side toward the street has a representation of the destruction of the city by the fire and the rebuilding of it again by several curiously engraven figures made in full proportion  first is the figure of a woman representing london sitting on ruins in a most disconsolate posture her head hanging down and her hair all loose about her the sword lying by her and her left hand carelessly laid upon it a second figure is time with his wings and bald head coming behind her and gently lifting her up another female figure on the side of her laying her hand upon her and with a scepter winged in her other hand directing her to look upwards for it points up to two beautiful goddesses sitting in the clouds one leaning on a cornucopia denoting plenty the other having a palmbranch in her hand signifying victory or triumph underneath this figure of london in the midst of the ruins is a dragon with his paw upon the shield of a red cross the arms of london over her head are represented houses burning and flames breaking out through the windows behind her citizens looking on and some of them lifting up their hands  opposite to these figures is a pavement of stone raised with three or four steps on which appears king charles the second in a roman habit with a truncheon in his right hand and a laurel about his head coming toward the woman in the despairing posture aforesaid and giving orders to two or three others to descend the steps toward her the firit has wings on her head and a crown of naked boys dancing and in her hand something resembling an harp then another figure of one going down the steps following her representing architect showing a scheme or model for rebuilding the city held in the right hand and the lest holding a square and compasses behind these two stands another figure holding up an hat denoting liberty next behind the king is the duke of york holding a garland ready to crown the rising city and a sword lifted up in the other hand to desend her behind this a third figure with and earls coronet on his head a fourth behind all holding a lion with a bridle in his mouth over these figures is represented an house in building and a labourer going up a ladder with an hodd upon his back lastly underneath the stone pavement whereon the king stands is a good figure of envy peeping forth gnawing an heart  an explanation of some of the hard words made use of in the two volumes of
