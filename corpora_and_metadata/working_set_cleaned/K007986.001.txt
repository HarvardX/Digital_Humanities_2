memoirs of the present state of the court and councils of spain  in two parts  with the true reasons why this vast monarchy which in the last century made so considerable a figure in the world is in this so feeble and paralytick  done into english by t brown  utile dulci london printed for d brown without temple bar t horn at the royal exchange t bennet in st pauls churchyard and b took in fleet street   0   to his honest friend mr william pate of london woollendraper i know no occasion wherein all sorts of people have taken greater liberty than in their dedications both in regard of the persons to whom the complement is made and of the things that are usually said in them all authors pretend to disclaim flattery upon these subjects and yet were historians to draw great men according as they are represented in dedications abundance of persons would pass with posterity for men of wit who never made a jest in their lives and for honest patriots who were only mere fripons at the bottom but tho most authors are agreed to wheedle and flatter in their dedications yet i see they are not so well agreed in the choice of their patron some have chose whole corporations or societies for this office and indeed this conduct would be politic enough if the parties who are concerned in the dedication were obliged to espouse the authors quarrel others have gone a step further and dedicated their books to the respective countries where they live and lastly some of a more universal spirit have offered them to the whole world in general without any restrictions or limitations as it consists of the four known parts europe asia africa and america and comprehends persons of all sorts and characters those that can read as well as those that cannot and those that have a religion as well as those that have none at all but the generality of writers decline this course of dedication because bodies politic and countries and the world it self as large as it is seldom reward the author for as we say what is every mans business is no mans business and therefore they generally make choice of particular persons and those for the greatest part of the best estates and fortunes not because an illustrious name gives any better protection to a book than a meaner would do although this is always pretended but because such persons are best able to reward an author and consider him for his incense as i never knew a bad book sell a farthing the better for having a gaudy title prefixed to it so a good one never fared the worse because it appeared without a fine fiocco for in short if the world has a mind to be censorious a person of qualitys name is as feeble an amulet against the critics as a silver horseshoe nailed upon a threshold would be against witchery and possession for i am of opinion that an horseshoe made of iron is full as powerful a preservative as the other now i  two reasons mr pate to address the following translation to your self the first is because you are my friend with whose entertaining learned conversation i have been often diverted and the next is because i can approach you without any of that cerem and fine which uses to embarras a young author so much when he addresses himself to quality  as he is obliged to say several things against his consence so he cannot assume that familiarity and ness which makes all sorts of discourses agreeable however i would not have you think that i am so unreasonable as to desire you to stand surety or what in a few years will become a scandalous word with us godfather to my translation because i am sensible there are several faults in it nor to stand up for the author of this epistle for then you must resolve to combat all comers and geers all i require of you is that if any of your acquaintance should enquire either after the book or the translator you would only tell them that the book gives a good account of a certain princes court who at this present writing is gazed at by all europe and that the translator is a very honest fellow who between a little french and less latin makes a shift to get a sorry livelihood  i have been often reproached and particularly by your self for sitting idle a whole year and writing nothing of my own now tho i must confess a certain party amongst us has given us almost daily provocations to encounter them yet i find they are a generation that are never to be edified by satyr and indeed all wholesome advice is effectually lost upon them suppose you or i should tell honest mr partridge yonder of covent garden that it was not civilly done of him to leave the thirtieth of january good friday and the twenty ninth of may all at a clap cut of his almanac and that john gadbury and he may now shake hands together like a couple of bigoted rascals as they are perhaps another year as who knows how far a turbulent reformers zeal may carry him he will leave us never an apostle in the calendar to the utter confusion of the poor people in the country who make no other use of the apostles but only to direct them to the next horserace or fair to say the truth we have too many ridiculous follies and divisions amongst us ever to be cured by writing which puts me in mind of what mr burgess who has made all the town merry with his preaching said lately upon this argument we englishmen cries he have been famous in all ages for our wars and jars and strife and life and so forth why what do you think virgil said of you sixteen hundred years ago even penitus toto divises orb britannos i e the britains are the most divided people in the whole world thus you see mr pate what little encouragement a man has to write since it is so unlikely that he should ever cure any of those distempers that are so in inveterate in our climate but i have a more particular reason still behind which obliges me to sit a spectator and purely respects my self for as i have had the ill luck to displease the moderate party by attacking the merits of the comprehension in my dialogue so i have fallen under the indignation of the critics by being too profuse and lavish of my similies as for the first i have nothing to say to them because they are a sort of gentlemen to whom i never designed to make my court and as for the last before i go about to justify my self i will tell you a short story i happened some years ago to make a visit to an honest decayed old captain in alsatia and his chamber was a perfect wilderness pipes and napkins and ends of candles and old cloaks were jumbled all together but what was most remarkable a loaf and a cheese lay upon his closesteel i asked him the reason of it and the captain honestly told me that he did it only for want of  and this mr pate was my own case exactly for there were several persons in the world for whom i had a kindness and these for want of a better convenience i was often sorced to throw into a simile and to say the truth some of them were such sad wretches that they did not deserve to have a paragraph bestowed upon them  but now to speak a word or two in behalf of these memoirs i am in good hopes they will be favorable ved because they give us a true idea of the spanish court with which the generality of men amongst us are utterly unacquainted and lastly because they pvide an agreeable entertainment to all sorts of people for here is rain and sunshine and earthquakes and shows and masquerades and processions and the lord knows how much history in sippits to divert the lous admirers stow and hoenshead and then for persons of better palates here are abundance of political reflections and judicious observations with the true reasons how this vast monarchy which in the last century made so considerable a figure in the world is in this become so feeble and paralytic i will only take notice of one instance among the rest to give you a true taste of this authors ingenuity don juan while the administration of affairs was lodged in his hands removed a poor dominican from salamanca which place you know a certain doctor who pretends he has received more stripes on his back than st paul and all his brethren did has made remarkable in story by the chimerical degree he took there and made him the kings confessor he thought by this means to have secured the monk for ever to his own interests and to have had a trusty confident upon all occasions near his majestys person but he found himself mightily mistaken in his expectation for this beast of a religious soon abandoned his patrons party and herded amongst his professed enemies some people says this author pretend that he did it out of a principle of conscience but as for my self i am of another opinion it is impossible that ingratitude should ever flow from any good principle i am sorry that this honest doctrine is not in better reputation with some people amongst us for i am satisfied that no pretense whatever can atone for so black and ungenerous a sin as ingratitude is  i should here according to the laudable custom of all authors take occasion to say something in your praise but besides that i will not offer that violence to your modesty i cannot handsomely commend you for so great a variety of learning in so much youth but at the expense of the city and you know i have too great a respect for our honorable metropolis to do any thing of that nature or indeed without a reproach to our selves who cannot pretend such excuses as the perpetual distractions of trade and business indeed if your good fortune in the world prove answerable to your merits you may for all i know dye a richer man than gresham or sutton but i must tell you my dear friend that good fortune and merit are two as different things as any are in the world i knew a gentleman who made a pleasant remark upon this occasion i have said he in my time laid out for two things viz preferment and a red nose with as much zeal and applicaiton as any man in town to attain the last i have dutifully drank my gallon of claret every night and a dull sober sot a neighbor of mine with his single penurious pint has arrived to it before me and as for the former i have wearied out my patience in waiting at court and at noblemens levees and yet could never stumble upon any and so he concluded that several men come by preferment and red noses who never deserved either of them  after all mr pate if my wishes will do you any good i wish you store of customers but never a poet or courtier or disbanded captain or player amongst them all may i be so fortunate as to behold you advanced to the highest pinnacle of honor in the city to furnish new matter for elkanah settles triumphs of london to sentence light butter and bread on horseback to terrify sabbath breakers and those that forget to hang out their lights to appear in the next edition of baker or stow and arrive to the privilege of sleeping in your gold chain at guildhall chapel in short may you be the wealthiest happiest man within the bills of mortality and may you ever continue to love  your friend and servant t brown  an account of the court of spain we must not expect to find in a general history those particular relations of things that usually entertain the reader better than the history it self but when any person is once acquainted with them he often reflects upon them with a great deal of pleasure i imagine i may without any flattery pretend my self capable of writing several secret passages that happened at madrid from the year      to the year      however i think it not amiss to begin these memoirs from the time of philip the iv in order to render the following discourse more intelligible and to give the reader a better idea of the genius of the spanish court  elizabeth of france his queen being dead he esponsed mary ann of austria daughter of the emperor ferdinand and sister of him that reigns at present she was young of a fair flaxen complexion her humor was lively and pleasant and she was no less agreeable than witty  she departed from vienna in order to go to spain in the year      she loved the archduke her brother very affectionately and as both of them were weeping when they took their leave of one another she demanded of him what lay in her power to do for his service my dear sister says he it lies in your power to have an infanta there which you may give to me in marriage this accident is so much the more observable because the archduke having at that time an elder brother who died afterward king of the romans and being himself designed for the ecclesiastic state there was little probability that he should ever arrive to the empire and marry as it since fell out the eldest daughter of the queen his sister  amongst several other persons whom the emperor gave the queen his daughter to accompany her into spain he chose father john evrard nitard a german jesuit to be her confessor his extraction was mean and obscure and he employed almost all his thoughts in the advancing of his fortune he was of a supple complaisant temper he exactly studied the respective characters of those persons to whom he belonged and took care never to differ much from them as to matters of opinion he finished his studies in the jesuits college at vienna and there took upon him the habit of his order and afterward was sent to govern one of their seminaries in which office he acquitted himself very well when he came back again to vienna he began to make himself known in the world and several ladies of the court desired him to be their spiritual director they omitted no opportunity to do him all the good offices they could with the emperor and in fine spoke in such advantageous terms of him that he was well enough contented to let the queen take him along with her  this princess was extremely surprised at all the spanish customs which those who came to wait upon her from the king caused her to observe in the first days of her voyage i have been told that as she arrived to a certain city under the dominion of the king of spain where the principal commodities of the place consisted in frocks wastcoats and silk stockings they made her a present of a great quantity of them of different colors but her major domo who religiously observed the spanish gravity despised the present and so taking up a bundle of silk stockings threw them at the heads of the deputies of the town  aveis de saber says he to them in a very furious tone que las reynas de espagna no teinen piernas that is to say  i would have ye to know that the queens of spain have no legs meaning that they are so far elevated above others by virtue of their rank that they have no feet to touch the ground like the rest of their sex however it was the young queen who was not as yet acquainted with the niceties of the spanish language took it in the literal sense and began to weep saying that she was fully determined to go back to vienna and if she had known before her departure from thence that they designed to cut off her legs she would rather have died than stirred a foot  it was no difficult matter to assure her of the contrary and she continued her voyage  when she came to madrid they told the king of this innocent simplicity of his queen he was so mightily pleased at the story that he vouchsafed to laugh a little at it and this was the most extraordinary thing in the world for him to do for whether it proceeded from affectation or was the effect of his constitution it was observed of him that he never laughed above thrice in all his life  the king showed a great respect for father nitard because he was the queens confessor who reposed an entire confidence in him but whatever desires she had to see him advanced he left him peaceably in his post without conferring any other dignities upon him and he had unquestionably continued a long time in the same condition if the king had not happened to die  when that prince found himself to be dangerously ill and saw he could not bequeath the care of his kingdoms to cardinal sandoval upon whose management of affairs he always depended because he was at that time extremely sick and to say the truth died but  0 hours after him he made his will wherein he ordered that the queen his spouse should be regent of the kingdom and governess of the young prince who was then four years and an half old since the time of don loys de haro the kings of spain have had no privado or chief minister the duke di medina de las torres had the management of the northern adairs and the count de castrillo of the rest he named the cardinal of arragon archbishop of toledo and inquisitor general the count of castrillo president of castile the count de penarauda don cristoval crespi chancellor of arragon and the marquess daytona to the end that these six ministers should assist the queen in her councils and thus the king died in the month of september      the six ministers that composed the junta were those that were or should be archbishop of toledo the president of castile vice chancellor of arragon and inquisitor general and besides these a grandee of spain and a counselor of state   the queen resented the great loss she sustained with abundance of sorrow but she had been still more sensible of it if she had found her self in the condition of the other queens of spain who are obliged to enter into a convent when they are widows unless the king orders the contrary before his decease nor was she insensible of the sweets of governing the first use she made of her authority was in favor of father nitard for don pascal of arragon having been made archbishop of toledo and grand inquisitor in the place of cardinal sandoval the queen sent for him and by her repeated importunities prevailed with him to quit the last of these two dignities the cardinal of arragon being grand inquisitor and afterward named to the archbishopric of toledo quitted the post of grand inquisitor because he could not have two places in the junto he could not be brought to comply with this request without a great deal of trouble for he almost chose rather to be inquisitor general than archbishop of toledo although that archbishopric is worth     thousand crowns per annum  but he was not able to refuse the queen a thing she so passionately desired who as soon as she saw her self in a capacity to dispose of that important charge bestowed it upon her consessor  as she engaged her self in this affair of her own proper inclination without consulting any thing else but the desire she had to see him made superior to the other ministers so she took occasion to discourse of it to them who immediately began to murmur amongst themselves  they read over the will of the late king where they found it expressly ordered that the queen should do nothing without consulting their advice and notwithstanding all this precaution of the deceased they saw with no little concern that she had without ever communicating the matter to them disposed of one of the most considerable offices in the kingdom and that to a mere stranger who had been born and bred up in the although it is very true that he had been formerly a lutheran and it was objected to him yet he vehemently deed it because it might have made him incapable of that office lutheran religion till he was    years of age the desire they had to preserve their own authority and the jealousy which is natural for all men to have of a favorite made them speak very fiercely in the matter however the queen being informed of their discontent took the true measures to appease them the charming manner of her deportment and particularly the obliging things she spoke to them upon this occasion prevailed with them to lay aside their murmurs so they agreed to dispatch letters of naturalization for the confessor without which it was impossible for him to execute the office the queen had given him  although all those difficulties that at first threatened to hinder the elevation of father nitard were removed without any great trouble yet he did not fail to raise several secret enemies upon himself who envied his growing fortune they beheld with great disdain and impatience the extraordinary confidence that the queen reposed in him for she determined nothing without advising with him and so great was his credit and interest with her that he durst offer to resolve things of the greatest importance without speaking a word about them to the queen  don juan was one of those that was the most offended at the advancement of father nitard he was sensible that they would turn him out of all by little and little upon this score he gave way entirely to the father confessor whom the q had made counselor of state he then retired to consuegra the ordinary residence of the grand prior of castile of the order of malta and said very imperiously that after he had seen himself president of the privy council of the king his father he could never endure a companion that was so much his inferior but the queen who was wholly busied in advancing her chief minister never disquieted her self with thinking what reflections people might make upon him so that without taking the least notice of don juans discontent she suffered him to depart and he continued a long time without visiting the court until the queen sent him particular orders at aranjues whither he was gone to divert himself to come immediately for madrid upon some important affairs which she was willing to communicate to him  he was the natural son of king philip iv and a certain actress whose name was maria calderona he was privately brought up at ocana near madrid and of all the natural sons that king had he only acknowledged him whether it were because he loved his mother better than any of his other mistresses and to say the truth she was the most charming person in the world or because count dolivarez procured this good fortune for him for it is commonly given out that the count had a son named don julian de gusman whom he had a mind to own and therefore used this artifice of persuading the king to begin with don juan that so he might follow his example  whatever the matter was philip loved this young prince very tenderly although some people suspected he was the son of the duke of medina of the house of gusman who had formerly been passionately in love with the young calderona and was in his time the most accomplished handsome cavalier in spain and don juan very much resembled him but if some persons were of this opinion others could never believe it especially when they considered the great kindness and fatherly affection that the king had for him and besides reflected upon his extraordinary good qualities which declared him to be worthy to be the son of so great a monarch he was brave even to a contempt of all dangers whatever gallant and agreeable wellshaped obliging liberal and a person of great honor he had abundance of wit and was master of a genius that extended it self to all arts and sciences as there is never a court in europe where natural sons are treated with such advantageous distinctions as they are in spain so this prince could scarce perceive that the unhappiness of his birth did in the least prejudice his advancement and it is indeed a certain truth that we see in this country the legitimate sons bred up with those that are not so in the same fathers house without any distinction between one and the other but this custom is not altogether observed with relation to the natural sons of the kings of spain for example they never bestow the title of infant upon them and don juan who passionately desired to have it used his utmost efforts to accomplish it but had not the fortune to succeed in his designs  from the year      the king had given him the government of the low countries he held as his proper right the government of the low countries of burgundy and charolois and he always enjoyed it excepting the time when the archduke leopold governed there  don juan contributed very much toward the reducing the kingdom of naples to the spanish obedience he took piombino and portolongone and in all his campaigns he perform d a world of actions that equally testified his bravery and conduct  the king his father having conceived no less an esteem than tenderness for him communicated to him the most weighty affairs of state and chose him to be chief of an assembly of the chief ministers of his kingdom  he was scarcely arrived at madrid but a council was held where he came to be informed that the king of france was resolved to espouse the interests of his queen to whom brabant and some other states of the low countries escheated by right of devolution upon the death of the infant don balthazar her brother that his most christian majesty had published a manifesto wherein he proved the justice of his claim and that not thinking himself obliged to consume any time in unprofitable contestations he had turned his arms toward that side of the country that he had marched his troops with incredible diligence and made considerable conquests as soon as ever he appeared upon a serious examination of the present state of the monarchy they were convinced that it was impossible at the same time to maintain war against france and portugal and that it was necessary for them to lay hold of a certain conjuncture that made a very plausible appearance that don alphonso king of portugal having by his extravagant conduct lost the hearts of his people was dispossessed of the government and his subjects freed from the allegiance they owed him that the infanta don pedro his brother had taken upon him the administration of affairs that things of this considerable importance could neither be begun nor ended without some disturbance during which they must have occasion for their own troops and therefore if it was judged expedient they should lay hold of this opportunity to advance proposals for a peace  after every one had delivered his own opinion of the matter the queen came to this conclusion a letter was dispatched to the marquess de liche who was at that time prisoner of war at lisbon wherein he had all necessary instructions given him in fine he managed the affair so dexterously that the regent don pedro listened favorably to the proposals and so a treaty of peace was concluded on the   th of jan       this news was entertained at madrid with a great deal of satisfaction because the affairs of flanders grew every day worse and worse and it was necessary to take some speedy measures to preserve it or else to abandon it for good and all new levies of soldiers were ordered in gallicia and elsewhere and the queen cast her eyes upon don juan to send him thither to command the troops for besides that no body was more capable of so great a trust than he was she had observed that during the little stay he made at madrid his aversion to f nitard daily increased and this reason alone was sufficient to incline her to resolve upon his removal she was not able to endure those biting reflections which don juan by way of raillery very liberally bestowed upon the father confessor one time among the rest when the ministers demanded of him who was fit to send against the king of france i am clearly of opinion says he that we had best send father nitard he is a saint to whom heaven can refuse nothing the post wherein we behold him at present is an undeniable proof of those miracles which he can command upon all occasions  the confessor answered with a very melancholy air that he was of a profession which taught him to hope every thing from the divine mercy but that it did not belong to his function to be a general of an army oh my dear father replies don juan and dont we see your reverence every day employed in things that are full as unsuitable to your profession  as i said before it was resolved to send the prince with the new supplies to flanders and a recruit of nine hundred thousand crowns with which they furnished him out of the silver that was brought in the gallions  necessary orders were likewise dispatched to cales and so the admiral who had charge given of this sum set sail with eight vessels from thence at the same time when don juan was marching toward the groyne where the rendezvous was appointed to be  the french fleet cruised upon the coasts of gallicia and was composed of    vessels and   fireships don juan finding his forces much inferior to the enemy was not willing to hazard all in a fight where in all probability he could not avoid a total defeat therefore he thought it more advised to send his troops in small bodies to flanders where they arrived without any danger  the formidable power of his most christian majesty not only alarmed the spaniard but the english and dutch who after a bloody war at fast concluded a peace at breda in      and having ceast from all acts of hostility toward one another entered into a league in the beginning of      to oblige the king of spain to accept of one of the two alternatives proposed by the king of france who still persisted in his offers  after their example the archbishop of triers the duke of bavaria the elector palatino and duke ernest augustus of brunswick bishop of osnabruck concerted their resolutions for the common safety and made a league whereby they obliged themselves to endeavor the adjusting the differences between france and spain or else to declare war against either of the two crowns that should refuse their mediation and act against the treaty the pope likewise entered into the league and a peace was concluded at aix la chapelle  but these things were not so speedily determined but that other matters of consequence happened at madrid and other places which strangely perplexed those persons that were interested and concerned in them don juan as was before mentioned was at corogne upon the point of imbarquing himself when he received certain informations of the death of joseph mallades a gentleman of arragon whom he entirely loved it was told him to his unexpressible amazement that he had been secretly arrested at madrid about eleven a clock at night and that by an order of the queen written by her own hand he was strangled two hours after the great care they took to keep this execution private only contributed to make it spread the faster and it was not doubted but that the queen sacrificed this unfortunate gentleman to the security of her confessor  don juan was extremely concerned at the tragical death of a person whom he loved so well and yet more enraged at the injury which he imagined himself to have directly received from father nitard resolved not to go to flanders they would never have exposed me to the puisance of the most christian king says he to don diego de valasco for whom he had an extraordinary affection but only with a design to complete my ruin they will certainly take care to keep back those succors from time to time of which i shall stand in need and whatsoever good conduct i may use in the management of the war there is no question to be made but that they will make me answerable for all the ill success we meet with you see i am now at the port and yet they have executed a man who was guilty of no other crime than of wearing the character of my friend what will they do then if i were once in flanders all my friends would undoubtedly find themselves exposed to the malice and hatred of the new favorite  he scarched the most plausible pretenses he could think of toexcuse his going for flanders for some days he feigned himself to be indisposed and sent word to the queen that he was troubled with a defluxion on his breast that the physicians had made him apprehend the fatal consequences of it if he undertook so long a voyage and therefore he beseeched her to dispense with him an alteration so little expected made a great noise at court and gave no small mortification to her majesty and father nitard they easily guessed at the cause and if they had imagined the prince was no farther off perhaps they had not sentenced malladas to die so soon the queen ordered don juan to resign his employ to the constable of castile who was to go to flanders in his room and also commanded him to go immediately to consuegra without presuming to come nearer than  0 leagues of madrid which he accordingly obeyed but it seems this obedience was not enough to satisfy the queens indignation who was so exasperated at him that in august      she carried into the council with her own hands a decree against the prince wherein she represented to them the disobedience he had shown at so pressing a juncture and the reasons which ought to have obliged him to set sail although the indisposition he pretended had been really true that a lie from a subject to his sovereign was always thought worthy of the highest punishments and especially under such important circumstances  don juan was informed of all that this decree contained against him and he was the more sensibly concerned at this ill usage since he had trespassed so much upon moderation in not making a louder complaint of the death of malladas  the man that served altogether to estrange his inclinations from the queen was a captain whose name was don petro de pinilla who having asked leave to speak with the queen threw himself at her feet and entertained her an hour in private without any bodies knowing what he said to her it is not doubted by what happened afterward but that he discovered something of importance against don bernardo pategno brother to don juans chief secretary because he was seized the next morning with   of his servants these informations were kept so secret that no one knew the matters they contained the marquess de salinas captain of the spanish guards received orders from the queen to post away with fifty of the reformed officers and arrest the prince at consuegra but although he used the utmost diligence in this affair yet he was not able to find him that as it happened did not prove unlucky to him for don juan had about him at that time a great number of his friends and domestics who would all have hazarded their lives to preserve him from being taken but by his great prudence he avoided the exposing any single man of them for being advertised of what had passed he withdrew in time and only left a letter behind him to the queen dated october    wherein he spoke to her with greater liberty than he had hitherto used he there takes an occasion to acquaint her that he would have certainly gone for flanders if it had not been for the surprising and tragical death of his friend malladas that he had all the reason in the world to believe that father nitard was the instrument and author of it that so horrid an injustice cried out aloud for vengeance against the man that had committed it that he found himself possessed with an earnest desire to contribute what lay in his power toward the removal of so wicked a man that he humbly beseeched her both for the good of the kingdom in general as also for her majestys glory to consent to his banishment that he hoped he should never be constrained to have recourse to any other methods than those of prayer to chase him out of that place where his presence was become odious to all the world that he found himself obliged to go and seek a sanctuary against the violences of this stranger and that this was a cruel necessity for a person of his quality that he hoped her majesty would be pleased to make serious reflections upon the whole and apply necessary remedies accordingly  the reading of this letter awakened all the resentment and indignation that the queen had naturally to don juan she flew into the greatest passion imaginable and had made it appear in a terrible manner if the grandees and people had not testified less inclination for her i was a new subject of displeasure to the queen and father nitard to see that all the world agreed to set themselves free from his ministry and that they had the hardiness to tax him publicly with the murder of malladas and the imprisonment of patigno  this obliged the queen to set forth a declaration wherein she assured the world that both those persons came to madrid to execute the wicked designs of don juan that she was fully informed of the whole by their own proper confession and that she had never proceeded so far as to take away malladass life if she had not been assured of his crime  at the same time father nitard printed and published a sort of an apology in which he accuses don juan with having frequently endeavored to assassinate him he spoke of this design as a thing beyond contest and declared his own innocence with relation to the death of malladas and the imprisonment of patigno he pretended to give an undeniable proof of this assertion in alleging that when the former was strangled he was saying over his breviary along with friar bustos and that when the second was arrested he was setting his papers in order in his cabinet then he took occasion to enlarge upon the nobleness of his birth and upon the considerable services which his ancestors had done for the emperors this article only served to set people on work to examine the obscurity of his family he addressed this writing to the queen and she for her part forgot nothing that might make his attestation be the better believed  some time after she presented to the council a second complaint against the prince charging him with having had his nativity calculated in flanders in which twas easy to discover the high and mighty expectations with which he fed his ambition that such an insufferable curiosity had been always punished as a crime of high treason that it was not only necessary to examine the fault but also the quality of the person that committed it that the debate was about a man of design who could by no means pretend to sin out of ignorance and an ungrateful rebellious subject loaded with favors and rewards by the crown that it was absolutely requisite to chastise him for fear lest a connivance should authorize his wicked designs and put him in a capacity of accomplishing them  the prince had too many friends not to find some amongst them who had the courage to defend him there was scarce any thing to be seen in all manner of company but multitude of writings the bitterness of which only served to animate the interested parties and make them more inveterate  those that appeared in behalf of don juan maintained that he was incapable of forming so mean and low a design as that of assassinating father nitard that if it had ever entered into his imagination the execution of it could have been no difficult matter that the difference was only about a stranger of an ecclesiastic without friends or relations supported by a queen who ought to have abandoned him to vengeance when she was informed of his wicked conduct that the best proof one can bring to show that the prince had no inclination to do any such thing was because it was not done that far from endeavoring to take him off privately he had demanded in public to have him removed from his ministry and that for attempting his removal he exposed himself to all the indignation of the queen that at the bottom father nitard would have no reason to complain of his ill usage since he was permitted to retire with the punishment only of a pension of  0000 crowns per annum which he has hitherto enjoyed besides some other private benevolences that dont appear that so considerable a revenue one would think might content the ambition of a simple ecclesiastic who was himself of so vindicative a nature that he would fain have assassinated the prince at barcelona and consuegra that it was not the effect of any particular resentment which made don juan press the queen so earnestly to send him home to his own country being generous enough to forget any private injuries but that he was too good a subject to bear any longer with a man whose rash and violent counsels might some time or other prove the occasion of a general revolution in the kingdom of spain to this they added several other things which i shall pass over in silence  the court and the city were divided upon this point every one engaging himself in the affair either as his own sentiments led him or as he was influenced by the reports of others nay the court ladies entered into the quarrel and for a distinction of the party they embraced some were called austrians and others nitardines  thus i have given you a relation of what past at madrid during the time that don juan kept himself at a distance from it and approached to barcelona the queen was ignorant what way he took and her disquietudes doubled upon her when she considered with her self what dangerous effects an affair of this nature might carry along with it especially seeing it began with so much heat when he was arrived there he writ a very respectful letter to the queen but did not conceal the resolution he had taken to demand of her constantly the removal of her confessor he advised her to it with very forcible reasons but they only provoked her the more against him and she could never suffer her self to be persuaded that she ought to deprive her self of the man in whom she reposed so entire a coce and for whom she preserved so great an affection she found that don juan meddled with an affair she had no inclination to and that since the council which the late king had assigned her could find nothing to except against the fathers conduct she was not obliged to gratify an aversion which the prince had so unjustly entertained against him that it would be for her glory to testify to the world the firmness of her mind in this rencounter and that if she abandoned her servants at the first chimerical objections that were raised against them it would be a dangerous matter for any one to serve her in fine the extreme desire she had to keep father nitard with her furnished her with such specious reasons that no body durst combat them  the father on his part knew not where to turn himself he was pleased without question to see himself beloved and protected by so great a queen and to enjoy an absolute power next to her but on the other hand he was not without sensible emotions when he considered what an enemy he had to deal with he was apprehensive of being poisoned or assassinated and tho the council had not as yet spoken against him yet he was not ignorant that he was but ill beloved by all the ministers and that if ever it was his fortune to be turned out the greatest part of the grandees would commend the courage and constancy of don juan these reflections so palled his spirits that he often went and threw himself at her majestys feet with tears in his eyes humbly to beg the favor of her to suffer him to depart but she always assured him of the continuance of her protection and forbad him any more to mention that thing which gave her so much pain and uneasiness  the prince did not content himself w writing to the queen but writ also to the chief ministers in such vehement terms that they evidently saw what it was he desired to do with the father confessor and likewise that he would never depart from his resolutions he prayed them to second him with her majesty and to represent to her of what a mighty consequence it would be to the state to send this stranger home  these letters mightily augmented the troubles of f nitard his friends were afraid that don juan would betake himself to violent methods and his enemies had the satisfaction to consider that the prince would employ his utmost efforts to turn him out of spain but those that beheld the whole scene calmly and without passion judged that the queens obstinacy and the opiniatrete of don juan would necessarily involve the kingdom in some great disorders where every thing would be equally confounded the queen fell into the greatest passion imaginable whenever the matter was mentioned to her and finding her person to be no where else in safety she ordered the cavalry to come to pardo which is a royal palace within two leagues of madrid  it is certain that if she had had less fears upon her she had at that moment declared don juan rebel she communicated this design to her father confessor who approved of this way of procedure well enough but others that were consulted about it opposed it with all their might they represented to her that in case this was done the prince would no longer observe any measures with her that perhaps he waited for a favorable pretense to declare himself that he was brave in his own person well beloved by his friends and besides had the people on his side that less causes have occasioned great revolutions that there was nothing left but good usage and gentleness that could make him return to his duty or at least convince him that nothing had been omitted to inspire him with a true sense of it although this advice was extremely opposite to the queens resentments and by her good will she would never have treated with a prince by whom she supposed her self to be injured yet she was at last persuaded to follow this good counsel so she wrote a very obliging letter to him wherein she conjured him to return to corsuegra and she engaged her royal word for the security of his person  don juan made some difficulty at first of obeying these orders whether it were because he was apprehensive as he told the queen of putting himself into the hands of father nitard whom he had but lately escaped or for some other reasons that are unknown but the duke dossore who was then at barcelona spoke to him with so much zeal and so vigorously solicited him to obey her majestys orders that he submitted to his reasons and so departed with three companies of horse which the duke had given him for his guard  the queen having received advice of it contrived to give him some affronts upon the road she knew that he was to pass through arragon and therefore she writ to the states of that kingdom to show don juan no manner of respect nay even to seek out some opportunities to disgust him but herein she was ill obeyed the states sent her word back again that they could not dispense with themselves from paying to the son of the late king and the brother of their present monarch those devoirs that were due to his quality and merits to say the truth they acquitted themselves herein with the greatest zeal and when he approached saragossa all the inhabitants went out above two leagues to meet him on the way the press was so great that he had much ado to get through it they cried all with one voice let the king live and the lord don juan let him always have the better of his enemies ana curses light on the jesuit that perssecutes him  every one scattered flowers before him such as the season of the year furnished them with and sprinkled him with perfumed waters the ladies better apparelled than they used to be on the most solemn days made a double lane for him with their coaches the air was filled with nothing but the benedictions and praises they bestowed upon him in a word the joy was universal in this great city  the queen and father confessor who received a faithful relation of the whole proceedings were sensibly concerned she to see the contempt wherewith her orders were entertained he to find himself so inveterately hated by the people  the report of don juans extraordinary reception spread it self as far as madrid and amongst several persons that received it with joy and satisfaction there were many that apprehended some disorder at the return of the prince  in order to prevent those evils that seemed to threaten them the regidors and other magistrates of that city assembled on the first of february they sent four of their body to the president of castile to represent to him the great mischief that might be occasioned by don juans arrival with his troops at a time when the court was so weak and the people so insolent and disposed for a revolt that notwithstanding the prince was well affectioned toward them yet he would not be able to prevent the lamentable effects they had reason to fear  the president waited upon the queen and the council immediately met where it was ordered to dispatch a courier to don juan with her majestys orders to send back his guards without delay  he received the order but hastened his march making the courier follow him two days on the third he gave him a receipt for his order and sent him back without any answer  in the mean time that he delayed the couriers coming back they were alarmed at court with the ill success of his voyage and their uneasiness was much increased in the palace when they saw him sent back without any letter some of the lords went thereupon to find out the president to desire him to tell the queen that they were ready to undertake any thing in the world for her service the cavalry was drawn up together and preparations were making at madrid to sustain a siege the event whereof appeared very doubtful although they had to deal with a prince who was only attended by  00 horse  twas in effect this guard that occasioned the greatest trouble the queen ordered the marquess de penalva to assemble the reformed officers together with those that should offer themselves to go upon this occasion and tell the prince that her majesty ordered him to send back the three troops of horse he had brought along with him  the marquess de penalva was disposed to obey but he demanded an order of the council royal and the secretary of state refused to expedite it alleging that the queen could do nothing without the council of the government and that she had never consulted them about this affair the queen being provoked sent the secretary word that he ought seriously to consider what difficulties he was going to start at so ill an exigence and how little they were to the purpose the cardinal arragon the count de penarauda and the vice chancellor came to wait upon her majesty they represented to her that the secretary was in the right and gave the president of castile a severe reprimand for giving way by his counsels to an order that might have produced very evil consequences  they resolved at last not to take up arms and to dissipate the apprehensions the people were under at madrid twas publicly proclaimed that don juan had sent back his guards or that if he had not done it as yet yet he would send them back at the first warning  the queen having no hopes at all of seeing her self obeyed by force betook her self to more gentle methods to try if she could by that conduct oblige don juan to send back his soldiers she writ to him by don diego de velasco who was his great confident and the letter was very courteous and civil  the prince who came secretly to madrid to discover the state of affairs the dispositions of his friends and what he might be able to effect there very resolutely sent the queen word again that there lay no obligation upon him to expose himself to the revenge of father nitard therefore he positively demanded to have him turned out of the kingdom that after this were once done none of all her subjects should pay a more dutiful submission to her orders than himself  this was to demand a thing of the queen which she had no manner of inclination to grant the nuncio borromee the council of state and the grandees gave themselves a great deal of trouble to no purpose to adjust the matter in the mean time the prince appeared so firm in his resolution that all the world judged it would be very happy for the confessor if he could escape with his life he himself was sensible enough of the danger he was in so he redoubled his importunities with the queen to suffer him to depart she returned him no answer but by her tears and sighs insomuch that he chose rather to expose his own life to the utmost extremity than disoblige her by leaving her service  news arrived that the prince was come with his troops to torrejondardos which is but four leagues from madrid those that were of the queens party were mightily disquieted at it and she her self was more afflicted than the rest they heard her several times repeat these words oh heavens this good father will be the first sacrifice  the council of the government met and desired the nuncio to carry don juan the letter the pope had written to him wherein he conjured him to preserve those sentiments of respect and submission for the queen which a subject owed his sovereign  the nuncio went to find him and came back about midnight no body almost in this great city went to bed but attended his return with impatience for they knew the occasion of his journey and the people ran up and down the streets in great bodies asking each other who they were for the news the nuncio brought back with him did not at all please the queen he told her that he had earnestly requested the prince to go to guadalajara or at least to stay where he was a few days that new measures might be taken to satisfy him but that the prince refused both the one and the other and said that if on the monday following the confessor would not go out of the gate he would throw him out at the window and enter madrid on purpose to put it in execution it was afterward known that this negotiation passed after another manner viz that the prince had agreed to let father nitard be with the queen provided she would grant some advantages to him which he proposed but that the nuncio who had no kindness for that father was resolved to break the treaty all to pieces by concealing the favorable inclinations of don juan  father nitard was informed of all that happened he confessed the queen the next morning and afterward threw himself at her feet beseeching her not to expose him to the outrages which he might expect to suffer from an incensed prince that his life was at stake and that there was no other way to preserve it but by submitting to the present necessity the queen answered him with abundance of tears that he should not disquiet himself at all for she would take care to set things to rights again  he was well enough satisfied of her own good will for him but he questioned whether her power answered her inclinations nevertheless he resolved at last that he would be torn in pieces by the people before he would leave madrid without her order so he tarried with her having all the apprehensions upon him that a man who every moment expects his death can be capable of  these affairs came to this upshot at last that on monday the    th of february the great court of the palace was filled with numbers of people of all conditions who in a disorderly manner that was not easy to be suppressed loudly demanded to have the confessor discarded without any more delay that no body was ignorant of what don juan had said to the nuncio that the city would go near to be exposed to plunder and desolation for the sake of a jesuit who was a stranger and had no other merit to recommend him but his pleasing the queen  the duke dinfantado and the marquess de liche seeing such a vast multitude assembled together ran to the queens apartment who was then in bed she had not closed her eyes all night long and had not enjoyed one moment of rest having it seems received some information of what had past one of her ladies whose name was donna eugenia was upon her knees by her to comfort her in these extremities alas said the queen to her what signifies my grandeur and these high titles they give me since i am not allowed the liberty to keep the good man any longer with me upon whom the consolation of my life depends there is never a lady in spain but has the privilege of keeping her chaplain and no body finds fault with it but i am the only woman in the kingdom that is persecuted upon this score and whose confessor must be taken away from her by force  the council sat immediately because the disorder still increased in the city and it was to be feared that it would augment more and more some of the ministers who were in the queens interests were for finding out some expedient to hinder the departure of father nitard but others pretended there was no room left for an accommodation and said that if the business was any longer delayed all would be lost that don juan would soon enter madrid and the friends and enemies would fare alike that their debate at present was only about a poor ecclesiastic whom the people hated even to madness and never mentioned without the bitterest execrations although at the bottom he never deserved them and was an honest man  her majesty happening to be in bed when the duke dinfantado and the marquess de lich demanded to speak with her they could no see her because it is the custom in spain for n body to go into the queens chamber when she is gone to bed so they went to the cava cuela which is a place under ground belonging to the palace where the who is called in spain secretary del despacho univer secretaries of state abide they spoke to don blasco de loyola and would have given him a memoir to deliver to her majesty but the great haste they made in running upto the queens apartment and afterward in hurrying down stairs again to the privy council together with the great ado they made to get in caused several persons that met them to follow after them so that when they entered the chamber where the ministers were assembled to inform themselves of what had past these two lords were not of the junta of the goernment they found a great rabble of people who entered along with them and began to cry out all together deliver us from the jesuit and send him packing  the ministers continued a while surprised and looking upon one another while the rabble renewed their importunities adding at the same time some menaces against those that should offer to stand by the father confessor  without demurring any longer upon the matter they resolved to send don blasco de loyola to wait upon the queen with a decree with which they entrusted him he brought her word that the council had determined that father nitard should depart madrid within three hours warning the order was already drawn and the queen discovered no emotion in reading it she signed it with great steadiness of mind and without shedding one tear but being desirous that her confessors removal should not seem to be extorted by force but that he made an honorable retreat she procured an order of leave to be drawn up in these words  whereas f john everard nitard of the society of jesus my confessor minister of state and inquisitor general has humbly entreated me to give him leave to withdraw himself out of these kingdoms although i am fully satisfied not only of his integrity and his other good qualities but also of the great zeal and application wherewith he has always served the crown yet nevertheless upon the account of his earnest supplications as well as for diverse other important reasons i have given him my permission to go where he pleases and since i desire that this may be done in a manner that is suitable to his merits and dignity i have thought it expedient to give him his choice of going in the quality of ambassador extraordinary either to germany or rome with all the emoluments and advantages that belong to that charge given at madrid the    th of february       as soon as don blasco was gone the queen using no farther violence with her self to keep in her tears shed them very plentifully and casting her self upon the bed with all the grief imaginable cried out incessantly alas alas to what purpose is it to be a queen and regent on the other hand the council commanded the cardinal of arragon and the count de penarauda to go and acquaint father nitard with the order her majesty had signed he who had long expected this tempest seemed not to be surprised at the news but was persuaded by the nuncios importunities not to go to council as he had designed for he told him the people were so highly incensed against him that he would infallibly run the risque of being torn to pieces if he offered to show himself  the superiors of the jesuits were come to wait upon him to prepare him for this fatal stroke the admiral of castile came thither also telling him with great fierceness and the freedom of conversation that so peculiarly distinguishes persons of quality from others that he had drawn all these misfortunes upon himself by his own ill measures which he there particularly enumerated to him the father who had been never accustomed to these reprimands replied that this discourse was not fit for an inquisitor general to hear before all the world  when the cardinal of arragon arrived he found the father extremely afflicted the necessity of parting immediately without so much as taking leave of the queen his mistress touched him to the quick the cardinal was not able to refrain tears at beholding it whether from a consideration of the incertainty of humane affairs that have no sure foundation or else from the particular esteem he always had for him he offered to furnish him with a thousand pistols for his voyage and the count de penarauda with letters of exchange for thirty thousand ducats but he would not accept of them saying that as he came thither a poor ecclesiastic so he knew well enough how to depart from thence under the same circumstances  the cardinal comforted him as well as he was able and told him that he would accompany him to fuencaral then he withdrew to leave him at liberty to set his own things in order and toward the evening came to take him up in his coach which was well guarded he asked him immediately whether all his things were ready i have no other things replies the father save only my habit and breviary so they departed being accompanied by all the officers of the inquisition as soon as ever the people saw father nitard they fell a crying and throwing stones at him and followed him with curses and imprecations it happened well for him that he was in company with a person of the cardinals dignity for otherwise he had been exposed to the fury of the rabble the grief that so rude a treatment possessed him with obliged him several times to say with tears in his eyes that god had now tried him by throwing him into this furnace of tribulations and that he should be very happy to be found good alloy as he passed through the streets he said to the people who pursued him with contumelious reproaches farewell my children farewell i am going  he was not willing to accept of the embassy to rome although the queen writ a very obliging letter to him at fuencaral and reiterated the offer to him she sent him two thousand pistoles for his voyage to rome some precious stones and an augmentation of two thousand crowns by way of pension when he was gone his domestics found a haircloth and some disciplines in his cabinet  when there was now no longer any fear of displeasing the father confessor by showing respect to don juan every one went to see him at consuegra and testified their zeal for him he wrote to the queen to thank her for sending away his inveterate enemy as well as that of the state and prayed her to give him leave to come to court and kiss the kings hands but instead of granting him that request she ordered him to retire a dozen leagues from madrid he was sensibly touched at this unexpected severity and complained of it as of a sort of banishment nevertheless this did not hinder him from demanding by letters as well to the queen as the council to take the public good into their consideration and fill father nitards places with persons that were capable of discharging them well he represented to them that those dignities ought to be taken from him since it was equally as important a matter to hinder him from coming back again into the kingdom as it was necessary to make him leave it  he demanded also that they should take away the place of president of castile from the bishop of placentia since he was the man that issued out the decree by virtue of which malladas was strangled and that the marquess daytone his capital enemy should no longer have the liberty of passing his judgment in those affairs that concerned him  the queen was very much offended at the manner wherein the prince wrote to her and yet more enraged at what had happened sent him a very unpallatable message and ordered him forthwith to discharge his guards as he had engaged to do  he complained of this to the cardinal of arragon and the nuncio giving them as well as the queen to understand that he could not part with his friends that accompanied him till such time as he was certainly informed that father nitard was out of the kingdom because he had still reason to fear some mischief from that quarter  hereupon the council met and judged it convenient that the cardinal should go to guadalajara to engage the prince to comply with the queens desires he consented to it at last and dismissed his guards after the cardinal had managed a sort of a treaty between that princess and don juan by which she confirmed him in the government of the low countries and passed her word that the father confessor should quit his places that the president of castile and the marquess daytone should not meddle with the cognizance of those things wherein the prince was concerned that as for himself he might settle wherever he thought convenient that they would take particular care to ease the people of their grievances that no body should be admitted to any of the military orders of castile who had not served ten years by land or by sea that the pope should be the depository of the queens word for the security of the prince there were many other articles besides these but not of the same weight and consideration all tending either to the satisfaction of don juan or the ease of the people  he forbore making his usual remonstrances till the month of may at which time he received information that the queen was setting on foot a regiment of guards for the kings service whereof she had made the marquis daytone colonel  he wrote very sharply to her about this matter and represented to her that it was against the custom of the kings of spain to have any other guards but the inhabitants of madrid that this regiment would be an everlasting reproach to the city and would occasion abundance of ill effects which he there enumerated at length it is worth the observing and i could not forbear to take notice of it that in this same letter he complained that the queen did not answer him with her own hand but used that of the cardinal of arragon under pretense that she was troubled with a megrim telling her in plain downright terms that a man of his rank and quality was not able to bear such a contempt the world may learn from this remarkable passage on what grounds the natural sons of the kings of spain pretend to stand  all the courts of judicature as well the chief as the subaltern the body of the city and the people made several remonstrances to the queen to hinder the setting up this regiment in madrid but to no purpose in fine they importuned her so often upon this score that she signed an order by which she prohibited them to speak to her any more about it and so without any more delay she completed the regiment  she afterward commanded don juan under very rigorous penalties to remove from guadalajara he obeyed her orders with a great deal of respect although he was in a condition by the help of his friends that were come to him from arragon and other places to do what he pleased the report ran that he was coming within a little distance of madrid and this gave several persons abundance of uneasy thoughts  to pacify their spirits the queen wrote to him and desired him to repair to arragon in the quality of viceroy and vicar general of the kingdom dependant upon it  this order affected him with a very sensible joy and he took care to testify it by the thanks he returned the queen to whom he writ a very large letter desiring her majesty to consider seriously of the education of the young king in it he represented to her the great consequences of it as being a man that was master of a great deal of wit and honor he wrote likewise to the pope on the   th of june to conjure him to oblige father nitard to quit his offices  in the mean time some of the queens enemies set about a sham decree wherein she gave orders to the council to disarm the people immediately and return their arms into the common hall it was an easy matter to persuade the world that this was her real intention and indeed this pretended innovation so far estranged the peoples hearts from her majesty that they were just upon the point of making an insurrection  this reason joined with the horrible disorders that were committed by the regiment of the scambergues for so the people nicknamed them because they were clad a la francoise and the spaniards copied this mode from m de schomberg this reason i say obliged the council royal to present another remonstrance to the queen wherein they desired her to send these new soldiers to the frontiers but she did not think fit to comply with their requests because she imagined this body of military men would keep the city in awe and subjection  don juan was now at saragossa beloved by the nobility and adored by the people the queen could never forgive him the irreparable injury he did her in forcing her to part with her confessor who made but a sorry figure at rome so that by way of raillery it was frequently said that the queen of spain had so invincible an aversion to the spaniards that she would never consent to the ruin of father nitard till he was naturalized a spaniard  but however she still preserved so great an esteem and affection for him that she employed her utmost endeavors to procure him a cardinals cap for this reason he gave secret orders to the marquess de s romain her ambassador ordinary at rome this soon came to be known at madrid and the news alarmed the people exceedingly every one apprehending that if ever the father confessor was made cardinal he would certainly by those steps come back to spain and they were all persuaded that the queen maintained the regiment of the schombergs for no other end but only to favor this design  the council being really afraid lest the intrigue should succeed bethought themselves of some means to defeat father nitard in his pretensions and for that purpose they dispatched a courier to the marquess de s romain to propose to the pope some other subjects of spain who better deserved the purple the queen made as if she consented to the business but under hand renewed her orders but the ambassador who was no friend at all to the jesuits managed his affairs so prudently that his holiness rejected father nitard and besides obliged him to resign his other places  the general of his order whom he had formerly neglected and who for that reason owed him a great deal of ill will thought he had now an opportunity in the reverse of the fathers fortune to pay the debt so he sent him immediately to one of their houses near rome  he retired thither with a spirit of moderation that was very exemplary and of all his train he kept no one with him but friar bustos his companion behold here a continued series of thunder claps one upon the neck of another this harsh usage appeared so terrible to the poor queen who did not in the least question the success of her negotiation that she fell sick of a tertian ague which continued a long time upon her  it is easy to believe by what i have already related that her resentments became more violent than ever against don juan from her natural disposition she was inclined to make him responsible for every thing that gave her any disquiet and when she saw at the same time the bulls for the charge of inquisitor general arrived at madrid she did not doubt but it was all of the princes doing in fine that place whieh she had seen so deservedly filled by father nitard was possessed by don antonio balladores president of castile and father nitard for his part continued still near rome but subject to all the ill treatment with which the general of his order thought fit to mortify him  the queen was not able to endure that a man who had formerly enjoyed so great a share in her friendship and confidence and who had governed the whole monarchy of spain so absolutely should continue exposed to all the resentments and caprices of his general therefore she employed all the credit she had at rome to place father nitard in another condition  clement ix dying in the month of december      cardinal altieri was chosen pope and took upon him the name of clement x the queen who did not doubt but that this pope would bestow a cap upon her confessor named the father to be ambassador extraordinary of spain at his holinesss court an employment which she had formerly offered him when he departed from madrid and which he was not then willing to accept of she procured leave for him to return to rome and in fine managed this affair with his holiness so successfully that father nitard was created archbishop of edessa she continued to solicit his promotion with a great deal of vigor and application the pope being thus importuned made him cardinal priest in the month of april      and gave him in the month of august following the title of st bartholomew disola and gave him a place in the four congregations  this news filled the queen with a very sensible joy and all those persons who were of her party did not fail to compliment her upon this occasion the new cardinal writ a very obbliging letter to don juan in hopes that this civility would draw another from the prince and that finding by this correspondence a means to reconcile himself to him he would at last consent to his return into spain but he was mightily mistaken in his project for don juan sent him no answer back again cardinal nitard seeing that the prince still continued his a version to him laid aside all hopes of going to madrid till the time of the kings coronation  but since what i have written concerning cardinal nitard has insensibly led me to the time of don fernand de valenzuela i think my self obliged to speak of him  he was originally of the city de ronda in the kingdom of granada and was supposed to be an hidalgo that is to say a gentleman and not a cavallero for they make this difference in spain between a cavalier and a gentleman that the former is descended of an ancient family or at least allied to some illustrious house and pays neither taxes nor tribute whereas the latter is exempt from nothing tho he perhaps has acquired the quality of a gentleman  valenzuela came very young to madrid where the duke de linfantado took him for his page when he went ambassador to rome he was handsome and wellshaped of an agreeable mien had a great deal of wit loved his studies and was naturally a poet the character of his verse was tender and passionate there are several pieces of his to be seen that are composed after fashion and among the rest some comedies which he caused to be represented for the diversion of the queen mother at the time when he first began to have the honor of being in her good graces  the duke de linfantado being returned cut of italy made don fernand knight of st jago it is by this means ordinarily that great persons begin to recompense those of their domestics for whom they have the greatest consideration but he received nothing else but this bare title for the many years service he had waited upon his master because it so happened that the duke died before he did any farther kindness for him  he found himself therefore all at a blow destitute of a protector and so miserably poor that he was obliged to become passeante en corte which is as much as to say a man that lives by his wits to say the truth he was master of very happy talents which put him in a condition to accomplish every thing he undertook so that after he had seriously examined with himself the meanness of his fortune he imagined the best conduct he could use to advance it was to make himself acquainted and known to some persons that were particularly devoted to the interests of the queen he searched out means to effect this design with so continued an application that at last he found access to father nitard he chose him immediately for his patron and indeed could not have pitched upon a better and soon insinuated himself into his favor by his exemplary submission and diligence the father taking notice that he wanted neither address nor wit and besides that he was capable of keeping a secret communicated to him some of his own and afterward entrusted him with those of the queen acquainting him with the resentments she had entertained against don juan of austria he knew very well what advantages to make both of the discovery that was made him and of the favorable disposition of the father confessor and rendered himself so necessary to him that he could not almost be a moment without him this obliged himto give him admission into the palace whether he often came to give him an account of the several things he had entrusted him with  as soon as ever valenzuela was introduced into the palace he lost no time there but improved all his favorable moments to the best advantages he played very well at cards and being informed that amongst the other women that waited upon the queen there was a german lady whose name was donna eugenia in whom her mistress entirely confided he presently resolved to use all means to see her he walked often under her chamber window and being an handsome agreeable young fellow she for her part failed not to take due notice of him  in short they spoke to one another he pleased her at least as well as she pleased him she gave him leave to galantear her for that is the fashionable word with them there when any person devotes himself to the service of any of the courtladies and it is a thing so common among them that although a man is married yet he does not forbear to treat his mistress in public with all those ceremonies that are usually paid to the lady whom they design to marry  donna eugenia did not receive the testimonies that young valenzuela gave her of his passion with the least coldness or indifference and he pursued the point so vigorously and pressed her so earnestly to consent to marry him that she discoursed the queen about it  her majesty had already taken notice of him and he had the good fortune not to displease her so that to tie him the faster to her interests she consented to let him marry her favorite and afterward bestowed a gentleman querrys place upon the new bridegroom about this time the differences between the queen and don juan daily increased and as don fernand was a man of address enough to sound the bottom of any intrigue so he did not omit to do the queen all the useful services that lay in his power she beheld his zeal with a great deal of pleasure and took him so far into her consideration that she daily gave him some fresh assurances of her confidence  father nitard placed all this to his own account and voluntarily contributed to valenzuelas advancement because he looked upon him as his own creature but tho fortune now began to desert and leave him yet she absolutely declared her self in favor of valenzuela about the time when don juan returned from arragon to castile and caused the father confessor to be turned out of spain  valenzuela continued the queens sole favorite without any spy upon him for the prince returned back to saragossa in quality of vicar general of the kingdom of arragon the queen was so extremely perplexed and mortified by the removal of father nitard and her enemies knew so well to make their advantages of it that it was some time before she could tolerably recover herself from the impression that so rude a shock had made upon her but having considered the necessity she lay under to have a faithful person near her whom she might entrust with her most secret affairs she cast her eyes upon valenzuela who for his part still continued very much amazed at the misfortunes of father nitard  one day the queen spoke to donna eugenia to bring her husband with her privately toward the evening because she had a mind to discourse with him alone donna eugenia who wanted neither wit nor ambition was transported with joy to think that valenzuela was going to have such particular conversations with the queen and exactly obeyed the orders she had received  the first time he entered into the queens chamber he was very cautious and fearful for he came armed with a broquel which is a sort of a buckler that they generally carry with them in spain when they go to a place where they apprehend any danger his hair that was very fine and delicate he had tied up in a ribbon knot he had not his golilia on for it is the fashion there to leave them off at night in short he forgot nothing that might render himself charming and agreeable to the queen she appeared in a deshabille that sat much better upon her than the widows habit she wore in the day time which very much resembles that of a religious woman  velanzuela threw himself immediately at her feet and after he had returned her his most humble thanks for the great honor she was now pleased to do him he assured her that his blood his life in a word every thing that lay in his power was so entirely resigned to her service that he had the presumption to believe none of all her subjects was devoted to her majesty after so particular a manner as himself the queen gave credit to his words and after this meeting scarce a night passed over his head but she caused him to come privately to her apartment  his wife always conducted him thither and the queen ordered her to be present all the while to take away all suspicion and umbrage hereit was that he gave her a particular account of every thing he knew and informed her of all the most secret intrigues that were carried on in court or city of the designs of don juan of those lords that were of the princes faction of the measures that were taken against her so that she knew all the most private affairs although to appearance she spoke with no body it was commonly said at court that there was a duende in the palace that is to say a familiar spirit that acquainted the queen with all the news and and secret designs but some time after when it came to be publicly known that valenzuela was this esprit folet this familiar spirit he was usually called el duende de la reina  the affection she had for him increased to such a degree that all the world knew it and the courtiers all endeavored to please the new favorite no favors were to be obtained but through his intercession and the credit of the other ministers sunk solow that they stood only for ciphers so they began to murmur amongst themselves to what purpose was it said they to remove father nitard and send him away since a new favorite is started up that succeeds him in his place and acts with more authority than the other ever did  this good fortune of valenzuela occasioned him a thousand enemies they spoke of the queen with all the freedom and liberty imaginable both grandees and people made no scruple of saying in public that a young ignorant favorite without fortune or merit governed all spain and that it was a shame to endure it the queen being informed of what was said resolved to advance valenzuelas fortune without delay to the end that he might feel the good effects of her protection before they were able to hurt him upon this consideration she gave him the charge of master of the horse without having any regard to the custom by which she was obliged to concert it with her ministers as is the way in spain when they are going to dispose of any considerable post because she apprehended they would have opposed her designs so that without entering into any matter of consultation that is the usual term in spain she ordered his commission to be dispatched  the marquess de castelrodrigo who was at that time master of the horse opposed it with all his power and peremptorily refused to give him admission into that place alleging abundance of very disobliging reasons against the pretensions of don fernand and particularly that he had no title to make him hope so great an honor the queen removed that difficulty very easily for she created him marquess de sanbortolome de los pinares  when the world observed so advantageous an alteration in the fortune of valenzuela no body questioned but that he was a valido that is to say a favorite the report immediately spread it self through all spain attended with some circumstances that deeply concerned her majestys reputation but she made no account of them whether it were because she thought those persons not worth her consideration that had the boldness to talk so freely of her or because she had some particular reasons to herself not to alter this conduct  some time after the marquess de castelrodrigo master of the horse happened to die and the queen bestowed his charge upon valenzuela if the grandees formerly murmured when he was advanced to a less considerable post it is an easy matter to imagine the excess of their dissatisfaction and jealousy when they beheld him settled in a place which all of them could have wished to have enjoyed and of which they believed themselves to be infinitely more deserving but they ceased to make any farther clamours about this business when they found they had a subject to talk of that was a great deal more surprising her majesty made valenzuela a grandee of spain of the first class with a double gold key at this piece of news all people looked upon one another and continued mute for some time not being able to express the astonishment they were in the lords as they met one another said nothing else but valenzuela made a grandee o tempora o mores in fine the queen declared him her sole favorite so that he issued out all orders for her as chief minister or to speak more properly as an absolute master no body was surprised at this new honor that arrived to him for they made no question but that after such strange unaccountable beginnings he was marked out and designed for the ministry  being elevated to so eminent a post he wanted nothing but some friends to help and support him if it ever should be his ill fortune to make a wrong step and it was no difficult matter for him to effect it in so advantageous a situation where all favors all the money all the offices and benefices were at his entire disposal but as soon as ever he procured a favor for any single grandee he at the same moment disobliged above twenty more who from that time dated themselves his mortal enemies and heartily wished his ruin because he did not prefer them so that he was often heard to complain and regret his fate for that he could not satisfy all the world and as the number of his friends was infinitely inferior to that of his enemies so the latter began to cabal against him and think of some way or other to oblige don juan of austria to return out of an expectation that he was the fittest person to remove this universal grievance this new creature valenzuela  this cabal of malcontents increased so mightily that there was almost nothing to be seen but pasquils lampoons and satyrs both in prose and verse against the queen and against him nay they had the boldness to give out that he hindered her majesty from recompencing the services of several persons who otherwise might have expected considerable employments in short their insolence proceeded so far that one night very near the palace they hung up the portraiture of the queen with valenzuela he had at his feet all the marks that represented his several places a sword for constable an anchor for admiral a golden key for gentleman of the bed chamber a collar of the fleece for knight of that order and so of the rest he pointed at all these things with his hand and below was written este se vende that is to say all this is sold and the queen leaning her hand upon his heart with this inscription yeste se da that is to say and this is given the report ran very strong that he sold all offices and dignities at high rates at which some persons of the highest quality were extremely offended and his avarice drew upon him abundance of enemies  but what is still the most remarkable is this that all these various reports made not the least impression on the queen she said that her rank placed her above these little contumelies and that she should be angry with her self if she were capable of being disquieted at such miserable reproaches that were so infinitely below her indignation that the most effectual way to punish and extinguish these licentious abuses was to take no notice of them that the reason why they were so inveterate against the marquess de valenzuela proceeded only from their envy that she was resolved not to abandon and sacrifice one of the best subjects that the king her son had to gratify the insatiable humor of some malcontents that were never to be satisfied so that now it was apparent that all the methods they took to destroy this favorite served only to confirm him so much the deeper in the affections and good graces of the queen  nevertheless he used all possible means to procure the good will of the people he took care that madrid should be always plentifully supplied with provisions necessary for life and that all sorts of commodities should be sold at cheap easy rates he often entertained the city with bullfeasts where he generally made his appearance in a black habit embroidered over with silver and wore black and white plumes as being in second mourning because the queen was a widow but as soon as ever he entered the lists and according to the custom of those that design to combat the bulls came under the queens balcony making her a profound reverence and demanding permission de taurear as they call it there she sent a messenger to forbid him to expose himself twas observable in one of these courses that he wore a scarf of black taffata embroidered over with gold with the device of an eagle gazing steadfastly upon the sun and for the motto these words tengo solo licentia that is to say  is only permitted to me some days after he eared at the running at the ring having an ea painted up on his buckler for they always wear them at this sort of course which is an ancient diversion of the moors armed with jupiters thunder bearing the same motto it is only permitted to me there being no hazard to run in this sport the queen was willing that valenzuela should show his dexterity which he did and carried away the prize from a great number of young lords that disputed it with him and received from the queens hand a sword beset with diamonds they talked hotly at court of the two devices of the favorite and every one was ready to explain them according to his own fancy and inclination he caused some comedies of his composing to be publicly represented on the theater and all the town had the liberty of seeing them for nothing this was the most taking way in the world to gain the hearts of the spaniards for they are such passionate admirers of all public shows that they will lay up the money which ought to be spent in maintaining their poor families to purchase a dear seat at a bullfeast valenzuela was not satisfied to cultivate the affections of the people by these magnificences but sought other ways to win their hearts he set several noble buildings on foot rebuilt the great square the better part of which had been consumed by fire and particularly the house where their majestys went to behold the courses at the bullfeasts and running at the ring he caused a bridge to be built at the gate near toledo over the mancanares that cost a million of ducats and another bridge over the same river at pardo which is a house of pleasure belonging to the king the frontispiece and place before the palace was finished by his order as also the tower of the queens apartment was raised much higher  he employed all his thoughts in contributing to the diversion of the queen and the king her son this young prince now began to go to all the meetings of sport and pleasure that were kept at aranjues the escurial and the other royal houses one day when the marquess de valenzuela had received orders of the king to prepare a chase for him and the court was then at the escurial the king designing to shoot a stag shot his favorite and wounded him on the thigh the queen being terribly affrighted broke out into great lamentations and fainted away between the arms of her ladies this accident occasioned some people to predict the approaching ruin of valenzuela whereof this odd adventure seemed to be a presage  the time being now come to order the kings household the marquess made choice of all the officers he made the duke dalbuquerque mayor dome mayor the admiral of castile cavallerizo mayor and the duke de medinacelli sumiller de corpse this officer is the same in effect with high chamberlain and puts on the kings shirt the name is originally french and comes from the dukes of burgundy from whom the house of austria is descended after the same manner he disposed of the other places  now as there were abundantly more pretenders than places to fill he drew upon him by this means a considerable number of enemies who could not digest the affront of having nothing given them and were less inclined to pardon him for that which directly concerned themselves than for what related to the interest of state at this time they thought more earnestly than ever of don juan hoping that he would come to revenge their quarrel upon valenzuela and besides they labored under hand to convince the king how necessary it was for the better management of affairs to have the prince about him  the queen being informed of what was designed against her passed many sorrowful days and more melancholy nights although she had almost continual conference with the marquess but she could never represent to her mind the killing thought that they would treat the marquess after the same cruel manner as they had used father nitard but she fell a weeping and discovered all the signs of a real concern she knew very well that the grandees frequently assembled together and that they spoke of the government with all the freedom imaginable that the libels and pasquils that were insolently scattered abroad all tended to defame her administration were publicly owned and acknowledged by the authors themselves and that she was obliged to seem as if she knew nothing of those matters because she was not in a capacity to punish them  valenzuela for his part was not without his uneasy moments the elevation of his fortune only served to make him sensible of the terrible precipice he was falling down from which he did not perceive any visible means to secure himself  in the mean time don juan who continued still at saragossa was discontented at his banishment how honorable soever it appeared it is sufficient that it was not voluntary and that was enough to make him disrelish it the queen and he had still the same natural aversion to one another as formerly and notwithstanding the fair appearances of his outward behavior he labored underhand with his friends to get himself declared infant de castile at least people report it of him it is indeed very true that he was never able to accomplish that design but they pretend that he was not absolutely without hopes to effect it  however it was he made so great a faction by the means of some considerable persons about the king who were for promoting his return that his friends sent him word that the king desired it that every thing was disposed and ready to receive him and that the credit of the queen would never be able to stand in competition against his  this good news obliged him to quit arragon and make all the haste he could to arrive at buenretiro       to bring about this affair with more facility they gave the king to understand that he was not only under the tutorage of the queen his mother but under that of valenzuela they afterward represented to him the constraint he lived under in such lively colors that he protested he would free himself immediately from this servitude and although the queen had always her eye upon him for fear he should be seduced by any ill counsels and take contrary measures to what she prescribed him yet he found the opportunity one night to steal out of the palace with only one gentleman of his bedchamber who lay in his room and so muffled up in his cloak he walked on foot to retiro which was far enough off from thence he dispatched an order immediately to the queen not to stir out of the palace  it is easy to imagine what entertainment such mortifying news found with her and what effects this sudden reverse of fortune caused in a princess who had been accustomed to govern  she employed the remainder of the night in writing to the king conjuring him in the most tender terms to give her leave to visit him but he still refused it  while the king tarried at retiro the people being informed of his intentions flocked in multitudes to salute and acknowledge him all the lords of the court made him very considerable presents so that some persons valued them at a hundred thousand crowns either in money plate tapistry or diamonds there was an universal joy at madrid upon this occasion and that for these two reasons which equally caused it the first is the exceeding affection the spaniards have for their prince the second because the queen was so ill beloved and besides the people could never forget some words that dropped from her once viz that she should never be at rest till she had brought them all to be clothed with estera this is a sort of a course matt made of rushes that serves them for mattresses and their bedding  the next night after the kings retreat they made illuminations in all the streets  as soon as don juan arrived he obliged the king to remove the queen from thence so she was sent to toledo with positive orders not to stir out of that city the unfortunate valenzuela took his leave of her with all the testimonies of grief and duty that so short a time would allow him and retired to the escurial according to order  thus there being a new face of affairs every body made his court and application to don juan and the king by his extraordinary caresses sufficiently testified how joyful he was to see him again he commanded him to take care of all his affairs and indeed don juan rendered himself so absolute a master that his authority became much greater than that of the queen and her two chief ministers  don juan earnestly desired to have valenzuelas person in his power but could not tell whither he was gone at last being informed that he was to be found at the escurial he showed a great deal of joy at the news this is one of the kings houses and is of so prodigious an extent that if we take in the buildings the park and a convent of religious jeronomits which is contained within the precincts of it it is thought it is several leagues in compass and is all enclosed with walls  the king commanded don antonio de toledo son to the duke of alva to go thither in person and arrest valenzuela he departed immediately with the duke de medina sidonia and the marquess de valpa rayso don fernand de toledo several persons of great quality and two hundred horse the marquess was then walking in an adjoining forest full of heaviness and melancholy but hearing on a sudden a great noise about him and being informed at the same time of what had happened by a certain messenger whom some of his friends had sent in all speed to acquaint him with the news he returned hastily to the fscurial and finding out the prior of the convent of the jeronomites who was a very honest man and particularly concerned at the misfortunes of this favorite he told him in a few words what danger he was in and what reasons he had to apprehend the loss of his life in case he was taken praying and conjuring him with all imaginable earnestness to conceal him in some place of safety  the prior immediately ordered a hole to be contrived in a cell belonging to one of the religious of whose confidence he was well assured this cell it seems was all over wainscoted so that taking down one of the pannels of the wainscot and making a cavity in the wall which was of a considerable thickness in manner of a nitch they threw in a few mats and there the poor marquess was shut up  it being very well known that the marquess was retired into the convent there was no place or corner left unsearchd by don antonio de toledo and those that accompanied him they had so small a respect to the most holy places that they almost turned every thing in the church upside down  but their search was to no purpose and don antonio could not tell what to resolve upon he had been upon the hunt there several days to find out valenzuela who as he now began to imagine had certainly found the means to save himself when the unhappy marquess being almost stifled in the hole for want of air and besides disordered with his late afflictions fell so dangerously ill that there were little hopes of his life finding himself therefore in this desparate condition he cared not what became of him but the father prior having first taken the surgeon of the convents word to keep the secret inviolably sent him to the marquess to let him blood this treacherous villain within a quarter of an hour after discovered the whole mystery to don antonio who had been it seems in the cell where poor valenzuela lay immured almost every day since he began to make the search after him he then immediately entered the convent and all on the sudden commanded the panel which covered the marquess to be taken down he found him fast asleep but very much altered by his indisposition and misfortunes his arms lay ready by him and if he had been awake there is no question to be made but that he had resolutely defended himself being a person of great courage and bravery and besides what would not a man attempt in so deplorable a condition  he was conducted to the castle de consuegra which belongs to the grand priory of castile of the order of malta don juan chose to make this the scene of his confinement because the castle depended upon him valenzuela lay there dangerously sick and often said in the hearing of his guards oh heavens and there is no hope then that i shall die immediately must i still live after i have endured so many afflictions  when he was somewhat better he was removed to the castle de los puntales at cadiz where he suffered a very close imprisonment nevertheless he showed a great deal of constancy and resolution in the midst of all his ill usage and disgraces  at last he was embarked in a vessel to be sent to chile in the philippines these are certain islands in the extremest part of the east indies almost adjoining to china it is a long and tedious voyage thither and they generally transport their most notorious criminals in spain to those places where they are forced to work in the quicksilver mines they seldom tarry above two years in that slavish employment but they die or at least are troubled with a general trembling in their limbs which makes them suffer infinitely more than death it self  valenzuela was informed before his departure that he was degraded from all his honors and that the king had taken away all his offices leaving only his bare name to him i perceive then says he very pensively that i am under more unfortunate circumstances by far than when i first came to court and the duke de linfantado took me for his page  but tho they took care to acquaint him with what related particularly to himself yet he could learn nothing of the queens destiny or what became of his wife and children they had shut up her majesty together with them in a convent at talavera de la reine and strictly commanded the abbess not to let them stir abroad or speak to any body  it is commonly reported that at the time when he was at the port of cales ready to embarque a woman of an extraordinary size handsomely dressed and covered with her veil as it is the spanish fashion bustled through the guards close up to him take courage valenzuela says she to him thy enemy will die and thou shall once more see spain  those that heard her say so would have stopped her but she found out means to make her escape what she told him afterward proved in effect to be true for don juan died and one of the first graces that the queen mother begged of the king at her return to madrid was to have valenzuela recalled home so a vessel was sent to the philippines to bring him back but he found to his sorrow that deguya hindered his return although the queen so earnestly desired it  the pope having received information of what had passed as well in the church as in the convent when they dragged valenzuela by force out of the escurial excommunicated all those that were concerned in the fact so that before the lords could prevail to have the ecclesiastical censure taken off which by this violation of the churches liberty they had incurred they were obliged in white sheets and halters about their necks to walk to the imperial college where cardinal mellini who was then nuncio at madrid made each of them undergo some blows of discipline  all the kingdom testified an extraordinary satisfaction to see don juan enter upon the government and we may safely say that all the hopes and expectations of spain were lodged in him  as he was master of a great deal of wit and vivacity so it was natural to believe that the different employments of his life whether in peace or war rendered him extremely capable of repairing the breaches and reforming all the irregularities of the state several of the grandees had entered into a sort of an association for his return and now they had leisure to make severe reflections upon the weakness of the late government where they found nothing but private intreagues and little factions that were extremely disadvantageous to the public interest  a german queen an infant king a foreigner chief minister of state and confessor valenzuela made a favorite and minister without birth and without capacity raised upon the sudden by a strange caprice of fortune and thrown down again into his primitive nothing in fine all their hopes centred in don juan and they had long expected him almost to a degree of impatience but when he was once arrived and they beheld him at a nearer view presently all those great and glorious ideas which they had conceived of him vanished away like a dream  this is commonly the fate and destiny of all great ministers the high place they possess only serves to expose them the more to the envy of their inferiors even those persons that took the greatest pains to place them in that condition think they have labored all the while for an ungrateful wretch and if he fails to shower down all his favors upon them will be sure to give him less quarter than any men else so small a distance there is from public favor and admiration to public hatred this rule which generally holds at all times and in all places did not fail to be accomplished in the person of don juan  most people were concerned to see what harsh usage he gave the queen and could not forbear to accuse his obstinacy for refusing to enter madrid till the queen was gone out and on her way to toledo  he was not content with this affront that he put upon her at his first appearance but to humble her still the more he added another that was full as mortifying he descended into a severe examination of her past conduct the particulars of which had the least relation to the present state of affairs and only tended to defame her  this princess suffered with an incredible grief a treatment so unbesitting her high quality and so injurious to her reputation but all other ways of showing her resentments were denied her and she had nothing left to exercise save only her patience and virtue  but several persons of quality that were still linked to her whether out of affection or duty could not without a sensible affliction behold the oppression she lay under they generally spoke of it with heat and indignation and spread abroad a report that although don juan was no legitimate prince yet he flattered himself that he should one day become absolute master of the monarchy  abundance of people maintained the contrary alleging that he was never guilty of such a design and that if he had been capable of harboring any such thoughts he might easily have succeeded in them by the assistance of his own party which was very numerous and by his own power that the king was but fifteen years old and besides was equally destitute of authority and experience  what occasioned this suspicion was his establishing of some innovations that were never practiced by any minister before him one that made the greatest noise was this that in his chamber of audience he would never give the right hand nor a seat to the ambassadors at first they showed themselves extremely disobliged at it but at last the nuncio and the other foreign ministers submitted to this rule and visited him without difficulty the queens creatures made a greater bustle about this affair than even the ambassadors themselves who were only concerned in it and whether they discoursed of it with too much freedom or don juan only suspected their private sentiments he caused several of them to be banished among the rest were the admiral of castile the duke de ossone the prince de stillano the marquess de mansera the count dhumanez the count daquillar and the marquess de mondejar the last of whom was accused for making the following verses but they were mistaken in the author for they were written by the admiral who was a person of extraordinary wit  un frail y una corona un duque y un cartelesta an dubieron la lista de la bella calderona baylo

doom and be not amazed that the people thus cry under all the oppressions and burdens they lie though too loudly they rail at the plague of the age their zeal to thy person excuses their rage and if they repine and are heard to complain it proceeds from the smart and excess of their pain don juan found these verses upon his toillette and in several other places of his chamber he was more concerned at them than in reason he ought to be for certainly he could never be so vain as to imagine that he was equally acceptable to all the world these resentments having sowred and exasperated his spirit he observed that the conversation of the count de monterey diverted the king this was enough to render him suspected and although this nobleman had set himself at the head of a party which declared for the princes return yet all his services were forgot and the prejudices of jealousy which are sometimes too headstrong to be mastered made don juan send him to command in catalonia  he afterward banished him and what is more ordered a trial to be commenced against him about the affair of puicerda thus the unfortunate count saw himself all in a moment removed from court where he flattered himself long to continue in the kings and princes favor but that monarch was young and destitute of experience and besides labored under the ill effects of a bad education for a minister that regards nothing in the world but what has a particular relation to his own interests will be sure to keep back those lights from his prince that may help him afterward to discover by what an ill conduct he is managed don juan was very well acquainted with the policy of this maxim and accordingly took care to conceal the affairs of state from the king with as much precaution as the priests keep their mysteries from the people to make himself always necessary to him he never instructed him in the art of governing but perpetually amused him with some little insignificant diversions that possessed his tender years with a spirit of laziness which could never fail to produce ill consequences afterward and never gave him leave to stir a foot out of the palace but in his own company  the people that are never sensible of events but at the very moment when they feel the smart had perhaps looked upon the banishment of the lords and the captivity of their king with an indifferent eye if they had not been sufferers themselves but the great scarcity of provisions that were daily inhanced the irregular administration of justice and the disorderly management of the finances made them soon sensible that the changing of masters is not always for the better and as it is natural to run headlong from one extreme into another and the just limits of carrying on a reformation are known but to a very few peersons so they began to disrelish the regency and to show a dissatisfaction that might easily have been improved into an insurrection but that the anger of the people of spain is generally week and feeble and it is not only upon these occasions that the apparent fierceness of that nation goes off and vanishes for it is very true that the people content themselves there with railing and murmuring so that if there was any thing to be feared it was from the grandees who nothwithstanding their banishment left very considerable relations and friends behind them at court these being concerned to see them exiled began privately to join and associate for the same cause they proceeded so far as to signify to the queen that they passionately desired her return and that she ought to attempt something on her side as they were resolved to do something on theirs and in short they took an occasion to discourse the king about the matter  they made him sensible that he was under a slavish ignominious dependence and confirmed him in his natural inclinations to take the government of the state into his own hands  he relished very well the overtures they made him and the queen likewise received her informations not without pleasure but it was not enough to wish well something of action was necessary for the king was young wanted assistance and every one shifted it off from himself to another the pleasures of the court and that laziness which is so peculiar to the spaniards made them advance so slowly in their affairs that don joan had leisure enough to destroy in one day the foundations they had been laying for several weeks the queen for her part was under a consinement which held her chained to the place so that she could attempt nothing without being discovered she was afraid too of finding traitors among her own servants and drawing new disgraces upon her whilst she endeavored to free her self from those she lay under at present what was past instructed her in some measure to fear and avoid what was to come  as she is naturally of a slow disposition so after long reflections upon the matter she was of the opinion that she ought not by any precipitate actions hazard the future repose of her life  don juan on his side was alarmed with continual fears and jealousies and having abundance of spies about him he was instructed of what he did not care to hear the unwearied designs that were daily formed against him notwithstanding the great authority and power with which he was invested he could not for bear very sensibly to apprehend the bad consequences of an aversion that began to be entertained so generally against him  he was in a manner responsible for all the good and all the bad successes of the state and the weight of so cumbersom a monarchy hung very heavy about him he sometimes considered with regret the tranquillity he had formerly enjoyed in flanders and arragon in fine his spirit was not in its natural sphere and we may say of him that he even over bought the pleasure of making so great a figure on the theater of the world  the war that was kindled      between france and holland interested several princes of europe who took their sides in it either according to their several inclinations or else the particular engagements they had to the powers that were then at variance spain which is always inseparable from the interests of the empire neither spared her money nor forces upon this occasion when the hollanders made a peace with france first in the year      the emperor and some of the princes of the empire followed their example nay spain could not hinder it self from doing the like the king of denmark and elector of brandenburgh who as yet kept their swords in their hands still laid them down likewise and a peace was concluded at nimeguen that gave repose to all europe  in the mean time the king of spain was upon the point off marrying the archdutchess the emperors daughter this affair was so far advanced that the articles were regulated and the contract signed this marriage was of the queens doing who earnestly desired the accomplishment of it but don juan at his return broke of this match not being desirous to strengthen his enemies party as it must assuredly have been by the accession of this young princess who was of the same name and same country with the queen and besides all this was her grand daughter and neice he too much feared the ill consequences of this affair to give his consent to it  the king about his nineteenth year seemed to be settled in a healthful state of body which promised successors to the crown and he expressed a great inclination to be married he considered that of the house of austria he alone was left remaining of the spanish branch and that his whole kingdom had an equal interest to see him have children  the circumstances of the peace that happened to be concluded at nimeguen made him cast his eyes upon mademoiselle eldest daughter of monsieur who was the kings only brother she was almost of his own age amiable wellshaped of a sweet disposition witty and charming all her inclinations were noble and virtuous and lewis the great took an extraordinary affection to her because her humor so exactly suited with his so that all the courtiers were surprised at it  the king had accidentally seen some portraitures of this princess and several spanish lords who had been at the court of france spoke of her as a prodigy these advantageous testimonies so luckily concurring sensibly affected him he could not take his rest a nights he carried her picture next his heart and held long conversations with it as if it understood him but what is the most incredible thing of all and yet is related for a certain truth is this that before he became enamoured he could not endure any woman near him but these dispositions were altered in him upon this occasion and he beheld the fair sex never after with aversion  all the people were ravished with joy to hear that the king desired mademoiselle the memory of queen elizabeth of france the first wife of philip the iv was so deeply imprinted upon the hearts of all the spaniards that they desired to see one of the same blood sit upon the throne again  don juan agreed with the kings inclinations as well as those of the people in relation to this princess he sent orders to the marquess de los balbazez in flanders who was come from nimeguen where he had assisted at the treaty of peace to go and demand mademoiselle for the king his master  every one was surprised that the prince lent his helping hand to this affair true policy would have required him to protract as long as he was able and to delay the marriage because as it gave a wife to the king so it might perhaps give an enemy to the favorite  and here many people could not forbear to call to mind the first ideas of that ambition of which he was suspected now it was for good and all to abandon the design of making himself declared infant to content himself with reigning after the king in case he had no children many persons do likewise pretend that notwithstanding the great earnestness he showed in public yet he had no over great desire to have the match succeed they allege this for a reason that he ought to have done something before so open an embassy by way of secret dispatches which might absolutely have had the success of a negotiation but that at the bottom whatever he did or whatever he said to the contrary he did not heartily desire it that he was afraid lest a french queen supported by the authority of the greatest king in the world would never truckle to him that now he was master but hereafter would become no more than a companion others were of the contrary opinion and said that he had a fair prospect of being well received by mademoiselle especially since he had broke off the marriage with the arch duchess and given the preference to her these different considerations embarrassed and perplexed don juan to such a degree that he knew not which way to determine himself and even at the very time that the marquess de los balbazez demanded the princess in france he very cunningly got the king at madrid to see the portraiture of the infanta of portugal who was a lady of admirable beauty he talked exceedingly of her charms and not knowing as yet that her marriage with the duke of savoy was agreed upon he underhand made a proposal to give her to the king but he was too deeply gone to alter his affections  the demand made by don balbazez was very agreeable to his most christian majesty and don juan who received advice of it did not at first doubt of its success therefore he now endeavored to overshoot the favorable dispositions of france either to promote his own interest by it or else by demanding things that were too great to meet a refusal and by that means to find a plausible pretense to break off in effect he pretended that mademoiselle not being the daughter of a king they ought therefore for that reason on the side of the french court to enter into particular considerations and restore to spain some of those places that were yielded up to france by the last treaty of nimeguen  upon this he held a council where he was desirous to insinuate his own sentiments into them but he found no body inclined to hearken to them every one concluded that they ought to have nothing else in view but the kings satisfaction that they were happy enough in finding out a princess that was beautiful and capable to give them a sovereign and that they ought not to take pains to destroy a thing of that consequence which all the world so earnestly desired to see accomplished  the queen who continued still very solitary at toledo and who was consulted in no affairs wrote a letter to the king wherein she told him she had received information that he was going to be married that she counseled him in the mean time while that affair was carrying on to go to arragon and catalonia to confirm the ancient privileges of those people the king sent her barely word again that he would do it without explaining himself more openly upon his marriage  ever since the twenty fourth of january      the king had nominated those persons who were to fill up the respective offices of the house of the new queen the duchess de terra nova was made camarera major that is first lady of honor but her power is of a greater extent than that of the other ladies of honor because she is mistress of all the women that serve the queen in her palace she is the widow of the duke de terra nova who was of the house of pignatelli and a grandee of spain she inherited a vast fortune that descended to her from fernando cortez for her mother bore the name of that famous captain who left her a small kingdom in the west indies tho he might if he pleased have left her a more considerable one in that part of the world where he made so great a progress  she is descended of a branch of the house of arragon that settled a long while ago in sicily she is extremely rich of a fierce imperious humor toward persons that are above her insupportable to her equals but kind and obliging to her inferiors she has a world of wit is fixed in her resolutions and is of a deep penetrating spirit her temper cold and serious still preserving her spanish gravity and never steps a foot backward or forward unless she has well considered of it before she thunders out her i will or i will not enough to make one tremble  she is a meager pale woman of a long and wrickled visage her eyes little and severe in short she makes a dangerous terrible enemy d caos of arragon her cousin german was  the banditti whom she caused expressly for that  to come from valentia because he demanded of her restitution of the duchy of terra nova which was in her possession although of right it belonged to him  the terrible noise this affair made in the world obliged her to retire into arragon where don juan resided at that time deeply afflicted at his misfortunes  both of them imagined that they had reason to complain of the severity of their fortune and this soon occasioned a certain friendship between them as it usually happens amongst persons of their quality when they come to be involved in the same circumstances after they had frequently conversed with one another the prince found out part of the dutchesses humor he knew she was ambitious but as all the other ill qualities of her soul were outwardly set off by the appearance of a great devotion he never took her for so malicious and spightful a devil as she really was he therefore cast his eyes upon her to make her camarera major for the young queen  the marquess dastorgas was nominated at the same time to be grand master of her house don juan had some thoughts at first of conferring this office upon don vincente gonzaga of the house of mantua and made him quit his viceroyship of sicily to come and possess it which the other freely left in consideration of the place that was now offered him but his expectations were deceived for the marquess dastorgas who had heaped up a prodigious wealth when he was viceroy or naples having proffered the use of it to don juan who mightily stood in need of money at that time and accepted the profer was preferred to don vincente who was admitted however into the council of state where his great abilities without question did great service  although the duke dossone continued as yet in exile don juan did not forget to nominate him for master of the horse to the queen he bestowed that place upon him only that he might have an opportunity to take away from him that of the president of the orders where his conduct it seems did not please him he affected a certain air of devotion that sat very disagreeably upon him because he mixed too much bigotry with it and it was a strange sort of bigotry too for this good duke one evening caused the count dhumanez to be set upon in the streets by some men of valencia who never come to madrid but to commit murders and other crimes of that nature the occasion of the quarrel was this the duke was passionately in love with a certain lady and soon after came to discover that the count was a more fortunate man than himself nevertheless the count escaped the danger this affair made a great bustle don juan who was particularly disgusted at the duke laid hold of this opportunity to banish him the court but now procured this considerable post for him that he might gain over to his party a man of so great an importance besides it was his interest to see the chief offices of the queens house filled with those persons that were at his devotion and might prepossess the mind of that young princess in favor of him the other officers of her house were likewise nominated about the the beginning of march  at the same time the marquess de mansera major domo to the queen mother was fined a hundred thousand crowns which he paid upon the nail after this manner the king sometimes punishes the crimes that the grandees commit against him he was soon after banished to the castle de cocchia and his place was given to the count de chinchon but the queen being highly incensed at these proceedings declared that she would never suffer it alleging that the widow of philip the fourth and mother of charles the second ought not to be treated after this unworthy manner so they were forced to let the matter drop and proceed no farther in it  there happened a little after another business that occasioned a great clamor don francisco de toledo second son of the duke of alva the count de mirande grandee of spain the marquess de valero son of the duke de bejar and the eldest son of the duke de sessa occasioned the escape of a man that was accused of great crimes the manner whereby they brought it about was this they sent a woman with a basket of fish to stand near the prison she sold such good pennyworths there that a man appointed for the pupose having informed the jailer and the keepers of it they presently ran to the place to by some fish the woman amused them with abundance of foolish stories so well that she suceeded in her design for in the mean time the abovementioned lords broke open the prison gates  the king ordered all of them to be arrested however this affair like others of the same nature at madrid brought no ill consequences upon them  the king took all the care imaginable to have the young queens apartments in the palace fitted up and made ready he was to have gone according to the usual custom in the month of april to aranjues but don juan hindered him because that place was too near tolcdo so he went to buenretiro the queen mother wrote to him thither desiring that he would be pleased to come and see her but tho she pressed it with a great deal of tenderness and importunity she was not able to succeed in her desires  he diverted himself every day with hunting and seeing comedies either at pardo or zarzuela which are two houses of pleasure belonging to the king of spain the opera dalcine was represented before him it cost a world of money but was miserably performed  there was likewise a bullfeast kept where two young cavaliers unfortunately perished on the following day there was running at the ring  about this time the prince de ligne arrived and a day or two after kissed his majestys hand and took his place at the council of state father francis de relux a dominican came likewise from salamanca where he had been professor of divinity and was chosen by don juan to be the kings confessor the duke of alva had engaged that he should submit himself entirely to don juans will who accepted him upon his parole at this time the cardinal de portacarero archbishop of toledo returned from rome the court at madrid was very full and numerous  on the twentieth of january the king o france named the marquess de villars to be hi ambassador in spain who was at that tim under the same character at savoy he wa known to the court of spain for in the yea      he resided there in quality of ambassador he arrived at madrid on the seventeent of june and those persons that were well acquainted with the disposition of don juan very much doubted whether he would meet with that reception which he might reasonably promise himself they knew well enough that the natural haughtiness of don juan would never comply with the instructions of that minister who to be sure would never go to visit the prince unless he were assured beforehand of receiving the honor of the hand the step and the chair that don juan would never consent to this proposal because it was not to be imagined that he would easily give up the rights he had obtained over the other ambassadors and that it would be an inconvenient thing for him of france not to treat directly with the chief minister what people surmised upon this occasion really happened for the prince would not bate him an ace and the marquess de villars kept fast to his instructions therefore they looked upon one another with great coldness but nevertheless this did not hinder the ambassador from having a private audience of the king on the eighth of july and a public one a little after upon the conclusion of his marriage with mademoiselle  don juan had three fits of a tertian ague toward the beginning of july on the thirteenth the secretary of the marquess de los balbazez arrived who brought word that the king had consented to the marriage of mademoiselle with the king of spain nothing is equal to the joy that he showed upon this account for he had expected the news with the greatest impatience he ordered te deum to be sung at our ladies datocha all the houses in the city were illuminated with white wax tapers and bonefires were to be seen in every street an hundred and fifty cavaliers of the best families in the kingdom performed a masquerate on horseback that consisted only of some embroiderie tiffany ribbons and feathers for they were apparalled in black as they used to be but were not masqued at all after this manner they ran all night every man carrying a flambeaux in his hand all these divertisements lasted three days and three nights a courier arrived soon after who brought the contract of the kings marriage this was soon communicated to the queen mother who expressed a great deal of joy at it the ratification was presently sent back and bonefires were made as before  while the people did thus endeavor to express their zeal to the king the servants of the queen mother were busied in finding out some means or other to advance her return the marquess de villars had refused to follow the example of the other ambassadors in the conduct they used toward don juan upon the occasion of those new customs which they suffered him to establish and this seemed a favorable opportunity to persuade the enemies of the prince that monsieur de villars had some secret instructions which were not favorable to him they flattered themselves immediately with the hopes of making him one of their party and believed it would extremely strengthen their own side if they could once bring him over to them upon this consideration the greater part of the cortiers applauded him mightily for his constauncy and made him abundance of complements upon that score he was respected at madrid and had the good fortune to find out several of his friends again and the queen mother showed a particular esteem for him she gave him a very obliging proof of this when he came to wait upon her at toledo for after public audience was over she was pleased to entertain him in private about her own affairs and testified what an entire confidence she reposed in him but although several proposal were made to him to be of a party against the prince and besides his own natural disposition led him to espouse the quarrel of those persons who opposed a minister whose civilities he had no great reason to applaud yet he was of opinion that in this present conjuncture it would be his best way to remain neuter  he considered still that the marriage of the king of spain with mademoiselle would bring along with it some agreements that were not to be expected before the arrival of that princess that it was a sure unfailing way to oppose one power to another that this young princess would never suffer the minister of france to be run down in that court where she was to become the mistress and sole delight that it was certain she would link her self to the interests of the queen mother that the most christian queen who loved both the one and the other very affectionately would be sure to give her this in charge before her departure amongst the other counsels which she was always to observe that their credit being united together and seconded by all those persons that desired another government don juan would without question find himself obliged to give way most persons reasoned after the same manner upon this affair and encouraged one another to stand firm against the favorite they now began to speak those things aloud which before they were almost afraid to mutter in private they complained of him and importuned the king to call the exes home and openly promoted the return of the queen mother don juan was now more disquieted than ever the appearance only of his fall had prevailed with several persons who ought to have been his creatures to abandon him for good and all and as for those that remained they had neither authority nor merit enough to support him he could scarce find any comfort but when he was alone but this sort of conduct does not always afford a man a sanctuary for even the silence the retirement and the infinite reflections we make are rather apt to perplex and disturb than to relieve our spirits he was still more afflicted when he saw some of his friends or at least such as he believed to be so embrace the interests that were directly opposite to his and he knew they employed the confessors credit with the king to bring all these matters about  i have already told you that don juan was the man who caused him to come from salamanca and after he had advanced him to this preferment thought he might ever after have him at his devotion nevertheless whether he had promised him nothing or really broke his word it is certain he quitted the princes party and caballed amongst his enemies some people pretend that this proceeded from a principle of conscience but it is impossible that ingratitude should ever flow from a good principle however it was he obtained for the princess de stillano who was the duke of alvas daughter the return of her husband don juan had absolutely refused it and found so little credit upon this occasion that he was sensibly afflicted at it for the thing it seems was pushed so far that the king out of pure complaisance to his confessor said it signifies nothing that don juan opposes it it is enough that i would have it so these few words very much increased the princes melancholy but as misfortunes seldom come unattended there happened another mortification upon the account of the duke of ossone who was in the number of the exiles the prince had sent him notice by some of his friends that he desired him to throw up his place of master of the horse to the new queen which he had lately bestowed upon him but he rejected his proposal with the greatest scorn imaginable don juan was mightily enraged at it and would have banished him farther off to make him sensible of his power and of the affront he had done him in pretending to oppose his intentions but he was so far from succeeding in his project that he saw the duke de medina celi who hitherto kept fair measures with him had prevailed with the king to recall the duke dossone the son of the duke de medina celi had married the daughter of the duke dossone and this occasioned the great friendship between them the pretense was that it was necessary for him to be with the queen and the duke de medina celi having found a favorable opportunity told the king that he was not a little concerned to see a man of the duke dossones quality who had the honor to possess one of the highest offices in the queens house banished so far from court at a time when all those persons that ought to serve her should be making preparations to meet her the king consented to his return as likewise to the count de montereys upon condition that they should neither make nor receive any visits at madrid  a general custom seldom fails to hold true for any particular persons and it is an usual observation that when we begin to receive any one misfortune we ought to expect another don juan being persuaded that he was not happy enough to be excepted from this invidious rule was desirous to strengthen his party by the authority of the constable of castile but he met with a very unlucky rub in his way for having engaged the duke of alva to propose an accommodation to him the constable calling to mind the insupportable pride wherewith don juan had formerly treated him and therefore still looking upon the prince as his formidable enemy answered very coldly that the time was past to increase his troubles all those that were exiled came into favor for they took an opportunity to solicit their return whilst he was sick and made such advantages of that conjuncture and pushed matters so home that the king was resolved to call home the queen mother while they were deliberating upon the conduct that was to be observed in this affair the king held a long conversation with the inquisitor general he sent his confessor to acquaint the duke de medina celi of the house de la cerda and the count doropeza of the house of braganza to meet at an oppointed hour at the inquisitors when they were met the king sent them word by the aforementioned father relux to advise him of the best method to remove don juan and recall the queen mother the day was spent in conference and after all it was unanimously agreed that the king should depart from the palace as if he were going out to hunt and that before his return he should send word to the prince to withdraw immediately this project was not put in execution the prince knew not a syllable of the matter and for want of resolution and courage the design fell  on the twenty sixth of june a bullfeast was kept where there was very good sport at the same time the marquess de fuentes got to be made counselor of the military affairs the king gave orders to the gentlemen of his bedchamber who were to meet the queen upon the way to furnish themselves with three suits of clothes apeice and two of them were to be after the french fashion  our ambassador made his entry on the thirteenth of august and we did not fail to go to some of our friends to behold the show it is a custom there for the king to send the ambassador a certain number of horses out of his own stable both for himself and his attendants for the ambassadors make their entry on horseback next morning the major domo in waiting the conductor of the ambassadors and his deputy accompanied him from his own house to the palace in his public audience which he had of the king he always spoke in french the procession of his entry was a long time interrupted by the opiniatrete of the ambassador of malta who pretended that his coach ought immediately to follow that of the venetian ambassador who was the last ambassador of the chapel in such manner that he was got before the second coaches of the marquess de villars but to put an end to the dispute the conductor of the ambassadors was sent to the palace where every thing was adjusted to the advantage of the ambassador of france and the pretensions of him of malta who was don diego de braeamonte were adjudged to be ill grounded since the ambassadors of crowned heads never gave him the right hand at their houses after some instances on his side his coach withdrew he is the first ambassador of malta that ever aspired to this honor  don rodrigo de silva de mendoza duke de pastrane and de linfantade having been named by the king to go ambassador extraordinary into france and to carry the presents of marriage to mademoiselle went immediately to toledo to receive orders of the queen mother and being returned to madrid he departed from thence with a dozen postillions and six trumpeters clad in green velvet embroidered with gold he had several gentlemen and pages with him and his two brothers don joseph and don gaspar de silva accompanied him in his journey donna catarina de mendoza his mother gave him twenty thousand pistoles and five thousand to each of his brothers he was descended in a right line from father to son of rui gomez prince deboli who was made duke de pastrane by king philip ii whose privado or principal favorite he was as his wife whose beauty has made so great a noise in the world was his mistress the king named the marchioness de mortare the marchioness del fresno the countess de santorcas the countess dayala and the marchioness de castra forte to be ladies of honor to the queen and for maids of honor the daughters of the duchess de sessa and de frias those of the marchioness dalcanisa of the countess de villambrosa of the marchioness de villa franca of the marchioness de villa manriquez those of the dukes dhijar and dalbe of the counts de paredes and darcos the sisters of the duke de vareguas and the marquess de codar the daughters of the duke dhijar and pastrane were to be menines or young ladies of honor they are not above ten years old and are the prettiest ladies i have seen in spain donna laura dalarcon was named to be the mother of the maids of honor the sons of the marquess de villa mariquez and of the count of st stephen to be menins or pages to the queen the marquess dastorgas major domo major the duchess de terra nova to be camarera major of the young queen all these ladies went to toledo to take their leave of the queen mother and at their return they went strait down to the palace where he took possession of those chambers that were allotted to them the king presented a thousand pistoles to every maid of honor to bear the expense of their journey with a pension of a thousand ducats he gave the title of grandee to don francis maria spinola a gentleman of genoa duke de s pierre and son in law to the marquess de los balbazez he was a young lord very well shaped and accomplished at the same time the count de talara brought the king a resignation of his office of master of the horse the aversion between him and the admiral of castile made him unwilling to execute his orders and since he saw himself recalled from banishment he thought it the best way to leave the court  a courier arrived from cales on the twentysecond of august who brought the news of the safe arrival of the gallions that were computed to be worth thirty millions but above half the treasure belonged to the merchants they were once minded to seize the whole cargo to defray the charge of the marriage and to serve for other occasional expenses however after a long consideration the council finding it would utterly ruin all commerce desisted from the design  the ministers and grandees wnt  complement the king on st les day because it was the birthday of the young queen he received them with a more pleasant  than was his usual manner and having abundance of precious stones in his hat he told them that he wore them for the sake of the queen the cardinal portocarero came to wait upon his majesty he went from madrid to toledo very much discontented and told some persons that if the king did not receive him with more honor than he did the first time he would never come back again to court but he had reason enough now to be satisfied for as he came out of the coach he found the halberdiers of the guards under their arms touching the pavement with their halberds as they always use to do when the king passes by so great and so welcome a reception made him resolve not to give the right hand to ambassadors and to the grandees which at first a little displeased some people but the dukes de medina celi dossone and alva the popes nuncio and the venetian ambassador having made him a visit were pleased to submit to the new regulation he had established which some others followed after their example  when it was known at madrid that our king was to swear to the peace at fountainbleau on the last day of august the king of spain came about four a clock in the afternoon to the great gilded hall of the palace to perform this ceremony on his side the marquess de villars came to the palace where he was received by the master of the ceremonies the constable of castile followed by all the major domos received him at the gate of the first hall he passed through several rooms each more magnificent than the other and hung with the richest tapistry in the world at the upper end of the hall there was a scaffold erected covered with persian tapistry grounded with gold  was ascended by three steps the kings thron was placed upon it all embroidered with large pearls and precious stones of admirable beauty and splendour the cardinal portocarero sat upon a chair of state the constable of castile upon a little low stool our ambassador seated himself upon another bench the patriarch of the indies continued standing the king came follawed by his grandees and sat down and those whose right it was to sit down and be covered did it don pedro colonna secretary of state read with a loud voice the commission which our king had sent to the marquess de villars to assist at this ceremony in his stead a little silver table was set before the king on which a crucifix and the gospel was placed the king kneeling set his right hand upon the book all the while that the cardinal read aloud the oath which his majesty took to keep peace with france when this was over the ambassador approached and made a compliment to the king who briefly answered him according to the custom and returned presently to his apartment  all the court was now filled with joy a masquerade on horseback was kept in the great court of the palace it was divided into two squadrons which ran against one another prince alexander farnese brother to the duke of parma led one and the duke de medina de las torres led the other the king named the constable of castile and the duke de medina celi to be judges and arbitrators of the course  the marquess defiat arrived at madrid from the part of monsieur to make his compliments to the king of spain he received him very kindly and as a person of his merit deserved he went to toledo to wait upon the queen mother and came back immediately on the ninth of august a courier from the marquess de los balbazez arrived at madrid who brought the happy news that the marriage of the king with mademoiselle had been solemnized at fountainbleau and this gave occasion to masquerades on horseback and the bonefires that were to be seen for three days together  all this public rejoicing did not in the least diminish don juans melancholy and it is certain the great perplexity of mind he was under very much impaired his health and the vigor of his constitution he was at a stand what party to take for as he had too much bavery ever to think of giving way to his enemies so his credit was not strong enough to put him in capacity of resisting them in this violent condition he was sensible enough that he should never be able to sustain the weight of his affliction and to say the truth it cost him his life at last but great men seldom complain when they become the sport of fortune and after their example don juan expected his last day with the constancy and steadiness of a hero his tertian ague seized him again and on the seventh of september he found himself so extremely ill that the physicians acquainted the king that there was but little hopes of his recovery at this news his majesty wept and testified a sensible grief he ordered cardinal portocarero to go to him and learn what condition he was in he appeared but little concerned and prepared himself for death like a good christian and philosopher he comforted all his friends with a wonderful presence of mind a man has lived long enough said he to them when he dies without having any thiog to reproach him i mean in relation to honor as for what concerns my duty to god i have been too deficient and the timeof my repentance cannot be too long he received the holy viaticum and the king almost every other moment came into his chamber testifying a great deal of friendship for him and tenderly complained that he would abandon him at a juncture when his assistance was become so necessary to him don juan made his will by which he constituted the king his heir he left almost all his jewels to the young queen and the queen mother and named cardinal portocarero the duke de medina celi the duke of alva and the president of castile to be his executors he likewise gave order that as soon as ever he was dead they should remove his cabinet which was filled with papers of great importance out of his own apartment to that of the king this extreme illness of the prince put some stop to the public rejoycings that were resolved upon and particularly to a bullfeast but however it did not hinder them from making fine artificial fireworks in the court of the palace nay he desired it himself although he was troubled with a furious pain in his head that might very well be increased with the noise of rockets and crackers all this while his physicians who knew nothing of the profound melancholy wherein he was plunged punished his body for an indisposition that was properly lodged in the mind and made him suffer a sort of martyrdom by the several torments they inflicted upon him in fine this poor prince died on the seventeenth of september      on the very same day that his father philip iv did he was born in      and abounded with a thousand good qualities a little time after his birth his mother received the habit of a religious woman from the hands of pope innocent x who was then the popes nuncio to king philip iv this action of her retiring out of the world justified her from abundance of suspicions which people entertained upon the score of her imprudent conduct the king did not acknowledge him till the year      he had the grand priory of malta in castile bestowed upon him and was sent against the portugueses with the title of generalissimo of the armies by sea and land after this he reduced the city of naples to its obedience and went to flanders to command the troops there he was governor of the low countries of burgundy and charolois but he came back to march once more against the portugueses after the death of the king his father he passed his time as is abovementioned at consuegra the ordinary residence of the grand prior of castile and when the present king came to be of age he continued near him on the twentieth his body was carried to the escurial and was interred in the pantheon for so the place is called where they lay the bodies of the kings of spain but those of the princes and princesses of the royal family are placed in a vault which is not far from it nay they dont lay the bodies of the queens of spain in the pantheon unless they have had children he left a very beautiful daughter behind him whom he had by a person of great quality she is a religious person among the carmelites at madrid who are called las descalcas reales  the first journey the king made after the death of don juan was to go and visit the queen mother he parted the very same day from madrid and lay on the way at aranjuez and arrived the next day at toledo the queen received him with great testimonies of tenderness they mnigled their tears together as they embraced one another and dined and afterward entertained one another a long time in private all those that accompanied the king kissed her majestys hand so after the day was agreed upon for her to come back to madrid he left her we may easily believe that she took but little time to prepare her self for a journey that was so welcome to her the king parted from madrid on the twenty seventh he lay again at aranjuez and the next day he set forward to meet the queen on the way that leads to toledo as soon as they met he desired her to come into his coach that they might discourse in private and so he brought her to buen retiro which is one of the kings houses situate at the end of the city there she rested her self for some time till the house of the duke duzeda could be fitted up for her which it seems she chose to reside in because the palace was not spacious enough to lodge the two queens it would be an endless piece of trouble to reckon up all the persons of quality besides the vast multitudes of people that accompanied their majestys at their arrival and indeed this mighty alteration of fortune was very remarkable on the queenmothers side there was an universal joy for her return in the very same city where but two years ago don juan was seen to enter as the deliverer of his country and the queen to go out like a mere fugitive under all the weight of the public hatred the king tarried there till evening and there scarce passed a day over his head from the time he went to meet the queen first on the road but he dined with her and staid a long time in her company  all the new queens family were just upon the point of going to meet her the duchess de terra nova made great preparations and since every body in a manner envyed her for having so advantageous a post and don juan her protector was dead twas commonly believed that she would be obliged to resign it but she foresaw and prevented all this by taking possession of her apartment in the palace from whence it was not so easy a matter to eject her now as it would have been before she departed on the twenty sixth of september with the marquess dastorgas and the whole family of the queen except the duke dossone whose equipage could not be got ready because he was but just returned from his banishment  but before i carry on these memoirs any farther i judge it not amiss to speak a few words of some of the lords that belonged to the court when i was there i shall particularly enlarge upon those that were of the council of state for it will be no small satisfaction to the reader to know the characters of those persons whose names he meets so frequently i shall not here speak of the duke de medina celi nor of the constable of castile neither do i pretend to name them according to their rank and order but shall only place them as they occur first to my remembrance and shall begin with  the duke of alva or dalbe of the family of toledo he has a vast estate and a considerable revenue and yet for all that is not before hand in the world he enjoys several good places and a large pension at court he was a witty obliging person and showed but little kindness to the queen mother he was    years old  don pedro de arragon was fomerly known by the name of the marquess de pobar he endeavored to relieve perpignan when he was general of the horse but had the ill luck to fall into the hands of the french amongst whom he continued a prisoner for some time at his return to madrid the king made him governor to the prince don baltazar his son who died by overheating himself and was afterward let blood in vain the king upon this was enraged against don pedro banished him when the king was dead the queen regent called him home and sent him ambassador to rome after this he was made viceroy of naples where according to the custom he heaped a great treasure together and what is more remarkable knew how to keep it for this is not the genius of that nation he was    years old  the admiral of castile of the family dhenriquez descended from a bastard of the kings of castile was a great lord and better shaped than any in the court he was tall of stature and well proportioned the air of his face was great and noble and he had a world of wit was of a gentle easy deportment and had nothing to trouble him but only his being    years old he had an excellent tallent at writing of verses which flowed naturally from him and in these diversions he employed himself more than in his domestic affairs he was born a libertine and lived private and could not fix himself so as to make a regular court either to the king or the chief minister he was of opinion that whatever is done by constraint cannot be recompensed by all the favors of fortune he communicated himself to a very few persons whether it were because he had too exquisite and nice a taste to accommodate himself to all the world or because he was a lover of solitude which the most delicious gardens and the finest house in madrid recommended to him formerly he kept some mistresses for whose sakes he almost ruined himself he was master of the horse to the king  the marquess dastorgas of the family dozorio was in his time a person of the greatest gallantry in the world and notwithstanding the disadvantage of being    years old continued still to be so he was of a cheerful lively spirit and talked justly and well upon all occasions he was grand master of the young queens horse his lady having entertained an implacable jealousy and hatred against a young beautiful woman for whom he had an extraordinanary affection found an occasion to kill her took out her heart and made a ragoo of it when her husband had eaten part of it she asked him how he liked it he answered very well i am much surprised at it says she for it is the heart of your mistress and immediately drew out her head all bloody as it was from under her farthingal and so threw it upon the table where he was with several of his friends it is easy to imagine how deeply he was concerned at so tragical a sight she saved herself in a convent whether she retired full of rage and jealousy and never stirred out of it the marquesss affliction was so great that it had like to have made an end of him he was exceeding rich  the prince de stillano of the house of gusman and duke de medina de las torres had abundance of wit and if he had joined a little more experience to his natural parts had assuredly have been capable of the greatest things bu he was never out of madrid and lived an effeminate lazy life there which alienated his mind from all manner of business he lived at  floride near the gates of madrid where he ha charming gardens and continued there under so unconcerned a state that he neither received nor made any visits and never endeavored to draw any advantages from the court he had a prodigious estate but for all that it was sufficiently entangled for want of putting every thing in order when he married the daughter of duke dalbe he ordered a sedan to be made for her all covered over with plates of gold and garnished with coral but when it was finished no body was found strong enough to carry it he was    years old and was deeply in the interests of the queen mother  the duke dossone of the house de giron was master both of good and bad qualities that equally distinguished him he loved his friends passionately and served them freely with his credit and purse he was of a liberal temper and a great adorer of ladies sparing no cost to ingratiate himself with them he was an irreconcilable enemy and withal was of a proud haughty imperious humor that made him insupportable to all the world and yet his conversation was diverting and pleasant enough when he could leave off his grandeur and rhodomontadoes he was a man of an inflexible steadiness and always had some quarrel or other in court or city he was one of the richest noblemen in spain and might be about    years old he had been viceroy of catalonia governor of milan president of the orders and was master of the horse to the young

council he was    years old  don louis portocarero cardinal and archbishop of toledo possessed the greatest benefices in spain he was extremely rich and his archbishopric was worth three hundred and sixty thousand crowns per annum to him he did abundance of good in his station was very obliging and courteous of an easy temper and had the repute of being an honest man he might be about    years old  the marquess de liche who carried the name of de haro gusman had two very opposite qualities he was liberal and yet covetous he carried his magnisicence even to an excess considering his rank in the world but especially toward his mistresses nevertheless he sometimes showed his frugality in things that did him no credit he had but an ordinary mien and was ill favored but was master of all the wit penetration and vivacity imaginable he was a great lord full of ambition and so naturally forward and adventurous that they feared him at court and kept him always at a great distance he was

liberal and witty he had a great deal of experience and people were well contented with his conduct in the government of flanders he was not above  0 years old twas observable that he was wellshaped and his wife very deformed whereas the marquess de liche his brother was very deformed and his wife exceeding beautiful  the marquess de los balbazez a genoese of the house of spinola was very rich he was not without justice reproached for falling into an excess in the management of his domestic concerns he married the sister of the constable colonna the bigness and figure of that lady were very remarkable it must be owned that he had both zeal and capacity for the service of his master he had been governor of milan and afterward was ambassador at vienna and at france and plenipotentiary at nimeguen he was  0 years old  don diego sarmiento was originally of gallicia his birth was not illustrious the queen mother protected him and procured for him the place of councellor of state because

oropesa who carries the name of toledo conjunctly with that of portugal was young and not above  0 years old his stature was somewhat of the lowest otherwise he was well enough made as to his person of a smiling agreeable countenance and a sweet and insinuating conversation open in appearance but in effect very reserved and close not always speaking as he thought and generally intent upon nothing but to deceive and amuse he pretended to be devout and under the exterior show of unconcernedness for the world concealed his great ambition to which he might be prompted perhaps by his illustrious birth he was of the house of portugal and presumptive heir of that kingdom in case the king had no children the king at that time loved him exceedingly and this love has been since wonderfully increased he is become a favorite and chief minister  the marquess de mansera had been formerly sent ambassador into germany and afterward was made viceroy of newspain where he enriched himself and came back to madrid he was of so unhealthful a constitution that he could not fill the chief places of the government which otherwise he might have done being a person of great capacity in regard of his experience and judgment he was    years old  the duke dalbuquerque was general at sea he was very brave and was not destitute of wit he married the daughter of his eldest brother to keep up the

gentleman to the duke de turcis he was well shaped and agreeable had abundance of wit and lived in the quality of a page to don pedro fernandez del campo secretary of state his master loved him exceedingly and made him his chief commissary he afterward rose to be secretary for don pedro del campo not being in the good graces of valenzuela deguya was chosen to officiate in his place by a commission and after some time had the good fortune to get it for himself for he to whom it belonged died of grief because he was not permitted to exercise it any longer the king had a great kindness for him and he behaved himself toward his majesty with all the address imaginable his office was under the kings apartment he was called secretary of state and del despacho universal he was never of the council his employment directly fastened him to the person of the king and chief minister he kept the bolsillo without being obliged to give up his accounts now these are the fines that come to the king as well from spain as the indies they amount to a prodigious sum and are employed for secret services either by way of presents or pensions  all these persons whom i have mentioned were very eminent and considerable and possessed the chief offices and greatest employments  there is another class of courtiers still behind which is only composed of young lords who are there called guaps as we call them in france les petits maitres the most witty and wellshaped among these are reckoned to be the duke duuzeda the marquess de penaranda the count daltamire the sons of the duke de cessa the prince de montoleon don antonio and don francisco de toledo sons of the duke dalbe and don fernand de toledo his nephew the two silva brothers to the duke de pastrane the marquess de leyva the duke de medina sidonia the marquess de quintana and the son of the duke de medina celi although the eldest of these lords is not above    years old yet they were most of them married for they take care in spain to make themselves acquainted with his godship hymen as soon as is possible  and now as for the ladies i shall only say in general that there is no place in the world where they have a greater share of vivacity and wit and a better talent to please than they have in spain amongst these without reckoning the maids of honor that belonged to the two queens the most remarkable for wit were the dutchesses dalbuquerque de terra nova dossone de frias de medina celi dhijar de pastran and the countesses de monterey and de villambrosa for beauty the marchioness de liche the princess de montelion the marchioness de la roche the countess de penaranda the princess stillano the duchess dosseda the wife of don pedro of arragon that of don henrique henriques and the marchioness de la puebla the constraint wherein they live the climate of the country and their own natural temper carry them to gallantry on course they are for the most part little lean and slender their skin is swarthy soft and painted their features regular their eyes full of fire their hair black and in great abundance and their feet small to admiration their habit sits so ill upon them that unless one has been long accustomed to it she can scarce know how to endure it the men are no less disadvantageously apparelled they always come to court in their golilia and a black cloak and hanging sleeves and although they be never so well shaped and handsome with fine heads of hair and good features yet their awkward way of dressing and parting their hair on one side of their face and throwing it behind their ears does abominably disfigure them  this digression has caused me to interrupt the series of these memoirs but now to reassume my discourse i must inform my reader that the good understanding which passed between the king and the queen mother occasioned abundance of people to make their court to the latter they looked upon her as a princess who had assumed all her former authority for the king was still young and had need of good counsel and his mother being accustomed to govern was for all sorts of reasons more capable to direct him than any one besides nay it was commonly believed that she would not be displeased to take the government again into her hands and so some by inclination and others out of policy endeavored to get into her favor in order to obtain some place or other under the new ministry that was going to be formed as well upon the score of her return as the arrival of the young queen  the world had reason to believe that the face of affairs would be absolutely changed and therefore every one thought of himself in the present conjuncture it is true abundance of persons that were very well read in politics judged that the queen mother would not perhaps manage the reins of the government they pretended that this would be always a weighty and troublesome charge that she had been of late years accustomed to ease and quietness and having undergone all the varieties of an uncertain fortune she was afraid of seeing her self exposed to them the second time that there was hopes she would dissuade the king from taking a chief minister and that she would be forward enough to make him conceive an aversion for one that to effect this she only needed to put him in mind of the sorry figure he made when don juan had such an authority over him and that in fine she would endeavor to form a junta which should be composed of her own creatures that this would be the true way to rn without making her self responsible for any events that all her orders would be punctually executed and yet she not appear to have any hand in them i ought to acquaint my reader that a junta is an extraordinary council of state which the kings of  to remedy the pressing necessities of the state for example philip iv by his last wi created a junta to serve and assist the  council during the minority of the  his son  thus people searched after and as easily found out the lords who were to compose this junta the hatred or the friendship of those persons that made reections upon the present affairs enriched or impoverished those they had a mind to they bestowed offices and took them away they made vows to no purpose and had effectual fears and apprehensions upon them in a word all these busy spirits were divided upon the point and the most quiet among them found themselves somewhat concerned for what was to come but the queen mother made no stir she seemed in appearance to have no other thoughts than how to establish her self in the favor of the king her son and serve her self in the same condition  this young prince was passionately in love and was sensible of all the pleasure that accompanies those agreeable ideas that love uses to inspire and flattered himself to see all his expectations suddenly crowned the possessing a princess who was already become so dear to him employed his heart to such a degree that he could think of nothing else he pressed the time of his departure that he might be the sooner with her  the arrival of the courier who brought the news that the queen was advanced toward the frontiers was expected with extreme impatience the marquess de ls balbazez sent them word exactly on what day she was to arrive at irun while she was in the territories of france the kings household waited upon her the prince dharcourt accompanied her in quality of ambassador extraordinary and the princess his wife likewise made the journey the marshal de clerambauts lady who was governness to her waited upon her as lady of honor mademoiselle de grance as lady of the wardrobe and this place has left her the name of madam instead of that of mademoiselle nothing was omitted in any of the cities through which her majesty passed to receive her with a respect suitable to her high rank and we may say she so much set off the grandeur of her birth by her natural beauty and by her engaging and courteous deportment that all france was sensibly grieved to lose her  one of the first persons that took the freedom to speak to the queen and give her advice was a religious theatin called father vintimiglia he was born in sicily of an illustrious family and was brother to the count de prade who happened to be governor of palermo at the time when that city revolted in the late troubles he had been seized and people thought it would have cost him his head but he got the favor to be sent to madrid to justify himself his brother the theatin went along with him to assist him with his credit he was a bold hardy adventurous man and devoted himself entirely to don juan and his zeal for that prince carried him so far that in some of his sermons he spoke of the queen mother with very little respect this father departed from madrid in company with the duke dossone and though he had not now any hopes of being made the queens consessor as he had before the death of don juan yet he could not forbear to go as far as bayonne to salute her his deportment his birth and his knowledge of the french tongue which he spoke perfectly well because he had resided a long time at paris procured him access enough to the young queen to take his opportunity of prepossessing her with some suspicions and jealousies against the queen her motherinlaw and the french ambassador by this piece of conduct he did not only design to injure those persons who had formerly been enemies to don juan but he had a particular aim that personally respected himself and wherein his ambition had by much the upper hand of his discretion and that was to persuade the queen to endeavor the erecting of a junta that was to depend solely upon her he told her that in order to bring this design about she was to choose the duke dossone to be a member of it because he was a person of consummate abilities and besides had a great zeal for her majesty he took care to reckon himself in the number of the ministers and could not forbear to write a scheme of the government the memoirs of which he gave to the duke dharcourt to the end that he might present them to the queen but it is very probable he never showed them to her majesty  the queen was now advanced as far as st johndeluz and she departed from thence about one a clock in the afternoon on the third of november followed by the guards du corpse of the king she came to a wooden house that was purposely prepared for her it was gilded and painted within and without there was a great hall in it a chamber and a moveable closet of crimsondamask with galloon and a rich lace of gold and silver this house was situate upon the brink of the river de bidassoa which parts france from spain as soon as the queen arrived there she put on a most sumptuous habit then coming into the hall she took part of a noble collation there she staid a little and afterward retired into her chamber after this she ascended a scaffold and placed her self in a chair of state under a noble canopy at this very moment she was seized with an air of melancholy which showed what a regret she had to be so near leaving france the prince dharcourt placed himself at her right hand the princess dharcourt at her left the mareshal de clerambauts lady and madam de grance behind her chair monsieur de saintot went to inform the marquess dastorgas of it who was major domo to the queen he was in a boat upon the river near a little island which the treaty of the pyranees has rendered since so famous and which was joined to the queens house by a bridge of communication the guards de corpse formed themselves into several squadrons in this place the marquess was waiting for his orders in this boat which was very magnificent and was prepared on purpose to carry her majesty over to the other side  as soon as he was informed that the queen expected him he set foot upon the ground and fourscore persons gentlemen pages or valets marched on foot before him he threw himself immediately at the feet of the queen kissed her hand made her a complement got up again and covered himself without staying for the queen to say any thing to him the prince d harcourt covered himself likewise at the same time the marquess spoke to her all the while in spanish and presented her majesty with two letters from the king and queen mother but before he gave them he touched them upon his forehead his eyes his mouth and his heart as the fashion is the queen told him she was extremely glad that the king her husband had given him the charge of conducting her after this the old marquess turned himself toward the prince dharcourt and made him a complement who answered that he had orders from the king his master to deliver the queen of spain into his hands monsieur de chateauneuf counselor of the parliament of paris read the act of deliverance in french and don alanson carnero secretary of state read the act of reception in spanish the marquess presented several persons of quality to her majesty who kissed her hand kneeling down upon one knee the bishop of pampelune kissed her hand but did not kneel the queen did not press to depart but the marquess informed her that it was high time to march she immediately arose placing him on her right hand and a menin of honor on her left upon whose shoulder she leaned for he was a young boy and thus she advanced toward the bridge the duchess de terra nova met her just about the middle and kissed her hand with the ladies of the palace that followed her who threw themselves all at her feet after the duchess had made her complement she presented several spanish ladies to the queen monsieur de repair lieutenant of the kings guards du corpse who carried the queens train gave it to the duchess the queen entered into the boat along with her her chamber was glazed all over and thus being all alone with this old dame she cast her eyes frequently toward that side of the kingdom which she had quitted and her languishing air sufficiently testified by what commotions she was agitated within twenty four seamen placed in two barks drew the boat along and the spanish horse discharged their musquetoons and pistols as soon as it began to move the artillery of fontarabia answered them with a great firing the prince and princess dharcourt the other ladies and all the queens attendants passed over in boats that were prepared on purpose the queen setting foot upon the ground toward the evening found her own coach her litter and a chair with abundance of men in liveries she placed her self in her chair and twenty valets on foot lighted the way with long flambeaux of white wax when they came to irun te deum was sung and this was the first time her supper was served after the spanish fashion the repast was so little and so ill dressed that she was extremely surprised at it and could scarce eat at all  alas that a young princess bred up in the most magnificent and refined court in the world should be forced to pass so many sorrowful melancholy moments she had always had the liberty hitherto to eat in public and it had not been denied to her upon the way she danced she rode on horseback she knew and esteemed those that were her companions and they if i may use the expression adored her and now she found her self all on a sudden amongst persons whom she knew not and consequently could not appear amiable enough to divert her grief she understood so very little of their language that she could not tell what they meant or return them any answer without trouble then besides all this the manner wherein they served her appeared so strange and carried so small a resemblance to that of france that she was not a little discomposed at it all was ceremony all was restraint and affectation from the very first day she appeared amongst them the spaniards expected she should know and do every thing as readily as themselves who had been learning them the better part of their lives they never considered the difference between the two nations that are opposite to one another in every punctilio but believing that her majesty ought immediately to be made acquainted with their way of living which she was religiously to observe for the rest of her life they dispensed with her in nothing so that from that time she suffered a kind of slavery to which the rigid humor of her camarera major contributed very much but the natural sweetness of the queens temper and her prudence made her receive all these things that naturally fatigued and displeased her with a world of patience  nevertheless one would have been apt to conclude that out of mere policy the duchess de terra nova ought to have managed the good disposition of the queen after another manner especially since having no interest in her at present she ought by a courteous deportment to have gained her favor because she had so great a number of considerable enemies and the greatest part of the court ladies were desirous of her place the prince who advanced her to this post was already dead all appearances seemed to predict her fall and she her self was very apprehensive of it however she took different measures from what any body would have thought she ought to observe for instead of showing any complaisance to her young mistress she became a spy upon her actions so that by this means she might merit the kings favor she studied all her inclinations and her humor she frequently caused some french women that followed her to madrid to be entertained she drew strange consequences from the slightest occasions and every thing became poison in her hands she likewise drew for her self a plan of the conduct she was to follow and this effectually hindered her from being turned out of her post  she was not only content with taking these remote measures to ingratiate her self with the king but likewise was of opinion that to secure her own interests she was to hinder the young queen from ever having any friendly correspondence with the queen mother or reposing any confidence in her because her party being absolutely opposite to that of don juan it was natural to believe that the first sacrifice she would demand of her daughterinlaw would be the removal of the camarera who was the creature of her enemy besides she could not flatter her self that the young queen would refuse to give the queen mother this proof of her complaisance at a conjuncture that would deliver her from a sort of a governess whom she had no great reason to love thus she could not think of a better expedient to support her self than by possessing the queen that the queen mother was her secret enemy that she would oppose her in every thing that she could never forget that she was in part the cause that the marriage of the archdutchess her granddaughter was not consummated with the king her son that she was always uneasy because she had not that ascendant as she desired over the kings affections that she was resolved to keep her under a subjection that was more befitting a daughterinlaw than the spouse of so great a monarch  to effect this more easily she had instructed some persons that stood very near the queen who acted their parts well enough when they first took the liberty to discourse her about this affair she thought them to be altogether devoted to her service and their pretended tears seemed to engage for the sincerity of their apparent zeal what have you lost madam would they say to her sometimes with a mournful air what have you lost by the death of don juan what would not he have done to please you if it had not been for him the king had married the arch duchess and his breaking off that match drew abundance of mortal enemies upon him now if you could promise your self that the ambassador of france would prove faithful to you you might find some consolation in him you might follow his advice and profit your self by his directions but considering his present dispositions heaven preserve you madam from taking his counsel alas he quarrelled with don juan only upon the queen mothers account he clearly declared himself for her in his first embassy and she reposes an entire confidence in him thus your majesty cannot show your self too great a stranger to such a minister that will never go cordially along with you and who will penetrate into your private sentiments for no other reason than only to make an ill use of them the queen was extremely alarmed at the things they told her and knew not which way to determine her self being so young and having no experience in this new world where she was acquainted with no body  she departed from irun and lay that night at hernani the next day she mounted on horseback followed by the duchess de terra nova who made but a sorry figure upon her mule madam de grance accompanied her the marquess dastorgas and the duke dossone with each a pair of spectacles upon their nose as is the fashion of the grandees bore their shares in the cavalcade the marquess placed himself next her majesty because she was to be his charge till she saw the king but the duke pretended a right to the same place as being master of the horse and so took it by force menacing the marquess very haughtily this dispute obliged the queen to take coach again she lay that night at tolositte where as soon as she was arrived the duke dossone arrested the guard who had abused his coachman because he would not suffer the coach of the marquess dastorgas to go before his this quarrel was renewed upon the discharging of their offices the marquess pretended that all the honor of the queens reception belonged to him the duke maintained that he being master of the horse ought therefore to have all the preeminences in her house to decide the matter they were forced to write to the king about it who decided it in favor of the marquess the duke not thinking himself justly dealt with continued his pretensions still but this obstinacy drew an order upon him to return to madrid with a prohibition to pass through burgos where the king was at that time  in effect the king left madrid on the twenty second of october being but slenderly accompanied the duke de medina celi lord chamberlain the constable and don joseph de silva were all three in his coach as for the admiral of castile he did not go along with them for he pretended that for want of money he was not in a capacity to fit out any answerable equipage there might indeed be something of truth in this pretense but it is certain that his natural laziness was the real occasion he loved his pleasure he shunned all trouble and carefully avoided whatever might make him uneasy and this was the true reason why he did not meet the king and queen till they were within a days journey of madrid the king continued fifteen days at burgos because he was extremely troubled with a cold in the mean time the queen advanced forwards by small journeys she wrote to him several times and he answered her again her majesty was forced to send to him to demand leave to dine in public and sometime to ride on horseback for those two terrible creatures the marquess dastorgas and the camerara major would not consent to it till they had received positive orders he granted it very freely and she sent to him in this place a watch beset with diamonds and a cravat with a knot of a fire color he immediately put on the cravat and ordered five hundred pistols to be given to the gentleman who brought him the present  the count daltamire grandee of spain came to ognate to complement the queen from the king and presented her with a bracelet of diamonds and rubies she arrived on the eleventh to victoria where a lamentable comedy was prepared to regale her there it was that she dressed her self first a lespagnolle and she appeared no less beautiful and charming in that than in her french habit she went likewise to the great church where the bishop of calahorra received her at the gate and held the canopy over her she afterward was pleased to go and see a bullfeast in the marketplace but there was little or no magnificence in the sight because it was only performed by citizens she received in this place a pair of pendants for the ears with pearls to them of a pear fashion this present was sent to her from the queen mother and was valued at four hundred thousand livers  monsieur the ambassador of france came to wait upon her at bribiesca and though he tarried but a little time with her and their conversation was but short yet he could very easily observe that she expressed a great uneasiness and a particular distrust of him he could not penetrate into the reason of it however he presently judged that these dispositions were not natural to her he told her several things that might be serviceable to her he advised her not to amuse her self with the different impressions that any persons might endeavor to make upon her that she ought to consider that the greatest part of those that waited on her only minded their own proper interests that her surest way would be to love the king cordially and so by that means engage him to love her to unite her self to the queen mother and concert all affairs with her that she ought to rest satisfied that that princess had a great kindness for her and that if she took care to make suitable returns she would find the affections of a true mother in her the young queen was already prepared for this discourse and particularly for what concerned the queen mother she had been tampered with upon that point before but if she had seriously examined what he spoke to her she had soon been made sensible as she was a person of extraordinary wit that the ambassador dealt plainly with her and that whoever persuaded her to the contrary endeavored to disunite her from her real interests he took his leave of her and went back to the king at burgos and during this short time he had the honor to discourse with her she still entertained him with great coldness and indifferency  the prince dharcourt was advanced as far as burgos to salute the king and since the queen was to come to quintanapalla which is within three leagues of it it was generally supposed that she would come to lie there on the nineteenth of november and that the ceremony of the marriage would be there solemnized but the marquess de villars having met as he was coming back the patriarch of the indies who was going to meet the queen it came immediately into his head that the marriage might perhaps be consummated without his being informed of it this thought made him inquire the news of don geronimo deguya secretary of state who only told him that the queen was expected the next day at burgos this doubtful answer which had nothing positive in it obliged our ambassador to inform himself still more particularly and he understood at last that the king was to go the next day to quintanapalla to celebrate the marriage being assured of this he took care to send advice of it to the prince dharcourt and they departed together soon enough to be with the queen before the king arrived thither  when they came there they found it no diffificult matter to discover that the spaniards desired to have the marriage solemnized without them the camerara major who was altogether of that opinion and to whom they spoke with abundance of honest freedom told them coldly that they were not to assist at the ceremony and that the king would have no body be there except only those whose presence was indispensably necessary such as the chief officers and some gentlemen of the bedchamber the prinoe dharcourt and the marquess de villars answered that the king their master had given them orders to be present at it she fiercely replied that the king their master had nothing to do to command in spain monsieur de villars told her that the king his master was used to command his ambassadors and that they would obey him in every thing that if the king was not willing to have him assist at his marriage he ought to signify to them by an order in writing that they were not to be there the camerara ravished with joy that she had an opportunity to show her zeal for the king of spain although this was a very improper time for it was so far transported with the matter and spoke several things so incoherent and fierce that the ambassadors lest her and addressed themselves to the marquess dastorgas he patiently listened to them and told them ingenuously that he would immediately dispatch a gentleman to the king to know his pleasure herein this gentleman found him on the way and he consented that the messieurs dharcourt and villars should assist at the ceremony in short it was occasioned by the industrious diligence of some persons who had no inclination to the french that this thought was insinuated into the king they were of opinion that so august a marriage ought not to be celebrated in a poor village where there were not above a dozen houses and their spanish vanity was so extremely offended at it as to desire that the ambassadors of so great a king might not be witnesses of so great a negligence not to say misery and now to excuse the matter they gave out that the king was young and amorous that every thing that hastened the pleasure of seeing his spouse touched him so sensibly that he even forgot the magnificence and grandeur of his rank that love alone made up the honors of his feast and that the king thought this alone sufficient the queen having passed the night at quintanapalla about ten a clock in the morning was told that the king was arrived this news caused a small emotion in her and spread a color upon her cheeks that made her still appear more beautiful and lovely she went to receive him in her spanish dress and having met him as he was just going to enter her antichamber she would have thrown her self several times at his feet and kissed his hand but he hindered her still and saluted her after the spanish fashion that is without kissing her but pressing her arms close with his two hands and calling her often mireina mireina my queen my queen they discoursed together a long time without being able to understand one another and this was certainly no little pain to them monsieur villars who perceived it advanced forward to serve as an interpreter if he did not say every thing they said it is at least very certain that he spoiled nothing of their conversation and that he mingled a great deal of tenderness and passion with it the king was dressed a la scombergue which is properly after the french mode and all his attendants were clad after the same manner for the campaign habits of the spaniards somewhat resemble ours  the marquess de villars having observed that the gandees of spain took the right hand spoke to the king about it and represented to him the rank the marquess de los balbazez had given to him at fountainbleau when the queen was espoused there this reason prevailed so the king ordered the ambassadors of france to be treated after the same manner the constable of castile could not be brought to quit his place without some trouble he had still a small dispute upon the point which continued a little time between the ambassador and him however civility was still preserved on both sides and the rest of the grandees placed themselves behind the king on antonio de benavidez y bazan patriarch of the indies and grand almoner gave them a second benediction the ceremony was performed incognito in the queens antichamber if the archbishop of burgos had not been indisposed he had performed this office whilst mass was saying they put a ribbond of black taffaty about the king and queen tied up in a true lovers knot and a white gauze with a silver fringe upon the kings shoulders and over the queens head the duchess de terra nova held up her train when the ceremony was over the king and queen withdrew into a chamber by themselves where they continued two hours alone they dined afterward in public and parted from thence to go and lie at burgos there was no body with them in the coach and since they did understand one another but very little one can scarce imagine what they said however the king appeared very amorous and affectionate several grandees of spain went before their majestys with very stately liveries and accompanied them to the palace where a comedy was acted and artificial fireworks were to be seen  the next day the king came to a rich abbey of nuns that are called las huelgas which is not much beyond the suburbs of burgos she dined there and about three a clock made her entry on horseback being dressed after the spanish mode but appeared so beautiful and charming that she ravished the hearts of all the spectators three grandees marched before her the marquess dastorgas followed her a canopy was carried over her head the old duchess de terra nova rode upon a mule and the maids of honor accompanied her on horseback on the twenty second of november prince dharcourt made his entry and had audience of the king and queen after dinner there was a bullfeast which pleased the queen exceedingly because the cavaliers showed extraordinary dexterity and courage in the performance the day following she saw the parejas that is to say an horserace in which nothing is observable but that two men who start together ride even without going a step one before the other although they ride full speed sixty gentlemen clad in silver brocard ran after this manner  after they had thus spent three days in different pleasures and diversions it was high time to think of going to madrid most of the french gentlemen and ladies that followed the queen took leave of her in this place so that the greatest part of the household went back to france but this was not done without shedding abundance of tears the queen had the liberty still to keep with her her two nurses two women of the chamber some valets de chamber a gentleman to look after five or six english horses she had ordered to be brought with her and some other officers for her table she presented the prince and princess dharcourt the marshal dclarembauts lady and madam de grance with her picture enriched with diamonds of different prices according to the quality of the persons to whom she gave them and the obliging manner wherewith she knew how to accompany her liberalities augmented the price of them exceedingly they pretend that the present the king made the prince dharcourt was worth twenty hundred thousand crowns but it fell much short of it the queen got a pension of two thousand crowns for madam de grance which was to be paid her wherever she lived  the princess dharcourt and the other ladies that followed the queen went back to france while she and the king took the way to madrid being both by themselves and sat in the back part of the coach several officers of the household went before and marched by different roads to avoid an embarras the counts darcos and de talara don joseph de silva and the duke dhijar gentlemen of the chamber were named by the king to accompany him in his journey he came back the very same way as he went to burgos he lay at lerma at aranda at st stephen de gormas and at guadalajara the nuncio and the venetian ambassador came thither to make their complements to the queen the next day their majestys arrived at torrejon which is within three leagues of madrid  all the while that the court was on the way from burgos to this place the camerara major frequently discoursed the king in private she found it no difficult matter to insinuate those sentiments into him that are so natural to the spaniards and he had for his share been educated in a country where they make no reckoning of a ladies virtue unless they take away from her all opportunities of transgressing she represented to him the ill consequences of that liberty which the women are allowed in france that it was absolutely necessary for the queen to live after the retired manner that those of her sex observe at madrid that she was young lively and of a brillant spirit accustomed to the french fashions that what is innocent in one place may become criminal in another but if he would be pleased to confide in her she would by her great diligence prevent every thing the king commended her zeal and gave her sufficient assurances of his confidence  the queen mother was arrived at torrejon before the king she quitted her apartment to go and meet their majestys when the king saw her he ran to her and embraced her very tenderly the young queen advanced forward at the same time to kiss her hand but the queen mother would not suffer it she took her between her arms and embraced her several times with great testimonies of friendship treating her still by the name of her majesty but the young queen told her that she requested her to call her daughter and love her as one and to be persuaded that she had all those dutiful sentiments for her that might make her worthy of this honor the king gave her his hand on one side and the queen mother on the other and thus going between them she entered the palace that had been prepared to receive them the queen mother perceiving that the queen had never a muff presented her with her own about which was a great knot of diamonds afterward she took from her a ribbond that tied some of her tresses and in exchange put upon her arm a bracelet that was computed to be worth three thousand pistols in a word she showed the queen all marks of her good inclinations to her from which she might promise her self all happy consequences she staid with their majestys as long as she could but went home that evening because this place had not conveneincies enough to receive her the next day which was the second of december the king and queen arrived at madrid in a coach with the curtains open that they might be seen by the people they went down to our ladies datocha where te deum was sung and at night lay at buenretiro the next day a comedy was acted and some french musicians that followed the queen prepared some operas  the duchess de terra nova being resolved to take entirely from the queen that little liberty that remained to her and desiring to continue sole mistress of her majestys will declared when she was arrived at buenretiro that no body of what quality or condition soever should see the queen till after she had made her public entry this was a sorrowful state and a heavy restraint to the young queen to find her self thus all on a sudden shut up from those persons that either might have afforded her some consolation or diversion or useful advice she kept her in this solitary condition at retiro without permitting her so much as to go out of her apartment all the entertainment they regaled her with was to see long fulsom tedious comedies little of which they understood and the terrible camerara was incessantly before her eyes with a severe affected air and never laughed but was perpetually finding fault with something or other she was a professed enemy to all manner of pleasure and she treated her mistress with as much authority as a governess would use toward a little girl  the marquess de villars knew all that passed and was mightily concerned at it but it was not time as yet to speak of it he sent to the duchess de terra nova to know whether he might have leave to salute the queen she answered him just as she did all the rest of the world that she was not to be seen till after the entry was over this answer he looked upon to be so positive that not desirous to run the risque of meeting a second refusal he was sorced to acquiesce but the queen being informed of what had happened by some of the french women that still continued with her could not forbear to acquaint the king with it and obtained leave to see our ambassador de secreto that is to say as a private person she immediately took care to inform him of it and the marchioness de villars imagining that she might likewise have the favor of the same privilege sent to the camerara major to know whether she might be admitted to wait upon the queen but she received the same answer that monsieur the ambassador had received from her before saying in a few words she had no order to let her in the gentleman that discoursed the matter with her still insisted that she had something of moment to say to her it is all one says the camerara i will never suffer any new customs to be introduced within these walls  her majesty not knowing what had passed between the camerara and the ambassadors lady charged her confessor to tell her that she desired to see her and that she would extremely oblige her by making her a visit but she was not in a capacity to obey the orders she had received and the confessor being informed what obstacles stood in the way very fairly gave the queen an account of all she was not a little troubled at the ill services the duchess had done her and one may be able to judge by these few instances what an absolute power that old lady assumed in the queens house and over the queens person the queen mother who came every day to retiro observed an air of melancholy in the looks of the young princess which sufficiently testified her disquietude within she easily apprehended that a person of her age could not choose but be disgusted at the severity of the camerara so she thought her self obliged to acquaint the king with it and desired him that he would be pleased to treat her after a more gentle method she succeeded in her petition and procured leave for the marchioness de villars to go and wait upon the queen who was introduced into her apartment through that of the duchess de terra nova who appeared less savage and somewhat more respectful to her than she used to be the king according to the custom of spain sat in a chair of state the two queens upon two low stools and presently another was brought for the ambassadors lady soon after the queen mother going out along with the king she found her self alone with the queen who seeing she was now at liberty to talk could not forbear to shed some tears as she acquainted her with the sorrowful life she led after she somewhat eased her self by recounting to her the several ill usages that so much disturbed her the ambassadors lady did not fail to apply those consolations she judged expedient for one in her condition she made her sensible that this life so full of constraint as it was and for which she expressed so great a reluctance was yet the very same that all the queens and insantas of spain had ever been accustomed to that there was nothing particular in what she suffered and consequently was not designed to disoblige her that she ought to hope that when the king was better acquainted with her and saw he had an entire possession of her heart he might out of complaisance allow her some relaxations which hitherto her predecessors had never enjoyed that since the queen mother loved her and cherished her interest as her own she could not do too much to cultivate that friendship which would be so advantageous and necessary to her that in the distribution of humane things the greatest happiness is always attended with some inconveniences that she was now elevated to the supreamest grandeur upon earth which heaven would have her purchase at the expense of a few mortifications but that her complaisance to the king and queen mother would soon deliver her out of them she likewise told her several things which in the conduct she was to observe toward the rest of the court might assist her to support the beginnings and render what followed more agreeable to her  madam de villars spoke with a great deal of zeal of the queen mother but the young queen being not as yet disingaged from those sentiments with which she had been lately possessed looked upon all this discourse as designed to mislead her and tho she ought to have considered that the ambassadress could have no other views in what she told her than only to make her sensible of her own true interrests yet these advices did not at that time make those impressions upon her as one could have wished they had for her good her prejudices to the queen mother which were perpetually inspired into her balanced the confidence she had in madam de villars and her mind that was only accustomed to be entertained with those agreeable things that use to employ persons of her youth her temper that was naturally free and lively dissipated the application she ought to have made in order to distinguish good counsels from bad she knew just enough to embarrass her and give her occasions of being uneasy but could not tell how to disintangle her self and for want of a steady resolution to free her self from these melancholy ideas thought it too great a fatigue to solve these apparent contradictions so she continued under this uncertainty without being able to rescue her self from it and perhaps by this means lost a favorable juncture that then offered it self to deliver her from the subjection under which the duchess kept her afterward the ambassador of france saw her sometimes whilst she continued at retiro but this was before company and besides the time they allotted him to be with her was so short that in those general visits they could discourse of no particular affairs  the queen mother continued to visit the queen often she desired her to dress herself after the french fashion because she never beheld her in that dress she did so and the queen mother liked it extremely well when she was returned to her palace which is the house of the duke duzeda and is one of the finest in madrid the young queen sent her two little cabinets full of pretty curiosities she on the other hand procured her by way of exchange the diversion of going a hunting at pardo she had not been on horseback since she came to retiro the king killed a wild boar before her and after that day they went frequently to the chase together  the councils of the inquisition of castile of italy of flanders of arragon of the indies of war of the finances of the crusade and of the orders went on new years day to wish a happy year to their majestys for this is the custom in spain  the marquess sera a genoese offered to make the naples squadron consist of fourteen galleys which was never more than seven and not put the king to any expense provided he would allow him the same conditions that the duke de tursis had at genoa he had made this proposal to don juan some time before his death who found it to be very advantageous however their resolutions are so long a taking in spain and they have so small a consideration for novelties of whatsoever use they may prove that it is almost impossible to introduce one and this affair it seems met with the same fortune  the marquess de los balbazez took the oath of fidelity for his place of counselor of state and don manuel de lira did the same for that of secretary of state in italy the duke dossone still expected that they would accommodate the dispute between him and the marquess dastorgas but seeing that they said nothing to him about it he took up a resolution to go no more to court and appeared every day in the city with a great equipage this is often enough practiced in spain  there are some people in the world that are never to be discountenanced by a repulse and father vintimiglia was of this number although he had received no manner of answer to the memorial he gave the prince dharcourt at bayonna to present to the queen yet he could not forbear to draw up a second wherein he regulated all the monarchy he entrusted a french gentleman with it who promised to find out some means or other to give the queen a sight of it but whether he showed it her or not it is certain that vintimiglia by an express order of the king was banished out of all his dominions he betook himself to the ambassador of france and nothing more became of the matter  twas expected that immediately after the kings return some sort of government would be established to settle affairs in their old course which had been entirely suspended ever since the death of don juan just as his death happened every thing was making ready for the journey which employed all the court and the king in particular his marriage might well enough detain him some time from making those applications he ought to use in the choice of an able minister and the world was not at all surprised to find him forget the concerns of the kingdom in general at a time when he was wholly possessed with a passion for his queen and had his head full of those agreeable ideas which all lovers amuse themselves with but now when that business was over they impatiently expected to see him take up some fixed resolutions the queen mother who was newly returned from her exile thought of nothing else than how to preserve her self in the favorable situation she in was in at present and no body in a manner was so interested with the king as to be able to pretend to the ministry thus the whole government was lodged in the hands of a monarch who was but    years old and who was never so well versed in things of lesser consequence as to have any just knowledge in greater affairs  the only man that shared the monarchy with him was don jeronimo deguya who had been secretary of state four years to which post he arrived from that of a simple commissary his address together with his good fortune rendered him agreeable to the king who had followed no other counsel than his unless deguya who was fearful of giving it sometimes had not advised him to consult the constable of castile and the duke de medina celi in certain affairs because he had no mind to answer for every thing himself it is indeed true that during the journey nothing of importance was debated upon for they only busied themselves about that in particular and the orders that are necessary to be given upon such occasions  the court became now very full the kings marriage and the return of the q mother had brought together the most considerable persons of the kingdom every family was consulting about the measures that were to advance some particular man amongst them to the chief ministry some wished their relations had it others desired it for their friends and abundance of people wished to enjoy it themselves among those that had the justest pretensions were reckoned the constable of castile and the duke de medina celi they were both of them furnished with great personal qualities were both of an illustrious birth and considerable fortune they possessed the chief offices of the crown were counselors of state and their merits equally distinguished them but nothing was more opposite than these two lords were to one another an old spirit of hatred which they were not able to suppress and which they had testified in a thousand rencounters increased their common emulation their humors and inclinations were as contrary as night is to day several of their common friends had endeavored to reconcile them but their pains were to no purpose they were all sensible that if they concerted matters together they would reciprocally render good offices to one another which might serve to advance their fortune this was one of the reasons they used to accomodate the matter between them but sometimes we meet with aversions that are never to be surmounted and this i have mentioned was of that number  the duke de medina celi was    years old his humor sweet and good natured but too slow and careless in matters of moment of an insinuating agreeable spirit he was descended of the illustrious houses of castile and de foix he is seven times a grandee of spain his wife was heiress of the house of arragon de cardonne she is very rich on her side as well as he is on his he was president of the council of the indies sommellor du corpse that is to say high chamberlain he made his court regularly and always testified a particular zeal for the person of the king and his majesty as he never fails upon that point expressed a certain affection for him which he never showed to any one besides this made the world believe that he stood fairer for the ministry than all his competitors  the constable of castile descended of the house de valasco was    years old and was master of a considerable estate nevertheless he did not live easy amidst all his wealth he is the tenth hereditary constable of castile dean of the council of state and grand master of the kings household his genius is vast his abilities and knowledge are surprising and he was always concerned in employments where he acquired experience the last of his governments was that of flanders and although these posts ought to have made him sociable and familiar yet he always preserved so severe and rigid a character that it rendered him terrible access to him is very difficult and his humor is naturally so imperious that he can never submit and this is the reason why he was embroiled so deeply with don juan and hindering him from receiving several favors which that prince would otherwise have willingly bestowed upon him to have brought him over to his own party it is true he declared himself very violently for the queen mother and this might be one of the principal causes that kept him from being of don juans faction no body doubted but that the king respected him very much for what the queen mother might say in favor of him and the world was persuaded that among those persons whose merits she would recommend to the king the constable would be the first who besides this would unquestionably find himself supported by all the party that had been ill treated by don juan and by all those that continued still in the interests of the queen mother she was obliged for her own proper interests to procure the kings savor and the favourites place for the constable but amidst all these flattering appearances he seemed to be very indifferent in the matter whether it were because the ill posture of affairs and the tender age of the king made him apprehend some danger to be in the chief post or because he was sensible that he had not a prospect of obtaining it at one step and so was willing to ascend it by degrees he seemed to desire that a junto were established for the government wherein he would bear his share with the inquisitor general and the marquess de mansera he sometimes told his friends that the weight of great affairs astonished him and that he found it a harder matter to adjust them than those persons who behold them only at a distance can well imagine and that all his ambition was to contribute what in him lay to the erecting a junto  the queen mother was not unwilling to have this project take effect because this was the way to keep the entire authority in her own hands for the council being composed of her creatures they would in all probability act according to her directions the constable for his part secretly promised that by his conduct and management he would always keep the upper hand over the other two and that thus his companions would only enable him to bear the public hatred in case any thing should meet with ill success  but this junto that would lodge all the authority in the hands of three persons only destroyed at the same time the expectations of all those that would have it be divided amongst more out of a consideration of their own interest this party desired to have it full as numerous as it was during the regency and would have it composed of the cardinal portocarero archbishop of toledo of don melchior navarra who had been formerly vice chancellor of arragon of the duke de medina celi and the other three whom i have mentioned  after so many different projects people were so well satisfied that the council at last would be only composed of the queenmothers creatures that the alarm became general to those persons who had been devoted to don juan and were very apprehensive of the credit of the queen mother and the advancement of the constable several of them assembled hereupon they beheld their ruin in the elevation of the contrary party and united themselves to the duke de medina celi to find protection from him out of hopes of beholding him made chief minister they considered that it would be more advantageous to them to see one man made happy who was sure to befriend them than to see three happy persons depending upon one alone who had just reasons to wish them ill  the duke de medina celi was of an equal and peaceable temper which rendered him agreeable to the king this good fortune which seemed particular to himself made him be looked upon by the greater part of the courtiers as the only man that ought to pretend to this favor in a court where the greatness of rank and birth is one of the most essential qualities to recommend a chief minister those that penetrated into the true disposition of the king saw very well that in the midst of these different parties the duke could not fail to get the better but whether it was an effect of his prudence and moderation or whether it was occasioned by the intrigues of those persons that were on the contrary side he advanced but slowly it appears probable that the greatest part of his ambition came from his friends and that he rather followed the advices they inspired into him than his own proper inclinations i desire the same thing that you do would he say to them but in truth the tranquillity a man abandons to expose himself to all the murmurs of the people and to all public inquietudes very much moderates the pleasure that is inseparable from so great a post and unless it were for the service we hereby render to our master i cannot imagine how any man could find any satisfaction in a thing that draws so many hazards along with it  thus people busied themselves about the two different factions that were formed by the constable supported by the queen mother and by the duke de medina celi who was seended by all the creatures of don juan but while these rivals were openly disputing the prize and all the court seemed divided between them every one embracing a party according to his own inclinations don jeronimo deguya formed a third almost alone he saw himself all on the sudden made secretary of state when the marquis de valenzuela after the removal of f nitard became the queenmothers favorite and took away that office from don pedro fernandez del campo who did not behave himself supple and submissive enough to him so that we may say his haughtiness was the occasion of his fall valenzuela having no reason to be content with him obliged him to quit his office and bestowed it upon deguya  he had too fresh an example before his eyes to fall into the same fault and being very adroit complaisant and well enough versed in dissimulation neglected nothing to please valenzuela as long as he stood upon his feet but when he saw his fortune declining and that the court declared in favor of don juan he presently copied after them and presented himself during that ministry by his exemplary submission he was one of the first that espoused his party and was likewise one of the first that abandoned the prince when he saw his credit began to sink in the world nay some time before the end of don juan he managed himself as he had done before valenzuelas fall he entered into a correspondence with the queen mother assuring her that he would only depend upon her so whether she was really persuaded of his sincerity or had not as yet a fit occasion to remove him from his post she suffered him to continue in it without the least molestation  in all these changes he only held his place by a commission but as this furnished him with an occasion to see the king perpetually and to discourse him in private about all affairs so he made use of this opportunity to possess him with a distrust of all those that might with justice make pretensions to his savor nay even of the most considerable persons so that being only a simple secretary of state by a commission and in all appearance of a narrow unexperienced genius he beheld himself in a capacity to balance at one time two powerful parties so that neither one nor the other could succeed in their affairs so long as he opposed them  whatsoever inclinations the king had for the duke de medina celi don jeronimo frustrated them by awakening him with an idea of don juans ministry the slavery he then suffered the persecution of the queen mother so many persons of quality ill used without any occasion the misery of the people and many other disorders that inevitably happen when the government is abandoned to the caprice of one man on the other hand he represented a junto to him as a company of ministers that would command every body and everlastingly embarras their own affairs by their jealousies and mutual discords that it would be a burden to himself as well as unprofitable to the state that juntos might do some good under a minority but that his majesty was too far advanced in age to want any governors that suppose he were pleased to compose one vet the obligation he had to make the constable one of the number would involve him in new difficulties that his temper was haughty and imperious in authority and that he was wholly devoted to the queen mother that she had been accustomed to govern and would easily come to be mistress again by the help of a junto composed of her own creatures that since he was married and had prudence and wit sufficient he ought to manage himself and that if ever he was prevailed upon to do otherwise he would find himself by little and little reduced to those sufferings from which he desired to free him  it is natural for a young king to desire to be at large and independent so whilst he continued thus in suspense eguya was master of all affairs the confessor possessed the king with the same sentiments to choose no chief minister upon whom he must depend and the duchess deterra nova found herself equally concerned to keep off the queen mother a junto and a favorite during this interregnum she had opportunity enough to fix and settle herself in the kings good opinion she did not question but if the q mother happened to be once more mistress she would endeavor either by herself or by her creatures to turn her out of the court this consideration obliged her to discourse frequently with the king and her only care was to persuade him that he ought to be apprehensive of the queen mothers designs she likewise inspired him with the same distrust of the queen whose youth and easiness of temper made her incapable of taking strict measures she constantly whispered some disagreeable things or other into his ear that only tended to disquiet him but he preserved so great a love for his queen that nothwithstanding he believed all the stories this old beldam told him he never had the less affection and tenderness for her  the court continued still at buenretiro that is to say without madrid expecting the queen to make her entry after which they were to go and lodge in the palace the preparations for her entry were very long it was commonly believed for some time that the queen was with child but all these hopes vanishing about the beginning of january    0 she made her entry on the   th of the same month the queen mother went in the morning to buenritiro from whence she parted some time after along with the king they went together to see all the streets through which the queen was to pass and stayed at the countess dognates in a balcony made on purpose and having a lattice window gilt all over the avenues that led to retiro were all shut up and a prohibition was issued out for any coach to go that way about eleven the queen mounted on horseback those that were to go before began to march and passed through a marble gate which was but lately built the kettle drums and the trumpets of the city in their habits used in these ceremonies marched at the head of all after them the alcaldes of the court the nobility the knights of the three military orders the gentlemen of the kings house the mayor domos to the queen and the grandees of spain followed by great number of lacquays whose different liveries of brocard and galloon of gold and silver of a mixed color made an agreeable diversity the querries of the queen marched on foot immediately before her the count de villa mayana was on her right hand who was her chief gentleman usher she was surrounded with her menins and pages of honor when she walks on foot she always leans upon one of them the duchess de terra nova followed her and donna loura de alargon governante of the maids of honor both of them mounted upon their mules and in their widows habit which somewhat resembles that of religious women except that when they are on horseback they wear great hats on their heads which made no less terrible a figure than the rest of their garb but people saw after this with a great deal of pleasure donna teresa de toledo donna francisca henriquez donna maria de gusman josepha de figueroa and donna manuela de velasco maids of honor to the queen all very beautiful and richly dressed they were on horseback each of them was accompanied by their relations in the midst of whom they marched there were several led horses admirably fine led by grooms clad in rich liveries and the passage was shut up by the guards de la lancilla at the prado which is one of the most agreeable walks in madrid by reason of the several fountains that water it continually was to be seen a gallery open on every side with one and twenty arches there were several jettings out in it on which the arms of the several kingdoms under the dominion of spain were affixed to pillars that supported some gilt statues which carried devices in honor of the queen with crowns and inscriptions that had a relation to the several kingdoms the queen found at the end of the gallery a triumphal arch very magnificent and well designed through which she entered into the city the corrigidor and the rigidors apparelled in brocard of gold of a red crimson color with bonnets and breeches such as the ancient castilians wore presented her with the keys of the city and with a canopy which they carried over her head during the procession the streets were adorned with the richest tapestries and the precious stones that were to be seen in the goldsmiths row were valued at eleven millions it would take up too much time to describe all the magnificences of that day i shall only content my self to say that the queen was mounted upon a fine andaluzian horse which in this noble march seemed proud to carry so beautiful and great a princess her habit was so covered with embroidery that the stuff was not to be seen she wore on her hat white plumes mixed with red and a pearl called there the peregrina which is as big as a small catherine pear and is of an inestimable value hung below a clasp of diamonds with which her hat was beset she wore on her finger the great diamond of the king which as they pretend surpasses in beauty any thing of that nature that was ever set in a ring but the graceful deportment of the queen in all her actions and particularly in the management of her horse and the charms of her person made a greater luster than all the precious stones she wore although it is certain that people could scarce behold the glittering of them she made an halt before the balcony of the countess dognate to salute the king and queen mother they opened the lattice about   broad fingers to see her and the k taking his handerchief in his hand carried it several times to his mouth his eyes and his heart which is the greatest piece of gallantry in spain she went on her procession and the king with the queen mother received her in the court of the pailace he helped her to light off her horse and the other taking her by the hand conducted her to her apartment where she embraced her often telling her that she was ever happy to have so amiable a daughter in law that evening there were rious fireworks and illuminations for three nights together the king next day went to the royal chapel where the queen was likewise in her chair of state the ambassadors and grandees were there according to the custom and te deum was sung after dinner the king and queen went out together which was the first time of their appearing in public they were in a chariot made like a tiumphal coach without a crown upon it and open on all sides to show themselves to the people they traversed the great square before the palace and passed through several streets where the balconies were full of ladies who mingled their acclamations with those of the people the grandees followed their majestys in very rich coaches with a great number of livery men there were abundance of these lords who for nine days together had nine different liveries and each finer than the other after this manner they went to our ladies datocha and it being already night before they returned to the palace white wax tapers were lighted at all the windows and the streets were so prettily illuminated by them that a man might almost see from one end of the city to the other the finest show of these lights was at the placa mayor which is a very large noble square the houses are built with five rows of balconies one over another and could reckon above three thousand tapers in all as soon as the king and queen were arrived there the fireworks began many other diversions lasted for several days sometimes their majestys went a hunting at other times to a comedy or took a walk sometimes they went to sup with the queen mother or the queen mother came to eat with them at the palace all the ladies had the honor to kiss the queens hand the councils and the grandees complemented her also  some days after her entry a bullfeast was kept at madrid which was the most magnificent of the kind that had been seen for a long time the king and the queen came to the great square about one a clock in the afternoon afterward entered the duke de medina sidonia the marquess camaraza grandees of spain don felix de cordova second son of the duke de sessa don francisco moscoso and don fernando de lea a gentleman of cordova each of them followed by an hundred lacqueys some dressed after the turkish others ofter the grecian fashion and after this manner they represented several nations they combated the bulls with extraordinary dexterity and courage the son of the duke de sessa had two horses killed under him this sport is an old remainder of the moors whose genius and customs are not entirely extinguished in spain although they themselves have been long turned out of it the spaniards still seem to preserve something of the barbarity of those people since they do so freely expose themselves to the rage of mad bulls to divert the public but to say the truth this representation is one of the finest things in the world and nothing can afford so agreeable a prospect as the place of the combat which is prodigiously spacious encompassed with five ranks of balconies all equal and regular and curiously set out with rich hangings and furniture as well as filled with almost an infinite number of spectators  the king on the eighteenth of january named the marquess dossera to go viceroy per interim of sardinia because the count degmon was not as yet in a condition to go thither he named the same day the marquess de fuentes son to him who had been ambassador in france to go thither in that quality in the room of the duke de giovenazzo who from an envoy to the court of savoy was nominated to that of france but it seems was at last destined to return to turin  in the mean time the marquess de villa mayna chief gentleman usher to the queen discharged the office of master of the horse in the place of the duke dossone who for his ill conduct was prohibited to come to the palace the marquess dastorgas took the advantage of his absence to make his own court and although he had been indisposed and continued to be so still yet he went every day with five coaches of extraordinary fineness and a numerous retinue of liverymen to wait upon the king the duke dossone being informed of it resolved to meet him and give him some affront so he took abundance of people with him and knowing which way the marquess was to pass he ordered his coachman to drive thither full speed and to overturn the marquesss coach in case he was within it happened he went that day in a chair and his coaches followed him but the duke dossones coachman for all that met with him so conveniently that he threw him along in the river this rencounter made a great noise and did not at all accommodate the affairs of the duke which before this were in no good condition  madam the constable colonnas lady who went out of the convent where she sojourned to behold the queens entry staid with the marchioness de los balbazez till the fifth of february when she was carried away by the kings order to a convent some leagues off madrid  it is the custom of spain that upon all solemn occasions whether of joy or grief all the kingdoms and all the principalities that depend upon the king send their deputies to complement him thus don pedro de salinas y unda came in the name of the principality of davila accompanied with the duke de pastrane and don joseph de silva his brother to kiss the kings hand and complement him upon the score of his marriage the kingdoms of naples navar arragon granada and diverse other places sent likewise after the king had given them audience he took the queen along with him to a great hunting of the wild boar where they killed abundance of them the duke de pastrane who exercised the office of chief ranger in the absence of the marquess de liche conducted the queen to a place in the forest that was extremely pleasant several streams of water ran by the place and under some of the highest trees a pavilion of gold brocard adorned with a fringe of the same was set up all the trees were covered with little apes squirrels and parrots and a thousand other birds that were fastened to them young boys that were dressed like fauns and silvanes and girls apparelled like nymphs and driades and sphepherdesses served up a noble collation to her majesty who seemed to be at first extremely pleased with the entertainment but although no body knew what it was that disquieted her afterward she appeared to be very sad all the remainder of the day  on candlemas day there was a procession in the galleries of the palace the religious of the mendicant orders and all the ecclesiastics belonging to the chapel walked before the pages of the king and those of the queen followed after the grandees of spain marched before their majestys the duchess de terra nova held up the queens train the maids of honor came next and there did not seem to be above eighteen or twenty of them it is not here as in other holidays where they all wait upon their sovereign  tho the young queen changed her place of abode yet she did not change that solitary and disagreeable life she led at buen retiro under the guard of the duchess de terra nova she governed her like a child and continued still to treat her after a worse manner unless it were that she was permitted to receive the visits of some ladies which oftentimes appeared more tedious to her than even solitude it self not that they wanted wit for no body can reproach them with want of that but the queen understood but a little of what they said and besides could not repose that confidence in them which gives liberty and life and spirit to conversation all was grandeur and ceremony and reverence and state much about this time i had the honor to kiss her hand but she could not forbear smiling to see me so much altered for the worse by my spanish garb for unless her self alone i never saw a stranger look well in that habit after i had passed through her apartments which to say the truth were exceeding pretty i found her in her closet which was painted and gilded and set out with great looking glasses fastened to the ceiling she sat upon a little square stool near the window making gold net work mingled with blew silk her hair was parted in the middle of her head which was bare only one knot of her hair was curled and plaited with great pearls and reached down to her waste she had a velvet robe on of a rose color embroidered with silver and had pendants in her ears that touched her very breast and so heavy that she gave her self the trouble to takeout one of them that i might pass my judgment on it and i was exceedingly surprised at it she spoke very little french to me affecting to talk spanish before the camarera major she ordered me to send her all the letters i received from france which had any news in them to which i replied that the news which was sent to me did not deserve the consideration of so great a queen ah good god cried she lifting up her eyes with a charming air i shall never think meanly of any thing that comes out of a country which is so dear to me this affection said i to her which your majesty preserves for your own native country makes me hope every thing madam since as i have the happiness to be one so i have all the inclinations of a good french woman she answered this with her usual goodness and whispered me in french that she would rather see me apparalled after the french fashion than that of spain but madam said i to her it is a sacrifice which i have made to the respect i have for your majesty say rather continued she with a smiling air that the rigid temper of the duchess has frightened you she appeared to me so very charming that day that i could not forbear to admire her for in spite of her melancholy she was plump and in good liking and that contributed to make her still more beautiful and agreeable  when i came back to my lodgings i found my letters from france were arrived there was one amongst the rest which i supposed would please the queen so i made all the haste i could the next morning to carry it to her but the camarera would not suffer me to have the honor of seeing the queen two days together therefore i was contented to write to the duchess desiring her to present that letter to the queen behold the contents of it  i am of opinion madam that i cannot send you better news to day than that of the marriage of mademoiselle de blois with monsieur the prince de conty the contract of the marriage was signed on the fifteenth of this month in the kings chamber who went about seven a clock at night to the queens apartment and afterward returned to his own with all the royal family the prince de conty led mademoiselle de blois she was set out with the finest jewels in the world all which together did not glitter so brightly as her eyes and whose luster was inferior to the lillies and roses of her complexion all the court was in a transport as soon as she appeared and the majesty of her stature was not a little increased by a train five else long which mademoiselle de nante carried the king drew near to a table that stood against the wall the queen was on his left hand and next after monseignear monsieur madam mademoiselle dorleans madam the duchess of tuscany madam de guise monsieur the prince and monsieur the duke and madam the duchess the prince de la roche suryon mademoiselle de bourbon the princess de carignan the count de vermandois the count du maine mademoiselle de nante and mademoiselle de tours all placed in a demicircle about the table the prince de conty and mademoiselle de blois came one after the other within the demicircle over against the table the marquess de seignelay drew near to the king and read the beginning of the contract with a loud voice but he had scarce read the qualifications when the king told him twas enough and so signed the contract after all the royal family had signed it the cardinal de bouillon entered and advanced forward to the middle of the chamber then the prince de conty and mademoiselle de blois approached up to him and performed the ceremony of the betrothing the princesss name as you know is anna maria and the princes louis armand this ceremony being over the king and all the court went to see an opera next day the cardinal de bouillon married this young prince and beautiful princess in the chapel of the old castle in the presence of the king the queen and all the court the king dined with all the royal family at night a comedy was acted and after that there was a great supper where without reckoning the princes and princesses of the blood there were fifty ladies that sat at one table which was served with three services of two hundred dishes each the cardinal bouillon blessed the bed the king gave the shift to the prince of conty and the queen to the princess next morning their majestys went to see her at her apartment in the new castle the king has given her the duchy de vaujour a million of money in hand a pension of a hundred thousand livers and abundance of jewels to the prince de conty fifty thousand crowns in hand and a pension of twenty thousand to the prince de la roche suryon  from st germains the   th of jan    0  the queen mother had given all imaginable assistance to the queen of spain to deliver her from part of her troubles if she could have cured her self of those suspicions with which some people had possessed her against her but she unhappily imagining that the other still regretted the archdutchess and would have been glad to see her in her place that opinion made her extremely distrustful and the queen mother who found nothing of that openness of heart and freedom as she desired was likewise troubled for her part for in effect she loved her tenderly and was ready to give her all possible testimonies of her affection  the ambassador of france his lady and the confessor often reminded the queen of that conduct she was to observe if she intended to be happy they told her that she ought to give her self entirely up to the queen her mother in law out of a principle of duty and gratitude for the friendship she showed her as out of a consideration of her own proper interests they represented to her that the queen mother ought not to be suspected by her and that although the archdutchess was her grand daughter yet she had received such few tokens and assurances of friendship from the emperor during her disgrace that she was too sensible ever to forget it that the conduct of france toward her was directly opposite to this that there she had been pitied and obliged that her most christian majesty had over preserved a strict correspondence and friendship with her and that the queen mother knew well enough that she could not by any returns oblige the queen of france more than by showing back all that kindness to the young queen of spain that she had all the agreements in her which could engage her heart that besides this she hoped to see her give an heir to the crown that this was necessary for the good of spain that the melancholy humor to which she abandoned her self might hinder her from having one that they ought to concert all their affairs together in order to possess the good graces and inclinations of the king that it was natural to believe he would divide his power between his mother and his queen rather than bestow it upon a favorite who would think of serving him no longer than his family reaped advantage by it whereas the souls of sovereigns having something in them that was more noble and great than those of private persons the motives of interest would never be supposed to influence two queens so much as they would a chief minister that in fine there ought to be no separation between them but that they must begin with the union of their hearts  the queen relished these reasons and found them plausible enough but for all that she relapsed all on a sudden into her old distrust into which the different things that had been said to her did cast her anew besides the extreme trouble she suffered from the rigid conduct of the duchess de terra nova she found her so absolute and inflexible that she began to fear her to which the tenderness of her youth her want of experience and her natural sweetness contributed not a little so that she could not open her self to the queen mother when she considered that if she did not really love her but would make invidious reflections upon what she said this would be the way to throw her into new inconveniences so that notwithstanding the desire she had to speak to her she was always silent in her company the queen mother perceived it well enough yet for all that she continued to visit her almost every day and sent her presents from time to time  at last the young queen being entirely vanquished by all these demonstrations of amity resolved to submit her self wholly to her directions they had a long conference together where they took those measures which they judged were necessary to promote their common satisfaction after this the queen mother spoke to the king but found him in a cold reserved humor so she made him no discoveries of any thing but took her opportunity to withdraw imagining with her self that her son would be obliged to come after her and that the world might take less notice of this alteration she gave out that she only desired to live easy and that she preferred her own repose to all other considerations whatsoever she talked after this rate before several persons in whom she reposed no ordinary confidence although at the bottom she was clearly of a different opinion  the constable was the first man that was aware of this alteration and was one of those who were mightily troubled at it he easily saw that the queen mother was leaving all thoughts of advancing him and as he had his own particular views so he used all the means in the world to effect his designs in fine he joined interests with the camarera major don jeronimo deguya and the kings confessor who brought the duke of alva into the same confederacy the design of these three last was to set up the constable against the duke de medina celi whose favor with the king increased as they thought very fast and this gave them violent jealousies of him the constable for his part endeavored to gain by them what they designed to make the duke de medina celi lose his emissaries began to promote the affair with very favorable appearances but after they had seriously reflected upon the imperious humor of the constable he is so arrogant and haughty said they that he would rather ruin every man of us than ever be brought to own that he was obliged to us for his eevation and whatever minister has his place will certainly be less dangerous than he  don jeronimo deguya who thought of nothing else but how to balance the credit  these two lords one with the other did not neect their reflections he mentioned them almost every day and endeavored to make them more strong if it were possible he ound it would be a great deal more advantageous to him to continue in the same condition than to see himself subjected to a new dependence and this reason obliged him to inspire the king with an aversion and jealousy for the constable so that instead of doing him any service as he promised he did him underhand all the ill offices imaginable  when our own particular interest lies at stake and we are pursuing the dictates of our ambition we are so clearsighted that it is a difficult matter for any one to deceive us long we penetrate even into the most secret thoughts of him that calls himself our friend and easily find out whether he does us good or ill pursuant to this maxim the constable soon perceived how well he was served by his friends and what designs each of them drove in particular it is no difficult matter to imagine how a person of his temper as i have already described resented this usage and his uneasiness to be sue was so much the more violent because he smothered it for some time before he let it break out  don jeronimo de eguya was the first person whom he attacked having represented to them one day in a full council and that with the greatest fierceness in the world how all affairs went from bad to worse he added that no body ought to be surprised to find it so since deguya who pretended to manage every thing had neither judgment nor experience nor capacity and that he ought to be confined to the duties of his post without meddling with those things that had no relation at all to it when he had ended his discourse don manuel de lira secretary of state of the council of italy who was of the constables faction presented to them at the same time a large memorial in which he laid open the vast prejudice which the state of affairs received from the ill conduct of de eguya and most of them there had been well enough satisfied if these complaints had obliged the king to remove him  don manuel de lira did not act only out of complaisance to the constable but had his own private ends he imagined that if deguya were once turned out of his post he might perhaps succeed him in it now nothing animates a mans zeal in any affair more than the prospect of some advantage or other to be gained by it however this same business did not meet with that success which he and the constable proposed to themselves so after long consideration the constable was obliged to come back to the queen mother and importune her to appear in favor of him he represented to her that if the chief minister was not one of her party her repose would not be of long continuance that the duke de medina celi stood very fair for it and although he advanced insensibly yet it was probable he would soon find himself possessed of a place where he would make his enemies severely feel the weight of his indignation that in spite of politics to which he pretended he would not fail to set up the president of castile against her who was a creature of don juan and always ready to execute those resentments that had lodged in his breast so long that this duke was the very person who formerly had the hardiness to carry her the order for her exile that he seemed at that time to rejoice at her misfortunes and perplexities that if ever he came to be favorite she would find him to be a constant rub in her way and that this conjecture perhaps was not ill grounded since the duke still possessed all the passions of don juan  the queen mother was alarmed at what the constable represented to her and gave him her word to act vigorously in his behalf but the duke de medina celi being advertised of it was resolved to prevent the blow and judged it the best expedient to soften the spirit of the queen mother by making a profound submission to her in fine he went to her and told her that he was resolved to be obliged to her for all the kings favors and desired to depend upon her out of an obligation of gratitude as he had done a long time ago out of duty and inclination that he humbly begged of her to do him the justice as to believe that his heart his birth and his fortune were too great ever to suffer him to be one of don juans creatures that he would never receive that title but from his own master and that the party must wear a crown who commanded the duke de medina celi that although he had declared himself for the president of castile yet it was not out of a consideration of don juan but the kings service and he was ready to abandon his interest at any time having no particular engagements of friendship to him and that if he appeared in this affair it was only done with a design to defend the authority of the king which the nuncio had a mind to invade in the conduct which he used toward the president the queen mother answered him that she did not without a great satisfaction believe what he said to be true that she had a great esteem for him and would not fail to give him convincing proofs of it in a short time  the constable being informed on his side that queen mother had very favorably received the submission of the duke whether out of a spirit of kindness or indifference to the choice the king might make of a chief minister dispaired at last of seeing himself succeed in any of his projects either of the junto whereof he pretended to be a member it one were erected or in the place of favorite which he could have desired rather to fill alone he resolved to merit something at least of the duke de medina celi by yielding up that post with a good grace when he was in a capacity to dispute it with him still  in short he laid hold of the first opportunity he could find to tell the king that no person was fitter to serve his majesty and preserve the government in good order than the duke de medina celi he bestowed wonderful commendations upon him for the good conduct he had ever used the free unconstrained manner wherein he spoke all this was exceeding remarkable especially in a man of the constables haughty temper who as the world imagined would dye a thousand times rather than offer this violence inwardly to himself but people at last believed that he designed to render himself agreeable to the king by commending a man for whom his majesty testified so great an inclination after all it must be confessed that he showed a generosity which is not common in treating his declared enemy after this manner  it cannot be easily imagined what a great detriment the republic received by these factions of the courtiers and the kings irresolution to take or not to take a chief minister nothing was concluded nothing was done a spirit of lethargy seemed to be predominant at court which helped to increase those perplexities under which the kingdom labored before every body languished to see what would be the success of the smallest matters and business that had been carried into the council tarried there whole years nay things that went directly into the kings hands were dispatched never the sooner thus no one knew what party to take or where to address himself  our ambassador who promised himself to find a better treatment than he had met with a long while and which he dexterously dissembled in expectation of the queens arrival perceived at last that they designed to satisfy him no better than the other ministers who made their complaints above five months were passed since he demanded justice for some violations of the peace that were lately committed as well by the governors of the provinces as by the taking of several vessels and the burning of others but at the time when he was urgent to have a positive answer he received a new injury by the insolence of an who is a kind of a provost or judge alcade and several these are sergeants and bailiffs alguazils who passed before his house which was never done at madrid in the quarter belonging to an ambassador he was extremely surprised at it but was so far from receiving the satisfaction that was due to him for this affront that they told him his majesty had given order that his quarter should be no longer exempt this resolution so much the more disgusted him because it affected only himself and all the other ambassadors enjoyed their privileges as formerly not but that they had several other complaints upon their hands as for example the envoy from the elector of brandenburgh made a great noise because they had amused him a long time with specious promises that had no effect at all they owed his master a great sum of money he demanded the payment of it but they shifted him off from time to time so that at last he perceived that they neither had the power nor inclination to satisfy him the nuncio did not seem to be less disgusted for his part because he saw the president of castile keep his place and continue still in favor although the pope had declared him suspended and he himself omitted no application to have justice done upon him  in the mean time they wanted money to raise four spanish regiments that were designed to be sent to milain because they apprehended some motion from the court of france but it was almost impossible to find any funds and besides this the silver that came from the indies in the flota was so suddenly gone and with so little order that no body knew what was become of it so that it was a difficult matter to send any returns into flanders or other places where there was occasion those that used to advance money upon these sorts of occasions would now do nothing at all they were all of them drained and the necessities were generally so great that they knew not where to take up money to defray the ordinary expenses of the king and queens house this proceeded in part from the disorder of the money a pistole which ought to go for no more than forty eight reals de vellon was raised up to a hundred and ten and the patacoons that are only worth twelve reals went at the rate of thirty the occasion of it was this a great part of the reals de vellon that are of copper were bad and the common custom made them pass as well in commerce as if they had been good but at last they were called in all on the sudden by reason of the excessive price a pistole was raised to and it is impossible to recount the disorders and inconveniences that attended this new regulation the court was of opinion in the month of februrary    0 that there was a necessity to find out some remedy or other suddenly for it so a pistole from a hundred and ten reals was levelled to forty eight the patacoons to twelve and the other money was so confounded one with the other that it was reduced to the eighth part of the ordinary value there was no body almost but lost more or less upon the account of this new regulation and accordingly felt it that which before the sinking the value of the money was worth forty reals which make four livers of french money since the reducing of it was worth a hundred and ten reals which is ten livers of our money so that what commodities a man could buy on monday for fifty sous went on the tuesday for above a third part more and the debtor who it may be on saturday owed twenty thousand reals de vellon which made but two hundred pistoles found to his sorrow the next day after that he owed near five hundred pistoles this ruined a great number of families and caused a mighty dejection in the spirits of the people for every thing a man has occasion to buy is dearer by much in madrid than any where else because they are brought a great way off and there are few or no manufactures at all in that part of the country a kind of a mutiny happened at toledo because after this sinking the value of money no care was taken to regulate the price of provisions for which they paid excessive rates it is still to be noted that the civil government in spain is managed but after a very sorry manner and that the slow lazy humor of those persons who might if they pleased correct the ill conduct of others contributes exceedingly to the public loss  all these disorders and continual complaints which made a noise from all quarters began at last to shake and undermine don jeronimo deguya he knew very well that the post wherein he stood was ticklish and dangerous and that after all his endeavors to disgust the world in case he remedied nothing the oblige maledictions and hatred would fall upon the favorite the present ill state of affairs was attributed to his ill conduct so he thought within himself that he could not too soon deliver himself from the torrent of the popular fury and therefore resolved to omit nothing whereby he might incline the king to choose a chief minister the consideration of his own interest soon determined him to act vigorously in favor of the duke de medina celi he knew the king had a particular affection for him and besides he persuaded himself that when the duke was informed what good offices he had done him he would maintain him still in his post as well out of a principle of acknowledgment as for the great services he might do him in these affairs since he had managed them for so long a time and consequently was in a capacity to furnish him with some necessary lights which all those persons that newly enter into the government are altogether unacquainted with and then he knew the natural sweetness of the dukes temper would never permit him to turn him out of his place and he was certain that as long as he continued in it he could manage the kings favor the functions of his place giving him opportunity to approach near the kings person very often  the camarera major and his majestys confessor had each of them particular designs in their head however they were both agreed as to the dukes advancement so that all the world concurring with the favorable dispositions which the king had for him he signed a decree that is the usual term with them in spain wherein he declared the duke de medina celi to be chief minister he immediately commanded father relux to carry it him who came to his house about ten a clock at night on the twenty first of february    0 and acquainted him with the good news  no body had any reason to be surprised at the dukes elevation it seems he had promised himself the place some time before whether it were because the king gave him his promise or that some outward appearances assured him of it  however it was it was agreed upon by all hands at court that the king could not have made a better choice he was a person in whom all good qualities were to be found his agreeable conversation his obliging character his noble and generous deportment his free easy temper made him beloved by all the world people only wondered that being so great a lord as he was he would sacrifice his repose to the administration of affairs that were then in a miserable condition they could scarce imagine and perhaps he was of the same opinion himself how he could ever be able to remedy evils of so inveterate a malignity before he could effect this he must in all appearance make an entire change in the ordering of the monarchy but this was an impracticable design and impossible to be executed  as soon as the choice his majesty had made in favor of the duke came to be publicly known all persons that were of any quality went to complement him as well the ministers of foreign princes as the grandees of spain the next day being accompanied by all his friends and relations he repaired to court to kiss his majestys hand and thank him most humbly for all his great favors on the following days he received visits in his bed pretending a slight indisposition to exempt himself from the fatigue of ceremonies his apartment and furniture were extremely magnificent but it is an odd sight to see a spaniard in his bed of state because they wear no morninggowns here but only their golilia and black cloaks and have their hats on or else are bareheaded for the men as well as the women wear no caps he had enjoyed the place of sumiller de corpse i e lordchamberlian for a long time and in this quality he was the only person that commanded in the kings chamber and lay there  he did not delay to give public audience in the hall which they call the rubis and is the place where the council of state uses to assemble it is under the kings apartment here it was that the duke received the visit of the nuncio and the venetian ambassador they did not seem to be pleased at the manner wherein the chairs were disposed because it could not absolutely be determined whether either of them or he had the chief place of honor besides this he only reconducted them to the middle of the hall of audience they acquainted the marquess de villars with it who told them that he had designed to make that visit along with them because the ambassadors of the chapel generally acquit themselves of these sorts of devoirs together but that he was not displeased with himself for not being there since he was resolved to take direction by the fault they had committed and that he would not neglect as they did to use all necessary precautions about the step place and rank and would be assured both of the one and the other before he performed that ceremony in short he sent to the duke to know whether he would not receive him as don louis de haro used to receive the ambassadors of france he immediately agreed to it and that there might be no mistakes committed the places were marked out and every thing was adjusted before the day of audience the other ambassadors were concerned at the oversight they had committed and by this visit of our ambassador regulated those they continued to make to the chief minister  the count de monterey kissed the kings hand and the queens he complemented them from the part of the city of st jago de compostella the marquess dastorgas did the same from the city of avila  about this time don francisco dagourto was nominated by the king to be master of the campgeneral of the cavalry the envoy extraordinary from england surprised all the court by the strict prohibition he gave his domestics not to suffer any ecclesiastics or religious to come within his doors  the young queen was so taken up with the diversions of the carnaval that she had scarce opportunity to perceive that this was a set time of mirth and jollity her best days were spent in hunting with the king and the three last days of the carnaval there was a comedy represented upon the theater at buenretiro which is a wellcontrived building the king and the queen saw it on the sunday the next day it was acted before the several councils and on tuesday before the officers of the city the queen being informed that the duchess de bejar and the marchioness de castle rodrigo who had never bore any children before were each of them delivered of a son begged leave of the king to send them word that she wished them joy i agree to it says the king smiling on condition that within nine months they will come in their turn to perform the same complement to you  all spain impatiently expected to see what remedies the new ministers would apply to those disorders that seemed for a long time to be radicated in the monarchy but whatever good intentions he had to rectify them he found it a difficult matter to put them in execution the kings treasury was exhausted several private families ruined the price of all commodities excessive high and these perplexities were heightened by the connivance of the magistrates and the length of time during the ministry of don juan nothing had been set in order and since his death one would have thought they had affected to abandon all manner of business  to this we may add that the duke de medina celi had never been in any employ where he might learn that experience which is so necessary for government he was born and bred in the genius of madrid which is so supine and careless that nothing almost is determined there nay what is more he suffered the master of the council to deliberate about the public affairs after the same manner as he did before his ministry and submitted to take his counsel he likewise erected juntas to debate of those things which he supposed to carry any great difficulty with them  he erected one amongst the rest to which he nominated the constable the admiral and the marquss dastorgas all which three were counselors of state he also admitted three divines whereof the kings confessor was one and three counselors of the kings council to examine along with him the affair of the president of castile about which the nuncio made so great a noise the occasion of this dispute was this monsieur mellini the nuncio had a mind to preside over a chapter of religious whom they call clericos minores who were going to choose a provincial the president desired that one of his friends might be named now he kew that the nuncio had a kindness for another so he went the shortest way to work and obtained a decree of the king which forbad him to preside in that assembly and because he did not exactly obey it he was fined a thousand crowns  the nuncio suffered this strange treatment with indignation enough and complained of it to the pope his holiness writ to the king about it and don juan promised him to get the fine revoked but the many disorders that happened after his death hindered the execution of it the king thought the business was laid asleep because he writ a very submissive letter to the pope about it but for all that the nuncio who was not to be appeased by a letter renewed the quarrel after the princes death he saw that the king had not as yet pitched upon a chief minister and judged that the president of castile was not well supported he knew he had abundance of enemies and that amongst the rest the queen mother was the most inveterate against him all these considerations served to persuade him that he should obtain an entire satisfaction without any trouble  he pretended therefore that he ought to lose his place and to go to rome to have the suspension taken off which he had incurred in the year      the court absolutely refused to grant him what he demanded upon this he complained very highly to the king telling him that he ill performed what he had promised the pope in his letter  the duke de medina celi being advanced to the ministry was willing to examine the reasons of the nuncio and those of the president by the junta twas alleged in favor of the last that being a native of spain the king could not abandon him to the popes resentments if at the bottom he did not deserve it that it was true indeed he had done irregular things upon several occasions but then his place was of that nature that he could not forfeit it unless it were for reasons of the greatest importance the chief minister declared that he should keep his place of being president of the council of the indies and that don vincente gonzaga should perform all his functions he received with extraordinary satisfaction the offer which the admiral of castile made to resign the office of master of the horse to him which is generally possessed by the favorite but would not accept of it  he gave order to don gabriel quinones secretary of the council of war to bring in his accounts out of hopes of drawing some money from thence and indeed the state was never in such extremity of want as now for since the publishing of the kings declaration for sinking the value of money all commerce was entirely stopped the shops continued shut up and the people groaned under the greatest necessities imaginable the duke used all his power to remedy these pressing grievances he designed to coin new money and lessen the price of all commodities but the effect of his good intentions was long delayed and the public misery increased more and more every day  hereupon a man of great business whose name was marcos dias presented a memorial to the duke wherein he proposed a method to raise the kings revenue and yet ease the people he offered to prove that the magistrates of the city of madrid under pretense of reimbursing themselves of the money they had lent the late king had raised considerable sums and had never given any account of them he proposed a way to force them to refund the overplus as well to supply the present want as to prevent the like exactions for the time to come the duke hearkened to him and told him his advice was good immediately after this marcos dias presented another memorial to him wherein he showed that his majestys dues were considerably diminished that he offered to pay the full worth of them and yet to make an advance of two hundred thousand crowns a present of a hundred thousand crowns to the king and lessen the imposition of the dues one half of what it amounted to the year      when they were less by one third part than they were this present year for this he demanded that the rents of the guild hall of the city of madrid the payments whereof were assigned for these funds should be reduced to five in the hundred whereas they were risen to eight and what is more he still offered to reimburse those persons who were not willing to suffer this diminution  it is natural to believe that he knew his own accounts well enough not to lose any thing by his project and to say the truth he had been no loser for the disorders and rapines were at that time so great that not a ninth part of the kings rights came into his coffers the duke foreseeing the event of this affair advised marcos dias not to stir out of the palace but he had a mind to go to alcala and he returned with vomiting of blood and convulsions which occasioned the belief that he was poisoned for this overture of accommodating the public affairs disgusted some particular persons of great estates who got prodigious sums at the expense of the king and people these persons to avert this blow had written to dias and threatened to have him infallibly stabbed if he continued his proposals he was very apprehensive of the danger he incurred and besides this these very magistrates offered the same terms to his majesty but the duke saw there was all the reason in the world to prefer dias and so he refused the others upon a consideration of what these differences might produce the duke advised him to have a care of himself till the treaty was concluded the advice was good if he had had the good fortune to have followed it but as he came back from alcala to madrid he met some men in masks who gave him several blows with little bags full of sand so that he spit abundance of blood at his mouth and being seized with a violent feavor died on the first day of april the corrigidor and some other officers of the city were the men that were principally exasperated against him because he had discovered their villainies a little before nevertheless they were willing to submit to some beneficial alterations in matters and so they reduced the rents of the guild hall of the city from eight to five in the hundred there was also some small regulation made in the civil government but the duke could not forbear to be sensibly touched for losing by the death of dias an opportunity to serve the king and ease the people  in the mean time the people who had fully flattered themselves that if the proposals made by dias had taken effect they should have met with plenty instead of want being informed of his indisposition flocked about his house and cried out aloud that he was poisoned and that this business ought to be examined to the bottom because he suffered for the good will he had expressed toward them they added menaces against those persons who had opposed such profitable advice and as the king accidentally passed by them in his coach a great body of them got about the coach and followed it crying  vive el roi y muera el mal goviorno that is to say let the king live and the ill government dye  there were great endeavors used to moderate the first motions of the popular fury which exceedingly increased on the day that dias died above six thousand were got together who ran up and down the streets complaining and weeping bitterly every one of them said that they had murdered the only man that wished them well they accompanied his body to the place of burial and the streets were so full of people that the king durst not stir out of his palace although he was to go to a great festival that was celebrated by the jesuits and he had a great desire to be there there was little probability that they would ever be appeased but as good fortune would have it the multitude was only made up of poor irresolute people whose spirits were broken by the miseries of which they complained all this tempest past over in vain menaces and some injuries against some considerable persons but however it did not alter the state of affairs  at this same time word was sent to the nuncio by an express order from court that he should enjoy no other privileges than what the ambassador of spain did at rome this was a new occasion of discontent to him but the action was general and they took care to inform the other foreign ministers that for the future they would allow them only the same privileges as their princes allowed to the ambassadors of his catholic majesty so that he had no reason to complain since he was treated but like the rest this resolution was taken upon this account six alguazils de corte passing before the house of the venetian ambassador it seems three of his footmen knew them and demanded of them how they durst have the impudence to go through their quarter the alguazils returned them a saucy answer whereupon the servants drew their swords but the alguazils fired immediately upon them and killed them upon the place the ambassador made great complaints about it they promised to give him full satisfaction but to avoid the doing of it they thought it more expedient to revoke all the franchises  the king received a letter from the viceroy of naples and was extremely glad to hear that he had found out a way to borrow three hundred thousand crowns of the merchants of genoa for the raising four thousand men that were to be sent into the milanese but they were persuaded at court that it would be a long time before they could be in a condition to get there because they demanded a further supply of money from madrid and here they wanted it without exception for every thing however this did not hinder them from using all imaginable efforts to contribute toward the raising of these four thousand men because they were exceedingly alarmed at the treaty of casal which they pretended our king had bought of the duke of mantua they apprehended this was an open pass to render himself master of italy when he pleased and they were fully persuaded that he had sent an army thither upon this score  the genoese first whispered and spread about these jealousies which at last reached the venetians so that they drew their soldiers out of their garrisons in dalmatia and bestowed them in their own towns in lumbardy where they made some new fortifications the emperor for his part was as much alarmed as the rest of his neighbors for he sent his troops to the milanese to guard them and several princes of italy put themselves to a great deal of trouble out of an apprehension of a rupture but if there was any reason to fear one it was from the side of bisca where the people of that province who are under the dominion of spain have almost every day some disputes with those that live under the dominion of france sometimes about the fishing at other times about other differences each of them appropriating the river de bidassoa to themselves so that they seldom live in peace matters came to that upshot at last that they burnt several barques and took several of the french prisoners our ambassador was ordered to demand justice for these injuries and frequently spoke to the ministers about it who contued deaf in these cases because they had no mind to redress them they persisted to be so stiff and obstinate upon this occasion that the ambassador declared at last to don vinzente gonzaga that his master would order his troops to march toward the frontiers by which means it would be more easy to get satisfaction for the insolence of the biscayneers than by sending to the council at madrid that his majesty was concerned for the tranquillity of his subjects and that he would take a due course to procure it gonzaga heard monsieur de villars very patiently and told him at last that he was surprised to find him address himself to him because he was no longer commissary and that the marquess de los balbazez had been nominated to his place above a month before the ambassador acquainted him that generally these sorts of changes are not made without informing those persons who are interested in them and that as for himself he had never heard the least mention of it don vincente replied that don pedro colonna had been ordered to inform him of it but that in truth he was a negligent person and had showed himself so not only on this occasion upon this he made some particular reflections that were not very obliging to the new secretary of state  don pedro fernandez del campo marquess de majorada who had been formerly secretary of state and to whom the marquess de valenzuela when he became sole favorite had an aversion because he would not blindly obey him died of grief for the loss of his place and to see it still possessed by don jeronimo deguya  the number of the maids of honor belonging to the queen was about this time augmented the king added to them the daughter of the princess pio those of the countess de villambrosa the marquess de pouar the duke dhijar donna eleonora of the house de zapara the niece of the duchess de terra nova and mademoiselle de lalain who was a flemish woman but although this was a testimony of the particular consideration which the king had for his young queen because ordinarily the queens of spain have not so many yet he could not forbear to be sensibly tormented at the stories which the camerara continually buzzed into his ear don melchior navarra who had formerly been vice chancellor of arragon and whom don juan banished to cienpuzuelos was called home at the entreaties of the queen mother nay it was even believed that the king would give him the place of president of castile in case the president who was then embroyled with the nuncio were turned of his place  the king and queen had the pleasure of hearing mass celebrated at the jesuits college in the chaldeanlanguage by a priest of the city of muzal which was heretofore called ninive after it was over the queen who was always desirous of informing her self in matters of curiosity sent for him to come to her and by the means of an interpreter she asked him several questions and amongst the rest whether the women were as severely locked up at muzal as they were at madrid this question although there was nothing criminal in it was so maliciously explained by the duchess de terra nova that the king was observed to look upon her with a great deal of coldness for some days after this did not hinder the queen mother from going to visit her who assured her with all the tenderness imaginable how sensibly she was concerned at these ill offices that were done her they went together to st marie la royalle where was celebrated the beatification of torribio alphonso mogrobejo second archbishop of lima the music of the chapel was there their majestys were informed at their return that the great archdeacon of madrid was dead the queen mother seemed to be desirous of seeing this dignity filled by one of her own creatures and the young queen proposed to send to cardinal portocarero to demand it of him but now it was too late for the cardinal to prevent all solicitations upon this point made haste to gratify his nephew don pedro portocarero with it  in the mean time whilst these small things happened news was brought that a squadron of french men of war commanded by the marquess de valbelle was arrived before the isle of majorca to demand of the viceroy some merchantmen that had been taken by the corsairs since the peace and monsieur valbelle had in his hands an order of the king of spain for their restitution the viceroy would not restore their prizes alleging that the persons who had taken them had already shared and divided them and that they were not all of them majorcans that the effects were all consumed and gone and for his part he demanded damages for certain hostilities which these corsairs had suffered valbelle continued his instances but seeing they had no effect he declared that he would not forget to make use of the right of reprisals that the subjects of the king of spain whenever he met them on the sea should find it to their cost that the king his master had reason to complain of the usage he found at their hands that several governors and viceroys dependant upon the king of spain had taken liberty to commit all injustices against the french that it was almost to no purpose to demand satisfaction from those at madrid where the councils were filled with persons who had played the same tricks when they were in the like posts and consequently durst not condem and punish others for the very same crimes they had committed themselves that he was assured this was the reason that occasioned this impunity and all their frivolous pretenses in a word that he was going to take another course with them and do himself justice  these menaces one would have thought were sufficient to alarm those persons that were concerned in them but they have this maxim in spain that provided the danger is a little remote they never fear it whether this happens through insolence or temerity and they rather choose to suffer the disorders that always fall out in military executions than give themselves the trouble to do justice upon the complaints that are made  but before i finish the first part of my memoirs i think it will not be altogether amiss to say something of the councils of spain according to the best information i have received concerning them  the council of state the number of these counselors is not fixed they dont observe the right of seniority amongst themselves but take their places as they happen to come into the chamber the king administers the oath to them and they sit as the secretaries of state do upon benches with backs to them every man has his cushion the counselors are in the middle near the table the secretaries of state at both ends  when the king assists there he has a table above that of the counselors who for that time have only places and the secretaries of state stand  this council is held twice every saturday and but once on mondays and tuesdays all of them are called his counselors and they deliberate here upon affairs of the greatest importance such as peace and war leagues and truces here they likewise treat of the marriage of the kings and princes of the royal family and distribute the viceroyships and all the governments of the provinces that are under the obedience of the king of spain and although other affairs are examined in other councils yet the counselors of state dont for all that omit to give the king their advice about them  behold a list of those that compose this council at present the constable of castile who is the dean of it the duke of alva don pedro darragon the admiral of castile the marquess dastorgas the duke dossone the prince de stillano don vincente gonzaga prince de guastallo don lovis portocarero cardinal and archbishop of toledo the marquess de liche the marquess de los balbazez don diego sarmiento the prince de ligne the duke de villa hermosa don melchior navarra the marquess de los velez the count doropesa the marquess de mansera and the duke dalbuquerque   the council royal of castile this council is the chief of all and to distinguish it from the rest by a title of honor the king calls it our council it was established by st ferdinand the third of that name in the year      there are in this council a president sixteen counselors a fiscal six reporters six secretaries a register and a keeper of the registers a receiver of the fines due to the council another of the fines adjudged to particular persons a treasurer a deputy and a dozen porters the council assembles every friday in the palace toward evening the king comes there the kings don ferdinand the fourth and don alonzo the last of that name established this custom this council is divided into four chambers where they distribute those affairs that are under their jurisdiction in castile  one of them goes by the name of the chamber of the fifteen hundred pistoles because such a sum is to be consigned before any man can get a review of a process which is pretended to be unjustly judged by the parliaments of vailladolid and granada which are the two parliaments of castile  when the president of castile goes out of the council the counselors follow him to his chair he never makes any visits never gives the right hand to any at his house he is to give the king an account of the most important affairs that pass in council where they name a council every week to report them  when the king comes there they all uncover themselves and kneel down afterward they cover themselves and sit  when audience is over the king retires into his cabinet with the president who discourses him about business of the greatest moment for which the king gives his orders and this does not return any more to the chamber for the counselors to deliberate upon it  in the year   0  all castile was divided into five districts and every district is under a counselor of the council royal who takes cognizance of the conduct of the judges the lords ecclesiastics and other secular persons besides this there is a particular council that is called the council of the chamber of castile the president is the chief and the king names a certain number of counselors of the council royal whether they be three or four that compose it here it is that they dispatch all benefices in the kings nomination titles and patents for the most considerable places letters of naturalization and the ratification of orders to arrest the grandees of spain and the graces and favors to which his majesty is pleased to give his consent  the king receives prodigious sums of money for the places that are sold by the means of these counselors he gives likewise the patents and commissions of several places of justice and it is commonly pretended that in the two castiles the kingdom of leon guypuscoa biscay the province de hana and in navarr there are above    thousand places of judicature  secretary of state and of the universal dispatch this secretary is in a condition to serve or injure people according as he stands affected to them for all the requests and petitions which they call memorials here and are presented to the king or chief minister pass through his hand it is he who sends them to his counselors who are to give their advice concerning them after the consult is made for this is their phrase in spain these petitions are sent back again to the secretary of state and when he reports them to the king his majesty orders what pleases him and this is called a decree  this decree is expedited by persons proposed for that office so that when these requests are carried to the king they say the memorial is mounted and when they are answered they say the memorial falls down or else the consult ascended and the decree descended  without counting the secretary of state whom i have been speaking of there are two more that enter the council one of them dispatches the affairs of arragon of italy and sicily the other those of castile and the north  one of these is named don manuel de lira who was formerly master of the ceremonies and envoy extraordinary in holland he was made at his return secretary of state the other is called don pedro colonna he is descended of a good family and those of his house have always possessed great places they may give their advice in writing in matters of consequence  the king sends the decrees to them and through their hands affairs go to the council of state they make a report of them there and gather the voices and give an account of all to his majesty who at last orders it as he thinks fit they have power to assemble the council out of the appointed days when they judge it convenient and when the king has a mind that they should have any extraordinary meeting they send the order immediately to all the counselors  every secretary of state has a chief commissary who is called the official mayor and exercises his masters office when he happens to be absent the secretary of state for italy has eight commissioners reckoning him that is the principal the king pays them and the secretary of state for the north has seven under him they choose them themselves and the king gives his consent these dispatch all patents and generally those persons that get into these employments advance their fortunes in the world  the council of war this began as soon as the kingdoms of castile and leon were erected under king pelagius in the year   0  it assembles on mondays wednesdays and fridays as for what concerns the government of it the king is always president of it and the counselors are men of the sword they must be men of experience and service the number of them is not fixed and it depends upon the kings pleasure to augment or to diminish them their places are not regulated in the council but they sit as they come it is indeed true that when the counselors of state are called thither they have the upper end but then they never come but at a time when a full council of war is held they have two secretaries who have each of them two commissaries under them one of these is for the seaaffairs and the others for those at land  when they debate about matters of justice an assessor of the council royal makes a report of them who has likewise the privilege to give his opinion before the dean of the council the king comes there almost every day there are besides some other chambers that depend upon this council such as those of the flotas the galleys and the garrisons the king nominates the officers for these chambers the councils are the same with those of the council of war and it is the chief minister or the president of castile that presides there  alcaldes of the court the word alcalde signifies a judge of any place this tribunal is full as ancient as the council royal whoever is judged to be a criminal by it can make no appeals but is executed immediately for this reason it is named the quinta sala that is to say the fifth hall here they determine both civil and criminal affairs but when these councils were established in castile the judges thereof were reduced to four alcaldes they have been augmented since and are nine at present two reporters and four registers their jurisdiction is divided into two parts one as i said before relates only to criminal matters the other is like that of ordinary judges and is to direct the management of civil affairs  the supreme council of the inquisition this council was erected in the year      by don ferdinand and donna isabella king and queen of castile to defend and preserve the catholic religion although it is certain that this tribunal of the inquisition was established ever since the year      the president of this council is called the inquisitor general and the counselors the apostolic inquisitors they are named by the pope and there are in spain above twenty thousand officers belonging to the holy inquisition whose business it is to seize the persons of criminals every council consists of six inquisitors the word signifies enquirers the fiscal who is the accuser two secretaries and alguazil principal two reporters a receiver of the fines four porters
