phaed with annotations and an appendix  the fifth edition  london printed for j wheble paternoster row  mdcclxxii  to david garrick esquire sir the author of the following eclogue having requested my assistance to introduce it to the world it was with more indignation than surprise i was informed of your having used your extensive influence over the press to prevent its being advertised in the newspapers how are you sir concerned in the lamentation of roscius for his nyky does your modesty think no man entitled to the appellation of roscius but yourself does nyky resemble any nicknamed favorite of yours or does it follow that if you have cherished an unworthy favorite you must bear too near a resemblance to him qui capit ille facit beware of selfaccusation where others bring no charge or granting you right in these particulars by what right or privilege do you sir set up for a licenser of the press that you have long successfully usurped that privilege to swell both your fame and fortune is well known not the puffs of the quacks of bayswater and chelsea are so numerous and notorious but by what authority do you take upon you to shut up the general channel in which writers usher their performances to the public if they attack either your talents or your character in utrumque paratus you are armed to defend yourself you have besides your ingenuous countenance and conscious innocence nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa besides this brazen bulwark i say you have a ready pen and a long purse the press is open to the one and the bar is ever ready to open with the other for a poor author not a printer will publish a paragraph not a pleader will utter a quibble you have then every advantage in the contest it is needless therefore to endeavor to intimidate your antagonists by countenancing your retainers to threaten their lives these intimidations let me tell you sir have an ugly suspicious look they are besides needless the genus irritabile vatum want no such personal provocations heaven knows the life of a playwright like that of a spider is in a state of the most slender dependency it is well for my rhiming friend that his hangs not on so slight a thread he thinks nevertheless that he has reason to complain as well as the public of your having long preferred the flimzy translated patchdup and misaltered pieces of your favorite compilers to the arduous attempts at originality of writers who have no personal interest with the manager in particular he thinks the two pieces you are projecting to get up next winter for the emolument of your favorite in disgrace or to reimburse yourself the money you may have advanced him might for the present at least be laid aside  but you will ask me perhaps in turn sir what right i have to interfere with the business of other people or with yours i will answer you it is because i think your business as patentee of a theater royal is not so entirely yours but that the public also have some concern in it you sir indeed have long behaved as if you thought the town itself a purchased appurtenance to the theater but though the scenes and machines are yours nay though you have even found means to make comedians and poets your property it should be with more caution than you practice that you extend your various arts to make so scandalous a property of the public  again i answer it is because i have some regard for my friend and as much for myself whom you have treated as ill perhaps as you have done any other writer while under your auspices some of the persons stigmatized by the satirist have frequently combined to do me the most essential injury but nemo me impure lacessit not that i mean now to enter into particulars which may be thought to relate too much to myself and too little to the public when i shall have leisure to draw a faithful portraiture of mr garrick not only from his behavior to me in particular but from his conduct toward poets players and the town in general i doubt not to convince the most partial of his admirers that he has accumulated a fortune as manager by the meanest and most meretricious devices and that the theatrical props which have long supported his exalted reputation as an actor have been raised on the ruins of the english stage  in the mean time i leave you to amuse yourself with the following jeu desprit of my friend hoping though it be a severe correction for the errors of your past favouritism it may prove a salutary guide to you for the future with regard to the mode of its publication i hope also to stand excused with the reader for thus interposing to defeat the success of those arts which you so unfairly practice to prevent from reaching the public eye whatever is disagreeable to your own  i am sir yours etc w kenrick  love

up their mouths and make faces at each other to the great edification of the audience  this play indeed was afterward almost entirely altered and got up for a performers benefit when it was received with the greatest applause it has however never since been acted either for the authors emolument or the entertainment of the public although the alterations were made at the instance of the manager

publication of a direct abominable charge against roscius in the public ledger of june    to which the author of the foregoing piece was an utter stranger having happened about the time of its publication and given rise to rumors equally false and foreign to the writer it appears that roscius or some of his friends was pleased to insert the following queries in the morning chronicle of july  d  candor presents her compliments to mr  she begs his pardon  to dr  kenrick and desires to ask him a few simple questions to which if he be the plaindealer he pretends he will give a plain and direct answer  query i whether you are not the author of the eclogue entitled love in the suds as well as of the letter prefixed to it ii whether you did not mean though you have artfully evaded the law by affecting the translation of a classical cento to throw out the most scandalous insinuations against the character of roscius iii whether you were not likewise the author of an infamous anonymous paragraph in a public paper for which that paper is under a just prosecution iv whether you have not openly acknowledged notwithstanding that you really entertained a very different opinion of roscius v whether any cause of dispute that might subsist between you and roscius can authorize so cruel so unmanly an attack vi whether the brother of roscius did not personally wait on you to require in his name the satisfaction of a gentleman which you refused him candor   to these queries the author judged it expedient to make the following reply in the same paper of july  th  to candor madam though i think your signature a misnomer to show that i am no stranger to the name and quality you assume i shall not stand on the punctilio of your being an anonymous querist but answer your several questions explicitly  i i am the author of the eclogue you mention ii i did not mean to throw out the most scandalous insinuations on the character of roscius nor any insinuation more scandalous than his conduct how far that has been so he knows best and is left to make the application iii an infamous paragraph i cannot write and an anonymous one i will not write to prejudice my greatest enemy as to that in question i have not to this hour even seen it calumny i detest but i think vice should be exposed to infamy nor have i so much false delicacy as to conceive it should be treated with tenderness in proportion as it is abominable iv i have not acknowledged that i entertain a very different opinion of roscius on the contrary i declare that i entertain a very indifferent opinion of him v as to the cause of our dispute i should be very ready to submit it to the public were i egotist enough to think it deserved their attention vi the brother of roscius did personally wait on me to desire i would meet him the said roscius who would bring a friend with him i being at liberty to do the same but as nothing of time place or weapon was mentioned i did not look on this message as a challenge nor well could i as i never heard of requiring gentlemans satisfaction by letter of attorney and the professed end of our meeting turned merely on a matter of business  it is possible indeed the messenger otherwise instructed might imagine it such especially as it seems his head has teemed with nothing but challenges and duels since his magnanimous monomachy with one of his brother rosciuss candlesnuffers  that roscius himself however did not mean to send me a challenge is plain from his soliciting afterward by letter a conference in the presence only of a common friend to both a request that would have been complied with had not he thought proper in a most ungentlemanlike manner to make a confidant in the mean time of a booby of a bookseller who had the folly and impudence to declare that he would on his rosciuss account take an opportunity to do me some desperate mischief  lest i should be yet supposed from the purport of this last query to have any fear of a personal encounter with the doughty roscius i require only that it may be on an equal footing i am neither so extravagantly fond of life nor think myself so consequential in it as to fear the end of it from such an antagonist nor to say the truth should i have any qualms of conscience if nothing less will satisfy him about putting an end to so insignificant a being as his but as the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong it is but right to provide against a mishap roscius has a large fortune and little or no family to leave it to i have a large family and little or no fortune to leave it let roscius but previously settle only half his estate on my heirs on condition that he deprives them of a protector and i will meet him tomorrow and engage at his own weapons not only him but his brother george into the bargain the above pleasantry being misconstrued by some of rosciuss friends to the disadvantage of the author the latter thought himself under the necessity of seriously acquainting the former of his being ready as he is at any time to give him such satisfaction as a gentleman who supposes himself injured has a right to require  and now madam candor give me leave to ask you a question or two in my turn  qu i whether from many gross instances of misbehaviour roscius has not long had sufficient reason to suspect the detestable character of nyky ii whether therefore granting roscius to be himself immaculate he is excusable for his notorious partialities to such a character iii whether he has any right to complain of unjust severity in being ludicrously reproached with such partialities by a writer whom he has treated even in favor of that very wretch with disrespect with insolence with injustice w kenrick   instead of heartily replying however to the above three queries a very difficult task indeed to roscius he caused the court of kings bench to be moved for a rule to show cause why leave should not be given him to file an information against the author for a libel which being granted of course the same was exultingly anounced in the following paragraphs inserted in all the newspapers  yesterday morning mr dunning made a motion in the court of kings bench for a rule to show cause why an information should not be laid against the author of love in the suds when the court was pleased to grant a rule for the first day of next term the poem was read in court by the clerk of the crown and afforded no small diversion when it came to that part which reflects upon a certain chief justice who was present all the time  besides mr wallace and mr dunning who are employed by a greatactor in his prosecution of some detestable charges which have been lately urged with as much folly as wickedness against his character mr murphy and mr mansfield are also engaged and the cause now becomes a matter of much expectation with the public  to these paragraphs the author judged it necessary to make the following reply in the abovementioned morning chronicle almost all the rest of the newspapers by the indefatigable industry and powerful influence of roscius a proprietor in most of them being shut against him  the author of love in the suds to the printer of the morning chronicle sir in reprehending the faults of other men you should ever be cautious of falling into the error you condemn in yesterdays paper you indirectly charge me among others with having urged a detestable charge with as much folly as wickedness against a certain great actor  what other people have done i know not nor does it concern me but i may safely defy all the lawyers in westminster hall fairly to deduce such a charge as you hint at from the eclogue in question in this respect it is certainly as innocent as the great actors jubilee ode but granting it otherwise with any one else how can you take upon you to say that such a charge is urged foolishly and wickedly can you know it to be false or groundless and if not on what grounds do you charge the accusers with folly and wickedness why does not the candor of the great actor reply to the queries put to him in your paper of saturday last but no unable to justify himself at the bar of the public he flies for refuge to the quirks and quibbles of westminster hall and even this at the latter end of a term in order to deceive the town into a notion that the court will countenance his prosecution why was not his motion made sooner that cause might have been shown in time and the futility of it made immediately evident believe me sir before an end is put to this business the public

ever dreads the fire ken vowed revenge made same his pandar hell shudderd at the horrid slander thus beatrice have i unfolded and fairly too i will uphold it the cause of quarrel literary twixt kenrick and renowned garry but were the managers behavior as you relate in kens disfavour pray could it justify to true sage your rancorous friends informal usage in the next term at least in hilary i hope your friend will grace the pillory and as he has prepared the suds my wish is the plebean bloods may recompense the scribbling adder by giving him a hearty lather benedick  to benedick ken vowed revenge made fame his pandar hell shudderd at the horrid slander benedick ha benedick and are you there caught in your own designing snare does k  ks eclogue say no more than common same had said before so horrid is it become the crime to turn the towntalk into rhyme to hint in dark and distant terms what foulmouthed rumor loud affirms is satire only too severe when more is meant than meets the ear so cruel is it to speak not out but leave avowed report in doubt fame is we know a lying strumpet and yet the muses blow her trumpet your lines would else not run so glib at every second word a fib lying it is therefore plain in thy sense is founded on poetic license a falsehood all that you relate of falstaffs wedding and its fate of g  ks patronizing charity how ill bestowed so great a rarity though k  k ever had too much pride to kiss a managers backside shunned with vile nyky to be seen in g  ks train behind the scene yet not so far the world above his labor to give up for love his lawful right he still maintains to what he claimed as honest gains nor this alone the secret cause why k  k his dread goosequill draws let others crouch but while a man he never will forgive nor can till full redressed on fair confession a bare affront or base oppression much less will he restrain his pen in fear of wretches less than men that pen which truth excites to gall both the great vulgar and the small the scourge of guilt when justice claims its aid against the greatest names much less will he its aid refuse or tamely check his daring muse because a stageplayr stalks abroad whose antic tricks the crowd applaud by his profession dead to shame and trusting to theatric fame presumptuous that our english laws perverted to avenge his cause the freeborn muse in chains will bind disgraceful unto human kind of ridicule will check the vein and satires wholesome power restrain that vice and folly thus set free may laugh at future infamy no sir next term indeed or hillary may bring your nyky to the pillory securely as you think he is closetted and safe from laws pursuit deposited but think not the indignant town will let his farces still go down or that with such a hateful croney you still may share the public money attempt it not lest in a rage the audience drive thee from the stage beatrice  to dr k  doctor i have been out of town or this packet would have reached you sooner prithee pull off your mask for no man should injure that dear creature woman in beatrice you give a handle to fix on the dear sex a scandal what lady would take up goose quill in defense of such a slanderous villain at the word fame you closely nibble and strive by jesuitic quibble to explain away an obvious meaning an art that ken was always keen in thus a solicitor who daily attends the sessions at old bailey in fraud deep skilled to law a nuisance will catch a word pervert its true sense to save a thoroughpacd and callous offender from his due  the gallows you tax as false what i relate of falstaffs wedding and its fate but will a kenricks ipse dixit blast my report and falsehood fix it no doctor he that knows us both will trust my word before your oath the comedy however you laud it i told you was not much applauded many can witness my assertion is truth not envy nor aspersion loves friends and yours were all agreed in the celebration of jacks wedding or possibly the critic clans had stepped in  to forbid the bans if on the town again you would pushed it another audience might have crushed it  that play whose only merit lies in imitation scarce can rise you rail at bick  with all my heart think you i mean to take his part think you i would one distich write texculpate a vile s  e no on him let thy rage be hurled no  lash him naked through the world expose in satires keenest lays this skulking damned detested race hang up to public scorn each brute who dares loves rites to prostitute but never tax in prose or rhyme the guiltless with so black a crime your hints to celebrated garry seem useless and unnecessary davy is  what  a man of prudence now mark what comment i obtrudehence  he would deserve a cane or thicker staff to favor in futuro bickerstaff for should a brat the town be sibbd on fathered by paul compiled by dibden the secret could he hope to smother no it would out some time or other then hey what havoc rage and fury would reign tumultuous at old drury down go the boxes up the benches  the scenes are fired  how great the stench is  by h  each british fair would fly out and eager join the general riot wives widows maids turn warlike knights to avenge their broken bill of rights twere just for sure no backdoor cub like vile bick should profit by the public doctor i mean this rhyming letter the last for which you will be my debtor in friendships name i therefore crave you to make it up with injured davy your heart of envious spleen a mass call and own yourself a slandrous rascal speak truth for once and shame the devil  shame my old friend twould be uncivil pho he will excuse you on that score you never made him blush before you think i am drurys stagedirector upon my honor mere conjecture i have put on benedicks disguise to be concealed from critic spies and garrick knows no more than bick or ken the name of benedick  to benedick thus costive bards themselves excuse and lay the fault upon the muse a slattern rambling up and down that when they are dull is out of town but come for once well let it pass a witling is sometimes an ass
