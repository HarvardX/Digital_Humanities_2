the apotheosis of punch a satirical masque with a monody on the death of the late master punch  as now performing at the patagonian theater exeterchange with universal applause  i have heard that things inanimate have moved and as with living souls have been informed by magic numbers and persuasive sounds congreve london printed for j wenman fleet street f newbery corner of st pauls churchyard and w thompson exeterchange in the strand  m dcc lxx ix  to richard brinsley sheridan esquire one of the joint managers of the theaters royal and operahouse this jeudesprit is humbly dedicated by his most obedient and devoted servant  plunder  dramatis doctor plunder roscius secundus punch apollo bacchus pan death undertaker mutes etc melpomene thalia apotheosis of punch prelude scene i a dressing room in the theater doctor plunder and roscius secundus discovered doctor plunder i have founded my piece upon two ideas  the first a custom among the egyptians who publicly tried the conduct of their great men after death and then gave judgment on their merit secondly a custom of the greeks and romans who pronounced orations over the bodies of their deceased heroes or over their ashes when inurned   roscius secundus i fear few in these days would pass the egyptian ordeal immaculate or merit the greek or roman oration but i am surprised doctor plunder that you who have suffered so severely for traducing master punch while living should now become his panegyrist particularly as his executors have no pecuniary demands upon you but having shifted off this mortal coil and become defunct like zangas revenge i suppose your enmity expired with your foe you war not with the dust  a lion preys not upon carcases   doctor plunder master roscius secundus you have hit the right nail on the head i hated punch while living but now he is dead i am determined to be one of his most zealous eulogists our dislike arose from that mutual antipathy which naturally exists not only between dramatic authors but every class of writers whether coiners cutters clippers or counterfeiters of literature   roscius secundus your sentiments doctor exactly coincide with mine his failings all lie buried in the grave and all his good comes rushing on my soul never will i again mimic his peculiarities with buffoon drollery but do you not think the plagiarism of our piece will meet the disapprobation of the audience   doctor plunder by no means i have only stolen from shakespeare and poets set up a prescriptive right to purloin from him i am convinced from experience that plagiarism meets as much success as originality the addition of a few songs to a tragedy makes an excellent masque and airs judiciously introduced into a cut comedy answers all the intents and every end of an original opera i know how to secure the approbation of the public by crook or by hook   roscius secundus i will say that for you doctor you do not descend to petty larceny your robberies are open and bold   doctor plunder i plead guilty to your arraignment and the prologue which you speak to this nights entertainment i have taken partly from old jack dryden and partly from alic pope i am like sir roger de coverleys chaplain who always preached from printed sermons when unable to compose himself in dull moods i make bold with the works of others   roscius secundus but do you not think doctor that the monody is rather too highly elevated in the hyperbole in praising your hero you have made mere ciphers of every other puppet like a poet laureat you have centered every virtue merit and qualification in an individual which is outheroding herod and an insult upon commonsense and modesty bell rings but hark the prompters bell rings   doctor plunder adieu i will retire and write a few puffs for the newspapers i have precedent for puffing my monody in the public prints   roscius secundus and in your puffs be sure to remember me as i have not leisure to puff myself i assure you doctor puffing is often a means of procuring a good engagement and if you give a critique upon this piece before it is printed i expect to shine forth in the critical review or if it be published to have my person delineated by roberts and stuck in the window of bells circulating library   exeunt scene ii before the curtain enter roscius secundus as prologue the laboring be when his sharp sting is gone forgets his golden work and turns a drone such is a satire when you take away that rage in which his noble vigor lay the honeybag and venom lay so near that both together you resolved to tear and lost your pleasure to secure your fear this is plain levelling of wit in which the poor has all the advantage not the rich the blockhead stands excused for want of sense and wits turn blockheads in their own defense yet though the stages traffic is undone still scandal with her smuggling trade goes on though satire on the theater you smother in paragraphs you libel one another each flaming patriot who would rule the roast we find dissected in the  morning post while those who get in place and think they are wiser are butchered in the  general advertiser your magazines with scandal are replete and monthly damn a brace in  teteatete like desperate pirates they refuse all quarter wives widows virgins suffer in the slaughter yet women sure are privileged from war it is not like knights to draw upon the fair though true of late they act en militaire on this our poor epitome of stage against the vicious mortal war we wage eye natures walks shoot folly as it flies and catch the manners living as they rise we have tragic heroes here of mandrake root comedians cut from leg of poor sam foot our poet too as you this night will see is mostly made of shakespeares mulbrytree all that is not his own you will find is good he steals like other modern bards of  wood who cook up broken viands in a dish like spanish olio mixed with flesh and fish nay ladies do not laugh though small i am mighty my heart is english oak my head is lignum vitae exit scene iii the great bell tolls and the curtain rising slowly to solemn music discovers a long gothic aisle six wings on each side hung with black and black curtains falling in drapery from the roof ornamented with escutcheons banners ensigns armorial helmet crests pendants etc in the center stands a coffin covered with crimson a black pall flowing over it a canopy plumes etc at each wing stands a mourner and at the head of the coffin choristers  funeral dirge by the choristers a cold and breathless corse behold he lies his spirit fled far far beyond the skies see where the plumed sable hearse does stand behold the mutes a pensive weeping band virtue on earth adorned his manly breast of fair and manly grace he was possessed he knew nor harm nor guile nor used deceit he lived beloved and all his death regret the grieving crowds lift up their mournful voice none but the undertaker fell rejoice undertaker recitative fall back make room there stand aloof a light is breaking through the roof was ever seen so great a wonder look at the joists they fly asunder what can it be descends in thunder  thunder melpomene the tragic muse clothed in royal mourning descends in a chariot a dead march playing melpomene fate spoke the word the cruel arrow flew and jocund punch lies with the mighty dead oh what a phoenix lies here overthrown the observed of all observers quite quite down but all must die  the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts and what is life lifes but a walking shadow a poor player who vainly struts his time upon the stage and then is heard no more each gay scene that rises on the bosom of the earth must vanish the cloudcapt towers and gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit must dissolve and like the baseless fabric of a vision leave not a wreck behind soft music but lo the comic muse descends tearfalling pity starting from her eye pining in thought she comes and with a green and yellow melancholy she looks like patience on a monument smiling at grief  thalia the comic muse descends in a chariot thalia what is she whose woe bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand like wonderwounded hearers  melpomene it is i melpomene your sister muse thalia  this is a sorry sight   thalia alas poor punch i knew him well melpomene a fellow of infinite jests of most excellent fancy who held as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure he was not one of those robustuous perriwigpated fellows who tear a passion to very rags and who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb show and noise  he ever suited the action to the word the word to the action  he was a man of wax and all he has left behind are dishclouts to him no more like him than i to hercules   melpomene he was a man take him for all in all we shall not look upon his like again o what a grace was seated on his brow hyperions curls the front of jove himself o twas a brow where honor might be crowned sole monarch of the universal earth an eye ike mars to threaten and command a station ike the heraldmercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man  come thou thalia on purpose to attend these obsequies  thalia no other cause on earth could bring me down from mount parnassus or move me laughterloving goddess thus to tremble sob or shed a tear nor shake my solid virtue from her point but punchs death o let us cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world shall be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun  melpomene oh it is dark with him here he does lie upon the wings of night whiter than snow upon the ravens back come death come grimlookd death give me my favorite hero death rises clothed in royal robes a diadem on his head angels and ministers of

free punch from my chains with tears and too much grief still shows a lack of wit i am not to be moved you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate its usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he has made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretted with the gusts of heaven as bid me quit my prey from every living creature lifes my due the flesh of punch is mine and i stand here upon the forfeit and penalty of my bond  thalia what base insatiate monster can he be
