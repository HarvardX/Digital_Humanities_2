the westminster confession of faith relative to toleration of a false religion and the power of the civil magistrate about sacred matters and the nature origin ends and obligation of the national covenant and solemn league are heartily represented and defended  by john brown minister of the gospel in haddington  glasgow printed by john bryce and sold by the booksellers in town and country mdcclxxx  letter i on the absurdity of authoritative toleration of gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry sir how god himself connected religion and the civil welfare of nations in his ancient laws almost the whole of the old testament does bear witness that religion is the great basis of civil happiness was the common the avowed belief of every sensible heathen it was for ought i know the infamous monster tiberius who first pretended that the gods alone ought to regard or resent the injuries done them before the happy reformation the popish clergy had reduced civil rulers into mere tools for executing their pleasure in religious matters and pretended that they had no power of judging in them to free these rulers from such antichristian claims the protestant reformers every where as their confessions of faith and other writings make evident loudly maintained that to magistrates themselves independent of clergymen belongs a distinguished power in the reformation and preservation of religion not long after erastus a german physician and his followers to curry favor with their respective princes pretended that magistrates are the proper lords of the christian church from whom her ministers and other rulers derive their whole power and to whom they must be accountable this notion exceedingly flattering their ambition was too greedily embraced by most of the protestant princes nor do i know of one protestant church which has not suffered by means of it meanwhile the german anabaptists having experienced the frowns and sometimes the improper severities of magistrates copied after the ancient donatists in the like circumstances and warmly contended that magistrates have no more power about religious matters than any private person and ought to punish none for different sentiments in doctrine or forms of worship the socinians and remonstrant arminians except when magistrates favored themselves and promoted their cause zealously contended for the same notion at least in the case of ministers and worship which were not maintained at the public expense many if not most of the english independents in the last century were much of the same mind and hence by their influence some passages in the westminster confession of faith could never obtain a ratification by the english parliament or a place in their own savoy confession part of these passages relative to the magistrates power are also dropped from the confession of faith agreed to by the independents of new england in      most of the english dissenters of this century seem to be much of the same mind especially such as might otherwise have been exposed to danger on account of their open maintenance of arian socinian and quakerish blasphemies  lock and bishop hoadly and some others of the episcopalian party warmly espoused the same cause  this notion never received much countenance in scotland till mr glass of tealing commenced a furious newfashioned independent he mightily contended that the jewish nation was an ecclesiastical one and their kings ecclesiastical rulers that christian magistrates have no more power in religious matters than private christians and ought not to employ their power in advancing the true religion or in making laws with penalties in favor of it or in restraining or punishing heretics or false teachers nor ought they to give more encouragement to good christians than to other peaceable subjects  that the example of the reforming kings of judah in punishing idolatry and false worship and in promoting the true religion is not now to be imitated and that our fathers national covenanting against popery and other wickedness in favor of the true religion was unwarrantable and is not binding upon us  dr wisheart principal of the college of edinburgh in his sermons contended that magistrates have only a right to punish such crimes as strike immediately against the persons or property of men but not to punish any thing which strikes immediately against the honor of god as blasphemy or heresy that all men ought to have civil liberty to think and speak as they please providing they make no attack upon the welfare of civil society that none ought to be hampered in their search after truth by any requirement of their subscriptions to formulas or confessions of faith that children in their education ought never to be biassed to a side by learning catechisms which maintain the peculiar principles of a party these or the like notions have been adopted by not a few of the pretenders to modern illumination  in her public standards the church of scotland has renounced and in her solemn covenants has abjured both these extremes in her old confession of faitb which is expressly sworn to in the national covenant of      etc as in all points the undoubted truth of god art xxiv she asserts that the power and authority of magistrates is gods holy ordinance ordained for manifestation of his own glory and for the singular profit of mankind  they are the lieutenants of god in whose sessions god himself does fit and judge  to whom by god is given the sword to the praise and defense of good men and to punish all open malefactors to kings princes rulers and magistrates chiefly and most principally the conservation and purgation of religion appertains so that not only are they appointed for civil policy but also for maintenance of the true religion and for suppression of all idolatry and superstition whatsoever this doctrine is further asserted and explained in her second book of discipline chap ix the doctrine of her westminster confession of faith the whole of which is solemnly espoused and engaged to by every presbyterian minister and elder in scotland in his ordination vows is that for their publishing opinions or maintaining practices contrary to the light of nature and the known principles of christianity whether concerning faith worship or conversation or to the power of godliness or such erroneous opinions or practices as either in their own nature or in the manner of publishing and maintaining them are destructive to the external peace and order which christ has established in the church they may be lawfully called to account and proceeded against by  the power of the civil magistate chap xx    that god the supreme lord and king of all the world has ordained civil magistrates to be under him over the people for his own glory and the public good  they ought especially in managing their office to maintain piety justice and peace according to the wholesome laws of each commonwealth  that the civil magistrate  has authority and it is his duty to take order that unity and peace be preserved in the church and that the truth of god be kept pure and entire that all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed all corruptions and abuses in worship and discipline prevented and reformed and all the ordinances of god duly settled administered and observed for the better effecting of which he has power to call synods to be present at them and to provide that whatsoever is transacted in them be according to the mind of god chap xxiii        the duties required in the second commandment are  the disapproving detesting opposing all false worship and according to each ones place and calling removing it and all monuments of idolatry  the sins forbidden in the second commandment are all devising counselling commanding using and any ways approving any religious worship not instituted by god himself tolerating a false religion lar cat q  0   0  these declarations are an authentic explication of the power of the magistrate in maintaining and preserving the true religion the defense of which is expressly sworn in their solemn covenants with god if therefore sir you discredit this doctrine and plead the toleration of idolatry blasphemy heresy and that magistrates ought to meddle with nothing in religion be so honest as openly to renounce your ordination vows and the confession of faith and catechisms as well as the national covenant and solemn league  to illustrate the above doctrine of our excellent standards it is proper to observe   god alone is the necessarily existent and absolutely independent creator and preserver and therefore original and supreme proprietor and governor of all things in heaven or earth exodus iii   genesis i psalm civ and xxiv     xxxiii   lxxxiii

  no right or authority derived from god can therefore be lawfully improven or exercised in protecting encouraging allowing or commanding any thing which god himself on account of his infinite perfection in holiness justice goodness and truth cannot command  or in discouraging disallowing or prohibiting any thing which god in his law requires it is absurd to suppose it that god can give men a power which he has not himself and shocking blasphemy to suppose him capable of giving men a right and authority to contemn or counteract his own law as their rule or his own glory as their chief end in every thing they do   timothy ii    hab i       exodus xv    deuteronomy xxxii   zeph iii   james i      all the diversified forms of right and authority in conscience husbands parents masters magistrates ministers and even in christ as mediator being derived from the same god of infinite wisdom and order each of them may and ought to be wholly exercised within its proper department and in a manner answerable to its nature and never in the way of invading the place or interrupting the exercise of any other right or authority no right of conscience can be exercised to the interruption of the due exercise of marital parental magisterial magistratical ministerial or christs mediatorial authority nor can any regular exercise of these powers interrupt the due exercise of the power of conscience or of one another   cor xiv     0 vii  0      all these different forms of power and authority being derived from the same god may have the same things for their object but viewed in different respects the same man may be subject to the power of his conscience as he is a rational creature  subject to the power of parents as a child  subject to the power of masters as a servant  subject to the power of magistrates as a member of the commonwealth  subject to the power of churchrulers as a member of an organized visible church  subject to the mediatorial power of christ as a member of his mystical body or an agent for promoting the welfare of it  the same good work of piety or virtue may or ought to be required by conscience by parents masters magistrates ministers and even by christ as mediator in different respects as calculated to promote the welfare of the persons families nations and churches concerned  in subordination to the glory of god as their respective proprietor and superior the performance of the same good work may be encouraged by rewards from all these different powers answerable to their respective forms  the same vices of idolatry blasphemy calumny treason theft murder etc as in different respects hurtful to persons families civil societies and churches may and ought to be prohibited by all these different powers and resented by each as hurtful to itself as subordinated to god  in a manner answerable to its particular nature and department  by conscience with stinging rebukes  by parents with correction disinheriting or the like  by masters with frowns stripes abridgment of wages or the like  by magistrates with public dishonor fining imprisonment or death  by church rulers with ecclesiastical rebuke excommunication  by christ with temporal spiritual or eternal judgment acts xxiv    josh xxiv    psalm ci mat v vi vii etc   all these powers of conscience husbands parents masters magistrates churchrulers and of christ as mediator proceeding from an infinitely wise powerful and good god are each of them in its own place altogether sufficient to gain its own end  nevertheless it mightily tends to the advantage of each that all of them be rightly exercised at once and to the hurt os all the rest if any of them be not if conscience act faithfully this promotes the regular and comfortable exercise of the power of husbands parents masters magistrates or ministers etc and it is to the advantage of conscience if they regularly exercise their power and especially if christ exercise his in a remarkable manner it is much to the advantage of church and state if husbands parents and masters faithfully exercise their power in their respective departments and much to their hurt if they do not if the rulers in church and state faithfully discharge their trust it will tend much to promote the welfare of families the more faithfully ministers labor in winning souls to christ and teaching men to live soberly righteously and godly in view of christs second coming the more easy will the work of magistrates and the greater the happiness of the commonwealth be  the more faithfully magistrates act in curbing of crimes and promoting obedience to god the king of nations as a mean of securing his felicitating blessing to the commonwealth the more delightfully will church power be exercised and the more abundantly it will tend to the welfare of the church nay though the mediatorial power of christ be infinitely sufficient in its own place to answer its own ends yet the delightful exercise and success of it is not a little promoted by the faithful exercise of the powers of conscience husbands parents masters magistrates and churchrulers acts xxiv      timothy i   ephesians iv  vi col iii iv   and   timothy titus i  iii   pet ii  v psalm ii  0    rev ii    xvii       xxi    isa xlix    lx      0      though the marital parental magisterial magistratical and ministerial powers be altogether distinct from and independent of one another and each of them have its own particular exercises pertaining to it alone  yet the same person in respect of different relations may be at once superior or inferior to another person  and so may be required to fulfill the particular duties of his station by one who has not any lawful right to perform them himself thus magistrates and ministers as such may require husbands to perform their duties to their wives parents to perform theirs to their children or masters theirs to their servants as a mean of promoting the welfare of the commonwealth and of the church in obedience to god and aiming at his glory an uncrowned husband of a queen may command her faithfully to exercise her magistratical power as a means of honor and happiness to his family and she as queen may command him in every thing relating to the welfare of the state as her officer or subject a parent may require his son as such faithfully to exercise his ministerial magistratical or magisterial power as a mean of honor and happiness to his family a son may command his father who is his servant in every thing pertaining to the service due from him and even to order his family aright in so far as it tends to promote that service ministers as the ambassadors of christ have power to require magistrates as church members faithfully to exercise their magistratical power so as may best promote the honor of christ and the welfare of his church and on the other hand magistrates have power to require ministers as their subjects faithfully to exercise their ministerial power as a mean of rendering the nation pious and virtuous in order to promote its happiness  and all this in subordination to the law and to promote the glory of god as the supreme governor of families churches or nations   though the marital parental magisterial magistratical and ministerial powers have each of them something for its peculiar and distinguishing object in which no other power can interfere with it  thus it is always unlawful for husbands parents masters or ministers as such to assume the power of civil magistrates in levying taxes adjudging criminals to death  always unlawful for parents masters or magistrates as such to preach the gospel dispense sacraments or church censures  yet if the exercise of some of these powers be fearfully neglected or abused the other powers may be exercised in order to rectify the disorders occasioned further than would be proper if there were no such neglect abuse or disorder thus if husbands parents or masters fearfully abuse their power relative to wives children or servants the rulers of church or state for the benefit of these societies may interfere more with their familyconcerns than would be proper in other circumstances if churchrulers be notoriously negligent or wicked magistrates as church members and to promote the welfare of the state may do more in the reformation of the church than would be proper for them if church rulers were diligent and faithful and if through the indolence or wickedness of magistrates the affairs of the nation be thrown into terrible confusion ministers as members of the commonwealth and to promote the welfare of the church may do more in the rectification of affairs than would be proper if the magistrates were faithful   kings xi   chronicles xxiii  0 all governing authority empowers the possessors of it to issue forth laws or commandments binding on the subject of it but these laws or commandments can extend their binding force no further than the particular department belonging to that power as by that every particular form of authority derived from god is limited the laws or commandments of parents masters magistrates and churchrulers extend only to external things in the family commonwealth or church these of conscience and of christ extend also to that which is inward in the heart  and as all human superiors are imperfect in knowledge themselves and cannot enable their subjects perfectly to understand their whole duty it is necessary that laws of families or nations or constitutions of churches require nothing but what is plainly agreeable to the law of god and nothing in religion but what is plainly required by the word of god that so nothing may be contrary to these laws but what is not only really but plainly contrary to the word of god and the weaker the subjects are the more condescension ought to be exercised toward them in this matter romans xv        as men cannot bow the hearts of their inferiors unto subjection they ought always to issue forth their commandments in the most prudent mild and gaining manner it is very improper to issue forth any law doubtful or obscure or which most of the subjects are not likely to be got peaceably to comply with this ought especially to be attended to in the framing and imposing of laws and constitutions relative to religion which ought to be a reasonable and voluntary service    as nothing particularly in religion ought to be contrary to any law of church or state but what is plainly contrary to the law of god and nothing ought to be held censurable by the laws of the church or punishable by the laws of the state but what is plainly contrary to these laws and has become duly public in the providence of god without requiring the party concerned to be his own accuser  so on account of the weakness or number of the offenders or the disordered state of the society many real scandals in the church must be forborne without centure and many real crimes against the state forborne without punishment notwithstanding it would be extremely wicked authoritatively to license or tolerate them in either if your children be very young raving in a fever delirious or apt to fall into convulsive fits it might be very prudent and dutiful for you to forbear severe chastisement of them for playing on the lords day repeating some wicked expressions they had heard from their fellow children or the like but would it be lawful in you to give them a parental license to profane the sabbath or name of god and promise them protection in so doing you dare not pretend it god himself wisely forbears the punishment of many things which his law forbids    as it is never errors or corruptions of the heart but wicked words and deeds sufficiently and regularly manifested which are to be corrected in families punished in commonwealths or censured in churches deuteronomy xiii       xvii    heb x      timothy v    so even in punishing manifest crimes especially in matters of religion all proper mildness ought to be exercised never proceeding to extremities where there is any hope of reformation or where as in the case of heresy or blasphemy confession and repentance can make any kind of restitution mat xviii        among the hebrews not one appears to have been punished for idolatry if he professed repentance and reformation the princes of israel first attempted to bring the reubenites and gadites whom they supposed guilty of it to repentance josh xxii never in the reformation by asa hezekiah or jofiah have we one instance of a penitent idolater slain the idolaters condemned to death deuteronomy xiii xvii are represented as men of belial presumptuous and obstinate in their wickedness the prophets of baal whom elijah caused be put to death   kings xviii  0 and mattan the priest who was slain by jehoiadas orders   kings xi    were no doubt of this sort and probably also guilty of promoting the murder of the lords prophets and people the man put to death for profanation of the sabbath appears to have acted presumptuously number xv  0     asa and his subjects covenanted to put to death such as obstinately adhered to idolatry   chronicles xv          magistrates ought never to attempt forcing men to believe with their hearts even the most fundamental truths of religion or to practice any religious duty  that being no means appointed by god for convincing them of the truth or inducing them to a cordial performance of religious duties   cor x     but it would be highly absurd hence to infer that magistrates may not restrain men from robbing nations or churches of those divine truths which god has graciously entrusted to them and which are inexpressibly profitable to them  or restrain them from propagating gross heresies blasphemies idolatries which undermine and exclude the true religion provoke god o destroy nations and are the fruitful seeds of contention confusion and every evil work no magistrate can compel me to love my neighbor as my self or can justly compel me to divide mine inheritance with him but he may lawfully punish me for calumniating or robbing him  it is therefore extremely uncandid in the advocates for magistratical tolerations of heresy blasphemy and idolatry always to attempt blending or placing on an equal level true and false religion  mere neglect of some positive duties of religion and shocking insults upon and opposition to the duties of religion  lesser and secret mistakes in religion and the most damnable heresies blasphemies and idolatries openly and obstinately professed and practiced as if these were equally objects of toleration restraint or punishment  or to confound a mere forbearance to punish with an authoritative license openly to prosess and practice what is criminal respecting religion the true religion ought never to need a toleration it ought always to have an establishment whereas a false one ought never to be established magistrates having no power against the truth but for the truth there are many mere neglects or lesser mistakes in religion against which it would not be proper for magistrates to enact civil laws in this present state of imperfection and if there be no civil law against them they cannot be punishable as crimes where no law is there can be no transgression  mere forbearance to punish what is plainly contrary to law is in some cases necessary and in imitation of god himself and gives no positive encouragement to wickedness whereas a positive or authoritative toleration proclaims to men a liberty to sin and promises them protection in so doing if the provider for an army deliver to them fine flour mixed with some particles of bran and a large quantity of arsenic is his delivery of the sine flour or even of the mixture of bran as criminal and punishable as that of the mixture of arsenic no man that is not mad will pretend it for the fine flour he deserves the highest encouragement for the bran he may be justiy forborne but for the arsenic he deserves to be hanged  the toleration which i mean to oppose if plainly and heartily expressed would run thus we the king and parliament of  as powers ordained of god  ministers of god for good to men  as the ordinance of god for the terror and punishment of evil doers and the praise of them that do well  as nursing fathers to the church of christ  in order that all our subjects may come to the knowledge of the truth and lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty  do hereby in the name and authority of the most high god from whom we have derived all that governing power which we possess that we ruling in his fear may exercise it wholly in obedience to his law and to promote his declarative glory in the world  grant to all and every one of you our said subjects an authoritative toleration or legal license  openly and obstinately to pervert contradict and revile the declarations of god contained in his word  and in the most in solent and abusive manner to blaspheme his nature perfections purposes and works particularly of the redemption of mankind  and to corrupt his worship represent him in it in the most absurd and abominable forms  or rob him of it giving it to devils monsters of wickedness brutes stocks or stones in his stead  and with all your might to exert yourselves in making your fellow subjects do the like  and we hereby do in the same name and authority of god the king of nations promise you every kind and degree of civil protection in all such behavior as you can profess or pretend your consciences do dictate or allow  providing always that you commit your outrage only against god your and our maker and sovereign  but do not disturb the external peace of the nation in reviling the civil character seizing or hurting the civil property or any way abusing the body of any of your fellow sinners of mankind  the correspondent warrant of conscience which we mean to impugn if honestly expressed would run thus i conscience as the great deputy of the most high god lord and lawgiver of the world implanted in every mans breast for his temporal spiritual and eternal advantage do hereby in gods name and authority and in the exercise of my power which is wholly derived from him and to be exercised for his glory in trying all things by his law and approving and holding fast that which is good  warrant and authorize all and every one of you sons and daughters of men to devise believe openly and obstinately profess and zealously propagate every damnable heresy and blasphemous opinion and to practice and propagate every absurd and abominable form of idolatry which satan who deceives the world and a heart deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and given up of god to strong delusion belief of lies vile affections and a reprobate sense can make you think innocent or proper  and i do hereby in the same name and authority  grant you my sacred claim of right to all manner of liberty and protection from the civil magistrate in so doing  providing always that you commit such injury and outrage only against god your infinitely excellent high and gracious proprietor and superior and do no civil injury to the body character or property of your fellow creatures such is indeed the toleration which many praise or plead for and this i proceed to impugn by the following arguments  i mens pleadings for it do all of them necessarily proceed on their adopting such atheistical principles as the following   mens natural or civil rights to their property liberty profits and honors are not originally derived from god  and ought to protect them in their most outrageous sinning against him   mens consciences have a right and authority underived from and independent of god by which it can warrant them to think and speak of or act toward god as insolently and blasphemously as they please   that if the law of god be any rule to men it is not so in respect of any intrinsic meaning affixed to it by him but merely as it is understood by every man particularly in that which relates to their behavior toward god   all men being ready to mistake we ought always to believe that our opponents may have as just a view of the scriptures as ourselves and never to condemn them for that which they do not own to be blasphemy idolatry or heresy   magistrates right and authority to govern others does not originate in god as the creator preserver and king of nations but in magistrates themselves or in their subjects and so may be exercised as they please particularly in requiring or allowing their subjects to belie blaspheme or rob god   magistrates may be moral governors deputies or lieutenants under god without having any power or authority relating to religion or his honor   not the law of god natural or revealed but the laws of nations ought to be the supreme standard of all civil government   not the declarative glory of god as the most high over all the earth but the civil peace and prosperity of nations ought to be the chief end of magistrates in all their acts of government   mens natural rights of conscience or their civil rights or the authority of magistrates may or ought to empower warrant or protect them in gross heresy blasphemy idolatry or other outrageous abuse and injury of god but can by no means warrant or protect them in calumny theft murder or any other injuries against men  0 there is no real difference between moral good and evil at least in things pertaining to god and so true and false religion are equally calculated to promote the welfare of civil society and the virtues which render men good peaceable useful and honorable rulers or subjects  and hence heretics blasphemers and idolaters may be good subjects    the favor or indignation of god is of no importance to civil society and therefore magistrates ought to use no means to procure his favor by the encouragement of true religion or to avert his indignation by the restraint of gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry  but only labor to procure the friendship of men and prevent their injuring the character property or bodies of their subjects  that all these propositions are really atheistical is manifest they all give up with the necessary existence infinite excellency and absolute supremacy of god without any of which he cannot be god at all  that lock hoadly blackburn voltaire and others advocates for authoritative toleration of false religion found their pleadings on the above propositions is no less evident to every judicious and unbiassed observer  nay did not modesty forbid i might defy all the world to plead for such toleration without taking all or some of the above or like atheistical propositions for granted  ii the scriptures plainly represent magistrates granting of men an unrestrained freedom to profess and practice a false religion as extremely sinful and hurtful   it is in the name of god to

against the truth but for it deuteronomy xvii      0 josh i     psalm cxix      0    cor xiii     they ought to consult with faithful ministers of the church either as met in synods or otherwise as it may be expected they know the laws of god relative to religion deuteronomy xvii       mal ii     chronicles xv       thus in making these laws churchrulers help magistrates with their direction while magistrates help them with their civil encouragements   chronicles xix  0    ezekiel xliv         they ought to require the ministers who are in their dominions faithfully to instruct their subjects in the whole counsel of god contained in his word relative to those points of religion about which they intend to make laws that they may be thus prepared willingly to receive and obey them  thus jehoshaphat first sent teachers and then judges throughout his dominions   chronicles xvii xix   in all matters of religion great care ought to be taken to establish the laws with and by the consent of the subjects or their representatives  thus strengthening these laws through their binding men who are willing to obey them  and the rather as the principal end of such laws is lost unless men willingly obey them   chronicles xv      xx    jonah iii       in these laws a special regard ought to be shown to persons of a weak and tender conscience political shepherds ought never to over drive their flock but to carry the lambs in their bosom and that the very weakest of their subjects may be qualified to obey their laws they ought never to establish any thing in religion but what is plainly as well as really established by god in his law  that so nothing may be contrary to their law but what is plainly contrary to gods law ezekiel xxxiv    iv though the law of god allows not of magistrates attempting to force men into the faith profession or practice of the true religion or of their punishing any thing relative to it which is not an open and manifest violation of the law of god and plainly destructive of the welfare of the commonwealth  yet it requires them to restrain and even seasonably and suitably to punish blasphemy idolatry and like grosser corruptions and insults upon the true religion when they become openly notorious and especially if obstinately continued in to the just offense and hurt of others   such restraint and punishment are represented in scripture

own spiritual and eternal advantage magistrates as such have a power of politically judging and determining what and how principles and practices of the true religion are to be connected with political rewards or encouragements or what ought to be professed and practiced by persons as members of their political society in order to promote the real welfare of it in subordination to the glory of god as king of nations   if they may enact laws in the matters of god as has been proven and may judge in what is fundamental in religion  or in that which is contained in express words of scripture  or in matters of the second table of the moral law  then they must have power to judge of that which is plainly deducible from the express words of scripture by necessary consequence  and in those matters of the first table of the moral law which as much belong to the law of nature as any in the second  have power politically to judge why and how such a religious profession and practice is to be encouraged by the civil authority and how and why that which is notoriously opposite to the true religion is to be discouraged   without this political judging of them magistrates could never determine whether the decisions of ecclesiastical courts ought to be ratisied by their civil authority or not   thessalonians v    acts xvii    if in judging of those things magistrates improve the word the spirit and the faithful ministers of god for their counselors they bid fair to have a divine sentence in their lips and not to err in judgment deuteronomy xvii      0 psalm cxix

subjects or their representatives  and also to ecclesiastical censure if they be church members   if magistrates be nursing fathers to the christian church isa xlix    they ought to prevent her being poisoned with corrupt food and hence must have a power politically to judge what is corrupt and what is not   if the magistrate be the keeper of the peace of the kingdom then if a party in the church complaining of the gross errors of the other should form a furious schism he must have power politically to judge who is in the right or in the wrong  who adhere to the truths established by law and who do not  and to show favor accordingly   thessalonians v      if magistrates may restrain and punish evil doers they may exercise this power over church officers if in their synods they make blasphemous or idolatrous decrees which tend to disturb the commonwealth and dishonor god the king of nations  and hence must politically judge of their conduct by the laws of god and the land  no covenanted subjection to church judicatures as a member of the church can deprive them of this political judgment any more than of their right of cognition and discretion as men and christians magistrates political judgment how principles or practices are to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragements is no infallible rule of church courts judging how principles and practices ought to be connected with ecclesiastical encouragements or censures nor are the decisions of ecclesiastical courts any infallible rule to direct magistrates but the law of god is the only infallible and supreme rule to both nor is the decision of the one subordinate to that of the other but both as well as every mans right to judge for himself according to the law of god what he is to believe and practice in order to his own peace and comfort and his joyful answering in the final judgment of god are supreme in their respective departments subordinated only to the judgment of god himself  but to argue the matter still more particularly    if magistracy conscience and human rights natural and civil be all derived from god as all but atheists must allow magistrates can have no more power authoritatively to tolerate sin than god himself can command it if god by virtue of the infinite perfection of his nature have no will no power authoritatively to proclaim liberty to commit sin he cannot communicate any such power to the magistrate nor can the magistrate account to god for exceeding his power in licensing that which is infinitely injurious to him more than the british kings lionkeeper has power or could be accountable for loosing and hunting out the lions in the tower upon his majesty if conscience derive all its power from god it can have no more power to enjoin any thing sinful than lord north has to hire ruffians to assassinate his sovereign if all human rights be derived from god the primary and supreme proprietor of all things it is impossible they can authorize men to contrive or commit any thing sinful or can protect them in it    mens state in this world is neither separated nor separable from but closely connected with their eternal state and magistracy is an ordinance of god appointed by him for his own glory and to promote the chief end of mankind in glorifying him romans xiii   prove xvi     cor x      pet iv    romans xii    but how sir do magistrates promote this end if they give the same degree of protection though perhaps not of encouragement to the soulruining and practicecorrupting delusions and abominations of satan as they

mere matter a mere man a mere creature a worker of contradiction and nonsense  as they do to those who faithfully proclaim his infinite excellencies and glorious works of redemption publish his truths and promote the present and future holiness and happiness of mankind  if god chiefly aim at the glorifying of himself in the advancement of the kingdom of christ how can magistrates who are appointed by him as his vicegerents for promoting his glory on earth be allowed far less obliged by him to exert their power as much for protecting or promoting the kingdom of the devil as for the advancement

strike against him  if they be gods ministers they must transact all their magistratical managements in his name  and how can god empower his own ministers as such and acting in his name to promote his highest dishonor licensing encouraging and protecting gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry  giving as much encouragement to the vilest delusions of satan as to the new testament in jesus blood  how can they be ministers of god for good to men without having power to restrain such as like wolves and murderers go about corrupting the principles and practices and destroying the sons of his and their subjects how can they be ministers of god the father of spirits for good universal good to men who are not brutes but endowed with precious and immortal souls which are more beneficial in commonwealths than their bodies without having power to promote the cultivation and welfare of souls as a means of promoting the happiness of that state how can they be ministers of god for good to men if they have power only to punish these crimes which strike immediately against their bodies or external property but no power to punish crimes as they provoke gods wrath against the nation  if they have power to restrain the petty thief robber or other less hurtful things  but none to prevent the kindling of gods wrath against the nation and the debauching of mens consciences and morals by blasphemy heresy idolatry etc which may quickly do more real mischief to a nation than ten thousand thieves or robbers could do  after god has expressly commanded to punish murderers as destroyers of

effectually conduces to make all their subjects live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty and make all men come to the saving knowledge of the truth   timothy ii       but how sir

produces the most ruinous practices  which is due to that doctrine worship and practice which is according to godliness and promotes glory honor immortality eternal life how can they rule in the fear of god if in their magistratical administrations they show no regard to that religion by which his declarative glory is advanced but instead thereof license protect and encourage that which infinitely dishonours and offends him    the fourth commandment the obligation of which is certainly moral and perpetually binding on magistrates as well as on heads of families commands them to cause the weekly sabbath to be sanctified by all within their gates i e all their subjects exodus xx  0 jer xvii  0     and to this the approven example of nehemiah corresponds neh xiii        now if magistrates cannot answer to god for encouraging or protecting their subjects in their civil business which is of itself lawful and useful  on the the sabbath  how will they account to him for protecting and encouraging men in teaching blasphemous errors or practicing abominable idolatries on that day how can this commandment bind them to restrain what is in itself lawful and useful  and yet bind them not to restrain but allow encourage and protect that which is in itself infinitely dishonorable to god their superior and ruinous to his and their subjects in both temporal and eternal interests  or dare you pretend that the observance of the weekly sabbath depends one whit less on revelation than the doctrine of the trinity of persons in the godhead does    if magistrates have power on proper occasions to appoint religious fasts as means of turning away gods wrath and of procuring or obtaining his blessings to their commonwealth as it is certain yourself and perhaps every advocate for authoritative toleration acknowledge jonah iii     0   samuel vii       chronicles xx       ezra viii        neh ix   jer xxxvi      they cannot but have power to establish that religion and only that religion which answers to those ends and to restrain that damnable heresy blasphemy and idolatry which provoke gods wrath against his subjects to command their subjects to mourn over the grounds of his anger and supplicate his favor while at the same time they encouraged and protected them in gross heresy public blasphemy and idolatry than which nothing can more provoke his indignation would be fearful dissimulation with the most high psalm lxvi    ezekiel xiv      if magistrates have power to appoint a christian fast and to punish the public contemners of it or of their authority in appointing it  how can they but have power to establish the true christian religion and to punish if seasonable the public and insolent contemners and corrupters of it and despisers of their authority in establishing it  dare you pretend that the upright profession and practice of the christian religion is less calculated to promote the happiness of a nation in subordination to the honor of god than an occasional fast or that a christian fast can be observed without entering into the very marrow of the doctrines of revelation  or that magistrates ought merely to require the day to be observed in fasting leaving the manner and object of the worship wholly to the choice of their subjects  recommending the worship of devils as much as that of jehovah and supposing the one as able and ready to avert calamities and bestow necessary blessings as the other if you pretend that god rewarded ahab or the ninevites for worshipping their idols you must prove that god is so far from being highly displeased with idolatry as himself often declares deuteronomy xxxii              judges ii      kings xvii  0     psalm cvi      0 jer xlviii      l    etc  that he is ready to accept and reward the worship of idols devils bulls dogs cats saints leeks onions consecrated wafers etc if men be sincere in it rare doctrine this for a presbyterian clergyman of this enlightened age    if every parent or master ought for the welfare of his family in subordination to the honor of the god of all families to establish the true religion in it genesis xviii    josh xxiv    to remove idols out of it gn xxxv      and to refuse seducing hereties a lodging in it   john x     and if according to this injunction and those approved examples he ought to extrude a seducer who had entered or even a member of the family who obstinately endeavored to corrupt the rest with damnable error blasphemy or idolatry  in order to prevent the infection of the family and hinder the destructive wrath of god from falling on them  why must not magistrates who are gods ministers for good be allowed power and authority to establish and promote the true christian religion in their large political families and to repress or exclude notorious murderers of souls and kindlers of the wrath of god the relation of a parent or master is no more spiritual than that of a magistrate makes no man either member or officer of christs mystical body any more than magistracy does  and i dare defy all the tolerants on earth to point out one thing relative to religion competent to masters and parents as such but magistrates may do what is similar or to prove that the true knowledge faith profession and practice of revealed religion is one whit less necessary and useful in commonwealths than in families   0 if the power of ecclesiastical rulers extends to all the civil transactions of church members  all the magistratical and military managements of kings or emperors not excepted in so far as they are regulated by the law of christ and are immediately connected with his honor and the good of his church  there is equal reason that the power of magistrates should extend to religious matters in so far as they are connected with the welfare of the state in subordination to the honor of god as king of nations no reason can be assigned why the vicegerents of god should as such act as atheists regardless of religion any more than the messengers of christ nor till it be proven that god the king of nations is more inclined to damnable heresy blasphemy and idolalatry than christ the head of the church can it be possible to prove that magistrates have one whit more power authoritatively to license encourage or promise them protection than churchrulers have  though as the church is a select holy society called out of the world which lies in wickedness founded on and having all her adult members instructed by the revelation of christ the same degree of forbearance to censure in the church as to punish in the state is by no means proper     unless true and false religion be equally calculated to render men good subjects or magistrates and to promote the peace and prosperity

plainly requires that magistrates maintain and promote the honor of that god who gave them all their power and authority  that god who is the original and supreme proprietor and sovereign of nations and societies and the allsufficient source of all their happiness  that they govern their subjects not as if they were dogs or swine having nothing but their bodies to care for but as men endowed with rational and immortal souls  that as righteousness exalts a nation and sin is the reproach of any people they should exercise their whole power and authority as is best calculated to make all their subjects behave most agreeably to the law and declarative glory of god and most usefully to each other  it plainly teaches that if god graciously grant us a supernatural revelation directive of our faith profession and practice we ought thankfully to receive believe profess and obey it  that if magistrates ought to restrain and punish gross immoralities they ought to restrain that error or worship which being a manifestly damning work of the flesh natively leads men into such immoralities  and that if heresy blasphemy and idolatry hinder the progress of virtue or the increase of good men who are the principal support and blessings of a society isa vi    lxv   genesis xviii           0       they ought to be restrained  if heresy blasphemy and idolatry established or authoritatively tolerated eminently and notoriously provoke god to punish nations with sword famine pestilence poverty decay of trade desolation captivity or the like as they have often done even among heathens common sense requires that every magistrate from regard to the welfare of his subjects ought to restrain them as far as his circumstances can prudently permit  instead of giving them as much liberty encouragement or protection as he gives to the religion of jesus christ which has the promises of this life and of that which is to come   timothy iv   titus iii      proverbs xiv        if sir as you pretend magistrates ought to tolerate heresy idolatry and blasphemy  then a power and office derived from god ought to be employed and executed in encouraging the most shocking dishonours and outrage against him  the authority of god placed in and exercised by magistrates ought to be set in opposition to his own immediate authority manifested in his word  they as ministers of god for good to men ought to license and encourage his enemies to deny pervert and revile his truths contained in his oracles and confirmed by the blood of his son and to introduce the most accursed and damnable errors into their place in his church  ought to give the devil and his agents as much countenance and assistance in driving men to hell as they give to jesus christ and his faithful servants in leading them to heaven  ought to give a company of wizards as much countenance and protection in worshipping the devil and his angels as a society of precious saints worshipping the lord and his christ in the beauty of holiness  in short authoritative tolerations of heresy blasphemy or idolatry are solemn proclamations issued forth by the deputies of god in his name bearing that satan and his emissaries have full liberty granted them to cast forth their floods of error and every abomination that proceeds from it for the dishonor of god and the temporal and eternal destruction of men nor for ought i know have they ever neglected to improve their opportunity as the issues of the tolerations granted by cromwell k james vii and q anne in part manifest  how absurd

infallible lawgiver he alone has power to constitute any thing a part of religion but that no more hinders his magistratical vicegerents to make political laws in favors of what he has declared and instituted in religion than christ being head of the church can hinder her subordinate rulers to make ecclesiastical constitutions in favors of the truth in his name psalm lxxxii     romans xiii        fet ii         neither magistrates nor ministers can make any law which of themselves and as their deeds bind mens conscience their authority is not infallibly exercised it does not reach to the inward actings of conscience they cannot oblige conscience to these actings or take any cognizance of them they cannot free it from any guilt contracted by them or reward it if it does well or punish or censure it if it does amiss nor are their constitutions but gods law the standard by which it shall be judged at the last day  but they may make laws or constitutions which as originating from subordinated to and adopted and ratisied by the law of god bind men to obey for conscience sake romans xiii      mat xviii      gods being the only lawgiver of men under the old testament as much as now did not hinder moses david asa jehoshaphat hezekiah josiah nehemiah nebuchadnezzar the chaldean darius the mede cyrus darius and artaxerxes persians or the king of nineveh to make civil laws in favors of the true religion   if god alone be the lawgiver and lord of the conscience it necessarily follows that magistrates and conscience who are his deputies can have no power to warrant license or protect any thing forbidden by his law   cor xiii    0  object ii every man has a natural right to judge for himself what he ought to do or forbear especially in religion he is to be fully persuaded in his own mind and to follow the dictates of his own conscience even the law of god is a rule to him as he understands it in his own conscience to force any man to do any thing contrary to his conscience is to force him to sin for whatsoever is not of says is sin and to punish him for following the dictates of his conscience is to punish him for doing his duty answ   already you have made mens conscience the supreme governor of their actions exalting it above the most high god   every man has a natural right derived from god to judge all things by the law of god and hold fast that which is good   thessalonians v    he has a right to judge by the law of god what is necessary to be professed and practiced in order to the peace of his conscience and his fellowship with and receiving of favors from god but that no more hinders magistrates politically to judge what profession and practice are proper for men as members of such a particular commonwealth  or what relative to religion is to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragements  than it hinders churchrulers ecclesiastically to judge and define what profession or practice is necessary in order to comfortable fellowship with such a particular church   mens conscience is no lawgiver at all but a witness of their conduct and a judge which enquires into the meaning of gods law and directs accordingly  and which compares their qualities profession and practice with the law of god and if faithful approves or disapproves accordingly   the law of god not mens conscience is their supreme and only insallible rule which binds even conscience itself mark xii  0   john v   and whatever men do contrary to it is sinful let their conscience approve it as much as they will   john iii   lev v       acts xxvi    0   timothy i        whatever proceeds not from the persuasion of a good conscience founded on the word of god is sin it is a sin for mens conscience to err in dictating any thing not perfectly agreeable to the law of god  how absurd to pretend that this fin can render another sin duty or a duty sinful in itself   if mens conscience in itself or in its directing persuading or instigating influence be sustained as the immediate rule of their conduct without respect to the word of god then either their conscience must be insallible in its dictates which it certainly is not in either saints or sinners in this world romans vii       prove xxviii    jer xvii   romans viii     tit i    or if it be fallible god must have established for men a fallible and deceitful rule of truth and holiness  and so be the author of confusion in religion since different consciences dictate different things in it  to make mens conscience their rule in religion would make god the author and commander of wickedness  by conscience requiring the transgression of his own law  it would make him not only acquit from criminality but approve as duty the most damnable errors horrid blasphemies detestable abominations and cruel barbarities if but dictated by the consciences of heathens mahotans papists etc in their religion  it would make him the author of mens ruin if it were procured by a way which seemed right in their own eyes prove xvi     it would render it absolutely impossible to convince men of the sinfulness of any thing they had done according to the dictates of their conscience be it ever so contrary to the law of god it would render it improper for men to repent of or mourn over any blasphemy murder of saints or the like which their deluded conscience had dictated to them or to ask receive or praise god for the pardoning of it contrary to   timothy i        with acts xxvi       gal i       phil iii   it would open a wide gap for mens doing whatever they pleased without being chargeable by at least any man for it  if men should be executed for the most horrid blasphemy or abominable idolatry high treason or any other deed dictated by their conscience they would die martyrs for righteousness sake  and men ought to believe whatever their conscience dictated to them concerning their state experience or duty however contrary to the testimony of god contained in his word  contrary to psalm iii    and xvi    xlii      rev iii      to pretend that the law of god not in itself but as understood by mens conscience is their rule is absurd it in the popish manner represents the law of god as destitute of sense and authority in itself and as deriving it from a creature it in the quakerish manner makes the light within the rule of mens conduct it exalts every man to an equality with or rather superiority above god having power to give regulating sense and authority to his word according as an erroneous and defiled conscience pleases it abolisheth every real standard of religion every mans particular apprehensions of the meaning of gods word being his binding rule the same word of god becomes the standard of calvinism popery socinianism etc as different men understand it it saps the foundation of all mutual trust and confidence among men and opens a wide inlet for all manner of villainy and dissimulation according to it mens promises oaths vows and covenants  their sworn and subscribed creeds articles confessions formulas etc bind them not according to the common meaning of the words  but according to the meaning which their conscience however seared biassed or deluded puts upon them in fine it plunges men into the depths of atheism according to which every man believes and acts what is right in his own eyes   if mens private judgment of their own acts hindered the magistrates supreme political judgment no laws could be made in matters of religion or any thing else as some would be readily of a different mind even in the fundamentals of religion and virtue  while some believed that christ was not true god or true man or that idols might be worshipped others would believe that oaths might be lawfully violated heretical princes assassinated or women and goods used in common   if other mens private judgment be allowed to be their supreme rule and reason of conduct it will necessarily follow that magistrates private judgment must be the rule of their conduct and that they ought to make and execute such laws as they believe in their own heart to be proper be they as arbitrary and tyrannical as they will   it is not with mens conscience and its judgment in religion any more than in matters of common honesty that magistratical authority intermeddles but with their external words and deeds it only restrains and punishes such of those as are manifestly contrary to the laws of god and the land and as they are hurtful to the commonwealth and the public honor of god as king of nations  0 if all proper means of conviction be used with men who obstinately persist in gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry without effect their mistake does not arise from a conscience regulating duty but from one stiffened against duty and it is perhaps sometimes as difficult to convince a hardened thief robber or adulterer of his mistake as it is to convince a hardened heretic men are punishable not for what their conscience as the deputy of god dictates but for what they would not have done if they had any proper conscience of duty    if men slothfully and especially wilfully refuse to use the means of ealightening their conscience by the word of god they but add to their crimes both before god and men by pretending conscience    mens conscience being as much a director in their conduct toward men as in their conduct toward god its influence must have as much force to keep them from accountableness  men for their theft murder calumny as for their gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry  object iii to allow magistrates such power of judging and of making and executing laws about religious matters is to render christians the servants of men contrary to   cor vii    answ   if so christ himself rendered his redeemed favorites servants of men under the old testament   if so church rulers being men as well as magistrates their restraints and censures appointed by christ himself must as much render christians servants of men  nay to comply with the religious orders of families would make them servants of men   servilely to comply with the vain fancies humors sinful lusts or laws of men particularly in religion is to be the servants of men in the sense of this text but to comply with scriptural restraints censures or punishments of wickedness is to act as servants of christ and his father and spirit  object iv to restrain men from what they think right in religion and especially to punish them for it is contrary to that christian charity which suffers long and is kind  envieth not  thinks no evil bears all things believes all things and hops all things   cor xlii      contrary to that meekness mercy and peaceableness exemplified in christ and required in christians romans xv   gal vi     ephesians iv      timothy ii    james iii    answ christian charity rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth it requires that nothing should be done out of malice or envy or rashly on bare surmises or without due examination of facts and circumstances but not that rulers either of church or state should overlook every scandal or crime contrary to the law of god even the undue delay of censure or punishment encourages men in wickedness much more would the total overlooking of it eccl viii      the texts quoted in the objection are directed to christians and churchrulers is therefore all their holy zeal and activity in restraining and censuring the corrupters of the church according to christs command rev ii romans xvi    gal v  0 tit iii  0   timothy i  0  contrary to christian charity meekness or mercifulness had moses quite abandoned his unparalelled meekness when he so zealously punished the hebrew idolaters number xxxii   with exodus xxxii        was jesus christ destitute of all meekness and mercy when he appointed the restraints and penalties under the old testament and at least the tremenduous censure of excommunication under the new was he destitute of all charity meekness and mercy in never giving us a hint that these laws are now repealed as having been cruel and tyrannical was he destitute of all charity meekness and mercy when the zeal of his fathers house did eat him up  when he repeatedly drove the buyers and sellers from the temple john ii        mat xxi     object v even under the law moses tolerated mens divorcing of their wives for slight causes much more does the gospel dispensation call for liberty to men answ it is blasphemous to pretend that the gospel dispensation allows any more liberty to fin than the legal did must the grace of god be turned into lasciviousness jude ver   gal v      to prevent worse consequences moses directed a deliberate and solemn manner of divorce which tended to render divorces less frequent or irregular but never warranted divorce for slight causes   perhaps you cannot prove that the perpetual continuance of marriage relation flows as necessarily from the nature of god as gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry are contrary to it god therefore might sovereignly dispense with the one though not with the other   this objection is rather calculated to prove that magistrates should license or tolerate murder adultery theft and other sins against the second table of the moral law than that they should tolerate heresy blasphemy and idolatry which pertain to the first table  object vi gamaliels counsel refrain from these men and let them alone for if this work be of men it will come to naught but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it was certainly prudent and gallios conduct who cared for no disputes relative to religion acts v       and xviii       answ   prove that gamaliels speech was inspired as a rule to us in all religious disputes or that magistrates or others ought to be mere skeptics in religion   that which gamaliel pled to be let alone was evidently good calculated to promote the welfare of both church and state and so ought to have had the utmost encouragement from him and his fellow rulers   prove if you can that the holy ghost approves gallios carelessness or that magistrates like him ought to allow parties at the bar to beat one another  object vii under the gospel it is promised that men should beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and that there should be none to hurt or destroy in gods holy mountain isa ii   micah iv   answ   these texts import that quarrelsome dispositions and injurious slaughter of men should be remarkably restrained by the gospel but not that magistrates should no more bear the sword or be terrors to and punishers of evil doers romans xiii        pet ii        they no more import that magistrates should not restrain or seasonably or suitably punish blasphemy and idolatry than that they should not restrain theft or murder   the restraint or punishment we plead for being gods institution cannot hurt but profit men making many fear and avoid such horrible wickedness deuteronomy xvii  0 nay sometimes do much good to the restrained and punished persons zech xiii     if heretics blasphemers and idolaters be as mischievous persons as above described from the oracles of god the restraint of them is a necessary mean to secure the peace of nations and churches if such scorners be cast out contention strife and reproach are repressed prove xxii  0  object viii our savior commands his servants to let the tares grow with the wheat mat xiii     0 answ he rather represents that till the last judgment the righteous should never be fully separated from the wicked   if it were a command it is given to church rulers rather than to magistrates and so might with more apparent propriety be pled in favors of ecclesiastical toleration of heretics idolaters blasphemers   if these tares mean only hypocrites who have a visible appearance of holiness or innocence we plead that neither magistrates nor ministers ought to attempt plucking them up if they mean all the children of the devil as ver    your objection ought honestly to plead that no crimes of theft murder etc manifesting them to be such ought to be restrained or punished  object ix by rebuking his disciples who would have commanded fire from heaven to consume those samaritans who refused him lodging in his way to jerusalem and by his declaring that he came not to destroy mens lives but to save them luke ix        our benevolent savior plainly intimated that under the gospel magistrates ought to lay no restraint on heresy blasphemy or idolatry answ   as these samaritans did not live under magistrates or laws which established the true religion it is not pled that even their gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry however notorious and obstinate could have been regularly punishable by men   they were in this matter guilty of no heresy blasphemy or idolatry  or of attempting to seduce or disturb christ or his disciples  but merely of not giving lodging to a meanlike jew of whose messiahship they had but little if any information or proof   though the samaritans had been guilty of gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry publicly and obstinately professed and practiced contrary to the civil laws of the country and been regularly punishable  christs disciples being no magistrates in that place had no right to call them to account   the disciples never sought to have the contempt shown to themselves and their master punished by the civil law but by the miraculous vengeance of god without any warrant from god and to gratify their own proud passionate and revengeful temper they would have required him to work a miracle for the destruction of these poor ignorant samaritans  so if you will drag in this text it ought to be to prove that neither god nor ministers ought to restrain heretics blasphemers or idolaters   while christ was in his debased state obeying and suffering for the salvation of mankind it would have been extremely improper for god visibly to punish every slight put upon him but his coming to save men with an everlasting salvation can no more infer that he came to protect criminals from just punishment by men than that he came to save obstinate unbelievers from hell he came to save mens lives by saving them from their sins not by protecting and warranting them in a public and obstinate commission of them there is no hint in scripture that he who was manifested to destroy the works of the devil came to procure men a liberty of conscience or a magistratical license or protection in public and gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry more than in theft murder adultery it would be highly blasphemous to suppose it  object x christ requires us not to judge others  to judge nothing before the time mat vii     cor iv   we ought to believe our own opinions in religion to be as probably erroneous as those of our opponents and if they do not acknowledge themselves heretics blasphemers or idolaters we ought never to hold them such or plead for their being restrained as such answ   we must never rashly or uncharitably judge others or judge their hearts and intentions which god alone knows but that will no more infer that magistrates ought to give no judgment about religious matters than that magistrates and ministers should judge of nothing at all respecting either god or men but encourage every person to live as his inclinations direct him   is there indeed no certainty in religion if men ought to be complete skeptics in it why not as well downright atheists   if mens own acknowlegments be sustained as the standard of our judgment concerning them what rare work must ensue none ought to be held blasphemers heretics or idolaters till they have become penitent convicts none ought to be held thieves murderers calumniators etc till they acknowledge themselves such all impenitent criminals must thus escape every degree of infamy restraint or punishment  object xi men ought to be persuaded not forced into faith and holiness it is in vain to attempt rooting out corruptions especially in religion out of mens outward behavior unless they be first rooted out of their hearts answ   it requires no small share of ignorance impudence and fraud to insinuate that the many thousands of protestant advocates for the magistrates power to restrain gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry plead for the forcing of men to faith and holiness when they so harmoniously plead for the contrary   none ought to be forced into the faith and profession of the true religion as has been repeatedly declared but all proper methods taken to render their compliance judicious and voluntary yet that will not infer that no man ought to be restrained from or even suitably and seasonably punished for open and gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry which while they publicly oppose insult and undermine the true religion  produce terrible immoralities and disorders in churches and nations and draw upon them the ruinous vengeance of god  and far less will it infer that magistrates as vicegerents of god ought in his name and authority to license a false religion and promise men protection and encouragement in it no magistrate has power to force me to esteem love delight in sympathize with maintain or even commend my neighbor but he has power to refuse me a warrant to calumniate rob or murder him and even to restrain or punish me for so doing it would be absurd to attempt forcing of the british jacobites to believe and solemnly profess that k george not the pretender is rightful sovereign of this kingdom but would it therefore be absurd to restrain and punish them for publicly and insolently reviling him as an usurper  or seducing their fellow subjects to dethrone him  or for taking arms against him or paying his just revenues to the pretender   it is certain that christ who has power over the hearts of all men curbed the external corruptions of the jewish buyers and sellers in the temple without first casting the corruptions out of their heart and pray would you have all thieves robbers murderers etc to have full liberty in their courses till their wickedness can be got rooted out of their heart  object xii such is the reasonableness and the glory of divine truths that if they be but freely clearly and distinctly preached their native lusire will render them victorious over every error and corruption in religion however boldly published or craftily varnished what a singular advantage has it been to britain that deists have had full freedom to make their attacks upon the christian religion and so to occasion so many glorious defenses of it answ   did not god under the old testament know the conquering power of his truth as well as you do did not christ know it when he drove the buyers and sellers from the temple   did the inexpressibly amiable and edifying conduct of jesus christ the way the truth and the life render him the universal the fixed darling of the jewish nation among whom he went about doing good you dare not pretend it and yet it is certain that examples do more affect than instructions   you must not only with pelagians deny original sin but effectually disprove it before your objection can have any sense in it  while men are so blinded by satan and their own lusts and so full of enmity against god they cannot but be much more disposed to receive and practice error than to discern embrace and practice gospel truths however clearly and faithfully preached   cor ii    romans viii       cor iv     isa liii   vi    0   the common experience of every one who attempt to instruct children and servants in the truths of god even when they are young and their minds most unbiassed irrefragably demonstrates that almost any thing is more readily embraced than the plain truths of the gospel and that earnest prayers serious admonitions external encouragements and christian nurture have all enough and too often more than enough of work to make men learn them   if professed christians by encouraging others in gross error and wickedness provoke god to give up themselves to strong delusions that they may believe lies will the native luster of divine truths then enlighten and captivate them far  very far from it   thessalonians ii  0       timothy iii    iv       if we do evil in licensing encouraging or protecting the free propagation of gross errors that good reputation may be thereby occasioned our damnation is just romans iii     few of those boasted glorious desenders of christianity are real and thorough friends to the gospel of christ but often proceed upon the arminian and sometimes the socinian scheme the last of which is as bad if not worse than heathenism itself  and it is certain that tens if not hundreds have been seduced by deistical publications for every one that has been been converted from deism by almost all these defenses of the christian religion  object xiii christ has appointed for his church rulers of her own who govern her in every duty of religion answ   this can no more prove that magistrates ought to make and execute no laws respecting the duties required by the first table of the moral law than it will prove that they ought to make no laws respecting duties of the second table  since churchrulers are as much authorized by god to govern in the one as in the other let magistrates and churchrulers be allowed to govern their distinct departments in their different manner in the very same things and nothing but harmony order and advantage will ensue   magistrates as well as church rulers are divinely denominated rulers watchmen shepherds  and therefore ought politically to direct govern and feed their subjects as members of the commonwealth by making and executing wholesome laws relative to both tables of gods law  while ministers ecclesiastically feed them as members of the visible church by preaching the gospel administering the sacraments and exercising church government and discipline   timothy ii       romans xiii        chronicles xiii  0    and xvii xix neh xiii  0     ezekiel xxxiv    0  object xiv the church has sufficient power in herself to obtain every end necessary to her own welfare that cannot be an ordinance of jesus christ which needs any foreign assistance to gain its proper end answ   the church has as sufficient power to gain her ends with respect to the duties of the second table as to gain her ends in what respects the first table will it therefore follow that magistrates ought to make no laws respecting murder unchastity theft calumny etc   public transgressions of the first table of the moral law injure the state as well as they do the church the state which also has a power in itself sufficient to gain all its ends necessary to promote its own welfare ought therefore to restrain or punish such transgressions as crimes injurious to itself while the church restrains and censures them as scandals defiling and hurtful to herself   if soundness in the faith purity in worship holiness in practice and beautiful order in the church be an excellent mean of promoting the happiness of that nation where the church has her residence magistrates ought to promote those things out of a regard to the prosperity of their state in subordination to the honor of god   however complete the intrinsic power of the church be it is manifest that it can be exercised to more advantage if parents masters and magistrates regularly exert their power in promoting the true religion in their different departments  it is no less certain that after the church has done her utmost by conference injunction and censure some turbulent heretics or blasphemers may do as much if not more hurt to her than before unless magistrates restrain or punish them  object xv for almost three hundred years after christ the truths of the gospel gloriously prevailed against errors and corruptions without any care of magistrates to restrain or punish the erroneous answ   it was proper that the christian religion should be spread in the world not only without the countenance of the civil magistrate but also in opposition to his severe laws and bloody persecutions that it might the more abundantly appear to be of god   in that period it prevailed notwithstanding the most furious opposition and the cruel persecution and murder of millions of its adherents as well as without magistratical assistance will you therefore plead that peace and freedom in preaching the gospel ought to be hated and avoided and furious persecution coveted and prayed for   in that period the miraculous powers which attested the doctrines of christ did more than balance the want of magistratical helpfulness to the truth heb ii      in that period the hardships to which christians were exposed deterred such naughty persons from entering the church as might have plagued her with their blasphemies and heresies   and nevertheless even then blasphemers and heretics did no small hurt to the church   if god had not reckoned the magistratical countenance a real blessing to his church he had never promised it as in the texts above quoted  object xvi it is horrid cruelty and unchristian persecution to restrain or punish men for believing teaching and worshipping according to the dictates of their own conscience as charity obliges us to believe is the case with heretics blasphemers and idolaters  it is altogether diabolical the very worst part of popery and that which peculiarly supports the whole antichristian scheme  men ought to follow the dictates even of an erring conscience answ   where is your proof from either scripture or reason that an erring conscience binds men to believe teach or practice gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry any more than their promises or vows to do evil bind to performance  or than it can bind them to theft murder adultery calumny or the like  if we have an erring conscience our immediate duty is to get rid of that error by the illumination of gods word as being sinful in itself especially if procured through sloth or wickedness it will hinder our right performance of duty but can never make fin lawful if sir you can believe that an erring conscience can outdo the almighty power of god in making heresy blasphemy or idolatry innocent things you may quickly believe that a romist priest can outdo his maker in making a god and then eating him in the mystery of transubstantiation   even when conscience is perfectly clear pure and unbiassed it is wholly subordinated and subjected to the authority of gods law  how can the entrance of sinful error into it exalt it above his law and make such a god of it as can stamp its wicked dictates into incontroulable laws in opposition to the mandates of jehovah himself  this will not only prove that adam and eve became gods by the entrance of fin but go far to justify popes and devils in the whole of their conduct   if the devil who deceives the world get into mens conscience by his strong delusions has god allotted him that as a quiet city of refuge from which no means ought to be used to dislodge him and from which he may use the whole man unrestrained in his service  in sacrificing children to moloch murdering saints blaspheming god etc   where is your proof that i ought to believe that the man who has access to the bible acts according to the dictates of his conscience in gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry any more than that he acts according to them in murder treason theft unchastity etc men have labored and suffered as much in courses of the latter kind as in those of the former and died as impenitently at last   if pretense of conscience and more than pretense in favors of sin we can never be certain of be a sufficient ground for magistrates licensing encouraging and protecting men in contradicting and blaspheming god or robbing him of his worship to bestow it on devils  or in robbing his church of his oracles or ordinances  in murdering the souls of men and sowing the seeds of confusion and every evil work  why ought it not to warrant their licensing encouraging and protecting them in high treason calumny theft robbery murder  it is hoped you who are so generous in allowing men if they can but pretend conscience for it to abused and rob jehovah will be as ready to allow them equal freedom if they can but pretend conscience in abusing and injuring yourself if gods giving up men to strong delusions that they may believe lies warrant magistrates to encourage or protect them in spreading gross heresy or in open blasphemy and idolatry why ought not his giving them up to vile affections  to their own hearts lusts equally to warrant their encouraging and protecting of them in open whoredom bestiality incest robbery etc men can as little conquer their lusts and cleanse their hearts as they can rectify the errors of their conscience   it is infallibly certain that god himself under the old testament appointed magistrates to restrain and punish men for blasphemy and idolatry let their conscience dictate them as strongly as it pleased  had men in these early ages no conscience to govern them or did god then like the old fashioned protestants not understand human liberty and the rights of mens conscience  did he indeed then so far mistake his way as to appoint what is so cruel and diabolical what is the very worst part of popery and the principal support of that abominable system or has god or the nature of sin cruelty and tyranny been changed how shocking the thought  object xvii as mens natural and civil rights nowise depend upon their being orthodox christians magistrates ought to protect them in these privileges be their opinions and worship what they will nay to give them legal security for their protection of them in these opinions and worship that they may not be exposed to the caprices of particular magistrates answ   the christian liberty which christ purchased is not a liberty to commit sin but a spiritual freedom from it gal v      luke i       heb xii       christ came not to save mens lives from restraint or punishment required by his own law in order that they by spreading gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry might ruin nations and damn mens souls   you might have forborne to demand legal or authoritative licenses for men to blaspheme god worship devils in his stead etc till you had proven satan to be the absolute proprietor and governor of this world and the primary granter of all civil and natural rights to men  or proven that god who is infinitely holy just and good has or can give men natural or civil rights protecting them in public blasphemy idolatry or the like any more than rights protecting them in incest robbery murder or that magistrates as his ministers ought in his name and authority to grant men such rights   if god has so frequently turned men out of their civil property and life for their idolatry and blasphemy isa x xiv xxxvii xlvi xlvii jer xlviii li ezekiel xxxv  how absurd to require magistrates who are his ministers for good to men to execute their office which is his ordinance rom xiii      in encouraging and protecting men in openly and insolently contradicting blaspheming rebelling against and robbing him  ought the sheriff and justices of peace in britain as the kings ministers for good to the nation to have executed their office in protecting the archrebels in      and      in the undisturbed enjoyment of all their civil rights or to have given them new legal securities in order to enable them more boldly and successfully to carry on their treacherous and murderous rebellion against his majesty or ought they by proclamation to warrant all the subjects in their respective counties to revile rob and take arms against our king and parliament and promise them protection in so doing but always prohibiting them to injure their fellow subjects  object xviii magistrates ought not to rule their subjects by the bible but by the civil laws of the nation according to which they are admitted to their power by their subjects from whom all their power originates answ   that magistrates power originates from their subjects is a notion plainly atheistical it originates in god himself romans xiii     romans xi    psalm lxxv   dan ii      if magistrates must regulate their government by no other law than that which they or their subjects have established for themselves or one another they must act as atheists independent of god in the execution of an office wholly derived from him and for every act of which they must be accountable to him if the useful laws of one nation may be adopted into the civil law of another why may not the will of god the supreme governor of nations declared in his laws of nature and revelation be also adopted into it are gods laws more dishonorable or dangerous  more unfit to be adopted into our civil law than those of our sinful neighbors is the scotch law the worse that many of gods statutes prescribed in his word have been adopted into it  nay that all the leading doctrines of christianity contained in our two confessions of faith and catechisms have been adopted into it and the confessions themselves expressly engrossed into acts of parliament  indeed if nations adopt nothing of the manifested will of god into their civil law it will contain nothing but useless trifles will these be fit for directing the administrations of ministers of god for good to men or for securing and promoting the important welfare of any nation under heaven   if all civil authority to make laws resident either in subjects or magistrates be necessarily derived from god as former and king of nations  if magistrates be ordained of god to be ministers of god for good to men to be for terror and punishment and revengers of evil doers and a praise of them that  well and to be obeyed for conscience sake  for the lords sake romans xiii        pet ii       common sense loudly demands that neither their will nor that of their subjects but the manifested will of god their independent and infinitely high superior should be the supreme rule and standard of all their administrations and that no civil law should or can bind either magistrates or their subjects but in so far as it is agreeable and subordinated to the laws of god  object xix magistracy being an office not founded in revelation but in the law of nature the whole execution of it ought to be regulated by that law of nature not by the will of god revealed in scripture answ   i thank you for so quickly overturning your preceding objection and adopting the divine law of nature instead of your civil law as the supreme standard of magistratical administration   according to your objection parents masters children and servants must regulate their performance of relative duties merely by the law of nature without taking the smallest assistance from the directions of the holy ghost in scripture no parents or masters must instruct their children or servants in the knowledge of the doctrines promises laws worship or virtue required in the bible as these relations depend no more on revelation than magistracy does i defy you to prove they do in performing the duty of our natural or civil relations we must act as mere deists ignorant of or pouring contempt on the inspired oracles of the great god our savior  what hurt have the laws of revelation done to such relative duties that they must be thus infamously excluded from being any part of a rule of them   no man can truly obey the law of nature without heartily embracing and cheerfully improving whatever revelations god is pleased to bestow on him  as such revelations proceed from the same divine authority as the law of nature and must be a noted means of promoting true and proper obedience to it  to exclude divine revelation when granted from regulating our performance of relative duties must therefore not only amount to an heathenish contempt of the scriptures but to an atheistical contempt of the law of nature which necessarily requires us to adopt divine revelation for our supreme rule whenever it is graciously granted to us  object xx many of the abovementioned instances of magistrates care about religion and their restraint and punishment of idolaters blasphemers and false prophets related merely to the jewish theocracy which was typical and therefore not now to be copied answ   many of the abovementioned instances particularly those respecting heathens or contained in the promises to the gospel church have not the least appearance of being typical nay i defy you to prove that the instances of jewish rulers were merely typical   these typical magistrates of the jewish nation also exercised laws relative to murder theft unchastity treason and other matters of the second table of the moral law ought therefore no magistrates now to do so the laws respecting duties of the second table pertained as much to the jewish theocracy as those relating to the first must therefore the christian magistrate for fear of copying the jewish theocracy meddle with no morality at all   must every thing that was once typical be now under the gospel excluded from regulating authority must all the excellent patterns of abel enoch noah abraham isaac jacob joseph job moses aaron samuel david and other hebrew saints be rejected as typical and useless  must all the laws directing to elect men fearing god and hating covetousness to be magistrates or directing them to judge justly impartially and prudently and to punish murderers adulterers thieves robbers etc be discarded as typical must the weekly sabbath public fasts and thanksgivings be laid aside as typical  a mere sign between god and the israelites must the ten commandments and all the explications of them in the old testament be discarded as published in a typical manner and to a typical people and used as the principal part of their rule of government in the jewish theocracy   as the jewish church was a real church and not merely typical so their state was a real commonwealth or kingdom and not merely typical whatever therefore pertained to it as a real commonwealth is imitable in any other   the jewish church and state were as really distinct as the church and state are now though i do not say precisely in the same manner   they differed in respect of regulating laws the ceremonial law directed the jewish church the judicial directed the affairs of their state   they differed in their respective acts the jews worshipped god offered sacrifices and received sacraments not as members of that state but as members of that church they punished evil doers by fines imprisonment banishment burning stoning and hanging and fought with enemies etc not as a church but as a state   they differed in respect of controversies to the church

state the priests might not take the civil sword out of the hand of the magistrates nor the magistrates offer sacrifices burn incense or otherwise execute the priests office   they differed in respect of continuance when the jewish civil power was taken away by the romans the constitution of their church remained in the days of our saviors debasement and even now the jews pretend to be a church but not to be a state   they differed in respect of variation the constitution of their church remained much the same under moses joshua the judges the kings and after the captivity but the form of the state underwent great alterations   they differed in respect of members proselytes of the covenant were complete members of the jewish church but had not the same dignities or marriages allowed them in the state as the natural israelites nor had the proselytes of the gate any church privileges though they had some civil ones   they were governed by different courts the church had her courts of the synagogue and her ecclesiastical sanhedrin  the state had her courts of the gate etc and her civil sanhedrin  though often some levites were judges in both as our ruling elders in the church may

independent of each other    nevertheless the purity of the jewish church contributed much to the welfare of their state and the right management of their state to the prosperity of their church and bad management in the one always tended to the hurt of the other deuteronomy xxviii  xxxii lev xxvi judges i  xiii   samuel ii  to   chronicles xxxvi isa i  to mal iv isa i     0 and iii  0    and still righteousness exalts a nation and sin is the reproach and ruin of any people prove xiv       god never commanded the jewish magistrates to force their true religion upon their heathen neighbors philistines moabites ammonites or syrians whom they conquered or to put them to death for their idolatry nor has he ever commanded magistrates who have embraced the true christian religion to force men by fire or sword or any like punishments to embrace and profess it  or to inslict the same punishments upon blasphemers or idolaters in unenlightened countries which they may do upon such as obstinately rebel against and apostatize from the truth amidst plentiful means of conviction and establishment in it    never did god that i know of require the jewish magistrates to punish any of their subjects for lesser faults however open or manifest or to punish them for the simple neglect of duties strictly religious  or to annex sentences of outlawry and of death to ecclesiastical cutting off by excommunication from the church nor can i find that he has enjoined any such thing upon the christian magistrate    among the jews some things partaking of both a civil and religious nature did in these different respects fall under the government of both church and state even circumcision itself was a national badge as well as a religious seal of gods covenant  among christians public fasts and thanksgivings calling of synods etc do in different respects fall under the power of both church and state  pretend therefore no more that there is a total difference between the case of our magistrates and that of the jewish recorded in scripture  object xxi to allow magistrates a power of judging making and executing laws about religion and of punishing men for erroneous opinions or for disturbing the peace and order of the church as in cur confession of faith and second book of discipline altogether confounds the kingdoms of christ with the kingdoms of this world contrary to john xviii    answ sir have you in an honest and orderly manner renounced these confessions of faith as plainly and publicly as you solemnly avowed if not also subscribed a steadfast adherence to the westminster one at your ordination dare you one day call god angels and men to witness that you sincerely avow that confession of faith to be the confession of your faith and that you sincerely believe the whole doctrine contained in it to be founded on the word of god and will constantly adhere to and maintain the same all the days of your life  and the next slight reproach revile and attempt to confute an important article of it see the wickedness of such conduct excellently exposed in walkers vindication of the discipline and constitutions of the church of scotland    have you suffered as much for a zealous maintenance of the intrinsic powerof the church and of christs sole headship over her as his spiritual kingdom as the compilers and cordial adherers to that confession have done if not modesty as well as equity might have restrained your revilings   suppose that contrary to my judgment i should allow that magistrates as such have not that power relative to religious matters mentioned in our confessions and solemnly avowed in our covenants yet being christians they are bound as such to execute their civil offices in that manner which most effectually promotes the honor and kingdom of christ  even as parents or masters who are christians are bound to exercise their power in their families as may best maintain and propagate the knowledge faith and obedience of the gospel every other character or office which a christian has must be subordinated to his character as a christian   pet iv    col iii    ephesians v        vi      col iii        iv     timothy ii

families must be excluded from all that care about religion which is allotted them in our confession of faith heads of families must for the same reason be excluded from establishing the gospel worship of god in their houses and from instructing their children or servants in the truths of divine revelation at least from requiring them to attend such instructions and worship you pretend there is a difference but sir i insist on your stating it precisely and proving from scripture and reason that headship over families is a more spiritual relation than headship over multitudes of families or that magistrates cannot without sin do what is similar to every thing which parents and masters as such are commanded to do   if to prevent confounding of the church with the state magistrates must exercise no care about religion  must punish no publicly obstinate heretic blasphemer idolater profaner of the sabbath or reviler of the oracles and ordinances of christ as a criminal against the welfare of the state  churchcourts must censure as scandals against the welfare of the church no theft murder robbery treason unlawful war perversion of civil judgment or the like as these pertain to the kingdoms of this world   though the powers of civil and ecclesiastical government be coordinate each standing on its proper basis and the right exercise of church power contributing mightily to the welfare of the state  and of civil power to the advancement of the church  yet they are not collateral inseparable from or dependent upon each other but are altogether distinct from and different in many respects see this point excellently handled in the hundred and eleven propositions of the assembly      republished by alston edinburgh     civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their foundation magistracy is founded on gods universal dominion over all nations and hence the law of nature is the immediate supreme rule of its administrations and the scriptures become the rule of them only as introduced by the law of nature requiring magistrates as well as others to believe and obey whatever revelation duly attested god is pleased to grant them  or by magistrates subjecting their consciences as followers of christ to the scriptures as their only rule to direct them how to glorify god and enjoy him for ever but ecclesiastical power is founded in the oeconomical or mediatorial headship of jesus christ over his church as his spiritual kingdom and hence the immediate standard for regulating the exercise of it is that revelation which god has given to and by him in his word  and the laws of nature have a regulating force in the church by virtue of the general precepts of scripture as   cor xiv     0 vi    xvi    phil iv   mat vii       civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their immediate object magistratical power immediately relates only to things external pertaining to the outward man even when exercised about sacred things it has that which is external for its immediate object it removes external hindrances of spiritual exercises and provides external opportunities and accommodations for the performance of them if magistrates call a synod they do not properly call it as a court of christ or as ministers of christ but as a meeting of subjects whose joint deliberations are calculated to promote the honor of god the king of nations and the happiness of their country by the right government of the church if a magistrate command persons to compear before a churchcourt to be judged or to bear witness be commands them not as spiritual members of christs mystical body but as his own and jehovahs subjects to take their trial or attest the truth before proper arbitrators of their cause that god may be honored and through keeping of order in the church the welfare of the city or nation may be advanced and consirmed if he punish insolent contemners of the authority and censures of the church he punishes them not as scandalous persons but as criminals insulters of that true religion which the civil law has established and contemners of these judicatories which it has authorized and to which themselves have solemnly engaged all due subjection  and thus as treacherous disturbers of the good order and peace of his kingdom and tramplers on the laws of the most high sovereign of the nation  but church power has that which is spiritual for its only proper object it properly deals with mens consciences and heart and with their outward man only in order to affect those in the way of conviction reformation comfort etc it considers the persons with whom it deals not as mere men or as members of a civil society but as members of the spiritual and mystical body of christ in the visible form of it    civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their torm though magistrates be the ministers of god for good to men their power over their subjects is of a lordly nature they are lordly fathers who by making and enforcing civil laws can compel the disobedient  in this view if they establish any thing pertaining to the church they establish it as a mean of honoring god their superior in the advancement of the welfare of the common wealth if they punish faults they consider them as crimes injurious to the happiness of the state dishonouring god its supreme governor and provoking his wrath against it and they punish those crimes only on the outward man by fining imprisonment death etc  but church power is altogether ministerial distributing to men reproofs admonitions and other ordinances according to the inspired prescriptions of christ mat xvi    and xviii      cor iv     christ being her alone lord churchrulers have no power to make any laws properly so called isa xxxiii    james iv    in dealing with offenders they consider faults even oppression tyranny sinful wars and leagues perversion of judgment bribery or the like in magistrates who are members not as crimes but merely as scandals desiling and ruining mens souls plaguing the church and dishonouring and provoking christ and his father in him against it they have no compulsory power  can punish no man either in his person or his external property can use no weapons but such as are spiritual mighty through god administering church censures not as punishments but as spiritual privileges and divinely instituted means of bringing offenders to a thorough repentance of their sins to the eternal salvation of their souls  and this whole power must be used only in the name of jesus christ as head of his church   cor i    x       xiii    0 ii     0   cor v      civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their proper end the formal end of magistratical power is to advance the glory of god the king of nations in promoting the welfare of the commonwealth  and the establishment of the true religion and care to promote the prosperity and propagation of the church are used as eminent means of gaining that end or the good of the church may also be considered as an accessory end of civil administration as the better civil justice be executed open  breakings restrained and virtue encouraged by the magistrate the fewer will probably be the scandals and the greater the purity and prosperity of the church nay though the advancement of the churchs welfare be not the formal end of magistracy yet as christ is made head over all things to his church every magistrate who professes the christian religion ought to pursue the formal end of his office as subordinated to his christian end of promoting the glory of god in the welfare of the church and eternal salvation of men  but the formal end of all church power is the glorifying of god in christ by promoting the spiritual conviction conversion and edification of mens souls and the welfare of nations is but an accessory or subordinate end at which churchrulers as subjects in the state ought always to aim  as the better they prosecute and obtain the end of their office the fewer will be the crimes the better both subjects and magistrates and the more numerous and valuable the blessings of god on the nation    civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their proper effects the proper effects of magistratical power rightly exercised is the good of the commonwealth in their commodious enjoyment of civil privileges in a manner mightily calculated to promote the honor of god as the most high over all the earth  and the purity peace and prosperity of the church arising from the right administration of justice discouragement of evil doers and praise of them that do well is but an accessory effect but the proper effect of church power rightly exercised is the conversion of men to jesus christ fellowship with him and growth in grace and good works to the praise of his glory and the advantage accruing to cities or nations by the virtuous laws and fervent prayers of church members is but an accessory effect of it    civil and ecclesiastical power differ in their subjects of residence no ecclesiastical power can reside in a heathen a woman or a child and no power of jurisdiction in a single person  as civil power often may or does nor can one ecclesiastic officer delegate his power to another    they differ in their formal consideration of the persons upon whom they are exercised a magistrates power extends over all persons resident in his territory be their moral character what it will jews heathens etc romans xiii   but church power extends only to the professed members of christs mystical body the church   corinthians v          civil and ecclesiastical power differ in respect of their divided exercise the one may and ought to be exercised whether the other be so or not  the end of churchcensure being to gain sinners to repentance and salvation scandalous persons appearing penitent ought to be seasonably absolved from it and restored to communion with the church in sealing ordinances but the end of civil punishment being the satisfaction of the law and the deterring of others from the like faults criminals however penitent and fully restored to church fellowship may as the nature of their crime demands be punished even unto death and suppose a churchmember should have satisfied the demands of the civil law for a crime he ought to be prosecuted and censured for it as a scandal by the ecclesiastical courts till he appear duly penitent not only ought churchrulers to censure scandalous persons when magistrates take no notice of their faults but even to censure magistrates who are church members for what wickedness they commit under color of countenance from the civil law and where magistrates punish and churchrulers censure the same persons for the same faults the processes ought to be kept entirely distinct from and independent of each other  though to prevent unnecessary swearing the proof taken in one court may sometimes be produced and judged of also in the other  object xxii magistrates not being proper judges of the doctrines of revelation cannot be capable to judge concerning religious matters and particularly to determine who are heretics blasphemers or idolaters answ   that they have a right to judge in these matters has been already established   god who knows all things admits private christians to be capable of judging what is heresy blasphemy and idolatry and who are heretics blasphemers and idolaters and hence commands them to keep themselves from these sins and to avoid such seducers and debar them from their houses romans xvi      timothy iii     cor v      john iv      and v      john       now what hinders christian magistrates to have as much good sense and s much capacity of judging in these matters as common christians   the gross errors blasphemies and idolatries which magistrates ought to restrain and suitably and seasonably punish are so plainly condemned by the word of god which magistrates ought carefully to search under the direction of the holy spirit that any unbiassed person of common capacity may easily discern them   the advice of faithful ministers and the common consent of christian churches may assist magistrates in discerning from the word of god what is gross or damnable heresy blasphemy idolatry  object xxiii if magistrates as such have a power of judging in religious matters then heathen magistrates must also be allowed to make laws concerning religion and the church while in the mean time they cannot be censured by the church if they do amiss answ   what could you gain if i should plead that it is magistrates christianity requiring them to execute their office in subordination to it that is the immediate origin of their power about the matters of religion even as it is parents christianity that warrants them to receive baptism for their infants but   heathen magistrates with gods direction and approbation have made laws respecting religion ezra vii        vi       i      dan iii    vi    jonah iii dare you condemn the almighty   heathen magistrates have the same power as christian magistrates but are less capable to use it aright even as heathen parents and masters have the same power over their children and servants as christians but are less qualified to discern and perform their duty   neither heathen nor christian magistrates have any power at all against the truth but for the truth  any power for the destruction of the church but for her edification   cor xiii    0   heathen magistrates therefore ought carefully to improve what assistance they have by the light of nature and works of creation and providence or by any revelation from god to which they have access  always taking heed to make no laws but such as they certainly know to be agreeable to the law of god  it is not to be expected that civil laws can forbid every fault and require every thing good in externals but they ought never to encourage sin or discourage duty  object xxiv to allow magistrates a power of judging about the matters of religion will make them churchrulers answ   no more than it made nebuchadnezzar darius cyrus darius and artaxerxes and the king of nineveh churchrulers   no more than churchrulers taking cognizance of murder adultery incest theft robbery or even of the conduct of christian magistrates relative to administration of justice wars alliances etc will make them magistrates   how often must you be told that churchrulers judge how such profession or practice ought to stand connected with ecclesiastical enconcouragements discouragements or censure but magistrates judge how such profession or practice ought to be connected with civil encouragements or discouragements churchrulers warn against and censure mens public faults only as scandals disgraceful and hurtful to the church magistrates judge of and punish them only as crimes hurtful to the prosperity of the state in church courts matters are considered as the matters of the lord in civil courts they are considered as the matters os the king   chronicles xix       ministers as the deputies of christ require magistrates to execute their office for the honor of christ and welfare of his church and censure them if church members if they do not magistrates as vicegerents of god the king of nations require ministers faithfully to execute their office particularly as stated by the laws of the land in order to promote virtue and happiness among the subjects and draw the blessing of god upon them and they punish them as undutiful subjects if they notoriously transgress   kings ii    magistrates have no ecclesiastical power at all they have no power to restrain or hinder the free and full exercise of church power but by giving full opportunity encouragement and excitement to church officers they have power to provide that church power be freely and faithfully exercised in their dominions they have no power to transact any thing ecclesiastical as in admission of members into the church or to the seals of gods covenant  no power to choose or ordain church officers  no power to preach the gospel dispense the sacrament inflict censures or absolve from them  they have no power to prescribe or enact any ecclesiastical laws but they have power to adopt such lawful and expedient constitutions as have been made by the churchcourts into their civil code by a legal ratification  and power to enact such political laws as are necessary for the more advantageous execution of these ecclesiastical constitutions they have no power to frame a religion for their subjects or ratify a false religion already received or framed or to establish any thing in religion which is not founded in the word of god but they have a power to adopt the law of god and the religion prescribed by it as a part of their civil law in order to promote the glory of god in the welfare of the nation  the more public church courts be and the more extensive his influence upon his subjects and the welfare of the nation  the more right has the civil magistrate to exercise his political power about them the church having an intrinsic right and power from christ to call synods for government whenever her circumstances require it the magistrate has no power to deprive her of this right but while the church calls them as courts of christ constituted of church rulers appointed by him to act in his name the magistrate may call them as courts established by the civil law and necessary to to promote the peace order and piety and so the prosperity of his subjects  as courts which consist of his principal subjects and to which place and protection must be given in his dominions the magistrate has no power of deputing to synods such members as he pleases acts xv   chronicles viii    or to hinder or recall those whom the church has deputed unless the safety of the state plainly require it but he may compel members and parties who have causes before the court to attend if the case of the church require it as a mean of repressing a malicious and turbulent faction who have or may hurt the state it is not necessary that either the magistrate or his commissioner attend ecclesiastical synods  though to secure their protection curb unruly troublers of the court and to witness the propriety of their procedure he may attend  if he attend he has a power to judge for himself how matters are ecclesiastically transacted  a power politically to provide that the members meddle with no political affairs which do not belong to them as a court of christ  and to take care that members and others present observe that due decency in reasoning voting submitting or hearing which the nature of the court requires if any cause be partly civil and partly ecclesiastical he is to judge the civil part himself and leave the ecclesiastical to the church court  even in ecclesiastical causes he may give his advice nay he may propose and require synods to examine and decide concerning points of doctrine or practice if necessary for the satisfaction of his own conscience or the instruction and edification of his subjects in order to promote the welfare of the state in subordination to the glory of god but he has no power to hinder others to propose their difficulties or grievances before the synod for satisfaction or redress unless the cause be partly of a political nature a synodical decision of which at that time endangers the state  he has no power to preside in the synod or give his decisive vote in any of their transactions but as a man and christian he has right to a judgment of discretion whether their decisions be according to the law of god or not  and as a magistrate he has a power of political judgment by which he does not properly judge whether these decisions be true or false good or bad in themselves but whether and how far they ought to be ratified and as it were adopted into the laws of the state and connected with civil rewards forbearance or punishments thus the power of the magistrate in nothing interferes with the power of the synod nothing is done by the one as a magistrate that the other can do as a court of christ and as the decisions of synods are supreme in the ecclesiastic order from which there is no appeal but to jesus christ  by remonstrating as a churchmember and commanding them as their king the magistrate may cause the synod reconsider its own deeds but he cannot reverse them himself  so the magistrates deed concerning the civil ratification of churchdeeds is supreme in its kind from which there is no appeal but to god himself the synod may require him as a churchmember and as subjects they may remonstrate and supplicate his reconsideration of his own deed but they cannot reverse it themselves  object xxv to allow magistrates to judge in matters of religion for others and to restrain and punish corruptions in it is to render them lords of mens faith and conscience  a power which even the inspired apostles disclaimed for if magistrates impose any religion at all upon their subjects it must be what their own conscience dictates and then what shall become of the private rights of conscience among their subjects answ   did then god who of old commanded magistrates to judge about matters of religion and to restrain and punish blasphemers idolaters seducers profaners of the sabbath deuteronomy xiii    0 and xvii      lev xxiv        song ii    number xv        command them to lord it over mens conscience if it was not so then it cannot be so now as conscience tyranny and murder are the same in every age   the objection strikes with equal force against all ecclesiastical establishment of the true religion and against all creeds and confessions of faith and against all ecclesiastical judging and censuring of men for heresy blasphemy or idolatry contrary to rev ii  0 titus iii  0 gal v  0    as against magistrates judging about establishing religion or punishing the public insulters of it   magistrates act in this matter as his ministers and vicegerents by virtue of his commandment who is the alone lord of conscience and restrain or punish nothing but what men under any proper influence of faith and conscience would abstain from as forbidden by the lord of conscience who is to be their future judge and has appointed magistrates as his substitutes to avenge the open injuries done to him in this world romans xiii   and if men persist in sins plainly forbidden in his law he holds them as sinners against and condemned by their conscience tit iii  0      the absurdity of mens consciences being sustained as a standard as well as the proper method of magistrates making laws relative to religion have been already manifested magistrates consciences have no more just claim to god bead than those of their meanest subjects not therefore magistrates pretenses to conscience but plain and evident marks of the authority of god manifested in and from the scriptures must determine their subjects to receive a religion in obedience to their authority as subordinated to the authority of god the most high superior of both  object xxvi in romans xiii where the power of magistrates is more fully described than any where else in the new testament only the commands of the second table of the moral law are subjoined to mark that it only extends to the concerns of men one with another answ   who authorized the objector to put asunder the two testaments and the two tables which god has joined or to separate the first part of that chapter from the last which certainly relates to religion any more than from verse  th   the magistrates character minister of god for good terror to and revenger of evil doers and his duty to love his neighbors as himself there hinted cannot admit of his having no care about religion and the first table of the moral law   to oblige men carefully to search the whole scriptures god has seldom if ever manifested his whole will relative to any thing in one passage  object xxvii if we allow magistrates any power at all about religious matters we must plunge ourselves into inextricable difficulties as the precise limits of civil and ecclesiastical power can never be fixed  and every small mistake in religious opinions or neglect of religious duties must bring men to the gibbet as theft draws down the wrath of god on nations as well as blasphemy and idolatry do answ there is no more difficulty in limiting the power of magistrates about either religion or virtue than in fixing precise limits to the power of churchrulers relative to those matters do you fix precise limits to church power according to the word of god and i shall next moment fix as precise limits for the power of the magistrate if you limit the exercise of church power to duties required and sins forbidden in the first table of the moral law  you naturally leave the care of the duties required in the second table to the magistrate but then whether a church of christ having no care or power about morality toward men  or a deputed kingdom of god without any care or power about any thing relating to the honor of god be most absurd and devilish i know not if you aver that the power of churchrulers extends to the external obedience or disobedience of church members to both tables of gods law not as civil but as spiritual conduct tending to the spiritual advantage or hurt of the church and therefore connected with the spiritual encouragements or frowns of christs visible church and that they meddle not with sins against the second table as crimes against mens person or property but as scandals against the spiritual edification of the church and the glory of jesus christ therein concerned  i immediately reply that precisely in like manner the power of magistrates extends to the external obedience or disobedience of civil subjects as such to both tables of gods law not as it is of a spiritual nature but as it affects the civil welfare or hurt of the nation or honor of god as the king of it and so ought to stand connected with civil encouragements or discouragements if you pretend that it will be still hard to show how far magistrates may in that view proceed in matters of the first table particularly with respect to offending clergymen i answer that it is not one whit harder than to show how far church courts may proceed in matters of the second table particularly with respect to offensive magistratical administrations   your pretense that if magistrates punish any faults in religion they must punish all known faults in the same form and degree is but a deceitful insult on the most high who in his word appointed the capital punishment of idolaters and blasphemers and yet never warranted the punishment of many faults relative to religion in like manner nay for ought i see has not required magistrates at all to punish any thing but the most atrocious faults in it if you insult christ who has not commanded any faults but atrocious ones obstinately continued in to be censured with excommunication and has never commanded many lesser neglects and infirmities of church members to be censured at all  it is an insult on common sense would you or any man in his wits either censure or punish men as severely for a simple neglect of a religious duty as for an open and blasphemous insulting of religion would you censure or punish the stealing of a single straw as severely as the stealing of a man or woman would you censure or punish a prick with a pin as severely as the cutting of a mans throat or the ripping up of a woman with child  object xxviii either every error in doctrine and mistake in worship must be punished by the magistrate or only that which is more glaring and notorious if it is only the latter how are the limits of what is punishable and what is not and the degree of punishment proper for each to be precisely fixed answ if every species of duty must be neglected and the contrary sin allowed where it is difficult to fix the precise boundaries of sin or duty  or where it is difficult to fix the precise degrees of encouragement to be given to such obedience or of censure or punishment due to such sin men must be left to live like absolute atheists in both church and state every man doing that which is right in his own eyes   unless you prove that every insult of and outrage against god and his religion ought to pass unpunished and even be licensed and authorized yourself must be equally embarrassed in fixing what is punishable and what is not and what must be the form and degree of punishment annexed to each punishable fault   nay unless you prove that all deeds however horrid ought to be tolerated in both church and state how are you to fix precisely what deeds are censurable or punishable and what not  and what form and degree of censure or punishment is proper for each in every particular form and circumstance a man may as really and for ought men can prove against him as justly pretend conscience for his wicked deeds of treason murder robbery etc as for his damnable heresies blasphemies and idolatrous worship wicked deeds if god be true are the native fruits of gross errors and idolatrous worship a conscience which under the clear light of scripture revelation approves the whole system of popery or socinianism may as reasonably dictate the murder of saints dethronement of lawful sovereigns community of women and goods etc let once the plea of conscience be admitted in the case of treason theft robbery murder and the like and i will undertake it shall be as commonly pled as in the case of gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry and it will be as impossible for judges to disprove it in the one case as in the other nothing therefore will truly answer your tolerant scheme but that every man be allowed to profess worship and act as he pleases   let therefore magistrates as well as churchrulers in their punishing and censuring work make gods word their rule and if they do not perceive from it clearly the proper degrees of punishment and censure let them rather err on the charitable side than in approaches to severity  object xxix but how are heretics blasphemers and idolaters to be got judged in order to punishment they must be judged only by their peers by persons of the same station as themselves quite impartial and no wise attached to the contrary sentiments or practices answ   but how can you prove from scripture or reason that such criminals must be judged only by their peers  or that there is a nation under heaven in which criminals are judged by such peers as you mention   allowing that our juries consist of the proper peers of the criminals yet they judge not concerning the relevancy of the crime or the form or degree of punishments but of the proof of the fact  which in the case of heresy blasphemy or idolatry is ordinarily no more difficult than in the case of adultery incest theft murder etc   nothing can be more absurd than to pretend that mens detestation of heresy blasphemy and idolatry disqualifies them from judging heretics blasphemers and idolaters what does mens abhorrence of theft murder adultery disqualify them to judge of and punish those crimes do gods infinite holiness and equity disqualify him from judging of sinners  object xxx if heretics blasphemers and idolaters be punishable orthodox magistrates who happen to become governors of heretical blasphemous and idolatrous nations must kill the most of their subjects answ we hold none punishable especially in any severe manner till they appear openly obstinate in it notwithstanding sufficient means of conviction which these subjects are not supposed to have had and so are not punishable at all by magistrates   nothing and particularly the infliction of punishment ought to be done merely because it is lawful till it also become expedient   cor vi    and x    eccl iii      now it would be highly inexpedient to proceed to extremities against the greater part of a society nay in the case supposed they would prove a barbarously sinful mean of prejudicing men against the gospel of christ   great difference ought to be made between such as were never reformed from a false religion and those who obstinately apostatize from the true religion to a false one  between such as live in a nation generally corrupted with a false religion and those who live in a nation generally enlightened and reformed by the gospel of christ  and between such as are only seduced and those who exert themselves to seduce others much more forbearance is due to the former than to the latter for   however peremptorily the jews were commanded by god to punish even unto death the obstinate false prophets idolaters and blasphemers of their own church or nation they were never required to punish their idolatrous tributaries in their conquered countries of syria philistia edom ammon or moab and meanwhile were never allowed and never did grant them any legal establishment or authoritative toleration of their idolatry   even god himself for the ends of his glory exercises much forbearance toward heretics blasphemers and idolaters but never grants them any legal establishment or authoritative toleration securing them of protection in their wickedness let magistrates who are his ministers for good to men go and do so like wise  object xxxi the christian law of doing to others that which we would have them do to us demands that we should allow every man to think profess and act in religion as he pleases if we think men heretics blasphemers or idolaters our proper method is to manifest the utmost kindness and familiarity to them that we may gain them to the truth every other method is no less dangerous than uncharitable if orthodox christian magistrates restrain and punish the spreading of heathen mohammedan and popish errors or worship  heathen mohammedan and popish princes will be thereby tempted to restrain and punish the spread of gospel truth in their dominions and can plead the very same right for their conduct answ   strange did not god know the meaning of his own law of equity and kindness between man and man and the true method of securing or propagating his own religion when he made or encouraged the laws against seducers idolaters and blasphemers above mentioned  when he commanded his people to avoid false teachers and not so much as to lodge them in their houses   with all your pretended benevolence would you familiarly lodge in your family a notorious pick pocket or an harlot along with your own children in order to gain them to the ways of piety and virtue you would not why then in direct contradiction to the command of god do you plead for familiarity with robbers of god defilers or murderers of souls   the christian law of kindness and equity requires me to do all that for the real welfare of my neighbor in subordination to the glory of god which i could lawfully wish him in like circumstances to do for me but must i do evil that good may come rendering my damnation just must i procure my just liberty to believe and serve god according to his own appointment by granting my neighbor an unjust an authoritative license to insult and blaspheme god and worship the devil in his stead because i wish my neighbor to be helpful to me in honoring god and in laboring to render myself and others happy in time and eternity must i assist and encourage them in horribly dishonouring god and destroying themselves and others none but an atheist who believes no real difference between moral good and evil can pretend it   when and where have faithful adherents to gospel truth got much liberty and safety by means of their friends encouraging and protecting gross herely blasphemy and idolatry since protestants became so kind to papists in their dominions have not the popish powers in return cruelly murdered banished or oppressed their protestant subjects in hungary poland germany france etc till they have left few of them remaining while britons were lavishly expending their blood and treasure in support of the popish house of austria about   0  and      she returned our kindness in the most villainous destruction of about   0 congregations of our protestant brethren in silesia and hungary   ought elijah to have spared nay protected and encouraged the prophets of baal as a mean of securing for himself the protection of ahab and jezebel or because she was disposed to avenge their death must thieves and robbers be benevolently used protected and suffered to pass unpunished for fear of provoking their associaus to revenge the just severities used toward them let magistrates do their duty and leave events to god   till you honestly profess yourself an atheist who believes no intrinsical difference between moral good and evil never pretend that magistrates who have their whole power from god have any power against the truth or have a right to exercise that power derived from god for the good of mankind to his dishonor and to the hurt of mankind astonishing i because a power originating from god may be rightfully exercised in promoting his declarative glory the spread or protection of his gospel and the happiness of mankind  may it must it therefore in the hand of other magistrates be rightfully exercised in promoting blasphemy and robbery of god and worshipping of devils  because it may be rightfully exercised in punishing obstinate and notorious heretics blasphemers and idolaters  may it must it therefore be rightfully exercised in persecuting and murdering the faithful preachers and professors of gospel truths and worshippers of the true god  because magistrates in britain have a right to punish thieves and murderers must these in france have as good a right to use alms givers and skilful and diligent physicians in the same manner  because that which tends to the highest honor of god and temporal and eternal happiness of mankind ought to be authoritatively tolerated nay established every where  may  must that which tends to his highest dishonor and the most dreadful temporal and eternal ruin of mankind be every where in like manner tolerated or established  because in a dearth benevolent persons may be tolerated nay highly encouraged in freely distributing wholesome provisions to the poor and needy may or must malicious murderers be therefore tolerated and encouraged in distributing their poisoned morsels especially if abundantly sweetened among the unwary infants or others   the restraint or suitable and seasonable punishment of that which is contrary to gods law being commanded by himself can never have any tendency to introduce corruptions in religion or persecution for an adherence to gospel truth and if some will abuse their power that must not hinder others either in church or state to use theirs aright  object xxxii if infidelity and difference in religion do not make void magistrates right to govern nations much less can heresy idolatry or blasphemy invalidate subjects right to protection or of admission to all the privileges of other subjects answ   in almost every case the restraint or punishment of superiors is more difficult than that of inferiors   if the professors of the true religion be the minority in number and power both scripture and reason demand their subjection to their common rulers in all their lawful commands till they become manifest tyrants and providence afford a proper opportunity of shaking off their yoke but if the professors of the true religion be the majority in a nation or society both scripture and reason forbid their setting up a magistrate of a false religion or a wicked practice  and allow that if after his advancement he apostatize and obstinately attempt to promote a false religion or notoriously wicked practice he may be deposed and even punished as far as the general welfare of the society in subordination to the glory of god can admit psalm xv     do you pretend to be wiser than god himself without any apprehended inconsistency he commanded the jews not authoritatively to tolerate protect and encourage but to punish blasphemers profaners of the sabbath idolaters and false prophets lev xxiv       number xv       deuteronomy xiv xvii zech xiii      and yet commanded them when they were the small minority in the chaldean empire to serve the heathen king of babylon jer xxvii    and xxix    object xxxiii unlimited tolerations in the state ought not to be granted in protestant countries papists ought not to be tolerated as they are subject to the foreign power of the pope as their head and cannot be supposed faithful subjects to or to keep faith with such as they pretend to be heretics atheists ought not to be tolerated as they cannot be bound by any oath such as are against tolerating others ought not to be tolerated as they will kindle strife and in churches there ought to be no toleration at at all answ   then it seems christ and his father must be excluded from all share in the toleration you plead for on account of their intolerant disposition unless they be infinitely altered from what they were in ancient times   you have already given up all your care for procuring the favor of the popish powers to your protestant brethren abroad by means of tolerating papists   never pretend zeal against atheism till you be able to maintain your tolerant scheme upon other than the atheistical principles mentioned near the beginning of this missive and to which you have had repeated recourse in your objections  and till you allow mens rights or pretenses of conscience to warrant them to defame abuse rob and murder yourself as you allow with respect to god   your present objection is partly foundin atheism papists are excluded from toleration not at all as notorious blasphemers and idolaters but merely as not very like to prove faithful subjects to protestant magistrates atheists are excluded not as daring blasphemers or intentionally malicious murderers of jehovah but merely because they cannot give proper security for their good behavior to magistrates and fellow subjects thus no more regard is showed to god the king of nations than might be expected among a nation of atheists and the interests of men are altogether i might say infinitely preferred to his   how are you to fix the precise limits who are to be accounted under foreign heads  who are to be accounted papists and atheists  or who are to be held to give sufficient security by oath  whether profane swearers quakers socinians notorious violaters of baptisinal engagements solemn subscribers of and engagers to creeds and confessions of faith which they believe not etc  if contrary to the light of nature and revelation men zealously propagate the doctrines of devils and do worship them in idols and follow the pernicious practices abovementioned as the native consequences of error and idolatry are not they plainly subject to another head even the god of this world who is not much more friendly to magistrates and nations than the romish pope if men have conscience villainously to wrest the scripture to prove that christ was originally a mere mar a mere creature and is now a made god what more security can we have by their oath than if they were professed atheists   none who plead tor the authoritative toleration of heretics blasphemers and idolators by the state can with any selfconsistent candor disallow of all toleration in the church  god the king of nations hates these abominations as much as christ the head of the church churchrulers have no other infallible rule to direct them in their decisions than magistrates have they are as unfit to judge of more refined errors as magistrates are to judge of gross errors blasphemies idolatries they have as little allowance from christ to lord over mens consciences or to impose their own opinions for articles of faith or rules of duty as magistrates have from god it is as difficult to fix precisely what is censurable and what not and the proper degree of censure answerable to every seandal in every circumstance as to six precisely what and how crimes ought to be punished by the magistrate unrighteous censures for an adherence to truth and duty are as real and more severe perfecution than unrighteous punishments articles and confessions of faith imposed by ecclesiastical anthority as much cramp christian liberty as if they were established by the state clergymen he as often abused their power about religion as e statesmen did their constitutions and councils have done as much hurt to it as these of magistrates ever did if it be difficult to get gross heretics blasphemers and idolaters judged restrained or punished by the state it will be found as hard to get all errors and all practical mistakes censured by the church nay for once that magistrates have erred in punishing heretics blasphemers and idolaters i believe clergymen have erred ten if not an hundred times in their censures and seldom have ever magistrates persecuted men for righteousness sake but when they were instigated to it by some clergymen  object xxxiv no carnal influence of magistrates relative to religion is consistent with the spiritual nature of the kingdom of christ which is not of this world john xviii    the apostles used no carnal weapons of warfare in promoting it   cor x     answ why do not you state precisely what you mean by the spiritual nature of christs kingdom and its not being of this world is it so spiritual that the members and subordinate rulers in it are not at the same time members in a civil state and interested in the welfare or hurt of it is it so spiritual that it has no manner of connection or fellowship with the kingdom of god over the nation in which it resides and neither gives nor receives from it any more helpfulness than from the kingdom of belial is it so spiritual that the power of it cannot touch any part of mens conduct toward one another or even the magistratical administrations of its members is it so spiritual as to exclude the most high king of nations and his deputed vicegerents from all regard to the honor of god and his religion and the welfare of the state as connected therewith leaving them no more concern therewith than if nations were herds of swine the question under consideration is not concerning the nature of christs kingdom of which the civil magistrate is not a ruler of any kind as has been already manifested but whether all care about the church and her religion as tending to promote the welfare of nations ought to be excluded from gods kingdom as the sovereign of nations and he and his vicegerents obliged to manage that department as if there were no god in the earth   had christ no spiritual kingdom in the days of moses and the prophets when god required magistrates to take care about religion and to restrain and punish the public atrocious insulters of it had he no spiritual kingdom not of this world when he repeatedly drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple   that the spiritual nature of christs kingdom rendered it perfectly consistent with the full exercife of the magistratical power in the roman empire or any other state which is what he meant in his answer to pilate we readily grant but the inspired promises which have been repeatedly quoted isa xlix    and lx    0    psalm ii    0       and lxxii  0    rev xi    and xvii    and xxi    sufficiently prove that the spiritual nature of christs kingdom does not exclude magistrates helpfulness to the truth in authorizing the profession and practice of it by their civil laws and in restraining the open and insolent blasphemers of it   though the weapons of ministers warfare in propagating the gospel be not carnal what is that to the case of magistrates and as the spiritual weapons of church officers reach as much to sins against the second table of the moral law as to those against the sirst they no more exclude the use of the magistrates carnal weapons against the atrocious sins against the first table than with respect to those against the second   cor x     cor v        magistratical influence cannot set up christs kingdom in mens heart or oblige mens conscience to obey his laws in an acceptable manner but it can remove many external hindrances and afford many external opportunities of his own setting up by means of his word and spirit it can restrain burning of bibles or abusing and murdering of preachers and hearers of the gospel it can spread the scriptures and protect preachers of the truths contained in them and by command example and otherwise encourage the subjects to search the scriptures and to hear learn profess and practice the plain doctrines of the gospel in thus endeavoring to make their subjects attend on receive and observe the doctrines of the gospel all appearance of force should be carefully avoided as that is apt to provoke a dislike rather than to promote a cheerful embracement of them but force may be used to restrain or duly and seasonably punish the insolent opposers and revilers of the true religion which is established and on no account ought such plagues of nations as well as of churches to receive any authoritative license to commit such wickedness  object xxxv the annexing of temporal encouragements to the profession and practice of the christian religion or external discouragements to the profession or practice of such opinions and worship as are contrary to it  tends to render men hypocrites and their religion merely carnal in obedience to civil authority and influenced by mere carnal motives it makes men trample on and debauch their conscience and so sap the foundation of all true piety and virtue answ   god who well knows the true nature of religious worship and obedience and highly regards the candor and purity of conscience excited the israelites to it partly by external encouragements restraints and terrors deuteronomy iv  viii xxvii  xxxii lev xviii  xx xxvi and by each of his prophets isa i  to mal iv and even under the gospel godliness has the promises of this life as well as of that which is to come   timothy iv     pet iii     did you mean to blaspheme his conduct as absolutely devilish   with gods approbation david nehemiah and others by familiar intimacy and by preferring them to posts of honor encouraged such as appeared eminent in the profession and practice of revealed religion and they excluded such as appeared notoriously wicked psalm cxix    and ci     neh vii   and xiii    nay david before hand publicly intimated his resolution to prefer only pious and faithful men  and why not when such bid fairest to be eminently useful officers in the state   why may not men even by external advantages be encouraged to an external attendance upon gospel ordinances which by the blessing of god and the working of his spirit may issue in rendering them eminently useful subjects and in their eternal salvation even as children may be hired to that reading of their bible and learning of their catechism which may issue in their conversion and everlasting life   regard to the command of parents masters magistrates and ministers all at once in our religious profession and practice is no way inconsistent with but may be delightfully subordinated to a supreme regard to the authority of god in them   do you really think that those who believe neither a god nor a heaven nor a hell ought under pretense of civil right to be as readily admitted to places of power and trust in civil governments as the most pious  nay are not even a profession and practice of the christian religion much more profitable in a nation than open blasphemy impiety and idolatry which we have heard from gods own word exceedingly corrupt mens morals and pull down the wrath of god on the society   if such things only be restrained and punished as are plainly contrary to the law of god and a right conscience and never punished till after sufficient means of conviction have been afforded and trampled on how can that make men dissemble with or sin against their conscience any more than the punishment of theft murder incest or the like can do it  object xxxvi the abolishment of all civil establishments of revealed religion would have a remarkable tendency to render men truly pious truly sincere in their faith profession and worship and to render them excellent subjects candid peaceable and affectionate lovers of one another it would effectually root out popery and every thing similar answ   just as remarkable a tendency as the leaving of children to themselves has to render them truly virtuous and a distinguished honor to their parents prove xxv      samuel iii     as remarkable a tendency as the abolishment of all ecclesiastical establishments of it would have to render men perfect saints   it is plain that god when he fixed a civil establishment of revealed religion and when he represented as above heresy blasphemy and idolatry as reudering men monsters of all manner of wickedness instead of good subjects neighbors or christians thought otherwise are you wiser than he   never that i know of was there a nation or numerous society on earth in which there was less of a religious establishment good or bad than among the ismaelians of irak and syria and the giagas of africa what were the noted virtues which flourished among them murders assassinations which cannot be read or heard without horror under the protection of an extensive toleration how did england about an hundred and thirty years ago swarm with sectarian errors blasphemies confusions and what has either the peace of the state or the orthodoxy and holiness of our church gained by our last scotch toleration repeated attempts in      and      to unhinge our civil establishment and dethrone our lawful sovereigns in favors of popish pretenders are the noted advantages which have accrued to our state and an alarming increase of infidelity profaneness and popery to our church instead of scarce six hundred papists which was once all that could be reckoned in scotland their number now may amount to about thirty thousand in about a dozen of parishes in the north they have above twenty congregations several of them pretty large and a college and an academy for training up priests how quickly these with the scotch colleges abroad may furnish converters for the whole nation god only knows in the parish of south uist there are   00 papists and  00 protestants in barra    0 papists and  0 protestants in ardnamurchan    0 papists and    protestants in kinkmichael and its neighboring parish    0 papists in kilmanivaig   00 and in glenelg    0  object xxxvii all civil laws establishing revealed religion must necessarily land magistrates in persecuting their subjects for if these civil laws be contemned and violated the breakers must be punished answ for this reason no superior parent master minister or magistrate must make any appointment relative to religious matters because if it be disregarded punishment or censure must be inflicted and that will amount to persecution in the sense of the objection  no duty must ever be attempted lest some perplexing consequence should attend it   though evil doers ordinarily reckon restraints of iniquity persecution the scripture allows nothing to be persecution but unjust severities exercised against the profession or practice of gospel truth  at least against innocence or virtue punishment of men for what is plainly contrary to the word of god is no persecution for conscience sake but a proper correction of them for trampling on and murdering their conscience   if by the blessing of god parents can do much to advance religion in their families without any furious or hurtful beating of their children  and ministers do much to promote it in their congregations without proceeding perhaps once in their life to the higher excommunication and if both may do much to render their children and people useful members of the commonwealth without having power to fine imprison or kill them why may not magistrates by their appointments encouragements and example much promote the profession and practice of revealed religion without proceeding unless very rarely to any disagreeable severities  the point we attempted directly to establish is that magistrates ought never to grant an authoritative toleration to gross heresy blasphemy idolatry you therefore act uncandidly in perpetually haling in the affair of punishments even capital ones just as your tolerant friends the ancient remonstrants perpetually haled in the doctrine of reprobation in order to render the sovereignty of gods grace odious to the people   if magistrates take heed never to punish on the head of religious matters but when the crime is plainly relevant and manisest plainly contrary to the laws of god as well as to those of the land and that the punishment be suitable and seasonable circumstantially calculated to promote the real welfare of the commonwealth why should they be charged with persecution for prudently supporting their most important laws and yet held innocent if not virtuous in supporting their comparatively insignificant laws relative to fishing fowling hunting or the like  object xxxviii let things be reduced to practice what could be done just now in britain without an authoritative toleration of the different parties in religion answ no difficulty of the performance of duties can be a sufficient reason for the neglect of them no difficulty of rectifying what is in disorder can be a proof that it is not duty to attempt it because i sind it so hard work to keep my heart with all diligence and often know not how to get its sinful disorders rectified it will not follow that to obtain inward quietness i should in gods name give an authoritative toleration to my several lusts except perhaps the grosser ones of malice whoredom drunkenness   the rules of rectifying what pertains to religion in britain is plain let magistrates and subjects impartially and earnestly search the oracles of god depending on the illuminating influence of his spirit  let every thing not contained in the scripture be thrown out of both civil and ecclesiastical establishments of religion and every thing plainly appointed therein for the gospel church be authorized let the whole administration of government in church and state and subjection to it be regulated by the law of god  let every prudent and winning method be taken to promote an universally cheerful compliance  if any continue to dissent let every degree and form of tender forbearance be exercised toward them which the express laws of god will permit especially if by a circumspect life they manifest themselves persons of a truly tender conscience with respect to what they apprehend  if all will not concur in these measures let particular persons in their several stations act as becomes the gospel of christ obeying god rather than man and doing all that he has commanded without turning aside to the right hand or to the left and if need be let them take up their cross and patiently follow christ counting nothing too dear unto them if they may uprightly finish their course with joy  upon trial it would be found as easy for magistrates to rectify the disorders in their department relative to religion as it would be for churchrulers in britain to rectify what pertains to rheirs in which you just now pled that there never should be any toleration at all  object xxxix the great dr owen zealously pled for authoritative toleration and that magistrates ought not to interfere with religious matters answ we call no man master one is our master even christ dr owens authority would be  00 light to balance that of many thousands of protestant divines but let us hear his judgment for ought i know his final judgment in his sermon before the english parliament october   th       the civil powers  shall be disposed of into an useful subserviency to the interest power and kingdom of jesus christ hence they are said to be his kingdoms rev xi    page     judges and rulers as such must kiss the son and own his scepter and advance his ways some think if you were well settled you ought not as rulers of the nations to put forth your power for the interest of christ the good lord keep your hearts from that apprehension p     it is the duty of magistrates to seek the good peace and prosperity of the people committed to their charge and to prevent and remove every thing that will bring confusion destruction and desolation upon them esther x   psalm ci magistrates are the ministers of god for good  universal good of them to whom they are given romans xiii   and are to watch and apply themselves to this very thing ver    it is incumbent on them to act even as kings and men in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty  and all may come to the knowledge of the truth   timothy ii       they are to feed the people committed to their charge with all their might unto universal peace and welfare  the things opposite to the good of any nation and people are of two sorts   such as are really directly and immediately opposed to that state wherein they close together and find prosperity  seditions tumults disorders  violent or fraudulent breaking in upon the privileges and enjoyments of singular persons without any consideration of him who ruletb all things  such evils as these nations and rulers supposed to be atheists would with all their strength labor to prevent    such as are morally and meritoriovsly opposed to their good and welfare in that they will certainly pluck down the judgments and wrath of god upon that nation where they are practiced and allowed romans i shall he be thought a magistrate to bear out the name authority and presence of god to men that so he and his people have present peace like a herd of fwine cares not though such things as will certainly devour their strength and then utterly consume them do pass current  seeing they that rule over men must be just ruling in the fear of the lord the sole reason why they sheathe the sword of justice in the bowels of thieves murderers adulterers is not because their outward peace is actually disturbed by them  but principally because he in whose stead they sland and minister is provoked by such wickedness to destroy both the one and the other and if there be the same reason concerning other things they also call for the same procedure  to gather up now what has been spoken considering the gospels right to be propagated with all its concernments in every nation under heaven and the blessings peace prosperity and protection wherewith it is attended when and where received and the certain destruction which accompanies the rejection and contempt of it  considering the duty that by gods appointment is incumbent on them that rule over men that in the fear of the lord they ought to seek the good peace and prosperity of them that are committed to their charge and to prevent obviate remove and revenge that which tends to their hurt perturbation destruction immediate from heaven or from the hand of men and in their whole administration to take care that the worshippers of god in christ may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty let any one who has the least sense of the account which he must  make to the the great king and judge of the world  of the authority and power wherewith he was entrusted determine whether it be not incumbent on him by all the protection he can afford by all the privileges be can indulge by all the support he can grant by all that encouragement he is required or allowed to give to any person whatsoever  to further the propagation of the gospel which upon the matter is the only thing of concernment as well unto this life as unto that which is to come  and if any thing be allowed in a nation which in gods esteem may amount to a contempt and despising thereof men may be taught by sad experience what will be the issue of such allowance p     0 although the institutions and examples of the old testament of the duty of magistrates in the things about the worship of god are not in their whole latitude and extent to be drawn into rules  obligatory to all magistrates now under  the gospel  yet doubtless there is something moral in these institutions  subduct from these administrations what was proper to the church and nation of the jews and what remains upon the general account of a church and nation must be everlastingly binding and this amounts thus far at least that judges rulers and magistrates which are promised under the new testament to be given in mercy and to be of singular usefulness as the judges were under the old are to take care that the gospel church may in its concernments as such be supported and promoted and the truth propagated wherewith they are entrusted  know that error and falsehood have no right or title either from god or men unto any privilege protection advantage liberty or any good thing you are entrusted withal to dispose that unto a lie which is the right of and due to truth is to deal treacherously with him by whom you are employed p        know that in things of practice so of persuasion that are impious and wicked either in themselves or natural consequences the plea of conscience is an aggravation of the crime if mens conscience be feared and themselves given up to a reprobate mind to do those things that are not convenient there is no doubt but they ought to suffer such things as are assigned and appointed by god to such practices p     a truly golden speech and which nothing but the deepest conviction of its truth could have drawn from an independent in his then circumstances  upon the whole sir i readily grant that a multitude of cavils may be started against the magistrates power about religious matters mentioned in our excellent standards as may be against every divine truth the most fundamental not excepted and that the proper application of it to practice may be in some circumstances not a little difficult but not cavils however specious nor difficulty of upright performance of duty but demonstrative arguments of its sinfulness will warrant my renouncing a principle which i have so solemnly espoused in ordination vows and covenants with god and far less to admit that mens conscience and magistrates ought in the name of god to warrant encourage and protect men in gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry though they cannot warrant encourage or protect them in doing any civil injury to men perhaps tindal alone has raised as many shrewd objections against the divine authority of our bible as have or can be raised against that power of magistrates mentioned in our standards and yet woe woe woe for ever to my soul if on that account i renounce it as an imposture of satan  letter ii on the perfidy of all authoritative toleration of gross heresy blasphemy or idolatry in britain sir to exhibit the contrariety of an authoritative toleration of gross heresy blasphemy and idolatry to many if not all the burgess oaths in our country and to the established oaths of allegiance to his majesty or even to his own coronation oath to maintain the true protestant religion as by law established in his dominions and to our solemn vows in baptism and the lords supper i leave to some fitter hand and shall only represent it as a violation of these public covenants with god which our fathers framed as their strongest human securities against gross heresy blasphemy idolatry popery and every thing fimilar  being treacherously and cruelly opposed in their reformation of religion by their two popish queens the protestant lords and others in scotland entered into five several bonds a d              0      in which they solemnly engaged to assist and protect each other in promoting the free exercise of the protestant religion it was only the smaller part of the protestants in our land which entered into these bonds  nor does it appear they were intended as general obligations  but when the papists abroad were laboring with all their might to extirpate the protestant religion and the pope was found to have granted dispensations for qualifying his votaries to undermine it in our land  the national covenant was formed and sworn in       in order to frustrate their attempts and secure the reformation attained in it the abominations of popery were expressly and particularly abjured and it was understood as adhered to and renewed in every religious bond that sollowed after god had marvellously frustrated the attempts of the spaniards and other papists against britain our fathers in thankfulness to him  and to secure themselves against the popish confederates abroad and their friends at home  with much unanimity and joy renewed their national covenant a d    0 along with the subscription of a general bond for preservation of the protestant religion and the kings majesty in      apprehensions of danger from the popish lords and the treacherous regard showed them by k james and especially a very extraordinary effusion of the holy ghost on the general assembly issued in much solemn mourning for sin and renovation of their covenant with god after forty years of fearful perfidious apostasy and much sinful veering toward the abjured abominations of popery they awakened by k charles and archbishop lauds imposition of an almost popish liturgy and book of canons  searched out and lamented their perfidy to god as the cause of their manifold miseries and solemnly renewed their covenant with him as a mean of obtaining his gracious assistance and securing their protestant religion and liberties affrighted by the papists massacring of about two hundred thousand protestants in ireland instigated by their distresses in england and encouraged by the remarkable countenance of gods spirit and providence to the scotch covenanters most of the english and irish protestants in      and      along with them entered into a solemn league and covenant with god and with one another in which they expressly abjured popery and prelacy as a branch of it  k charles had scarce granted a peace a kind of establishment of their religion to the murderous papists in ireland and duke hamiltons attempts to restore him to his throne without giving any security for religion or liberty miscarried in england when the scots and not a few of the irish renewed their covenant with a solemn acknowledgment of sins and engagement to duties  to manifest the fearful perfidy of all authoritative toleration of gross heresy blasphemy idolatry popery and every other form of encouragement to or reception of them the solemn the religious nature of these covenants and their extensive and perpetual obligation must be considered  god alone bath a supreme and unlimited authority and right to regulate his own and the conduct of all his creatures psalm lxxxiii    dan iv    james iv    but the very constitution of a rational creature implies a power derived from him to govern itself even as mens standing in the relation of parents masters magistrates or churchrulers necessarily implies their power to govern others  in subordination to him by virtue of their divinely originated authority over others parents masters and other rulers make laws or binding rules for directing the external behavior of those who are committed to their charge and by their authority derived from god to rule their own spirit and to govern and keep in subjection their whole body prove xvi    james iii     cor ix    all men are empowered to make for themselves laws of self engagement in promises oaths vows and covenants which extend to their purposes and inclinations as well as to their external acts and as all the authority which men have over themselves or others is derived srom that supreme and independent authority which is in god himself and is communicated to them by an act of his will and is implied in his giving them such a nature and station it is plain that no human laws of authority or selfengagement can have any obligation or binding force but what are regulated by and subordinated to the divine laws of nature or revelation   cor xiii   and that if such laws and engagements be lawful god not only does but must necessarily ratify them his law requiring the fulsilment of them under pain of his highest displeasure romans xiii      mat v     as no deputed authority derived from god can increase that supreme that infinite authority which he has in himself so no human command or engagement can increase that infinite obligation to duty which his law has in itself but if lawful they have in them a real obligation distinct though neither separated nor separable from the obligation of gods law to pretend with bellarmine and other papists that our promises or vows do not bind us in moral duties commanded by the law of god is manifestly absurd it necessarily infers that all human commands of superiors as well as human promises oaths vows and covenants are in themselves destitute of all binding force except in so far as they relate to such trifling things as the law of god does not require of men in such particular truths and thus saps the foundation of all relative order and mutual trust and confidence among mankind commands of superiors must be mere declarations of the will of god in his law and promises oaths vows and covenants must be nothing but mere acknowledgments that gods law requires such things from us  in so far as relating to moral duties it represents the authority which god has in himself and with which he has invested men as his deputies as so inconsistent and mutually destructive of each other that men cannot be bound to the same thing by both it represents the law of god as necessarily destructive of the being of an ordinance appointed by itself to promote the more exact observance of itself  in so far as that ordinance binds to a conscientious and diligent obedience to it it is contrary to the common sense of mankind in every age who have all along considered mens promises oaths and covenants as binding them to pay their just debts perform their just duties of allegiance or the like and to declare the truth and nothing but the truth in witness bearing etc it is contrary to scripture which represents promises promissory oaths vows and covenants as things which are to be performed paid or fufilled and which may possibly be transgressed and broken mat v    deuteronomy xxviii          eccl v   psalm xxii    and l    and lxi   and lxvi    and lxxvi    and cxvi        and cxix  0  isa xix    judges xi    isa xxiv   jer xxxiv     which represents an oath as a strong and decisive confirmation putting an end to all doubt or strife heb vi         and which in one of the plainest and least figurative chapters of it repeatedly represents a vow as constituted by our binding ourselves binding our own souls with a bond and represents a vow as a bond or obligation heb issar a very fast and strait binding bond or obligation  as our own bond that stands upon or against us number xxx        selfbinding self engagements is so much the essential form of vows and of all covenants promises or promissory oaths whether of god or man that they cannot exist at all or even be conceived of without it any more than a man without a soul or an angel without an understanding and will to represent vowing as a placing of ourselves more directly under the law of god or any command of it or as a placing of ourselves in some new relation to the law is but an attempt to render unintelligible that which the holy ghost has in the abovementioned chapter labored to make plain if it does not also import that we can place ourselves more directly under the moral law than god has or can place us or more directly than christ was placed  to pretend that mens commands or engagements derive their whole obligation from the law of gods requiring us to obey the one  and pay or fulfill or perform the other is no less absurd  these divine commands requiring us to obey pay perform or fulfill human laws and engagements plainly suppose an intrinfic obligation in these laws and engagements and powerfully enforce it but no law of god can require me to obey a human law or fulfill an engagement which has no obligation in itself any more than the laws of britain can oblige me to pay a bill or fulfill a bond consisting of nothing but mere ciphers  the intrinsic obligation of promises oaths vows and covenants which constitutes their very essence or essential form is totally and manifestly distinct from the obligation of the law of god in many respects   in his law god by the declaration of his will as our supreme ruler binds us deuteronomy xii    in promises vows covenants and promissory oaths we as his deputygovernors over ourselves by a declaration of our will bind ourselves with a bond bind our uls with our own bond our own vow number xxx psalm lxvi       and cxix  0  etc   the obligation of our promises oaths and covenants is always subject to examination by the standard of gods law as to both its matter and manner   thessalonians v    but it would be presumption blasphemous presumption to examine whether what we know to be the law of god be right and obligatory or not james iv       isa viii  0 deuteronomy v      the law of god necessarily binds all men to the most absolute perfection in holiness be they as incapable of it as they will matthew v      pet i       no man can without mocking and tempting of god bind himself by vow or oath to any thing but what he is able to perform no man may vow to do any thing which is not in his own power and for the performance of which he has no promise of ability from god but no mere man since the fall is able in this life either in himself or by any grace received from god perfectly to keep the commandments of god eccl vii  0 james iii   while god remains god his law can demand no less than absolute perfection in holiness while his word remains true no mere man since the fall in this life can possibly attain to it and therefore ought never to promise or vow it the least imperfection in holiness however involuntary breaks the law of god and is even contrary to the duty of our relative stations of hushands parents masters magistrates ministers wives children servants or people   john iii   romans vii          but it is only by that which is in some respect voluntary sinfulness that we break our lawful vows psalm xliv    nothing can more clearly mark the distinction of the two obligations than this particular there is no evading the force of it but either by adopting the arminian new law of sincere obedience or by adopting the popish perfection of saints in this life   the law of god binds all men for ever whether in heaven or hell psalm iii     no human law or selfengagement binds men but only in this life in which they remain imperfect and are encompassed with temptations to seduce them from their duty in heaven they have no need of such helps to duty and in hell they cannot be profited by them  the obligation of lawful promises oaths vows and covenants as well as of human laws respecting moral duties however distinct is no more separable from the obligation of gods law than christs two distinct natures are separable the one from the other but closely connected in manifold respects in binding ourselves to necessary duties and to other things so long and so far as is conducive thereto gods law as the only rule to direct us how to glorify and enjoy him is made the rule of our engagement our vow is no new rule of duty but a new bond to make the law of god our rule even adams engagement to perfect obedience in the covenant of works was nothing else his sallibility in his estate of innocence made it proper that he should be bound by his own consent or engagement as well as by the authority of god our imperfection in this life and the temptations which surround us make it needful that we in like manner should be bound to the same rule both by the authority of god and our own engagements it is in the law of god that all our deputed authority to command others or to bind ourselves is allotted to us the requirement of moral duties by the law of god obliges us to use all lawful means to promote the performance of them and hence requires human laws and selfengagements and the observance of them as conducive to it nay they are also expressly required in his law as his ordinances for helping and hedging us in to our duty in making lawful vows as well as in making human laws we exert the deputed authority of god the supreme lawgiver granted to us in his law in the manner which his law prescribes and in obedience to its prescription in forming our vows as an instituted ordinance of gods worship which he has required us to receive observe and keep pure and entire psalm lxxvi    and cxix  0  and lvi    isa xix       and xlv       and xliv   jer l     cor viii    we act precisely according to the direction of his law and in obedience to his authority in it  binding ourselves with a bond binding our soul with a bond number xxx        binding ourselves by that which we utter with our lips ver         binding ourselves with a binding oath  binding ourselves  binding our soul by our own vow  our own bond ver        in forming our vow we according to the prescription of his own law solemnly constitute god who is the supreme lawgiver and lord of the conscience  the witness of our selfengagement and the guarantee graciously to reward our evangelical fulfillment of it and justly to punish our perfidious violation of it the more punctual and faithful observation of gods law notwithstanding our manifold infirmities and temptations and the more effectual promoting of his glory therein is the end of our selfengagements as well as of human laws of authority and by a due regard to their binding force as above stated is this end promoted  as hereby the obligation of gods law is the more deeply impressed on our minds and we are shut up to obedience to it and deterred from transgressing it  in consequence of our formation of our vow with respect to its matter manner and end as prescribed by god he does and necessarily must ratify it in all its awful solemnities requiring us by his law to pay it as a bond of debt  to perform and fulfill it as an engagement to duties and an obligation which stands upon or against us number xxx          with deuteronomy xxiii        psalm lxxvi    and l    eccl v     mat v    in obedience to this divine requirement and considering our vow in that precise form in which god in his law adopts and ratifies it and requires it to be fulfilled we pay perform and fulfill it as a bond wherewith we in obedience to him have bound ourselves to endeavor universal obedience to his law as our only rule of faith and manners whoever does not in his attempts to obey human laws or to fulfill selfenagements consider them as having that binding force which the law of god allows them he pours contempt on them as ordinances of god and on the law of god for allowing them a binding force thus through maintaining the superadded but subordinate obligation of human laws and of selfengagements to moral duties we do not make void but establish the obligation of gods law  the obligation of a vow by which we engage ourselves to necessary duties commanded by the law of god must therefore be inexpressibly solemn not only are we required by the law of god before our vow was made but we are bound in that performance to fulfill our vow as an engagement or obligation founded in the supreme authority of his law warranting us to make it we are bound to fulfill it as a mean of further impressing his authority manifested in his law upon our own consciences  as a bond securing and promoting a faithful obedience to all his commandments we are bound to fulfill it in obedience to that divine authority by derived power from which we as governors of ourselves made it to promote his honor in those or like respects our fulfillment of our vows is a direct obedience to his whole law  we are moreover bound to fulfill it as a solemn ordinance of gods worship the essential form of which lies in selfobligation and must be received observed kept pure and entire and holily and reverently used and so in obedience to command i ii iii we are bound to fulfill it as an ordinance of god in which we have pledged our own truth sincerity and faithfulness and so in obedience to command ix i ii iii we are bound to fulfill it as a solemn deed or grant in which we have made over our persons property and service to the lord and his church and so in obedience to command i ii viii nay in obedience to the whole law of love and equity mat xxii       and vii    we are bound to fulfill it from regard to the declarative glory of god as the witness of our making of it that he may appear to have been called to attest nothing but sincerity and truth and so in obedience to command i iii ix we are bound to fulfill it from a regard to truth honesty and reverence of god as things not only commanded by his law but good in themselves agreeable to his very nature and therefore necessarily commanded by him  and from a detestation of falsehood injustice and contempt of god as things intrinsically evil contrary to his nature and therefore necessarily forbidden in his law and thus in regard to his authority in his whole law as necessarily holy just and good we are bound to fulfill it from a regard to the holiness justice faithfulness majesty and other perfections of god as the guarantee of it into whose hand we have committed the determination and execution of its awful sanction  as the gracious rewarder of our fidelity or just revenger of our perfidy  and hence in regard to our own happiness as concerned in that sanction  in fine we are bound to fulfill it in obedience to that command of god which adopts and ratifies it requiring us to pay fulfill or perform our vow oath or covenant psalm l    and lxxvi    eccl v   deuteronomy xxiii        mat v     in violating such a vow we do not merely transgress the law of god as requiring the duties engaged before the vow was made but we also rebel against and profane that divine warrant which we had to make our vow we profane that authority over ourselves in the exercise of which we made the vow and consequentially that supreme authority in god from which ours was derived and so strike against the foundation of the whole law we manifest a contempt of that law which regulated the matter and manner of our vow we profane the vow as an ordinance of gods worship appointed in his law by trampling on a noted mean of promoting obedience to all the commands of god we mark our hatred of them and prepare ourselves to transgress them and endeavor to remove the awe of gods authority and terror of his judgments from our consciences we blasphemously represent the most high as a willing witness to our treachery and fraud we pour contempt on him as the guarantee of our engagements as if he inclined not or durst not avenge our villainy contrary to the truth and faithfulness required in his law and pledged in our vow we plunge ourselves into the most criminal deceit and falsehood contrary to equity we rob god and his church of that which we had solemnly devoted to their service contrary to devotion we banish the serious impression of gods adorable perfections contrary to good neighborhood we render ourselves a plague and curse and encourage others to the most enormous wickedness contrary to the design of our creation and preservation we reject the glory of god and obedience to his law from being our end meanwhile we trample on the ratification of our vow by the divine law in all its awful solemnities and manifold connections with itself  and requirement to pay it  it is manifest that our covenanting ancestors understood their vows in the manner above represented they never represent them as mere acknowledgments of the obligation of gods law or as placing themselves in some new relation to gods law or more directly under any command of it but declare that a man binds himself by a promissory oath to what is good and just  it cannot oblige to sin but in any thing not sinful being taken it binds to performance  by a vow we more strictly bind ourselves to necessary duties confess xxii        and in expressions almost innumerable they represent the obligation of their vows as distinct and different though not separable from the law of god stevensons hist p                             etc sir james stewart

which is required by the law of god  but sincerely really and constantly to endeavor the performance of them  ii these public covenants of our ancestors in which they abjured the popish and other abominations may be called national because the representatives or the greater or better part of the nation jointly entered into them as covenants of duty grafted upon the covenant of grace but they ought never to be called national or civil in order to exclude them from being churchcovenants and thus diminish the solemnity or continuance of their obligation both church and state jointly promoted them and in different respects they related to both being at once covenants of men with god and with one another in so far as therein they covenanted with one another with an immediate view to promote or preserve what belonged to the state they served instead of a civil bond but at the same time they covenanted with one another as church members in subordination to their covenanting with god himself as their principal party  the ratifications given to these covenants by the state were really civil ratifications which adopted them as a part of the laws of the state  but that no more rendered them merely civil covenants than the civil ratifications given to and embodying our confessions of faith made them merely civil confessions and mere acts of parliament  or than the repeated legal establishment of our protestant religion in doctrine worship discipline and government made it a mere civil religion these covenants were sometimes used as means of promoting civil purposes but that will no more prove them merely civil than the use of fasting and prayer for advancing or securing the welfare of the state will prove them a mere civil worshipping of god  these covenants were formed for promoting the happiness of both church and state and were calculated to answer that end but so is the christian religion and all the ordinances of it if duly observed   timothy i   prove xiv    i admit that there was sometimes too mixed an interference of civil and ecclesiastical power in enjoining these covenants but abuse of things does not alter their nature gods ordinances are too often used in a carnal sensual and devilish manner without ever being rendered such themselves it is only as really religious covenants and not as civil or state covenants they can be adopted into ordination vows or baptismal engagements and that they were such the following arguments evince    the covenanters themselves who best knew their own intentions do times without number represent them as vows which their confession declares to be a religious ordinance as covenants with god which must be religious if any dealings with him be so chap xxii   lar cat q  0  calderwoods hist p  0

that the scots considered it as a real renovation of their national covenant a religious covenant with god and among ourselves  if it should seem meet to your prudence to think of joining in the religious fellowship of such a covenant how absurd for persons of weaker capacities and less instructed by the spirit of god to pretend at this distance of time to know better the nature of their covenants than themselves did    except perhaps in      the church in her general assemblies or commissions took the lead in promoting the covenanting work and the state when it did any thing did

delightfully carried on in scotland the state had no influence at all in promoting it nay in      the court did all it could to oppose the covenanters procedure indeed our zealous ancestors in the preamble to their bond of that year quote many acts of parliament in favors of that religion to which they engaged and of the steadfast maintenance of it but they never condsiered these acts as a part of their bond or as a command to covenant in their manner but as an evidence that they were doing nothing rebellious or treasonable as their adversaries pretended nay till    0 no act of parliament

when they administered the covenant but that will no more prove that they acted as civil judges than that ministers receiving an order from king or parliament to observe a public fast or hold a synod they must in their fasting and judging work renounce christs sole headship over his church and adopt the magistrate into his place  if it is pretended that ministers marrying of persons is not a

ministers  the papers from the english parliament and their commissioners and the scotch assemblys answers manifest that an uniformity of religion was the principal thing proposed by this league henry vane and perhaps some other english commissioners nevertheless from a dislike of the scotch presbyterianism thought to have gone no further than a civil league but the scots being positive for a religious one he yielded it appeared from that readiness and avidity with which the solemn league was received in england that it answered to the wishes of his constituents after the westminster

the power thereof and received christ into their hearts  and as really and sincerely penitent denying themselves and resolving not to lean on carnal confidences but to lean to the lord dare you pretend that all these expressions in their several bonds represent men merely as members of a commonwealth employed in mere statecovenanting    the ends of their covenanting expressed in their several bonds are religious not merely civil in          and   0  they covenanted in order to promote and preserve the profession and practice of the true protestant religion  in order to advance the

swearing of these covenants for the conviction conversion and confirmation of multitudes fixing in their hearts such a deep sense of religion as all the profaneness and persecution of twenty eight years could not eradicate  is no contemptible evidence that he looked upon them as religious not merely state covenants it is at our infinite hazard if we call that common and unclean which god has so singularly honored  object i our covenanters characterizing themselves noblemen barons burgesses and commons proves their covenants to be mere civil covenants answ will then others characterizing themselves ministers render them at the same time churchcovenants has solomons denominating himself king of israel in his proverbs and ecclesiastes rendered these two books merely civil not religious if in a bond or bill i denominate myself minister of the gospel will that render the bond or bill religious and ecclesiastical   as they never used such characters in their bonds but when they covenanted contrary to their kings will they probably intended no more by them than merely to mark the great harmony of all ranks for the encouragement of their friends and the terror of their malicious enemies   there was no irreligion in subjecting themselves and all their honors to the service of jesus christ as made of god head over all things to his church revel xxi     object ii in      and      they framed their covenants to admit episcopalians and independents whom they would not have admitted to the sacraments answ as in taking these covenants men bound themselves to the regular reformation of every thing found sinful when tried by the word of god our ancestors agreeable to romans xiv   isaiah xxxv     were willing to help forward the weak and admit to their covenant and church fellowship every person who appeared willing to receive more light even though they were not in every respect equally enlightened and reformed as themselves but i defy you to prove that they excluded one upright covenanter from their religious communion   the covenants of      and      were not framed to admit any who resolved obstinately to adhere to episcopacy or independency in the bond of      men bound themselves to forbear the practice of episcopalian government and of the articles of perth till they should be tried and allowed in a free general assembly the covenanters declare that their intention in that bond was against all innovations and corruptions stevensons hist p      in the covenant of      that paragraph which peculiarly respected the protestants in england and ireland was prudently suited to the weakness of many of them but there is nothing in it which favors either episcopacy or independency the preservation of the reformation attained in scotland sworn to excluded them both if then erastians or independents and others dissembled with god and their brethren in taking it they not the covenant are blameable mens hypocritical reception of the sacraments will not render them civil ordinances   you can never prove that the covenant of      was tendered to the doctors of aberdeen after they had shown their obstinate attachment to prelacy

imposition of these covenants under civil penalties proves them to have been merely state covenants answ no more than the requirement of men under civil penalties to partake at least once a year of the lords supper rendered it a merely civil ordinance an ordinance may remain religious though a civil sanction should be sinfully annexed to it   if which i do not you believe that asa and josiah by penal laws compelled men to take their covenants you can scarce condemn our covenanters annexing civil penalties to the refusal of their bonds especially as they knew it would scarce come from any but such as were malignant enemies to the civil as well as religious liberties of the nation   in                and      these covenants had no penalty either civil or ecclesiastical annexed to the not swearing of them without any hint from the covenanters that this altered the nature of the engagement  object iv our ancestors gave up with their covenanting work whenever they got the state of the nation settled by means of it and having got their civil liberties otherwise secured at the revolution they never covenanted at all answ   did ten years of murderous invasion and outrageous contention and twentyeight years of horrible profaneness and persecution make our nation so happy that covenanting with god our deliverer was no more necessary or have the fearful profanation of the name of god by unnecessary and wicked oaths or the shocking bribery and perjury too common in the election of our representatives in parliament and our other outrageous abominations rendered britain so holy that these covenants need no more be regarded   not the alteration of the national affairs to the better but the alteration of mens hearts to the worse made covenanting with god to be so contemned at the restoration and revolution  iii that these solemn and religious covenants with god in which all gross heresy blasphemy idolatry popery and other abominations have been repeatedly abjured bind not only the immediate swearers or subscribers but all their posterity and other representees in all generations following to a saithful performance of every thing engaged must now be demonstrated    that which is engaged in these covenants being moral duty commanded by the law of god is of perpetual obligation the whole faith and practice to which we therein engage are stated from the oracles of god in our excellent standards if the matter in itself were contrary to gods law no human covenant could bind us or any represented by us to it for a moment we can have no power from god to bind ourselves or others to any thing sinful   cor xiii   nor can any human deed be valid in opposition to his supreme authority  if the matter were indifferent no vow or promissory oath could lawfully constitute a perpetual obligation as the alteration of circumstances might render it very unexpedient and unedifying   cor vi    and x    and xvi    romans xiv    but if that which is engaged be precisely what every person in every age or circumstance is bound to by the antecedent tie of the law of god no man can be in the least abridged of any lawful liberty by being brought under the most solemn obligation of an oath or vow  the strictest fulfillment of it cannot but tend to the real profit of every one concerned both in his personal and his social capacity psalm xix      cor xv    isa iii  0 proverbs xiv    romans ii     0 it is therefore for the advantage of us and our posterity to be hedged in and bound up to the most exact conformity to gods law by every mean which he requires or allows in his word  even as it is for our advantage to have our liberty bounded by the ledges of bridges  the law of god requires us to do every thing which is calculated to promote or secure our own or our childrens walking in the truth genesis xvii   psalm xlv    and lxxviii      isa xxxviii      john ver    it represents solemn vows as a mean most effectual to answer this purpose psalm cxix  0

were constituted the adopted laws of both proper to be acknowledged and submitted to by all their members in the most solemn manner which their circumstances permitted  several of these acts as well as the best duties of christians had their sinful infirmities particularly on the head of penalties which i mean not to defend but in so far as these acts approved and authorized these covenants which bound men to receive and hold fast such temporal and spiritual privileges as god had given them and thankfully improve them to his glory  and required a christian regular and seasonable taking of them  they were certainly good and valid being good in themselves and the exact performance of them calculated to promote the glory of god and eminent welfare of both church and state these covenants if once regularly adopted as laws must remain obligatory upon the adopting societies while they exist civil rulers being ordained ministers of god for good to men romans xiii      and church officers appointed by christ for the edifying of his body ephesians iv        have no power against the truth but for the truth   corinthians xiii    0 and so can no more repeal a law which promotes only that which is morally good any more than they can give validity to a sinful one  these covenants must therefore in the view of god and conscience continue binding as laws divinely ratified upon us as subjects and as christians but it is their much more solemn obligation as public vows and covenants with god which i mean to establish particularly with reference to scotland    the matter of these vows being morally good calculated to promote the holiness and happiness of every person in every age the immediate covenanters were such as laid every possible foundation of transmitting the obligation of their vow to the whole church and nation to all generations the representatives of both church and state  the majority of the society and our own parents in their respective stations took these covenants what could transmit and extend an obligation to posterity if all this did not you cannot but allow that even in private civil deeds the obligation is extended far beyond the immediate engagers in bonds respecting money or service men bind not only themselves but their successors and assigns especially if they have the continued right to or possession of that fund or property from which that money or service natively arises the obligations contained in a call to a minister fix on the whole congregation if subscribed by the majority without any regular dissent  and on such as afterward accede to it the treaties of peace traffic etc contracted by kings parliaments magistrates are held binding on their subjects and even on their posterity they who accede to any society fall under the binding force of its social engagements for debt duty etc if bonds and covenants did only bind immediate contractors nothing but the wildest disorder would ensue if the immediate engagers quickly after died they who trusted to their engagement might be totally ruined  a minority who had been silent during the transaction might in a few days overturn a bond or contract of the majority subjects might at their pleasure render void the contracts and treaties of their rulers to pretend that men may not use the same freedom in binding their representees and posterity to god as in binding them to men is highly absurd and shocking as it represents god as more dangerous and less honorable and useful to be dealt with than the very worst of men why may not a parent in offering his child to god in baptism take hold of god to be his god and the god of his seed after him to all generations  and dedicate not only that child but all his posterity to god as his honored vassals and servants genesis xvii   acts ii     is this less dutiful safe or honorable than to infeft himself and them in some earthly property and bind them as possessors of it to be the vassals of some sinful superior  if the majority of a society especially in distress may put the whole under the authority and protection of a man who is a great sinner why must they act either wickedly or foolishly if by a solemn dedication they put it under the especial care and protection of the great god our savior rev xi    psalm ii    and xxii    if the representatives of a people may bind them to live peaceably and trade honestly with earthly neighbors or may in some cases subject them to the power laws or exactions of other earthly superiors  why allow them no power to study peace with god and to follow peace with all men and holiness  no power to surrender them to god to be ruled by his law  and to render him his due revenues of honor  has not god an original and supreme right to all men as his creatures subjects and children are they not all bound by his law to the whole of that duty to which we contend any man ought to be bound by a vow of perpetual obligation is it not inexpressibly honorable safe and profitable to stand under the special care of and in relation to god in christ deuteronomy iv   and xxxiii    why then more shy of devoting posterity or other representees to him than to a sinful man and his service  in covenants with men a proper and timely dissent may frequently be well founded and may effectually divert this obligation from the dissenters but how there could be a lawful dissent from an engagement carefully to keep all the commandments of god and nothing else i know not had the whole or even the body of the hebrew nation timely and regularly dissented from the treaty made by their princes with the gibeonites it might have diverted its obligation from them  inslead of this they appear to have agreed to the final stating of it without a single murmur josh ix but if these princes had by covenant devoted themselves and their tribes to a careful keeping of gods commandments i know not how the peoples dissent could have diverted the obligation from themselves  in covenants with men the nonfulfilment of some condition or some dispensation or remission may weaken if not perfectly annul the obligation but none can dispense with or grant remissions in the matters of god covenants made with god are more absolute and less clogged with conditions and so more obliging the covenants of which we now treat being about indispensible duties of morality upon which depends the glory of god the advancement of the kingdom of jesus christ the honor and happiness of magistrates and the public liberty safety and peace of the nation and the good of posterity in all time coming ought to have their obligation allowed to fix wherever any ground can be found while christ has a kingdom and the covenanters a posterity particularly in scotland for    our civil representatives by these covenants devoted themselves in their station and their subjects in so far as under their power to the service of god in      and    0 king james and his privy council took the national covenant and required their subjects to follow their example in      the privy council again took it as it stood in      in    0 the members of parliament took it as explained by the assembly      to abjure prelacy and the five articles of perth and appointed it to be sworn by all the members of every future parliament it was sworn by the members of parliament      in      the national covenant and the solemn league which was materially the same were renewed by the members of parliament with solemn fasting and humiliation the oath framed in      to be sworn by members of parliament at taking their seats expressly approved the national covenant king charles i gave a solemn approbation of it king charles ii and other magistrates took the covenants in    0 and      now if a covenant made by the princes of israel with the representatives of the gibeonites in a matter which concerned the lords land and the remote service os his altar extended its obligation to the whole nation of israel who consented to it no otherwise than by silence at the final stating of it  and to their posterity for many generations  that four hundred years after they were punished with a famine on account of readiness breach of it josh ix with   samuel xxi and to the gibeonites and their posterity  why not allow the covenanting deed of our princes to extend its obligation in like manner if magistrates be the ministers of god for good to men why should they not be capable to surrender themselves and their subjects to the special care and service of god their common and beneficent superior if they possess the powers assigned them in our excellent standards why may they not as nursing sathers of the church devote themselves and their subjects of the same true religion to the enjoyment of god himself in his oracles and ordinances and to serve him regularly in christ if joshua could bind himself and his family to serve the lord why may not magistrates bind themselves and their subjects of the same true religion to receive and hold fast the like honor and happiness if for the benefit of their subjects magistrates may in a time of need subject themselves and their people to some powerful monarch whose fury is terrible but his favor extremely profitable or may approve and ratify some former grant of that kind  why may they not for the same end devote themselves and subjects to the great god our savior and prince of the kings of the earth why may they not bring their glory into the church and as judges kiss the son of god solemnly approving and in their station ratifying that grant which his father made to him of the outermost ends of the earth rev xxi    and xi    prove viii       psalm ii          in these covenants our representatives in the church in their station devoted themselves and their people to the faith profession and obedience of christ in april      the general assembly unanimously approved the national covenant and then in october ensuing in the name of christ appointed it to be subscribed by all protestants in      and    0 they made further acts for promoting this subscription the general assemblies of                and the commissions or assemblies of                     enjoined the swearing of the covenant by all adult church members i do not know of one presbyterian minister or ruling elder in scotland who in any of the covenanting periods of         0                     declined taking it now if civil representatives may bind their subjects and their posterity by civil contracts why ought not the harmonious dedication of themselves and people to god by churchrulers to have a like binding force if in public prayers ministers may devote themselves and congregations to christ why may not they and ruling elders conjunctly do it by public covenant but we do not chiefly rest the matter on these grounds for    it is beyond all contradiction that the lawful and public covenants civil or religious which are made by parents do bind their posterity the oath of esau in which he resigned his birthright to jacob bound his posterity never to attempt recovering the privileges of it from jacob or his descendents hence esau and his family after the death of isaac removed entirely from canaan genesis xxv    and xxxvi   even the public curse which the jews took upon themselves and their children has been manifestly binding on them these seventeen hundred years past mat xxvii    the vow of parents in the ancient circumcision or the christian baptism of their infants extends to these children  nay according to the extent of gods covenant and promise to all their future seed genesis xvii   acts ii       hence whatever any of them do contrary to that vow must at once be perfidy and rebellion against god nor will their wilful or slothful ignorance of that obligation or their nonconsent to it when grown up free them from that guilt any more than ignorance of adams covenant or of the breach of it can free his posterity from the guilt of his first sin or from perfidy in their personal violations of that

grand children who survived them number xxvi     in deuteronomy xxix       he declares that the covenant taken by that new generation in the plains of moab did not only bind them who were alive and

afterward josh ix       with   samuel xxi    now these covenants of allegiance to god and duty to men of which we are treating were sworn and subscribed by our own natural though now mediate parents and when it is considered how frequently that covenant the same in substance in the several bonds was sworn or subscribed and how generally  and how readily some covenanted on one occasion whose ancestors had not on a preceding  and how families have been since intermixed it will scarce remain probable that there is a scotchman at least on the continent of britain or ireland who is not descended from some covenanter if any to his own disgrace will contend that in all these and different periods of covenanting         0                          etc all his progenitors were such mere

whole and every future acceder to it  at least unless the minority or acceders have by a proper dissent diverted the obligation from themselves  and that if remarkably calculated to promote the common advantage they bind the members of it while it continues a society  common sense will not allow us to doubt that the exact fulfillment of our covenants with god is remarkably calculated to promote the

which it was taken in the city of london and the several counties and congregations of england  than which  no act ever passed among the people of england more solemnly or more religiously  the solemn league and covenant is really public and national in england   its matter is public and national relating to the kingdom under its civil religious and reformed capacity being the reformation and defense of religion under a national profession and the honor and happiness of the king privileges of the parliament and liberties of the subjects   these matters were consulted debated and agreed to

that the lord may be one and his name one in the three kingdoms and the kingdoms of england and scotland may remain conjoined in a firm peace to all posterity  in a case that concerned the good of these kingdoms   the covenant was sworn by the nation   collectively in the most full and complete body that could or ever did represent the same the parliament consisting of lords and commons and that in their public capacity and with the greatest solemnity imaginable did as the representative body of the kingdom swear the covenant which as a further testimony that it was a national covenant they caused to be printed with their names subscribed and to be hung up in all churches and in their own parliament house as a compass whereby to steer their debates and to dictate unto all that should succeed them into that place and capacity what obligations before god ly upon the body of this nation   it was universally sworn by the people of this kingdom england solemnly testified in their particular places of convention all over the kingdom and by all manner of persons from eighteen years and upwards and that at the command of and by the authority of the parliament who in their

parishes and taken by all persons religious military or civil  if the several rolls within the several parishes and precincts of this kingdom in which the several names of such as did swear the solemn league and covenant were engrossed be viewed it will be found that it was sworn by the universality of the nation  and i hope we who are a free people tied by no bonds but such as we lay upon ourselves may be allowed to bind ourselves by an oath   his majesty charles ii did swear the solemn league and covenant in behalf of himself and his successors and that as king of great britain and

who were then exercising unheard of cruelty  with the scotch army of six thousand under gener alexander lesly which were sent to check the ravage of the murderous papists ministers were sent to attend

preached both in camp and country  at this time those who had fled from ireland on account of the oath imposed by strafford before the massacre begun returned in great numbers and joined with the scotch army and sir john clotworthy a zealous puritan so that he with his party scoured the whole county of antrim from massacring papists  when the established  i e episcopalian clergy were generally

to be taken in ireland and accordingly it was sworn by almost all the protestants in ulster who acknowledged the authority of the parliament  the greatest part of the protestants in ireland all concurred in it  and their posterity enjoy large estates from that english parliament which enjoined the taking of the covenant  it known that the irish army under the lord of ards were all

p     from these hints it appears that the body of protestants in ireland took the solemn league and covenant and that the number of covenanters there could not be less than  0 or  0000 if it was not double or triple that reckoning  if then sir the public engagements of representatives of church and state can bind those represented by them and their posterity  if the public engagements of parents can bind their descendents  if the public engagements of the greater part of a society can bind the whole and their successors  our public covenants with god must bind the protestants in ireland the whole nation of england and in a peculiar manner the scots who are so manifestly affected by all the four sources of obligation that no not our perjured prelatists for their own vindication ever dared that i know of to contest it and answerable to this source these fourfold vows must fix upon us a kind of foursold solemn obligation to god frequently repeated renewed or confirmed how fearful then must be our guilt if we cast all the cords of god behind our back in favors of gross heresy blasphemy idolatry popery    our ancestors did not covenant with god as mere individuals but as a body

     the assembly august  th      say  our engagement therein is not only national but personal  the subject bound by the covenant being thus not merely particular persons but a church and nation the obligation of it must be as permanent as the society bound by it    our ancestors did what they could to make their covenant as binding as possible the express terms in which the different forms of it are conceived manifest it a promise an oath a vow a covenant if then there be any binding force in a promise from the truth of men which is therein pledged if there be any religion in an oath because of the reverence we owe to the sacred name of god interposed in it if any obligation results from a vow because of the fealty we thereby owe to god if a man be obliged to keep his covenant from regard to truth or justice due to others who are parties in it  all these transacted with the utmost solemnity must concur in constituting the binding sorce of this public engagement  hence the commission      in their warning say the bonds and obligations that lie upon us to this duty by the law of god the law of nature and the national covenant and solemn league and the pains therein contained whereunto we have devoted ourselves if we shall desert or fail stevenson p  0     our ancestors plainly intended that their public covenants should bind all future generations in      they lamented their own

and perpetual obligation should stand in vigor for the more firm establishment of religion in our own time and in the generations following  although the innovations of religion were the occasion of the making of this covenant yet our intention was against these and all other innovations and corruptions to establish religion by an everlasting covenant never to be forgotten stevenson p

national oath and subscription of         0      inviolable in the solemn league they swear we shall endeavor that these kingdoms may remain conjoined in a firm peace and union to all posterity    the ends of these covenants declared in their express words are perpetual till the end of time viz to maintain the true worship of god the majesty of our king and the peace of the kingdom for the common happiness of ourselves and our posterity  that religion and righteousness may flourish in the land to the glory of god etc covenant of       to promote the glory of god and the advancement of the

subject upon which the obligation was laid be permanent if the end of the covenanters and their covenant was to fix the obligation upon posterity as well as upon the immediate engagers and if they did every thing in their power to render that obligation solemn and permanent what surther evidence of the perpetuity of that obligation can any man demand who singly regards the honor of god or the welfare of this church and nation may i therefore adopt the words of a truly great man it was the glory of scotland that we were solemnly in covenant with god  wherein our forefathers for themselves

covenanting forefathers deuteronomy xxix                now our solemn covenants which our forefathers entered into being nothing but a superadded and accumulative obligation to what we were previously bound to by the word of god they cannot but stand binding upon us their posterity ibid p   0  0    as israel avouched the lord to be their god by solemn covenants that were binding upon them and their posterity after them so in this moral duty we in our forefathers followed the example  entering into a solemn covenant with him which he many signal ways countenanced  attended with internal displays of his power and glory  to disparage these covenants is to cast dung upon our glory i think it worse than the breaking burning and burying of them to bespatter their reputation and deny their obligation is to render them odious to all generations ibid p       there is  a superadded obligation lying on us by our covenants of gratitude and duty which though it bind us to nothing but what we were authoritatively bound to before yet it strengthens the obligation ibid vol ii p       when god has manifested his covenant of grace to a people receiving them to be his people and they thereupon have entered into a covenant of duty with him avouching him to be their god and promising through grace subjection to him though it were four hundred yea four thousand years it stands and they who succeed are bound by the covenant  a number of honest covenanters when they avouched the lord to be their god and promised obedience to him did it in the faith of his avouching them to be his people and trusting to his covenant of grace and promise and not to their covenant or engagement we in these lands have devoted ourselves to the lord in which we were warranted by many scripture precedents  never was an action done more sedately and advisedly  the binding obligation of it upon us is plain if we have the benefit of that religion to which our forefathers swore we must be heirs of that oath they came under to the most high as levi paid tithes in his fathers loins so we in our forefathers swore to this covenant we are obliged to stand to it though it were never so many years after  being partakers of the benefit we are bound to do that which they promised to do for it if a parent bind his children are not their seed and heirs bound by his promise as well as they were what continual changes and confusions would there be in the world if persons themselves were only to be tied by their own personal bonds  how much more impiety is it for men to deny that obligation by covenant to god made by their forefathers in their name  our solemn covenants are one of the grounds of our claim to him  and of his continuing his claim to us who own these covenants  how will god avenge the violation of a lawful oath made with himself in this land  unless these professed preshyterians can now prove that presbytry is sinful they must acknowledge that our national covenants are binding on us in this matter  if a covenant in things lawful be not binding then no covenant ever was r erskines works vol ii p          0  comp hind let loose p          apol relat p

and prelatists answ   let us allow no malignant enemy or perjured violator of these covenants to be held a sufficient witness against them nor let us have the long ago refuted calumnies of such men revived upon their mere authority   though the covenant had had insirmities even infirmities sufficient to have hindered the swearing of it as the doctors of aberdeen and oxford pretended was the case  it may nevertheless bind when once it is sworn though its matter had been in part sinful and selfcontradictory it would bind to the part which was lawful  though the authority which imposed it had been insufficient and the manner of imposing it improper it would bind when once sworn zedekiah was in some respect compelled to swear allegiance to nebuchadnezzar whose sovereignty over judah was very disputable yet his oath bound him ezekiel xvii          chronicles xxxvi     though our covenanters ends had been carnal or even sinful the oath as far as lawful in its matter is binding when once it is sworn  without allowing these things as fixed principles no oaths or covenants could be any securities among mankind   if popery and prelacy be plants which god has not planted why may we not as lawfully in our stations endeavor to extirpate or root them out as we may mortify the deeds of our body that we may live the one includes no more violence against mens persons than the other romans viii    do you imagine that the covenanters swore to cut their own throats or tear out their own hearts when they engaged to endeavor in their station to extirpate every thing contrary to the power of godliness as indwelling sin vain thoughts etc which adhere to believers in this life certainly are  object ii many in england and ireland never took the solemn league or took it in a sense consistent with prelacy or independency answ i do not expect that any hater of that covenant will ever be able to invalidate the proof which has been given of the number of the covenanters in both these kingdoms   the covenanters declared that an oath is to be taken in the plain sense of the words without equivocation or mental reservation  it cannot bind to sin but in any thing not sinful being taken it binds to performance although to a mans own hurt confession of faith chap xxii    all but jesuits profess the same principle and indeed if oaths vows or covenants bind not men according to the plain meaning of their words they become quite useless mens prevarication therefore in favors of prelacy or independency cannot free them from the obligation of an oath which strikes against both   as the scots stood bound by their national covenant to every duty contained in the solemn league long before the english had a thought of covenanting along with them and did also swear the solemn league no neglect or prevarication of either english or irish can free us from our obligation it was neither to the english nor to the irish but chiefly to the faithful and unchangeable god of all grace that our fathers bound themselves and their seed the assembly in their letter to the council of london justly observe it is not in the power of any human authority to absolve you from adhering to this so solemnly sworn league and covenant and in another letter the covenant has been broken by many in both kingdoms  we do not doubt but there are many seven thousands in england who have retained their integrity in that business and in their warning      the violation of the covenant by some in england does not set us free from the obligation of it no laws nor authority on earth can absolve us from so solemn an obligation to the most high  we are not acquitted from the obligation of our solemn covenants because of the troubles  in the worst of times all those duties whereunto by covenant we oblige ourselves do still ly upon us  we have sworn and we must perform it and in their warning      albeit the league and covenant be despised by that prevailing party in england yet the obligation of that covenant is perpetual and all the duties contained therein are constantly to be minded and prosecuted by every one of us and our posterity according to their place and station and in their letter to brethren in england although there were none in the one kingdom who did adhere to the covenant yet were not the other kingdom nor any person in either of them absolved from the bond thereof since in it we have not only sworn by the lord but also covenanted with him it is not the failing of one or more that can absolve others from their duty or tie to him besides the duties therein contained being in themselves lawful and the grounds of our tie thereto moral though others forget their duty yet does not their defection free us from that obligation which lies upon us by the covenants in our places and stations the covenant being intended as one of the best means of stedfastness it were strange to say that the backslidings of any should absolve others from the tie thereof especially seeing our engagement therein is not only national but personal  all these kingdoms joining together to abolish that oath by law could not dispense therewith much less can any one of them or any party in either do the same  they are testimonies which the lord christ has entered as protestations to preserve his right in these ends of the earth long ago given unto him for his possession and of late confirmed by solemn covenant  object iii the influence of the highland thiefs and the gross ignorance of the scotch islands together with the general dislike of the covenant at the restoration and revolution are internal evidences that but a part perhaps a small part of the scots took the covenant answ i boldly defy you to invalidate the proofs i have brought to the contrary nay for ought i know you cannot produce one of these perjured prelatists that pretended that only the smaller part of the scotch nation took the covenant especially in    0      and        were the highland chiefs and the gross ignorance of the islanders occasioned by the negligence of the curates a whit more able to withstand the enlightening and heartbowing power of god so remarkably manifested on these occasions than k charles and many others on the continent have we not produced evidence that multitudes of the highlanders entered into the reformers covenant      and were not argyle mar and many other highland chiefs zealous covenanters did not such as were otherwise minded take the covenant of      as imposed by the privy council according to its original meaning did not even the doctors and prelatic inhabitants of aberdeen take that bond without approving the councils limitation of it to its original meaning   you can produce no evidence that the covenanting work was not carried on in the scotch islands but such as we have that never a hebrew child was circumcised on the  th day from isaac to john baptist  or that never a weekly sabbath was observed from the creation till the manna fell around the hebrew camp i e want of positive evidence to the contrary  and that too in places of which to this moment we have little account except what relates to their situation soil product or the like   it is highly absurd to pretend that the so general disregard of the covenants twelve or forty years after the last taking of them is internal evidence that few had taken them will it irrefragably prove that adam was never made after the image of god or taken into covenant with him because within a few days or hours he had become a sinner hating both god and his covenant  or that devils were never created holy and happy because within a few days they had left their first estate will the general concurrence of the hebrews in worshipping the golden calf prove that they had not entered into solemn covenant with god about forty days before will their subsequent apostasies prove that but few of them had covenanted with god under joshua asa joash hezekiah josiah ezra and nehemiah will peters fearfully heinous and repeated denial of christ prove that he had not a few hours before solemnly engaged against it  object iv force or fear caused many to covenant answ though force or sear should have rendered the manner of covenanting unacceptable to god they cannot render void an oath which is sworn   i will never contend that the penalty annexed by law to the refusal of the covenant in      or even on some other occasions was proper but after a laborious search i find no proper evidence that any force was ever used in scotland to make any take the covenant except in      by montrose and monro two military men without any warrant from either church or state  the former if not both of whom afterward turned out a malignant murderer of his covenanting brethren never sir pick up or retail the mere inventions of perjured violators of these covenants who were glad to say any thing to conceal or excuse their own wickedness   in      when the covenanting was most universal the bishops and some other anticovenanters afraid of prosecution for their enormous debts or for their oppressive and other wicked deeds  and perhaps chiefly to calumniate the covenanters at court did flee their country but none were obliged to do so for refusing the covenant fear of danger probably restrained some from reviling a bond which the nation so highly esteemed but none that i know of were thereby constrained to swear it some mobs happened occasioned by the kings suspension of the common exercise of the civil law and the sitting of its courts but these were detested by the zealous covenanters and not one of them appears either to have been intended or to have issued in favors of the covenant if the influences of gods spirit and the affecting appearances of his providence  as at sinai or in the apostolic age awed or allured numbers to take the covenant whose hearts were not sincere before him  should we quarrel with the almighty on that account  but sir henderson dickson and cant who being the principal leaders of the covenanting work that year affirm to the doctors of aberdeen who were eager to have detected them of falsehood if it had been possible no pastors in our knowledge have been either forced to flee or have been threatened with the want of their stipends for refusing their subscription but some have of their own accord gone to court for procuring protection against their creditors  and have made lies between the king and his people others have wilfully refused to abide with their flocks for no reason but because the people have subscribed  arguments have been taken from promised augmentation of stipends to hinder subscription fear of worldly loss rather hinders men to subscribe than scruples of conscience  the prelates flight seems rather to have proceeded from inward furies of accusing consciences etc  in this day of the lords power his people have most willingly offered themselves in multitudes like the dew of the morning others of no small note have offered their subscriptions and have been refused till time should try their fincerity from love to the cause and not from the fear of man no threatenings have been used except of the deserved judgments of god nor force except the force of reason from the high respects which we owe to religion to our king to our native country to ourselves and to our posterity answers to doctors of aberdeen p        the general assembly      in their act ses   th appear so far from forcing men into their covenant that they earnestly enjoin and appoint the utmost caution to be used for preventing such persons taking of it as did not sincerely approve it and resolve to prosecute the ends of it      since the covenanting work was so remarkably countenanced by the holy ghost  attended with perhaps more sincere mourning for sin  more serious repentance and solid conversion to god than has within an equal space of time and place happened any where in the world since the apostolic age  and since the covenanters in their vow deponed that they covenanted without any worldly respect or inducement as far as human in firmity would allow  take heed sir lest after your objection has manifested the carnality selfishness and dissimulation of your own religious appearances  god at last should publicly expose you as a blasphemer of his great work and a malicious slanderer of his people as wilfully perjured  object v it is impossible our covenanters could understand their bonds particularly in that which relates to popery in the notional covenant or to prelacy in the solemn league answ ignorance indeed hinders a right and acceptable swearing of oaths or covenants but cannot invalidate their binding force if once they be sworn otherwise millions in britain would through ignorance be freed from all their solemn engagements in baptism and the lords supper and thousands freed from all obligation of their oaths of allegiance or fidelity to magistrates or even their oaths to declare the truth and nothing else in witness bearing candidates for the ministry needed but keep themselves in a great measure ignorant of the doctrines of the confession of faith and duties of the ministerial office in order to render their ordination vows or subscriptions altogether unobligatory   being trained up in the abominations of popery or prelacy or having frequent access to witness them our covenanting ancestors who had common sense might have more knowledge of them than most clergymen in scotland now have even as a common sailor who has served  0 years in a man of war may have more knowledge of her tackling and other pertinents than all the learned doctors of fix british universities  object vi if nothing be engaged to in these covenants but what god has declared or required in his word they never could lay any obligation upon the covenanters much less a perpetual obligation upon their posterity it is absolutely inconsistent with sound philosophy christianity or common sense to imagine that any human deed can bind to any thing declared in the word or required by the law of god answ   then it seems the common protestant doctrine of our confession of faith which in your ordination vows you solemnly declared to be founded on the word of god viz that a man binds himself by oath to what is good and just that in any thing not sinful it binds to performance that by a vow we more strictly bind ourselves to necessary duties etc must be grossly erroneous   instructed by some papist or some ringleader in the perjurious violation of these covenants in the last century you have indeed now hit upon a sentiment which if proven would effectually undermine the obligation of our covenants and for ought i know all religion  all morality  all mutual trust and order among mankind along with it if our promises oaths vows or covenants can have no binding force except in things to which the revelation and law of god cannot reach neither adam nor christ as mediator could bind themselves to fulfill gods law and so there must be no proper no real covenant of works or of grace and so no religion among mankind and for the same reason the promises of god in so far as their matter corresponds to his natural excellencies can have no binding force and thus the foundation of our faith and hope is quite overturned all engagements in baptism or the lords supper to believe what god reveals receive what he offers and do what he commands must be absolutely null and void destitute of all binding force  jesuitical equivocation and mental reservation are no more necessary in the making of promises covenants or vows or in swearing promissory oaths of allegiance fidelity or witness bearing or in subscribing articles creeds or confessions of faith calls to ministers bonds or bills of service or debt  if the law of god which is exceeding broad can but reach to the matter of them and require the believing maintaining or practicing of what is therein engaged that alone renders them null and void and not binding to all intents and purposes and so there can be no such a thing as perjury perfidy or breach of promise except it be with respect to such things as the law of god could not directly or indirectly reach  which if it be as perfect and exceeding broad as the bible affirms must certainly be very few and very trisling  for where there is no law  no binding of a law  there can be no transgression  mens promises covenants oaths and vows in word or writ in so far as they respect things to which the law of god can reach must be mere villainous impositions seeming to bind while they do not in the smallest degree and therefore ought to be detested instead of being required made or trusted  for the same reason no commands of parents masters magistrates or any other superiors being human deeds can have any binding force in any thing relative to religion equity kindness etc to which the law of god can reach its requirements and hence cannot be lawfully obeyed or their authority regarded except when they commend what is absolutely indifferent and trisling  if human engagements and commands can only bind men to that which is absolutely indifferent it is plain that we can only be answerable to men for such parts of our conduct as the law of god did not reach  but let men once firmly believe that their promises covenants oaths or vows and the commands of superiors have no binding force but in that which is left absolutely indifferent by the law of god and that they are answerable to men only for such parts of their conduct as the law of god could not reach  how naturally they will rush headlong into all manner of profligacy every man doing that which is right in his own eyes in every thing important   how absurd to pretend honoring of religion or of the law of god by making it the murderer of that deputed authority which god has by it granted to men or of these covenants oaths or vows which he has therein appointed as means of his worship  not only scripture but even common sense dictates that the authority of god in his law cannot be rightlyregarded unless in a way of also regardingthat authority which he has deputed to men and all the commands or self engagements which proceed from it in due subordination to it if i read my bible daily in obedience to the command of god as my god in christ  in obedience to christ as appointed by god to be my mediatorial prophet and king  and at the same time in due subordination hereto  in obedience to my civil ruler as the minister of god for good to men  in obedience to my pastor or church judicature as the messenger of christ to me  in obedience to my parents or masters as gods deputygovernors over me  and in fulfillment of the vow which i as gods deputy governor over myself have laid myself under according to his appointment where is the inconsistency must i wickedly put asunder the immediate and deputed authority of god which he has so closely and delightfully joined together god forbid  object vii what have we to do with our fathers engagements in religion to which we never gave any personal consent especially after we have become capable to judge and choose for ourselves  nay to do with engagements which i cannot prove my ancestors ever took answ   to rest obligation to pay debt or perform duty on the debtors proving the contraction of it or engagement to it is highly absurd in itself and opens a wide door for breaking through almost every engagement according to this scheme you may hold your ancestors who lived   0 years ago unbaptized heathens and perhaps yourself too and so renounce your baptism because you cannot prove that ever you received it if god who is our creditor in these covenants can prove our ancestors taking of them he will hold us bound by their deed and even though they did not take them he will hold us bound by the deed of the society and its representatives   you know that lord  about four hundred years ago granted your ancestor the valuable estate of  to be held under him and his heirs for a very small honorary service as an acknowledgment of vassalage and that the celebrated farmer a b about six years ago took a ninetynine years lease of one of your farms at a very high rent have you certified the present heirs of that lord and farmer that they are nowise bound by their progenitors deeds unless they have given their own personal consent  and that the one may recall your estate and the other may keep your farm and refuse to pay you any rent  you have not nor ever will you allow such freedoms only to be used with god  not with yourself  too strong a presumption that you more value your estate and rent than all that you hold of god in religion and all the honor you owe to him   if our fathers bound us to any thing in religion which is not warranted by the word of god we have nothing to do with it but to bewail their sin in such engagement but if they bound us to what is commanded by the law of god we must stand bound  till we prove from scripture that vows binding to duty are not lawful or that fathers have no right to devote their children to gods service no slothful or wilful ignorance or withholding of personal consent can so much as excuse the nonperformance of such engagements nothing can free from their binding force which would not annual our baptismal vows   once more sir be pleased to review these public covenants of our fathers in their principal contents and meaning they were a solemn acquiescence in and confirmation of gods grant of the utmost ends of the earth to his son jesus christ for hs possession they implied a solemn acceptance of god himself in christ as the god savior and portion of the covenanters and their posterity freely granted to them in the gospel  and of his oracles and ordinances as the means of familiar fellowship with him  a resolution through his grace to retain him and them as their inestimable privileges  and a solemn engagement thankfully to improve these privileges in an holy obedience to all his commandments to promote his glory and the temporal spiritual and eternal advantage of these covenanters and their seed now sir do you so heartily envy our redeemer his fathers grant of the ends of the earth for his possession psalm ii   that you would gladly renounce our ancestors solemn acquiescence in it do do you so heartily dislike the having of a reconciled god in christ for your and your posteritys god savior and portion and his pure oracles and ordinances for your privileges that you would fondly renounce a solemn acceptance of gods gracious grant of them sealed and consirmed by the remarkable influences of his spirit do you so undervalue these enjoyments and hate a grateful and selfprofiting obedience to all the commandments of god that you would gladly renounce a solemn obligation to it or are you offended with the declared ends of these covenants viz the glorifying of god the preservation and reformation of religion and promoting the welfare of the nation  and that god may delight to dwell among us to the latest posterity  you will perhaps pretend that you love our reformed doctrine worship presbyterian government and discipline but hate to be bound to them especially by others than yourself but sir for the same reason you must renounce your baptismal engagements and state your quarrel with god himself who has appointed vows as his ordinance for hedging up men to their duty and who has entered into covenants with parents for their posterity as well as for themselves moreover it is scarce credible that you can love every thing engaged to in a vow and yet hate to be bound by it after god has signally countenanced it it is scarce possible that my wife can dearly love her husband and the order and enjoyments of my family if she hate and wish to renounce her marriage vow
