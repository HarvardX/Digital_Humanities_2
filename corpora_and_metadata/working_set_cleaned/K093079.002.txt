midday in silent horror over the boundless waste the driver hassan with his camels past one cruise of water on his back he bore and his light scrip contained a scanty store a fan of painted feathers in his hand to guard his shaded face from scorching sand the sultry sun had gained the middle sky and not a tree and not an herb was nigh the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view with desperate sorrow wild the affrighted man thrice sighed thrice struck his breast and thus began  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way ah little thought i of the blasting wind the thirst or pinching hunger that i find bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage soon shall this scrip its precious load resign then what but tears and hunger shall be thine ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griefs a more than equal share here where no springs in murmurs break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are sound and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way cursed be the gold and silver which persuade weak men to follow farfatiguing trade the lilly peace outshines the silver store and life is dearer than the golden ore yet money tempts us over the desert brown to every distant mart and wealthy town full often we tempt the land and often the sea and are we only yet repaid by thee ah why this ruin so attractive made or why fond man so easily betrayed why heed we not while mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefore think the flowery mountains side the fountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o cease my fears  all frantic as i go when thought creates unnumberd scenes of woe what if the lion in his rage i meet  often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to the mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way at that dead hour the silent asp shall creep if aught of rest i find upon my sleep or some swollen serpent twist his scales around and wake to anguish with a burning wound thrice happy they the wise contented poor from lust of wealth and dread of death secure they tempt no deserts and no griefs they find peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o hapless youth for she thy love has won the tender zara will be most undone big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid when fast she dropped her tears as thus she said  farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain  yet as thou go may every blast arise  weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  safe over the wild no perils may thou see  no griefs endure nor weep false youth like me o let me safely to the fair return say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn o let me teach my heart to lose its fears recalled by wisdoms voice and zaras tears he said and called on heaven to bless the day when back to schiraz walls he bent his way eclogue iii abra or the georgian sultana scene a forest time the evening in georgias land where tefflis towers are seen in distant view along the level green while evening dews enrich the glittering glade and the tall forests cast a longer shade

tender strain who led her youth with flocks upon the plain at morn she came those willing flocks to lead where lillies rear them in the watery mead from early dawn the livelong hours she told till late at silent eve she penned the fold deep in the grove beneath the secret shade a various wreathe of odorous flowers she made that these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of persia see the modern history of the ingenious mr salmon gay motleyd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose the violet blue that on the mossbank grows allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there the finished chaplet well adorned her hair great abbas chanced that fated morn to stray by love conducted from the chase away among the vocal vales he heard her song and sought the vales and echoing groves among at length he found and wooed the rural maid she knew the monarch and with fear obeyed  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved the royal lover bore her from the plain yet still her crook and bleating flock remain often as she went she backward turned her view and bad that crook and bleating flock adieu fair happy maid to other scenes remove to richer scenes of golden power and love go leave the simple pipe and shepherds strain with love delight thee and with abbas reign  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love on the cool fountain or the shady grove still with the shepherds innocence her mind to the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined and often as spring renewed the plains with flowers breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours with sure return she sought the sylvan scene the breezy mountains and the forests green her maids around her moved a duteous band each bore a crook allrural in her hand some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung with joy the mountain and the forest rung  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved and often the royal lover left the care and thorns of state attendant on the fair often to the shades and low roofd cots retired or sought the vale where first his heart was fired a russet mantle like a swain he wore and thought of crowns and busy courts no more  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved blessed was the life that royal abbas led sweet was his love and innocent his bed what if in wealth the noble maid excel the simple shepherd girl can love as well let those who rule on persias jewelld throne be famed

every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved eclogue iv agib and secander or the fugitives scene a mountain in circassia time midnight in fair circassia where to love inclined each swain was blessed for every maid was kind at that still hour when awful midnight reigns and none but wretches haunt the twilight plains what time the moon had hung her lamp on high and past in radiance through the cloudless sky sad over the dews two brother shepherds sled where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led fast as they pressed their flight behind them lay wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away along the mountains bending sides they ran till faint and weak secander thus began secander o stay thee agib for my feet deny no longer friendly to my life to fly friend of my heart o turn thee and survey trace our sad flight through all its length of way and first review that longextended plain and yon wide groves already past with pain yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried and last this lofty mountains weary side  agib weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know the toils of flight or some severer woe still as i haste the tartar shouts behind and shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind in rage of heart with ruin in his hand he blasts our harvests and deforms our land yon citron grove whence first in fear we came drops its fair honors to the conquering flame far fly the swains like us in deep despair and leave to russian bands their fleecy care  secander unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword in vain unheard thou callst thy persian lord in vain thou courtst him helpless to thine aid to shield the shepherd and protect the maid far off in thoughtless indolence resigned soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy no wars alarm him and no fears annoy  agib yet these green hills in summers sultry heat have lent the monarch often a cool retreat sweet to the sight is zabras flowery plain and once by maids and shepherds loved in vain no more the virgins shall delight to rove by sargis banks or irwans shady grove on tarkies mountain catch the cooling gale or breathe the sweets of alys flowery vale fair scenes but ah no more with peace possessed with ease alluring and with plenty blessed no more the shepherds whitening tents appear nor the kind products of a bounteous year no more the date with snowy blossoms crowned but ruin spreads her baleful fires around  secander in vain circassia boasts her spicy groves for ever famed for pure and happy loves in vain she boasts her fairest of the fair their eyes blue languish and their golden hair those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send those hairs the tartars cruel hand shall rend  agib ye georgian swains that piteous learn from far circassias ruin and the waste of war some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare to shield your harvests and defend your fair the turk and tartar like designs pursue fixed to destroy and steadfast to undo wild as his land in native deserts bred by lust incited or by malice led the villain arab as he prowls for prey often marks with blood and wasting flames the way yet none so cruel as the tartar foe to death inured and nursed in scenes of woe he said when loud along the vale was heard a shriller shriek and nearer fires appeared the affrighted shepherds through the dews of night wide over the moonlight hills renewed their flight  ode on the death of mr james thomson by the same in yonder the scene of the following stanzas is supposed to lie on the thames near richmond grove a druid lies where slowly winds the stealing wave the years best sweets shall duteous rise to deck its poets sylvan grave in yon deep bed of whispering reeds his airy harp the harp of aeolus of which see a description in the castle of indolence shall now be laid that he whose heart in sorrow bleeds may love through life the soothing shade then maids and youths shall linger here and while its sounds at distance swell shall sadly seem in pitys ear to hear the woodland pilgrims knell remembrance often shall haunt the shore when thames in summer wreaths is dressed and often suspend the dashing oar to bid his gentle spirit rest and often as ease and health retire to breezy lawn or forest deep the friend shall view yon whitening richmond church spire and mid the varied landscape weep but thou who ownst that earthy bed ah what will every dirge avail or tears which love and pity shed that mourn beneath the gliding sail yet lives there one whose heedless eye shall scorn thy pale shrine glimmering near with him sweet bard may fancy die and joy desert the blooming year but thou lorn stream whose sullen tide no sedgecrownd sisters now attend now waft me from the greenhills side whose cold turf hides the buried friend and see the fairy valleys fade dun night has veiled the solemn view  yet once again dear parted shade meek natures child again adieu the genial meads assigned to bless thy life shall mourn thy early doom their hinds and shepherdgirls shall dress with simple hands thy rural tomb long long thy stone and pointed clay shall melt the musing britons eyes o vales and wild woods shall he say in yonder grave your druid lies ode to pity by the same o thou the friend of man assigned with balmy hands his wounds to bind and charm his frantic woe when first distress with dagger keen broke forth to waste his destined scene his wild unsated foe by pellas euripides bard a magic name by all the griefs his thought could frame receive my humble rite long pity let the nations view thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue and eyes of dewy light but wherefore need i wander wide to old ilissus distant side deserted stream and mute wild arun a river in sussex too has heard thy strains and echo midst my native plains been soothed by pitys lute there first the wren thy myrtles shed on gentlest otways infant head to him thy cell was shown and while he sung the female heart with youths soft notes unspoild by art thy turtles mixed their own come pity come by fancys aid even now my thoughts relenting maid thy temples pride design its southern site its truth complete shall raise a wild enthusiast heat in all who view the shrine there pictures toils shall well relate how chance or hard involving fate over mortal bliss prevail the buskined muse shall near her stand and sighing prompt her tender hand with each disastrous tale there let me often retired by day in dreams of passion melt away allowed with thee to dwell there waste the mournful lamp of night till virgin thou again delight to hear a british shell ode to simplicity by the same o thou by nature taught to breathe her genuine thought in numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong who first on mountains wild in fancy loveliest child thy babe or pleasures nursed the powers of song thou who with hermit heart disdainst the wealth of art and gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall but come a decent maid in attic robe arrayed o chaste unboastful nymph to thee i call by all the honeyd store on hyblas thymy shore by all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear by her whose lovelorn woe in evening musings slow soothed sweetly sad electras poets ear by old cephisus deep who spread his wavy sweep in warbled wanderings round the green retreat on whose enameled side when holy freedom died no equal

range their ordered hues while rome could none esteem but virtues patriot theme you loved her hills and led the laureat band but staid to sing alone to one distinguished throne and turned thy face and fled her altered land no more in hall or bower the passions own thy power love only love her forceless numbers mean for thou have left her shrine nor olive more nor vine shall gain thy feet to bless the servile scene though taste though genius bless to some divine excess faints the cold work till thou inspire the whole what each what all supply may court may charm your eye thou only thou can raise the meeting soul of these let others ask to aid some mighty task i only seek to find thy temperate vale where often my reed might sound to maids and shepherds round and all thy sons o nature learn my tale ode to peace by the same o thou who badst thy turtles bear swift from his grasp thy golden hair and soughtst thy native skies when war by vultures drawn from far to britain bent his iron car and bad his storms arise tired of his rude tyrannic sway our youth shall fix some festive day his sullen shrines to burn but thou who hearst the turning spheres what sounds may charm thy partial ears and gain thy blessed return o peace thy injured robes upbind o rise and leave not one behind of all thy beamy train the british lion goddess sweet lies stretched on earth to kiss thy feet and own thy holier reign let others court thy transient smile but come to grace thy western isle by warlike honor led and while around her ports rejoice while all her sons adore thy choice with him for ever wed ode to mercy by the same strophe o thou who sitst a smiling bride by valors armed and awsul side gentlest of skyborn forms and best adored who often with songs divine to hear winst from his fatal grasp the spear and hidst in wreaths of flowers his bloodless sword thou who amidst the deathful field by godlike chiefs alone beheld often with thy bosom bare art found pleading for him the youth who sinks to ground see mercy see with pure and loaded hands before thy shrine my countrys genius stands and decks thy altar still though pierced with many a wound antistrophe when he whom even our joys

roseate bower thou thou shall rule our queen and share our monarchs throne ode to liberty by the same strophe who shall awake the spartan fife and call in solemn sounds to life the youths whose locks

alcaeus fancyblest shall sing the sword in myrtles dressed at wisdoms shrine awhile its flame concealing what place so fit to seal a deed renowned till she her brightest lightnings round revealing it

opportunity of meeting him one day as he walked on the shore and opened her passion to him but was received with a coldness occasioned by his horror and surprise at her appearance this however was so misconstrued by the sealady that in revenge for his treatment of her she punished the whole island by covering it with a mist so that all who attempted to carry on any commerce with it either never arrived at it but wandered up and down the sea or were on a sudden wrecked upon its cliffs  once hid from those who search the main where thousand elsin shapes abide and wight who checks the westering

matrons on her awful voice silent and pale in wild amazement hung yet he the bard aeschylus who first invoked thy name disdained in marathon its power to feel for not alone he nursed the poets flame

and poured the main engirting all long by the loved enthusiast wooed himself in some diviner mood retiring sat with her alone and placed her on his sapphire throne the whiles the vaulted shrine around seraphic wires were heard to sound now sublimest triumph swelling now on love and mercy dwelling and she from out the veiling cloud breathed her magic notes aloud and thou thou richhaird youth of morn and all thy subject life was born the dangerous passions kept aloof far from the sainted growing woof but near it sat ecstatic wonder listening the deep applauding thunder and truth in sunny vest arrayed by whose the tarsols eyes were made all the shadowy tribes of mind in braided dance their murmurs joined and all the bright uncounted powers who feed on heavens ambrosial flowers where is the bard whose soul can now its high presuming hopes avow where he who thinks with rapture blind this hallowed work for him designed high on some cliff to heaven uppild of rude access of prospect wild where tangled round the jealous steep strange shades oerbrow the valleys deep and holy genii guard the rock its glooms embrown its springs unlock while on its rich ambitious head an eden like his own

those oftturnd scrolls i leave behind the sports and i this hour agree to rove thy scenefull world with thee the passions an ode by the same when music heavenly maid was young while yet in early greece she sung the passions often to hear her shell thronged around her magic cell exulting trembling raging fainting possessed beyond the muses painting by turns they felt the glowing mind disturbed delighted raised refined till once it is said when all were fired filled with fury rapt inspired from the supporting myrtles round they snatched her instruments of sound and as they often had heard apart sweet lessons of her sorceful art each for madness ruled the hour would prove his own expressive power first fear his hand its skill to try amid the chords bewildered laid and back recoiled he knew not why even at the sound himself had made next anger rushed his eyes on fire in lightnings owned his secret stings in one rude clash he struck the lyre and swept with hurried hand the strings with woeful measures wan despair low sullen sounds his grief beguiled a solemn strange and mingled air twas sad by fits by starts twas wild but thou o hope with eyes so fair what was thy delighted measure still it whispered promised pleasure and bade the lovely scenes at distance hail still would her touch the strain prolong and from the rocks the woods the vale she called on echo still through all the song and where her sweetest theme she chose a soft responsive voice was heard at every close and hope enchanted smiled and waved her golden hair and longer had she sung  but with a frown revenge impatient rose he threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down and with a withering look the war denouncing trumpet took and blew a blast so loud and dread were never prophetic sounds so full of woe and ever and anon he beat the doubling drum with furious heat and though sometimes each dreary pause between dejected pity at his side her soulsubduing voice applied yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien while each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head thy numbers jealousy to naught were fixed sad proof of thy distressful state of differing themes the veering song was mixed and now it courted love now raving called on hate with eyes upraisd as one inspired pale melancholy sat retired and from her wild sequestered seat in notes by distance made more sweet poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul and dashing soft from rocks around bubbling runnels joined the sound through glades and glooms the mingled measure stole or over some haunted streams with fond

there fled the fair that all beholders charmed whose beauty fired us and whose spirit warmed in that sad sigh the unwilling breath retired the grace the glory of our scene expired and shall she die

melt with unaccustomed woes accept o once admired these artless lays accept this mite of tributary praise oh could i paint thee with a masters hand and give thee all thy merits could demand these lines should glow with true poetic flame bright as thy eyes and faultless as thy frame we mourned thy absence from our scene retired each longing heart again thy charms desired yet still alas we hoped again to view our wish our pleasure every joy in you again thy looks might grace the tragic rage again thy spirit fill the comic stage but lo disease hangs hovering over thy head dire danger stalks around thy frighted bed those starry eyes have lost each beamy ray and ghastly sickness makes the fair her prey death shuts the scene  and all our hopes are over those beauties now must glad the sight no more say ye whose features youthful luster bloom whose lips exhale arabias soft perfume must every gift in silent dust be lost no more the wish of man or female boast ah me with time must every

surpised a ravished audience viewed what forms too often the tragic scene disgrace what tasteless airs the comic scene deface though tuneful cibber still the muse sustains by nature framed to pour the moving strains though from her eye each heartfelt passion breaks and more than music warbles when she speaks when shall we view again like thine conjoined a form angelic and a piercing mind alike in every mimic scene to steer the gay the grave the lively and severe thy judgment saw thy taste each beauty caught no senseless parrot of the poets thought thy bosom well could heave with fancied woe and from thy own our tears were taught to flow whenever we viewed the romans sullied same thy beauty justified the heros shame what heart but then must anthony approve and own the world was nobly lost

alexander now forsakes our coast  and ah roxana is for ever lost nor less thy power when rigid virtue fired the chaster bard and purer thoughts inspired what kneeling form appears with steadfast eyes

wiped the sorrows from afflictions eyes go ask the wretch in want and sickness laid whose goodness brightened once misfortunes shade o snatch me hence to lone sequestered scenes to arching grottoes and embowering greens where scarce a ray can pierce the dusky shade where scarce a footstep marks the dewy glade where palehud grief her secret dwelling keeps where the chill blood with lazy horror creeps where awful silence spreads her noiseless wing and sorrows harp may tune the dismal string  or rather lead my steps to distant plains where closing earth enfolds her last remains what time the moon displays her silver beam and groves and floods reflect the milder gleam when contemplation broods with thought profound and fairy visions haunt the sylvan ground lo fancy now on airy pinions spread with scenes ideal hovers over my head i see i see more pleasing themes arise what mystic shadows flit before my eyes imagination paints the sacred grove the place devote to poesy and love here grateful poets hail the actors name and pay the rightful tribute to their fame around their tomb in generous sorrow mourn and twine the laurels over the favored urn methinks i view the last sepulchral frame that bears inscribed her much lamented name see to my view the dramas sons displayed what laurelld phantoms crowd the awful shade first of the choir immortal shakespeare stands whose searching eye all natures scene commands bright in his look celestial spirit blooms and genius over him waves his eagle plumes next tender southern skilled the soul to move and gentle row who tunes the breast to love the witty congreve near with sprightly mien and easy farquhar with his lighter scene a numerous train of bards the shrine surround in tragic strains and comic lore renowned see on the tomb yon pensive form appear heave the full sigh and drop the frequent tear the garments loose her throbbing bosom show dispersed in air her careless tresses flow round her pale brows a myrtle wreath is spread a gloomy cypress nods above her head see while her hand a solemn lyre sustains her trembling fingers wake the languid strains soft to the touch the vocal strings reply and tune the notes to answer every sigh she child of grief at human misery weeps at every death her dismal vigil keeps but chief she mourns when fates relentless doom gives wit and beauty victims to the tomb her lays their merits and their loss proclaim a mournful task and elegy her name now bending over the pile she vents her moan and pours these sorrows over the senseless stone ah lost for ever lost the breath that warmed the wit that ravished and the mien that charmed here sleeps beneath the fairest of the fair the graces darling and the muses care who once could fix a thousand gazers eyes now cold and lifeless unregarded lies who once the soul in bonds of love detained now lies alas in stronger bonds restrained pale death has risled all her pleasing store and nature loathes a sorm so loved before is there a fair whose features point the dart charm the sixd eye and fascinate the heart behold what soon disarms the childish sting and plucks the wanton plume from cupids wing then boast no longer wits fallacious store the sweets of sprightly converse boast no more those lips so framed to each persuasive art no more shall touch the ear and win the heart let beauty here her transient blessing weigh let humbled wit her pitying tribute pay let female grace vouchsafe the kindly tear wit grace and beauty once were centered here ye sacred bards who tuned the dramas lays here pay your incense of distinguished praise she gave your scenes with every grace to shine she gave new feeling to the nervous line her beauties well supplied each tragic lore and showed those charms your muse but feigned before here round her shrine your votive wreaths bestow around her shrine eternal greens shall grow the listening groves shall learn her name to sing and zephyrs wast it on their downy wing till every shade these doleful sounds return and every gale in sullen dirges mourn the mourner ends with sighs her hand she rears and with her vesture dries the gushing tears behold each bard the soft contagion feels from every eye the trickling sorrow steals see natures son lament her hapless doom see shakespeare bending over his favourites tomb each shadowy form declines his awful head and scatters roses on the funeral bed in slow procession round the shrine they move and chant her praises through the tuneful grove farewell the glory of a wondering age the second oldfield of a sinking stage farewell the boast and envy of thy kind a female softness and a manly mind long as the muses can record thy praise thy fame shall last to far succeeding days while wit survives thy name shall ever bloom and wreaths unfading flourish round thy tomb while thus i tune the plaintive notes in vain for her whose worth demands a nobler strain lo to my thought some warning genius cries attempt not swain beyond thy flight to rise shall thy weak skill attempt to raise our woes or paint a loss that every bosom knows it is not thy lays can teach us tears to shed what eye refrains  for woffington is dead spring a pastoral ballad by mr tho brerewood when approached by the fair dewy fingers of spring swelling buds open first and look gay when the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing and are danced by the breeze on each spray when gently descending the rain in soft showers with its moisture refreshes the ground and the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers like rich gems beam a luster around when the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe and the cuckoo proclaims with his voice that nature marks this for the season to woo and for all that can love to rejoice in a cottage at night may i spend all my time in the fields and the meadows all day with a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime young as april and blooming as may when the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn may my fairest and i sweetly wake view the far distant hills which the sun beams adorn then arise and our cottage forsake when the sun shines so warm that my charmer and i may recline on the turf without fear let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy while we breathe the first sweets of the year be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side bubble out and transparently flow creep gently along in meanders and glide through the vale strowd with daisies below while the be flies from blossom to blossom and sips and the violets their sweetness impart let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips the rich cordial that thrills to the heart while the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate which the fowler has caught in his snares may we think ourselves blessed that it is not our fate to endure such an absence as theirs may i listen to all her soft tender sweet notes when she sings and no sounds interfere but the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats are at strife to be louder than her when the daisies and cowslips and primroses blow and checquer the meads and the lawns may we see bounding there the swift lightfooted do and pursue with our eye the young fawns when the lapwings just fledged over the turf take their run and the sirstlings are all at their play and the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun let us then be as frolic as they when i talk of my love should i chance to espy that she seems to mistrust what i say by a tear that is ready to fall from her eye with my lips let me wipe it away if we sit or we walk may i cast round my eyes and let no single beauty escape but see none to create so much love and surprise as her eyes and her face and her shape thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves and the meadows around us are mown when the lass on the sweet smelling haycock receives what she afterward blushes to own when evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads with the dew then no longer well roam with my arm round her waist in a path through the meads let us hasten to find our way home when the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings each one by the side of its mate when a mist that arises a drowsiness brings upon all but the owl and the bat when soft rest is required and the stars lend their light and all nature lies quiet and still when no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night but at distance the clack of a mill with peace for our pillow and free from all noise so that voices in whispers are known let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys that are mused on by lovers alone summer by the same where the light cannot pierce in a grove of all trees with my fair one as blooming as may undisturbed by all sound but the sighs of the breeze let me pass the hot noon of the day when the sun less intense to the westward inclines for the meadows the groves well forsake and see the rays dance as inverted he shines on the face of some river or lake where my fairest and i on its verge as we pass for it is she that must still be my theme our two shadows may view on the watery glass while the fish are at play in the stream may the herds cease to low and the lambkins to bleat when she sings me some amorous strain all be silent and hushed unless echo repeat the kind words and sweet sounds back again and when we return to our cottage at night hand in hand as we sauntering stray let the moons silver beams through the leaves give us light just direct us and chequer our way let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk as thus gently and slowly we move and let no single thought be expressed in our talk but of friendship improved into love thus enchanted each day with these rural delights and secure from ambitions alarms soft love and repose shall divide all our nights and each morning shall rise with new charms autumn by the same though the seasons must alter ah yet let me find what all must confess to be rare a female still cheerful and faithful and kind the blessings of autumn to share let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine overspread with its branches and shade whose clusters appear more transparent and fine as its leaves are beginning to sade when the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load in our orchard surrounded with pales in a bed of clean straw let our apples be stowed for a tart that in winter regales when the vapors that rise from the earth in the morn seem to hang on its surface like smoke till dispersed by the sun that gilds over the corn within doors let us prattle and joke but when we see clear all the hues of the leaves and at work in the fields are all hands some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves let us carelessly stroll over the lands how pleasing the sight of the toiling they make to collect what kind nature has sent heaven grant we may not of their labor partake but oh give us their happy content and sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook let us silently sit at our ease and there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook struggles hard to procure its release and now when the husbandman sings harvest home and the corns all got into the house when the long wished for time of their meeting is come to frolic and feast and carouse when the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed and are leaving the branches all bare either strewn at the roots shrivelled withered and dead or else blown to and fro in the air when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem and the axletrees ready to break while the waggoner whistles in stopping his team and then claps the poor jades on the neck in the morning let us follow the cry of the hounds or the fearful young covey beset which though skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds are becoming a prey to the net let us enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords still amused with these innocent sports nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords with their grand entertainments in courts in the evening when lovers are leaning on styles deep engaged in some amorous chat and it is very well known by his grin and her smiles what they both have a mind to be at to our dwelling though homely wellpleased to repair let our mutual endearments revive and let no single action or look but declare how contented and happy we live should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul let soft music the phantoms remove for it is harmony only has force to control and unite all the passions in love with her eyes but half open her cap all awry when the lass is preparing for bed and the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by sometimes rouzes and scratches his head in the night when it is cloudy and rainy and dark and the laborers snore as they lie not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark in the farm or the village hard by at the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this ere our eyes are closed up in their lids let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss which the sunshine and daylight forbids winter by the same when the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen and the meadows their beauty have lost when natures disrobed of her mantle of green and the streams are fast bound with the frost while the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold as bleak the winds northerly blow and the innocent flocks run for warmth to the fold with their fleeces besprinkled with snow in the yard when the cattle are fodderd with straw and they send forth their breath like a steam and the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw flakes of ice that she finds in the cream when the sweet countrymaiden as fresh as a rose as she carelessly trips often slides and the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shows all the charms that her modesty hides when the lads and the lasses for company joined in a crowd round the embers are met talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind and of ghosts till they are all in a sweat heaven grant in this season it may be my lot with the nymph whom i love and admire while the icicles hang from the eves of my cot i may thither in safety retire where in neatness and quiet  and free from surprise we may live and no hardships endure nor feel any turbulent passions arise but such as each other may cure the cure of saul a sacred ode by dr brown  vengeance arise from thy infernal bed  and pour thy tempest on his guilty head thus heavens decree in thunders sound shook the dark abyss profound  the unchaind furies come pale melancholy stalks from hell the abortive offspring of her womb despair and anguish round her yell by sleepless terror saul possessed deep feels the fiend within his tortured breast midnight specter round him howl before his eyes in troops they rise and seas of horror overwhelm his soul haste to jesses son repair he best can sweep the lyre wake the solemnsounding air and lead the vocal choir on every string softbreathing raptures dwell to sooth the throbbings of the troubled breast whose magic voice can bid the tides of passion swell or lull the raging storm to rest sunk on his couch and loathing day the heavenforsaken monarch lay to the sad couch the shepherd now drew near and while the obedient choir stood round prepared to catch the soulcommanding sound he dropped a generous tear  thy pitying aid o god impart for lo thy poisoned arrows drink his heart the mighty song from chaos rose  around his throne the formless atoms sleep and drowzy darkness broods upon the deep  confusion wake bid the realms of chaos shake rouse him from his dread repose hark loud discord breaks her chain the hostile atoms clash with deafning roar her hoarse voice thunders through the drear domain and kindles every element to war   tumult cease  sink to peace  let there be light  the almighty said and lo the radiant sun flaming from his orient bed his endless course begun see the twinkling pleiads rise thy star orion reddens in the skies while slow around the northern plain arcturus wheels his nightly wane thy glories too refulgent moon he sung thy mystic mazes and thy changeful ray o fairest of the starry throng thy solemn orb of light guides the triumphant carr of night over silver clouds and sheds a softer day ye planets and each circling constellation in songs harmonious tell your generation oh while yon radiant seraph turns the spheres and on the steadfast pole star stands sublime wheel your rounds to heavenly sounds and sooth his songenchanted ears with your celestial chime in dumb surprise the listening monarch lay his woe suspended by sweet musics sway and awe struck with uplifted eye mused on the newborn wonders of the sky lead the soothing verse along he feels he feels the power of song  ocean hastens to his bed the laboring mountain rears his rockencumberd head down his steep and shaggy side the torrent rolls his thundering tide then smooth and clear along the fertile plain winds his majestic waters to the distant main flocks and herds the hills adorn the lark highsoaring hails the morn and while along yon crimsonclouded steep the slow sun steals into the golden deep hark the solemn nightingale warbles to the woodland dale see descending angels shower heavens own bliss on edens bower peace on natures lap reposes pleasure strews her guiltless roses joys divine in circles move linked with innocence and love hail happy love with innocence combined all hail ye sinless parents of mankind they paused  the monarch prostrate on his bed submissive bowed his head adored the works of boundless power divine then anguishstruck he cried an smote his breast why why is peace the welcome guest of every heart but mine now let the solemn numbers flow till he feel that guilt is woe heavenly harp in mournful strain over yon weeping bower complain what sounds of bitter pangs i hear what lamentations wound mine ear in vain devoted pair these tears ye shed peace with innocence is fled the messengers of grace depart death glares and shakes the dreadful dart ah whither fly ye by yourselves abhorred to shun that frowning cherubs fiery sword  lo hapless hapless pair goaded by despair forlorn through desert climes they go wake my lyre can pity sleep when heaven is moved and angels weep flow ye melting numbers flow till he feel that guilt is woe  the king with pride and shame and anguish torn shot fury from his eyes and scorn the glowing youth bold in truth so still should virtue guilty power engage with brow undaunted met his rage see his cheek kindles into generous fire stern he bends him over his lyre and while the doom of guilt he sings shakes horror from the tortured strings what sounds of terror and distress rend yon howling wilderness the dreadful thunders sound the forked lightnings flash along the ground why yawns that deepning gulf below  it is for heavens rebellious foe  fly ye sons of israel fly who dwells in korahs guilty tents must die  they sink  have mercy lord  their cries in dreadful tumult rise hark from the deep their loud laments i hear they lessen now and lessen on the ear now destructions strife is over the countless host for ever lost the gulf is closed  their cries are heard no more  but oh my lyre what accents can relate sinful mans appointed sat he comes he comes the avenging god clouds and darkness round him roll tremble earth ye mountains nod he bows the skies and shakes the pole the gloomy banners of his wrath unfurled he calls the floods to drown a guilty world  ruin lift thy baleful head  rouse the guilty world from sleep  lead up thy billows from their cavernd bed  and burst the rocks that chain thee in the deep  now the impetuous torrents rise the hoarseascending deluge roars down rush the cataracts from the skies the swelling waves overwhelm the shores just o god is thy decree shall guilty man contend with thee lo hate and envy seaentombd and rage with lust in ruin sleep and scoffing luxury is doomed to glut the vast and ravenous deep  in vain from fate the astonished remnant flies   shrink ye rocks ye oceans rise  the tottering cliffs no more the floods control sea following sea ingulphs the ball over the sunk hills the watery mountains roll and wide destruction swallows all now fiercer let the impassioned numbers glow swell the song ye mighty choir wing your dreadful darts with fire hear me monarch  guilt is woe  thus while the frowning shepherd poured along the deep impetuous torrent of his song saul stung by dire despair gnashd his teeth and tore his hair from his blood by horror chilled a cold and agonizing sweat distilled then foaming with unutterable smart he aimed a dagger at his heart his watchful train prevent the blow and call each lenient balm to sooth his frantic woe but pleased the shepherd now beheld his pride by heavens own terrors quelled then bade his potent lyre control the mighty storm that rent his soul cease your cares the bodys pain a sweet relief may find but gums and lenient balms are vain to heal the wounded mind come fair repentance from the skies o sainted maid with upcast eyes descend in thy celestial shroud vested in a weeping cloud holy guide descend and bring mercy from the eternal king to his soul your beams impart and whisper comfort to his heart  they come o king thine ear incline listen to their voice divine their voice shall every pang compose to gentle sorrow sooth thy woes till each pure wish to heaven shall soar and peace return to part no more behold obedient to their great command the lifted dagger quits his trembling hand smoothed is his brow where sullen care and furrowed horror couched with fell despair no more his eyes with fury glow but heavenly grief succeeds to hellborn woe  see the signs of grace appear see the soft relenting tear trickling at sweet mercys call catch it angels ere it fall and let the heartsent offering rise heavens bestaccepted sacrifice  yet yet again  ah see the pang returns again with inward fire his heaving bosom burns now shepherd wake a mightier strain search the deep heartrending pain till the large floods of sorrow roll and quench the tortures of his soul almighty lord accept his pang sincere let heavenly hope dispel each dark temptation and while he pours the penitential tear o visit him with thy salvation  stoop from heaven ye raptured throng sink ye swelling tides of song for lo dissolved by musics melting power celestial sorrow rolls her plenteous shower over his wan cheek the colors rise and beams of comfort brighten in his eyes happy king thy woes are over thy god shall wound thy soul no more the pitying father of mankind meets the purereturning mind no more shall black despair afflict his soul each gentler sound ye shepherds now combine sweetly let the numbers roll sooth him into hope divine now lowly let the rustic measure glide to quell the dark remains of selfconsuming pride till natures homesprung blessings he confess and own that calm content is happiness  ye woods and lakes ye cliffs and mountains haunted grots and living fountains listen to your shepherds lay whose artless carols close the day bounding kids around him throng the steep rock echoes back his song while all unseen to mortal eye sliding down the evening sky holy peace though born above daughter of innocence and love quits her throne and mansion bright her crown of stars and robe of light serene in gentle smiles arrayed to dwell beneath his palm tree shade hail meek angel awful guest still pour thy radiance over my breast pride and hate in courts may shine the shepherds calm and blameless tent is thine  softly softly breathe your numbers

where sighs the zephyr to you lonely tree a solemn grove its leafy mantle spread where bend you mouldering turrets over the sea a venerable dome once reared its head the solemn grove the venerable dome were erst frequented by a numerous train even chaste as they who dians mountain roam but not subjected to her gentle reign far other goddess did this train obey far other temples other altars raised far other meaning breathed their choral lay far other incense on their altars blazed veiled superstition waked her magic sound bad albions sons sorsake the splendid court forsake amusements variegated round and to her sable standard here resort alas obsequious to her stern command a sullenpensive brotherhood they came refused to trace the paths by nature planned and razed from glorys page their ancient name nor these alone were found incloisterd here here also dwelt the simpleminded swain who wrapped in sloth dreamed out the lazy year while industry sat weeping on the plain the many temples rising fair to view which towering superstition called her own with hand unerring radiant truth oerthrew and snatched the impostor from her tinselld throne on yon dustlevelld spire the crafty maid with indignation brooding in her breast sits gloomily  her votaries all are fled her lamps extinguished and her rites suppressed within her hand a vacant string she holds that once connected many a hallowed bead the blotted scroll the other hand unfolds contained the maxims of her slighted creed couched at her feet behold a mouldering shrine of various relics once the dread abode where runs the spider over his treacherous line where lurks the beetle and the loathso me toad on darkness wing now sails the midnight hour when for the grateful sound of choral prayer the shrieking owl from you disparted tower with notes of horror wakes her trembling ear of human grandeur mark the fleeting day how frail each purpose and each wish how vain the strongbuilt domes the

while rude winds howl around and dreary torrents lash his naked limbs mean time the rifting thunder dreadful roars the livid lightnings flash and elements conjoined pour out their wrath as if to rend the lone defenseless aged feeble oak such scenes awake imaginations powers to sacred thought such rosa cannot paint it is his alone to show the shattered trunk the winds keen howl the thunders aweful

timeworn hollow towers convey the sound to the near wood where in the devious path retired fancy wanders on her ear the faint sound murmurs strait the distant low of unyokd heifer strait the cuckows note she hears while often the roving zephyrs tread rustling alarms her and the measured step of the slow steer who brushes through the thicket to seek his food beats duly regular as on he wanders through the opening bower he sees the pale moon rising clouds on clouds pild mountainous awhile obstruct her beam till laboring thence she lifts her silver brow and pours her full ray on the ivyd steeple and hark its bell now tolls the minute knell and through the churchway path the surplicd priest walks slowly forward while the snowy pall covering the relics of some love lorn virgin passes with aweful pace along the glade wrapped harmonist what though thy studied chord can sound the slow knell echo to the note the lone owl utters breathe the heifers low and mark the funeral step with pausing cadence and music can no more where is the tower oerhung withivy seen by the pale moon whose faint beam glimmers on the snowy pall where are the rocky clouds from whence she breaks yet do not these does not the rustling breeze and the slowtreading heifer add delight do not accordant senses join to fill the musing mind with calm and holy rapture and can the city by the utmost force of mimic art with labored imitation so soothe the soul or give such mild delight ye gay and sportive votaries of joy forgive the thoughtless muse for she has led me to talk of pleasing horror and the bliss which melancholy gives ye cannot form amid the circling follies which urge on your laughing hours perhaps ye cannot form a notion of these joys and with a taunt of high contempt despise the wild enthusiasm yet on the welltrod stage have ye not seen your roscius fired by the natural bard immortal shakespeare wander the bleak heath a poor and outcast king nor blame the winds whose keen tooth seized his age nor chide the elements for their unkindness while the ruffling storm tore the proud garments from his shivering trunk and the fierce lightnings fired his maddening brain have you not then felt horror would ye not change your rich pomp for edgars naked hovel and be the poor kings host  have ye not wished to range with rosaline the forest wild or live beneath the shelter of some oak with melancholy jaques tell me why then ye looked on wealth and greatness with a scorn why but because the muse with native strength poured truth on fancys eye and yet the muse can only boast in the most warm description a faint resemblance nor has she such force to strike as nature has alas her voice but wakes remembrance of our absent bliss and when she sings of incensebreathing spring she wafts no odours to the longing sense but only prompts our sigh that we must dwell confined in the full city distant far from every scene of rural innocence whose woods whose shades whose storms or funerals even raise a sense of pleasure what can then the brighter views what can the happy hour that gives the blushing bride to the true arms of faithful damon thenot pleased revives to former youth

greater bliss fills the whole breast nor leaves a vacant place for lighter mirth unnoticd speaks the pipe they hear no sound but the endearing voice of mutual love they do not mark the joy in every face around for their attention fixed on each other watches every glance diffused by the lovely languid eye well may all else be unperceived for who observes bright hesper dart his pointed ray when riding high mild cynthia pours serene her steady beam oh tell me when compared to these true raptures what is the shadowy pomp and artful splendor when the golden shackles fetter two venal souls by interest called to prostitute the everhallowd rites of holy hymen  on the village plain naught joins but mutual love no sordid motive promotes unnatural union but the flame that first united glows throughout their life a steady fire whose unabating light gilds youth with rapture and with fostering warmth chears drooping age who smiling sees his offspring step forth to claim the joys he celebrates with annual hospitality what time the circling year brings round the happy day that showerd down blessings on him when it gave to his fond vow the willing sylvias charms then blooming young now hoary but her heart unchanged by time for still the same desire to add to every joy or fondly soothe each woe he feels reigns unabated there his social roof receives each welcome guest his open heart diffuses round his pleasure and each plain neighbor with unfeigning tongue congratulates his bliss who would not leave for these sincere delights the pageant pomp the rich array the courtly formal speech unutterd by the heart the birthday wish of venal hirelings who for interest crowd the glittering levee happier reason deems viewed in each light the simple village life than all that courtiers wish or kings bestow kings cannot give a boon of so rich price as are thy smiles o lovely health and thou shunning the tumult to the rural green retirest there not built by mortal hand stands on the southern slope of the fresh hill thy temple from whose roof the eglantine and vagrant woodbine hang and at the porch sits thy good priestess ease administering to exercise who up the gentle slope by moderate footing moves the holy cup of temperance nymph of the crystal spring that dwells beneath thy altar and from thence warbling with gentle lapse joins the full stream that winding wild delays its silver course in the rich mead whose bank the peasant often approaches to allay his thirst and quaffs the simple beverage from the limpid fount bright virgin thee of all the powers who range the rural plain i woo with constant vow most ardent deign around my temples bind thy fragrant wreath and deck my purpled cheek with thy rich glow then undisturbed the mind musing pursues its holy meditation and rapt in trance can trace a thousand gifts showerd by the gracious hand of natures king to deck the various field the wondering eye roams over the fair creation then to heaven unbidden soars for the full soul impressed with holy transport there directs its view from whence its blessings flow and the rapt voice accordant hymns the grateful song of praise the rapid gusts of passion which or pride or folly or the thousand varying forms of courtly affectation ever raise here all subside and the composed breast expands with love and to its utmost power diffuses blessings to mankind nor fears ingratitude should check or pride should spurn the offered bounties of the generous heart blessed be the day and doubly blessed the hour when my fidele with unfeigned vow gave her fond hand and owned her constant love though since that hour already thrice the sun from every sign has seen our growing bliss and though thy smile of unaffected love adds joy to every joy and charms to ease the brow of care though thou art all that heaven could give in woman tenderness and truth and all my heart ever wished when warmest fancy formed the fond future view of household bliss yet happier still perhaps our lot had been had thou beneath the rural thatch received my faithful vow and we had never heard of town or city life a marian thou and rustic corin i then on the plain contented we had passed lifes little day while youth with sprightly beam illumd her hours they would move on with joy and when at noon firm manhood called us forth to till the soil and with our laboring hand direct the plough we would be ready nor refuse the task due tribute to the public till at eve our vigor lost when age came creeping on we would unyoke our heifers and retire to welcome ease our best skill then employed at our own home attentive there to thatch the chinks which time had made and to root up each foul weed that deformed our little plot this business over calm we should attend the approaching hour of our eternal rest and when it came borne to our peaceful grave by the plain villager what though no tomb of sculptured marble called the passing eye to read our story yet the cottage tear should on our ashes fall and the good heart overflow sincerely for a neighbor lost upon our bier the virgin troop would hang freshwoven chaplets of the sweetest flowers green turf should deck our grave and every year in springtime would some friendly hand with care bind the fresh briar around to guard the place from the rude insult of the careless step and faithful memory to late time record we were the happiest pair of human kind woodstock an elegy written in the year mdcclix ah me what is this mortal life i cried what changes crowd the page of flitting time what dire reverse of fate have numbers tried what youth what beauty withered in the prime inexorable destiny pursues and levels in the chase with rapid wing pity in vain or mirth or merit sues equally vain the beggar and the king ah what is fame the idol of the great no solid pleasure can she ever bestow if just to worth that justice comes too late prompt is her malice but her mercy slow thus on the winding isis willowed bank the varying scenes of fortune i deplore wasting in fruitless sighs the evening dank tears adding water to the rivers store a gloomy mansion open to the view disclosing horror heightened by the shade where round the nodding walls the mournful yew points to the vault where rosamond was laid where with her birds of night haggard and foul in sullen fellowship together dwell the bat ambiguous and illomend owl screaming to nighted swains a dreadful knell intent i gazed till terror ruling sight reared a pale spectre from the yawning tomb a faint delusion of the murky night begot and bred in fancys fruitful womb semblance of virgin elegance and grace the mimic shape in every part adorned but wan and languid seemed the beauteous face which elen envied and which henry mourned now gently gliding over the hallowed ground close by my side the phantom made a stand piercing the nightstilld air an awful sound and claimed attention with uplifted hand  i once was

shrouded from every eye my mouldering dust  that on the chisseld stone no verse might tell  my crime how great my punishment how just  but woodstocks blooming bowers still remain  the scenes to me of

heros guerdon and his soft retreat  yielding content in fields and senates lost  thy glories now are levelled low in earth  no longer beauty does thy bowers adorn  no more thy woods resound the voice of mirth  the laurel from thy victor brow is torn  but thou whose bosom foreign sorrow heaves  whose eyes can stream for anguish not thine own  whose heart the whiterobd fugitive receives  when forced by awful rigor from her throne  the scourge of vice the good mans destiny  the wreck of fortune and the waste of years  the miseries thou mournest thou shall see  sad consolation granted to thy tears now on the summit of a cloudbuilt height methought i stood and from an opening glade with faultering ray gleamd forth a magic light and round the plain in lambent circles played sudden the ground with inbred motion shook a solemn murmur rustled through the trees and on the pebbled shore the surging brook dashed angry waves unconscious of a breeze daedalian mystery from the parted soil a labyrinth rose to sounds of melting note a moments labor mocking all the toil of nations old and monarchs long forgot high overarchd in summers gayest weed meandering alleys form the wondrous maze and puzzle most when best they seem to lead the untaught foot that in their precincts strays deep in a vale impervious to all tread save by a flowerhid path a grotto stood and ancient oaks their foliage round it spread oershading with their tops the neighboring wood and nature sporting with a lavish hand this little spot in gay profusion graced with every wanton variation planned luxuriant fancy yielding but to taste here on the brink of a pellucid stream circling in eddies over its mossgrown bed where ever and anon a quivering beam piercing the covert on the surface played a beauty lay surpassing all the train of virgin delia or idalias queen or what of dryads poets sweetly feign on ida or thessalian oeta seen and by her side a form imperial lay with roses and with myrtle garlands crowned the withered laurel cast in scorn away the pomp of war in lydian measures drowned the little loves that fluttered on the boughs in grateful bondage did their limbs entwine and strove to join them closer than their vows with woodbine sweet and twisted eglantine but weak all bonds when those of beauty fail the monarch sated left the flowery bed nor grieved to see the maid his loss bewail nor mingled parting tears with those she shed now swift advancing to the guilty bower with frantic step the injured queen drew nigh and armed for vengeance seized the fatal hour when all things slept but rage and jealousy each eager hand a deadly weapon filled a pointed dagger and a poisoned bowl my ebbing blood her mad demeanor chilled and anguish unallayd possessed my soul ah stop inhuman with a faultering tongue and inarticulate voice as in a dream i cried and strait the rattling thunder rung and livid lightnings in the welkin gleam no more the mazy grove or bower appeared but all around a waste and barren plain the scattered trees of leaves and branches barred and blanched by srowning winds and beating rain and murder shrieking hideous wandered there and ruthless envy and relentless hate with snaky locks and shrivelled bosoms bare whilst lurking felons on their motions wait and soon the landscape shifting like a cloud to lessening distance bore the hellish crew now twang in fainter sounds their yellings loud now vanished quite a milder scene i view of checkered light and shade a sober dawn faint through a lingering vapor did disclose a hamlet seated on an open lawn and from each roof the pillard

beneath her scorn each youthful ardor dies its joys its wishes and its hopes expire in vain the fields of science tempt my eyes in vain for me the muses string the lyre o let her often my humble dwelling grace humble no more if there she deign to shine for heaven unlimited by time or place still waits on godlike worth and charms divine amid the cooling fragrance of the morn how sweet with her through lonely fields to stray her charms the loveliest landscape shall adorn and add new glories to the rising day with her all nature shines in heightened bloom the silver stream in sweeter music

hymn to fortitude by the same night brooding over her mute domain in aweful silence wraps her reign clouds press on clouds and as they rise condense to solid gloom the skies portentous through the foggy air to wake the demon of despair the raven hoarse and boding owl to hecate cursed anthems howl intent with execrable art to burn the veins and tear the heart the witch unhallowed bones to raise through funeral vaults and charnels strays calls the damned shade from every cell and adds new labors to their hell and shield me heaven what hollow sound like fates dread knell runs echoing round the bell strikes one that magic hour when rising fiends exert their power and now sure now some cause unblest breathes more than horror through my breast how deep the breeze how dim the light what specter

firmness steel my breast descend propitious to my lays and while my lyre resounds thy praise with energy divinely strong exalt my soul and warm my song when raving in eternal pains and loaded with ten thousand chains vice deep in phlegeton yet lay nor with her visage blasted day no fear to guiltless man was known for god and virtue reigned alone but when from native flames and night the cursed monster winged her flight pale fear among her hideous train chased sweet contentment from her reign placed death and hell before each eye and wrapped in mist the golden sky banished from day each dear delight and shook with conscious starts the night when from the imperial seats on high the lord of nature turned his eye to view the state of things below still blessed to make his creatures so from earth he saw astraea fly and seek her mansions in the sky peace crowned with olives left her throne and white robbed innocence was gone while vice revealed in open day sole tyrant ruled with iron sway and virtue veiled her weeping charms and fled for refuge to his arms her altars scorned her shrines defaced  whom thus the essential good addressed  thou whom my soul adores alone effulgent sharer of

with the entrapturd strains the valleys ring and the groves flourish in eternal spring eternal spring smiles in those green retreats  no more the monarchs still the muses seats where crowned with towers majestic windsor stands and the wide world beneath her feet commands not that her regal rampires boast the fame of each great edwards each great henrys name not that in days of highatchievd renown there britains genius fixed his aweful throne encircled with that glorious blaze that springs from conquered nations and from captive kings when each proud trophy moulders from the wall and even the imperial dome itself shall fall when those great names the warrior and the sage lie clouded in the dark historic page then shall the heavenborn muse to whom belong the more than mortalmaking

thy hallowed haunts partake thy love clear spring enameled vale or bowery grove o come and range with me the aspiring glades where leicester spreads the lawns and forms the shades on holkhams plains bid grecian structures rise and the tall column shoot into the skies beneath whose proud survey extended wide new scenes new beauties charm on every side here crowned with woods the shaded hills ascend in open light there the low vales extend here in rich harvests waves the ripened grain and there fresh verdure clothes the pasturd plain sweetly intermixed and lovely to behold as the green emerald enchasd in gold see where the limpid lake through pendant shades the hills between her liquid treasures leads and to the boughs that fringe her crisped sides holds the clear mirror of her crystal tides her crystal tides reflect the waving scene their silvery surface darkening into green as on the steep banks bending over the flood grotesque and wild up springs the oershadowing wood or

swells with an unforced ascent in just proportion rising on the sight the stately mansion lifts its towery height and glitters over the groves an oak beneath that calls the cool gales through its boughs to breathe where the sun darts his fervid rays in vain like the great patriarch on mamres plain the princely leicester sits the pageant pride of cumbrous greatness banished from his side in these blessed bowers he plans the great design with heightened charms bids modest nature shine shows us magnificence allied to use though rich yet chaste though splendid not profuse calls forth each beauty that from order springs from its loved greece each honored science brings over arts fair train extends his generous care and bids each polished grace inhabit here nor these alone here virtue loves to dwell no cold recluse selfcavernd in a cell active and warm she breathes a noble part glows in the breast and opens all the heart to generous deeds she fires the empassiond mind the substitute of heaven to bless mankind she through desponding miserys chearless gloom pours joy and gives neglected worth to bloom she in each bosom stills the rising sigh and wipes off every tear from every eye she to yon almshouse bosomed in the grove from toil and cares bids age and want remove there the tired eve of labored life to rest fed by her hand and by her bounty blessed these these are rays that round true greatness shine and thine bright clifford the full blaze is thine bring the green bay the fragraut myrtle bring the violet glowing in the lap of spring bid the sweet valleys send each honied flower each herb each leaf of aromatic power the muses hand shall their mixed odours spread and screw the ground where clifford deigns to tread in distant prospect sinking from the eye low

healths roseate glow more distant yet the thronged commercial town that makes the wealth of other worlds her own lifts her proud head and sees with every tide richfreighted navies crowd her harbored side or bids the parting vessel spread the sail loose to the wind and catch the rising gale whilst the vast ocean albions utmost bound rolls its broad wave a world of waters round in sweet astonishment the impatient mind bids her free powers expatiate unconfined from scene to scene in rapid progress flies glances from earth to seas from seas to skies delights to feel the great ideas roll swell on the sense and fill up all the soul not such the scene when over the unculturd wild no harvest rose no cheerful verdure smiled on the bare hill no tree was seen to spread the graceful foliage of its waving head no breathing hedgerow formed the broiderd bound nor hawthorn blossomed on the unsightly ground joy was not here no bird of finer note poured the thick warblings of his dulcet throat even hope was fled and over the chearless plain a waste of sand want held her unblessed reign lo leicester comes before his mastering hand flies the rude genius of the savage land the russet lawns a sudden verdure wear starts from the wondering fields the golden ear up rise the waving woods and haste to crown the hills bare brow and shade the sultry down the sheltered traveller sees with glad surprise over trackless wilds the extended rows arise and as their hospitable branches spread blesses the friendly hand that formed the shade joy blooms around and chears the peasants toil as smiling plenty decks the cultured soil the brightning scenes a kinder genius own and nature finishes what art begun but can the verse though philomela deign to breathe the sweet notes through the warbled strain though every muse and every grace should smile and raptures raise the honeysteeped style can the verse paint like nature can the power that wakes to life free fancys imagd store boast charms like here is or the creative hand in blended tints such beauteous scenes command though learned poussin gives each grace to flow and bright lorrains ethereal colors glow yet peerless is

laboring in thy patriot soul though europe from thy voice expect her fate and thy keen glance extend from pole to pole o chatham nursed in ancient virtues lore to these sad strains incline a favoring ear think on the god whom thou and i adore nor turn unpitying from the poor mans prayer ah me how blessed was once a peasants life no lawless passion swelled my even breast far from the stormy waves of civil strife sound were my slumbers and my heart at rest i never for guilty painful pleasures roved but taught by nature and by choice to wed from all the hamlet culled whom best i loved with her i staid my heart with her my bed to gild her worth i asked no wealthy power my toil could feed her and my arm defend in youth or age in pain or pleasures hour the same fond husband father brother friend and she the faithful partner of my care when ruddy evening streaked the western sky looked toward the uplands if her mate was there or through the beechwood cast an anxious eye then careful matron heaped the maple board with savoury herbs and picked the nicer part from such plain food as nature could afford ere simple nature was debauched by art while i contented with my homely cheer saw round my knees my prattling children play and often with pleased attention sat to hear the little history of their idle day but ah how changed the scene on the cold stones where wont at night to blaze the cheerful fire pale famine sits and counts her naked bones still sighs for food still pines with vain desire my faithful wife with everstreaming eyes hangs on my bosom her dejected head my helpless infants raise their feeble cries and from their father claim their daily bread dear tender pledges of my honest love on that bare bed behold your brother lie three tedious days with pinching want he strove the fourth i saw the helpless cherub die nor long shall ye remain with visage sour our tyrant lord commands us from our home and armed with cruel laws coercive power bids me and mine over barren mountains roam yet never chatham have i passed a day in riots orgies or in idle ease never have i sacrificed to sport and play or wished a pampered appetite to please hard was my fare and constant was my toil still with the mornings orient light i rose felled the stout oak or raised the lofty pile parched in the sun in dark december froze is it that nature with a niggard hand witholds her gifts from these once favored plains has god in vengeance to a guilty land sent dearth and famine to her laboring swains ah no yon hill where daily sweats my brow a thousand flocks a thousand herds adorn yon field where late i drove the painful plow feels all her acres crowned with wavy corn but what avails that over the furrowed soil in autumns heat the yellow harvests rise if artificial want elude my toil untasted plenty wound my craving eyes what profits that at distance i behold my wealthy neighbors fragrant smoke ascend if still the griping cormorants withold the fruits which rain and genial seasons send if those fell vipers of the public weal yet unrelenting on our bowels prey if still the curse of penury we feel and in the midst of plenty pine away in every port the vessel rides secure that wastes our harvest to a foreign shore while we the pangs of pressing want endure the sons of strangers riot on our store o generous chatham stop those fatal sails once more with outstrecthd arm thy britons save the unheeding crew but wait for favoring gales o stop them ere they stem italias wave from thee alone i hope for instant aid it is thou alone can save my childrens breath o deem not little of our cruel meed o haste to help us for delay is death so may nor spleen nor envy blast thy name nor voice profane thy patriot acts deride still may thou stand the first in honest fame unstung by folly vanity or pride so may thy languid limbs with strength be braced and glowing health support thy active soul with fair renown thy public virtue graced far as thou badst britannias thunder roll then joy to thee and to thy children peace the grateful hind shall drink from plentys horn and while they share the cultured lands increase the poor shall bless the day when pit was born five pastoral the scenes of these eclogues are supposed to lie among the shepherds oppressed by the war in germany eclogues eclogue i lycas and alphon alphon arise my lycas in yon woody wilds from a rough rock in deep enclosure hid of thickest oaks a gushing fountain falls and pours its airy stream with torrent pure which late returning from the field at eve i found invited by its dashing sound as through the gloom it struck my passing ear thither i mean to drive our languid flocks fit place to cool their thirst in midday hour due west it rises from that blasted beech the way but short  come lycas rouse thy dog let us be gone  lycas alas my friend of flock of spring or shepherds lore to me is vain to tell my favorite lamb the solace dear of these gray locks my sweet and sole delight is snatched by cruel fate an armed band on neighing steeds elate in wide array trampled the youngling as the vale along at eve they passed beneath their whelming march  alphon such throng i heard as in the neighboring wood i wandered to reduce a straggling ewe escaped the fold what time the griesly owl her shrieks began and at the wonted elm the cows awaiting stood lucillas hand when strait with sudden fear alarmed i start and listening to the distantechoing steps of unseen horsemen with attentive ear i stand aloof but why this deepfelt grief merits such loss these tears and black despair  lycas alphon no more to lycas now remains since he my last and latest care is lost thou know my little flock three tender ewes were all my mean ambition wished or sought even now nine days and nine revolving nights are past since these the moldaws raging flood swept with their wattled cotes as over its banks it rose redundant swollen with beating rains and deep immersed beneath its whirling wave i waked at early dawn and to the field i issued to pursue my wonted toil when lo nor flocks nor wattled cotes i saw but all that met my wondering eyes around was desolation sad here stateliest oaks torn from their roots with broken branches lay in hideous ruin there the fields that laughed with ripening corn of all their charms despoiled with oozy fragments scattered waste and wild were seen i cursed the wicked spirit drear that in the ruined abbeys darkest cell that stands immured amid yon lonesome piles i bound with triple chains his magic power ofttimes with howling storms and thunder loud deforms the night and blackens natures face his tempests swelled the moldaws rising streams and thus overwhelmed my flock  but this my heart had learned to bear at length to comforts voice it had obeyed and all its woes forgot when ah too soon returning woes invade my breast just rising from its former stroke when this the sole survivor of my flock follows his lost companions while a wretch i here remain deserted and forlorn he too had died beneath the whelming surge had not the shelter of my lowroofd cott that fatal night preserved him where at eve i haply placed him with providing care lest the fell storm which yet from southern clouds threatened destruction and to lour began might violate his tenderblooming age  alphon with piteous eye and sympathizing heart thy tears i view  these scenes of war and blood the calm repose of every field invade myself had fallen a victim to their rage as in deep dead of night my cave beneath i lay dissolved in sleep with warning voice had not my dog alarmed with wondering ear when straight approached the cave a savage throng with barbarous arms and habit fierce and wild with stern demeanor and defying look terrify which the moons paleglimmering rays presented to my sight as in the boughs close shrouded of a neighboring pine i sat where sudden fear had driven me to evade impending fate unconscious and amazed secure but trembling and in chilly damps my limbs bedewed  the monsters as they past with dire confusion all the cavern filled hurled to the ground my scrip and beechen cup dispersed the shaggy skins that form my bed and over the trampled floor had scattered wide a hoard of choicest chestnuts which i culled with nicediscerning care and had designed a present to my beauteous rosalind alas with them her love had been obtained and me to myron she had then preferred  lycon shepherd on thee has fortune kindly smiled it is mine to feel her griefinflicting hand alas each object that i view around recalls my perished darling to my sight and mocks me with his loss see there the spring where often he wont to slake his eager thirst and there the beech beneath whose breezy shade he loved to lie close covert from the sun see yet the bark smoothworn and bare remains where often the youngling rubbed his tender side ah what availed my care and foresight vain that day he fell oppressed by whelming steeds this hand had built a bower of thickest boughs composed and wove with intermingling leaves impervious to the sun and strewn the floor with choicest hay that in the secret shade he might repose nor feel the dogstars beam but why this sad repeated track of woe i still pursue farewell my alphon dear to distant fields and pastures will i go where impious war and discord nurse of blood shall never profane the silence of the groves  eclogue ii acis and alcyon acis while in the bosom of this deep recess the voice of war has lost its madding shouts let us improve the transient hour of peace and calm our troubled minds with mutual songs while this recess conspiring with the muse invites to peaceful thoughts this cavern deep and these tall pines that nodding from the rock wave over its mouth their umbrage black and cast a venerable gloom with this clear fount that cleaves the riven stone and fills the cave with hollowtinkling sounds repeat the song which late alcyon from thy mouth i heard as to the spring we drove our thirsting slocks it tells the charms of grateful evening mild begin alcyon acis in return shall sing the praises of the dawning morn  alcyon behind the hills when sinks the western sun and falling dews breathe fragrance through the air refreshing every field with coolness mild then let me walk the twilight meadows green or breezy uplands near thickbranching elms while the still landscape sooths my soul to rest and every care subsides to calmest peace the mists slowrising from the rivers dank the woods scarce stirring at the whispering wind the streaky clouds that tinge their darkened tops with russet hues and fainter gleams of light the solitude that all around becalms the peaceful air conspire to wrap my soul in musings mild and naught the solemn scene and the still silence breaks but distant sounds of bleating flocks that to their destined fold the shepherd drives meantime the shrilltund bell of some lone ewe that wanders from the rest tinkles far off with solitary sound the lowing cows that wait the milkers hand the cottagemastiffs bark the joyous shouts of swains that meet to wrestle on the green are heard around but ah since ruthless war has ravaged in these fields so tranquil once too often alas the din of clashing arms and discord fell disturbs the softer scene thy sweet approach delights the wearied ox while in loose traces from the furrowed field he comes thy dawn the weary reaper loves who long had sainted in the midday sun pleased with the cooler hour along the vale whistling he home returns to kiss his babes with joyful heart his labors sweet reward but ah what sudden fears amaze his soul when near approaching all before he sees his lowly cottage and the village round swept into ruin by the hand of war dispersed his children and his muchloved wife no more to glad his breast with home feltjoys i too when in my wattled cotes are laid my supping flock rejoice to meet my dear my fair lauretta at the wonted oak or happily as her mikingpail she bears returning from the field to ease her arm sweet office and impart my aiding hand thy charms o beauteous evening shall be sung as long as these tall pines shall wave their heads or this clear fountain cleave the riven stone  acis sweet are the dews of eve her fragrance sweet sweet are the pinetopt hills at sultry noon sweet is the shelter of the friendly grot to sheep and shepherd at impending storms but ah less sweet the fragrant dews of eve less sweet the pinetopt hills at sultry noon less sweet the shelter of the friendly

of early birds on every bush the steaming odours of the freshblown flowers   alcyon cease acis cease thy song  from yonder hill whose lofty sides enclose this secret seat our flocks that graze along its verdurous brow tumultuous rush as struck with sudden fright and hark methinks i hear the deathful sounds of war approaching and its thunders roar  acis kind heaven preserve my wife and children dear alas i fear the sound that louder now swells in the wind and comes with fuller din is near my cottage which thou know my friend stands at the spring that issues from beneath that rising hill fast by the branching elm  alcyon see see my friend what darksome spires arise of wreathing smoke and blacken all the sky  nearer and nearer comes the threatening voice and more distinguished strikes our trembling ear but lo the foes advance above the hill i see their glittering arms begin to gleam come let us sly and in the deepest nook the inmost cavern of this winding grott close shroud ourselves

the bosom deep of a wild wood with solitary steps there to lament his wretched fate he sought him late as over the vale at coming eve joyful he walked with his lucilla dear a soldier stern advancing on his steed robbed of his love and toe the beauteous maid with brutal hand from his contending arms weeping in vain and shricking for his aid and frowning bore the precious prize away the wood whose shades the plaintive shepherd sought was dark and pathless and by neighboring seet long time untrod for there in ancient days two knights of bold emprise and high renown met in sierce combat to dspute the prize of beauty bright whose valiant arm should win a virgin fair whose fairemblazond charms with equal love had smote their rival breasts the knight who fell beneath the victors sword unhearsd and restless from that fatal day wanders the hated shades a spectre pale and each revolving night are heard to sound far from the inmost bower of the deep wood loud shrieks and hollow groans and rattling chains when the dark secrets of the grove he gained beneath an ancient oak his weary limbs he laid adown and thus to plain began this midnight deep to plaintive love accords this lonesome silence and these hideous shades that in this darksome hour i dare to tread and all the horrors of this fearful place will suit a wretch abandoned to despair  but ah  what means this sudden fear that creeps in chilly sweats over all my trembling limbs  what hollow whispering sounds are those i hear from yonder glade  do not i hear his voice does not the knight that in these shades was slain call me to come and beckon with his hand do not i see his visionary sword waved in bright circles through the murky air  does not he point his wounds  be still my sears it is vain illusion all and fantasy these sears my lovedistemperd brain suggests alas they will not bring me back my love  who now perhaps amid the thronging camp on earths cold breast reclines her weary head a helpless virgin subject to the will of each rude ravisher and distant far from her dear alcon and her native fields  ill will the hardships of inclement skies suit with her tender limbs the various toils of painful marches her unwonted ears how bear the trumpet and the sounds of war this task is hard indeed  but soon alas at will her savage lord may cast her off and leave her to succeeding scenes of woe i see my dear lucilla once my own naked and hungry tread the pensive steps of desolation doomed to wander over helpless and vagabond the friendless earth i hear her sigh for alcon and her home and ask for bread at some proud palacegate with unavailing voice this toilsome scene alas how different from the smoother paths of rural life my dear was wont to tread forth to the field to bear the milkingpail was all her wont to tread the tedded grass to tend her fathers flock beneath the oak to snatch her dinner sweet and on the green with the companions of her age to sport in vain i now expect the coming on of dewbathd eve to meet my wonted love no more i hear the woodgirt valleys ring with her blythe voice that often has blessed mine ear as in the distant shade i sat unseen no more i meet her at the wonted spring where each revolving noon she daily went to fill her pitcher with the crystal flood  if in her native fields the hand of death had snatched her from my arms i could have born the fatal shoek with less repining heart for then i could have had one parting kiss i could have strewn her hearse with fairest flowers and paid the last sad office to my dear  return my sweet lucilla to my arms at thy return all nature will rejoice together will we walk the verdant vales and mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet come i will climb for thee the knotted oak to rob the stockdove of his feathery young i will show thee where the softest cowslips spring and clustering nuts their laden branches bend together will we taste the dews of morn together seek the grotts at sultry noon together from the field at eve return  what have i said what painted scenes of bliss my vain imagination has displayed alas she is gone ah never to return farewell my pasteral pipe and my dear flock farewell my faithful dog my oncelovd haunts farewell or cave or fountain or fresh shade farewell and thou my low ord cott farewell  here will i lie and fellest wolves that roam this savage forest shall devour my limbs unwept unburied in a place unknown eclogue iv mycon and philanthes mycon welcome philanthes to thy native fields thrice three revolving moons are gone and past since first you parted from your fathers cott to drive to pastures far remote your flock since that alas how often has savage war disturbed our dwellings and defaced our fields  philanthes mycon each object that i view around speaks ruin and destruction see my friend the ancient wood whose venerable shades so often have sheltered us from noonday suns so often have echoed to the lowing herds that fed widewandering in the neighboring vales the soldiers ax has levelled with the ground and to the sun exposed its darksome bowers the distant villages and bluetopt hills the farstretchd meads appear and meet mine eyes that erst were intercepted by the grove  mycon how is the wonted face of all things changed those trees by whose aspiring tops we knew the suns ascent at noon unerring mark no more are seen to tell the coming hour how naked does the winding rill appear whose banks its pendant umbrage deepimbrownd and farinvested with its arborous roof as by its side it rolled its secret streams how often alas those shadowy banks along close solitude my rosalind and i have walked in converse sweet and linked in love but tell me dear philanthes are the fields which late you left like ours by war oppressed alike in tumult and confusion wrapped  philanthes mycon i will tell thee wonders past belief it happd one morn when first the dawning sun began to cheer the lightenlivend earth caught with so bright a scene i sought the fields before my wonted hour and roving wide among the vales the villages and woods wherever my fancy led or pleasure called i chanced upon a neighboring hill to stray to view the glittering prospect from its top of the broad rhine that rolled his waves beneath amid the level of extended meads when it m be supposed that in these lines the shepherd is giving an account of prince charless passing the rhine lo ere yet i gained its lofty brow the sound of dashing floods and dashing arms and neighing steeds confusive struck mine ear studious to know what tumult was at hand with step adventurous i advanced and gained with timorous care and cautious ken its top sudden a burst of brightness smote my sight from arms and all the imblazonrie of war reflected far while steeds and men and arms seemed floating wide and stretched in vast array over the broad bosom of the bigswoln flood that dashing rolled its beamy waves between the banks promiscuous md with thronging troops these on the flood embarking those appeared crowding the adverse shore already past all was confusion all tumultuous  i trembled as i looked though far above and in one blaze their arms were blended bright with the broad stream while all the glistening scene the morn illumd and in one splendour clad struck at the sight i lest with headlong haste the steepbrowd hill and over the extended vales the woodgirt lawns i ran nor slackd my pace till at my flock thickpanting i arrived and drove far off beneath a deeparchd cave but come my friend inform me in return since this my absence what has here fell out  mycon do thou remember at the river side that solitary convent all behind hid by the covert of a mantling wood  one night when all was wrapped in darkness deep an armed troop on rage and rapine bent poured over the fields and ravaged all they met nor did that sacred pile escape their arms whose walls the murderous band to ruin swept and filled its caverns deep with armed throngs greedy of spoil and snatched their treasures old from their dark seats the shrieking sisters fled dispersed and naked through the fields and woods while sable night concealed their wandering steps part in my moss grown cottage shelter sought which happily escaped their rage in secret glade immersed deep  i rose at early morn with fearful heart to view the ruined dome where all was desolation all appeared the seat of horror and devouring war the deep recesses and the gloomy nooks the vaulted isles and shrines of imagd saints the caverns worn by holy knees appeared and to the sun were opened  in musing thought i said as on the pile i bent my brow   this seat to future ages will appear  like that which stands fast by the piny rock  these silent walls with ivy shall be hung  and distant times shall view the sacred pile  unknowing how it fell with pious awe  the pilgrim here shall visit and the swain  returning from the field at twilight gray  shall shun to pass this way subdued by fear  and slant his course across the adverse vale  philanthes mycon thou see that cow which stands in cool amid yon rushy lake beneath the shade of willow green and ruminates at ease the watery herbage that around her floats that way my business leads i go to greet my father and my wonted cottage dear  mycon come let us go my path is that way too come my philanthes and may piteous heaven indulge more happy days and calm our griefs alas i thought some trouble was at hand and long before presaged the coming storm even when the lightning one disastrous night blasted the hoary oak whose ample boughs imbower my cottage and as on the grass at noon i slept a serpents sudden hiss broke my sweet rest  but come let us be gone the sun begins to welk in ruddy west  eclogue v corin and

i chanced at earlier hour to rise and drove faroff my flock unpent to wash them in a spring that late i marked there the first motions of the deathful day i heard as listening to the trickling wave i stood attentive when like rising storms hoarse hollow murmurs from asar i heard and undistinguished sounds of distant din alarmed i stood unknowing whence it came and from the fount my flock unwashd i drove suspecting danger when as nearer yet i came advancing all was tumult loud all was tempestuous din on every side and all around the roar of war was up from rock to rock retost from wood to wood not half so loud the tumbling cataract is heard to roar that from the pineclad cliff precipitates its waves whose distant sounds i often have listened as at twilight gray i pent my flocks within their wattled cotes  corin for three revolving days nor voice of bird melodious chaunting or the bleat of sheep or lowing oxen near the fatal place were heard to sound but all was silence sad the ancient grove of elms deserted stood where long had dwelt an aged race of rooks that with their nests had crowded every branch we often have heard them at the dusk of eve in troops returning to their well known home in mingled clamours sounding from on high  calistan corin thou know the firinvested cave where late we sheltered from a gathering storm our flocks together driven beneath its shade i had appointed at sweet eventide to meet my delia homeward as she passed bearing her milkingpail alas the thoughts of that sweet congress the preceding night softened my dreams and all my senses lulled and with more joyful heart at morn i rose but ah that tumult cropped my blooming hopes and in confusion wrapped my love and me  corin that day nor in the fold my flock i pent or walked at eve the vales or on the turf beneath the wonted oak my dinner took or slept at noon amid my languid sheep reposed at ease on the green meadows bed when sable night came on for not even yet the tumult had subsided into peace even then low sounds and interrupted bursts of war we heard and cries of dying men and a confused hum of the ceasing storm all night closeshrouded in a forest thick wakeful i sat my flock around me laid and of neglected boughs i kindled up a scanty flame whose darklygleaming blaze among the enlightened trees formed hideous shapes and specter pale to my distempered mind how often i looked behind with cautious fear and trembled at each motion of the wind  but where did you calistan shelter seek what dark retreat concealed your wandering steps  calistan corin thou know the furclad hermits cell deeparchd beneath a rock among the wilds thither i bent my flight a welcome guest and not unknown for when my flock i fed of late beneath the neighboring pastures green i often was wont invited at his call at noon beneath his cavern to retire from the suns heat where all the passing hours the good old man improved with converse high and in my breast enkindled virtues love nor seldom would his hospitable hand afford a short repast of berries cool which over the wilds his scanty food he plucked here was my refuge  all the livelong night pensive by one pale lonesome lamp we sat and listened to the bleak winds whistling loud and the shrill crash of forests from without soon as the morning dawned the craggy height of the steep rock i climbed on whose wild top his rustic temple stood and mossgrown cross the sacred object of his pious prayers formed of a tall firs thunderblasted trunk where all beneath the expansive plains i saw with white pavilions hid in deep array there too my little fold which late i left standing at eve amid the warlike scene with tearful eyes affrighted i beheld alas how changed the scene when there i pitched those hurdled cotes the night was calm and mild and all was peaceful i remember well while there within that fold my flock i pent how blythe i heard my beauteous delia sing her distant echoing voice how sweetly rung and all my ravished senses wrapped in bliss  corin have thou not seen the fatal plain of death where raged the conflict there they say at eve grim ghosts are seen of men that there were slain pointing their wounds and

venerable moss arrayed that over yon caverns stretch your pendent shade where sacred silence lulls the rural vale and love in whispers tells his tender tale ye lonely rocks ye streams that ever flow

his blushing maid when his soft lips too eloquent his art poured the warm wish and breathed out all his heart ah once loved seats your pleasing scenes are over nor you can charm since he can love no more though smile your lawns with vernal glories crowned in vain gay nature paints the enameled ground while through your solitary paths i rove a prey to grief to sickness and to love though gentle

languish every sense ye have no sweets for fallen innocence torn by remorse sad victim of despair where shall i turn or where address my prayer far as the morn its early beam displays or where the star of evening darts its rays far as wide earth is stretched or oceans roll where blow the winds or heaven invests the pole in vain my fluttering soul would wing its way stern care pursues wherever the wretched stray sost god of sleep whose everpeaceful reign lulls earth and heaven and all the extended main powerful to give the laboring heart to rest to wipe the tear and heal the wounded breast say by what crime offended slies from me invoked thy unpropitious deity or dooms on racks of wildest fancy torn in dreams my agonizing soul to mourn why am i often on angry billows tossed now in some wide and dreary desert lost why yet in life infernal tortures feel bound by fierce demons to some rapid wheel now seem to climb while hills on hills arife in vain or fall in tempests from the skies tread burning plains or swim in seas of fire just reach the shore then see the shore retire as often dear youth thy pleasing form appears i stretch my arms and wake dissolved in tears yet waking fancy all that loss supplies and still i view thee with a lovers eyes entranced in thought over all thy charms i gaze see thy bright eyes diffuse their softest rays hang on thy hand and on thy breast reclined play with thy locks that waver with the wind joy in thy joy or in thy sorrows join and on thy lips my spirit mix with thine now over dark wilds or rugged rocks we stray love lights the gloom and smooths the dreary way now on soft banks our weary limbs repose where every flower of vernal beauty glows but light as air each pleasing vision flew swift as the fun dispels the morning dew while with the day returns the sense of woe we wake more wretched when the cheat we know imagination mistress of the soul what powers unseen the active mind control and fill the waking thought or busy sleep when not a breeze disturbs the tranquil deep nor lofty pines through all the forest move why stir the motions of resistless love urged by the golden morn the night recedes and year to year in

renew o boast of lauras longforgotten praise past are the triumphs of my happier days when placed supreme on beautys radiant throne i saw with conscious pride each heart my own wherever i turned a thousand nymphs admired whenever i smiled a thousand swains expired i spoke twas music dwelt upon my tongue i moved a goddess and an angel sung my careless steps in joys were taught to rove each voice was flattery and each look was love but beautys power too mighty long to last fled on the wings of rapid time is past as some proud vessel to the prosperous gale her streamer waves and spreads the silken sail while silver oars to flutes soft breathing sweep with measured strokes the scarcely heaving deep but soon tempestuous clouds the scene deform and the loud surge remurmurs to the storm thus big with hope from dark suspicion free i sailed with transport on lifes summer sea the gay attendants of my happy state the smiles the graces round were seen to wait and all the moments as they swiftly flew showerd down soft joys and pleasures ever new how changed this fleeting image of a day how sets in awful gloom the evening ray while fixed on earth her eye in sad suspense pours the deep sigh incessant penitence if youthful charms decay with age or pain beauty thy crowded worshippers how vain why then such crowds of incense round ascend why prostrate monarchs at thy altars bend why earths and oceans mighty bounds explore at once to win thee and increase thy power let sad example reasons dictates aid here see what ruin grief and love have made even love who lives by beautys smiles carest basks in her eyes and wantons on her breast with cruel force the fatal shaft employs and soonest what he most adores destroys how cold i feel lifes idle current flow where once the dancing spirits loved to glow no more these eyes with youthful rapture shine nor cheeks soft blushing speak a warmth divine graceful no more amid the festive dance my steps with easy dignity advance and all the glossy locks whose ringlets spread over my fair neck the honors of my head cease the neat labors of my hand to know ill suits the care of elegance with woe why did not nature when she gave to charm with unrelenting pride my bosom arm why was my soul its tender pity taught each soft affection and each generous thought hence spring my sorrows hence with sighs i prove how feeble woman and how fierce is love in unavailing streams my tears are shed sad lauras bliss is with lorenzo fled for thee false youth was every joy resigned young health sweet peace and innocence of mind are these the constant vows thy tongue professed when first thy arms my yielding beauties pressed thus did thy kiss dispel my empty fears or winning voice delight my raptured ears thus swore thy lips by ocean earth and sky by hells dread powers and heavens allpiercing eye yawns not the grave for thee why sleeps the storm to blast thy limbs and rend thy perjured form unmoved o faithless can thou hear my pain like the proud rocks which brave the unwearied main sooner the shipwreckd pilot shall appease with sighs the howling winds with tears the seas than lauras prayers thy heart unfeeling move o lost to fame to honor and to love nursed in dark caverns on some mountain wild to cruel manhood grew the daring child no female breast supplied thy infant food but tigers growling over their savage brood cursed be that fatal hour thy charms were seen while yet this mind was guiltless and serene with thee false man i urged my hasty flight and dared the horrors of tempestuous night nor feared with thee through plains unknown to rove deaf to the dictates of paternal love in vain for me a parents tears were shed and to the grave descends his hoary head when at my feet entranced my lover lay and poured in tender sighs his soul away fond foolish heart to think the tale divine why started not my hands when pressed in thine too well remembrance paints the fatal hour when love great conqueror summoned all his power when bolder grown your glances flashed with fire and your pale lips all trembled with desire back to my heart my blood tumultuous flew from every pore distilled the chilling dew when shame presaging spoke each future pain and struggling virtue armed my soul in vain but o let silence all my weakness veil and burning blushes only tell the tale ah faithless man and thou more wretched maid to guilt and grief and misery betrayed far flies thy lover to some distant plain now cleaves his bounding bark the peaceful main avenging heaven that heard the vows he swore bid howl the blackening storm and thunder roar till waves on waves in tumbling mountains roll now sink to hell and now ascend the pole then on some plank over foaming billows borne trembling his perjured faith the wretch shall mourn but mourn in vain his vigorous arm shall fail guilt sink him down and angry heaven prevail no friendly hand to earth his limbs convey but dogs and vultures tear the bloated prey yet ah fond heart avert kind heaven the stroke my heart denies what trembling lips have spoke the varying accents real nature prove and only show how wild a thing is love go much loved youth with every blessing crowned and lauras wishes ever guard thee round me to the silent shades and sad retreat where loves expiring flames forget their heat death wooes allpowerful ere he parts the clew once more thy laura bids her love adieu bids health and affluence every bliss afford bids thee be loved be happy and adored in ease in mirth glide each glad hour away no pain to spot thy fortunes cloudless day nor sigh to swell no tear to flow for me o grant heaven all but grant thee constancy yet from my hand this last address receive this last address is all that hand can give in vain thy bark with spreading canvas flies if these sad lines shall meet thy conscious eyes and taught with winning eloquence to move the winds and waters waft the voice of love that voice o grant what dying lips implore

every flower on every hill in every vale had drank its fill of sunshine and of dews in short twas that sweet seasons prime when spring gives up the reins of time to summers glowing hand and doubting mortals hardly know by whose command the breezes blow which fan the smiling land twas then beside a greenwood shade which clothed a lawns aspiring head i urged my devious way with loitering steps regardless where so soft so genial was the air so wondrous bright the day and now my eyes with transport rove over all the blue expanse above unbroken by a cloud and now beneath delighted pass where winding through the deepgreen grass a fullbrimd river flowed i stop i gaze in accents rude to thee serenest solitude burst forth the unbidden lay  begone vile world the learned the wise the great the

voice i hear twas reason whispered in my ear these monitory strains what mean thou man would thou unbind the ties which constitute thy kind the pleasures and the pains the same almighty power unseen who spreads the gay or solemn scene to contemplations eye fixed every movement of the soul taught every wish its destined goal and quickened every joy he bids the tyrant passions rage he bids them war eternal wage and combat each his foe till from dissensions concords rise and beauties from deformities and happiness from woe art thou not man and dare thou find a bliss which leans not to mankind
