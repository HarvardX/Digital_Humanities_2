mr john caryll john caryll esquire was probably a sussex man and wrote two plays the english princess or the death of richard iii      quarto and sir solomon or the cautious coxcomb      quarto it may be conjectured that he was of the roman catholic persuasion being secretary to queen mary the wife of james the second and one who followed the fortunes of his abdicating master how long he continued in this service is unknown but he was in england in the reign of queen anne and recommended the subject of mr popes rape of the lock to that author who on its publication addressed it to him he was alive in      and at that time must have been a very old man see three of his letters in additions to pope vol ii p     r  meliboeus in peaceful shades which aged oaks diffuse you tityrus enjoy your royal muse we leave our home and once our pleasant fields the native swain to rude intruders yields while you in songs your happy love proclaim and every grove learns amaryllis name the reader may be pleased to observe that virgil under the name of tityrus personates himself newly saved by the favor of augustus caesar from the general calamity of his mantuan neighbors whose lands were taken from them and divided amongst the veteran soldiers for having been dipped as may be presumed in the same guilt with their borderers of cremoa who in the civil wars joined with cassius and brutus these mantuans are likewise personated by meliboeus as also by amaryllis the city of rome by galatea that of mantua are represented the drift of this elogue is to celebrate the munificence of augustus toward virgil whom he makes his tutelar god and the better to set this off he brings in meliboeus  his mantuan neighbors pathetically relating their own deplorable condition and at the same time magnifying the felicity of tityrus this his exemption from the common calamity of his countrymen virgil shadows over with the allegory of a slave recovering his liberty and because slaves did not commonly use to be infranchised till age had made them useless for labor to follow the trope he makes himself an old man as by the candidior barba and the fortunate senex sufficiently appears though in reality virgil at that time was young and then first made known to augustus by the recommendation of his verses and of his friends varus and maecenas caryll   tityrus a god to me he always shall be so o meliboeus did this grace bestow the choicest lamb which in my flock does feed shall each new moon upon his altar bleed he every blessing on his creatures brings by him the herd does graze by him the herdsman sings  meliboeus i envy not but i admire your fate which thus exempts you from our wretched state look on my goats that browze my kids that play driven hence myself these i must drive away and this poor mother of a newfalln pair the herds chief hope alas but my despair has left them in yon brakes beside the way exposed to every beast and bird of prey had not some angry planet struck me blind this dire calamity i had divined twas often foretold me by heavens loudest voice rending our tallest oaks with dismal noise ravens spoke too though in a lower tone and long from hollow trees were heard to groan but say what god has tityrus relieved  tityrus the place called rome i foolishly believed was like our mantua where on marketdays we drive our wellfed lambs the shepherds praise so whelps i knew so kids their dams express and so the great i measured by the less but other towns when you to her compare they creeping shrubs to the tall cypress are  meliboeus what great occasion called you hence to rome  tityrus freedom which came at last though slow to come she came not till cold winter did begin and age some snow had sprinkled on my chin nor then till galatea i forsook for amaryllis deigned on me to look no hope for liberty i must confess no hope nor care of wealth did me possess whilst i with galatea did remain for though my flock her altars did maintain though often i had made my cheesepress groan largely to furnish our ungrateful town yet still with empty hands i trotted home  meliboeus i wondered galatea whence should come thy sad complaints to heaven and why so long ungatherd on their trees thy apples hung absent was tityrus thee every dale mountain and spring thee every tree did call  tityrus what should i do i could not here be free and only in that place could hope to see a god propitious to my liberty there i the heavenly youth did first behold whose monthly feast while solemnly i hold my loaded altars never shall be cold he heard my prayers go home he cried and feed in peace your herd let forth your bulls for breed  meliboeus happy old man thy farm untouched remains and large enough though it may ask thy pains to clear the stones and rushes cure by drains thy teeming ewes will no strange pastures try no murrain fear from tainted company thrice happy swain guarded from syrian beams by sacred springs and longacquainted streams look on that bordering fence whose osier trees are fraught with flowers whose flowers are fraught with bees how with their drowsy tone the whistling air your sleep to tempt a concert does prepare at farther distance but with stronger lungs the woodman joins with these his rustic songs stockdoves and murmuring turtles tune their throat those in a hoarser these a softer note  tityrus therefore the land and sea shall dwellers change fish on dry ground stags shall on water range the parthians shall commute their bounds with francs those shall on soane these drink on tygris banks ere i his godlike image from my heart suffer with black ingratitude to part  meliboeus but we must roam to parts remote unknown under the torrid and the frigid zone these frozen scythia and parched africa those cretan oaxis others must enclose some amongst the utmost britains are confined doomed to an isle from all the world disjoined ah must i never more my country see but in strange lands an endless exile be is my eternal banishment decreed from my poor cottage reared with turf and reed must impious soldiers all these grounds possess my fields of standing corn my fertile leyes did i for these barbarians plow and sow what dire effects from civil discord flow graft pears o meliboeus plant the vine the fruit shall others be the labor thine farewell my goats a happy herd when mine no more shall i in the refreshing shade of verdant grottoes by kind nature made behold you climbing on the mountain top the flowery thyme and fragrant shrubs to crop i part with every joy parting from you then farewell all the world verses and pipe adieu  tityrus at least this night with me forget your care chestnuts and wellprest cheese shall be your fare for now the mountain a long shade extends and curling smoke from village tops ascends  eclogue ii by mr nahum tate born about the middle of the reign of king charles ii in the kingdom of ireland where he received his education he was made poet laureat to king william upon the death of shadwell and held that place till the accession of george i on whom he lived to write the first birthday ode which is executed with unusual spirit he was a man of goodnature great probity and competent learning but so extremely modest that he was never able to make his fortune or to raise himself above necessity the earl of dorset was his patron but the chief use he made of him was to screen himself from the persecution of his creditors he died in the mint august         and was succeeded in the laurel by mr eusden he was the author of nine dramatic performances a great number of poems and of a version of the psalms in conjunction with dr nicholas brady he was a man of wit and parts yet not thought to possess any very great genius as being deficient in what is its first characteristic namely invention thus far the biographical dictionary  his miscellaneous poems are enumerated by jacob who says tates poem on the death of queen anne which was one of the last is one of the best poems he ever wrote his share in the second part of absalom and achitophel is far from inconsiderable and may be seen in the english poets vol xiii p   0 he published also memorials for the learned collected out of eminent authors in history etc       vo and his proposal for regulating of the stage and stage plays feb   school is among bishop gibsons mss in the lambeth library n  a hopeless flame did corydon destroy the loved alexis was his masters joy no respite from his grief the shepherd knew but daily walked where shady beeches grew where stretched on earth alone he thus complains and in these accents tells the groves his pains cruel alexis have thou no remorse must i expire and have my songs no force it is now high noon when herds to coverts run the very lizards hide that love the sun the reapers home to dinner now repair while busy thestylis provides both sauce and fare yet in the raging heat i search for thee heat only known to locusts and to me oh was it not much better to sustain the angry days of amaryllis reign and still be subject to menalcas sway though he more black than night and thou more fair than day o lovely boy presume not on thy form the fairest flowers are subject to a storm thou both disdainst my person and my flame without so much as asking who i am how rich in hefers all as white as snow or cream with which they make my dairies flow a thousand ewes within my pastures breed and all the year upon new milk i feed besides the famed amphions songs i sing that into theban walls the stones did bring nor am i so deformed for the other day when all the dreadful storm was blown away as on the cliffs above the sea i stood i viewed my image in the seagreen flood and if i look as handsome all the year to vie with daphnis self i would not fear ah would thou once in cottages delight and love like me to wound the stag in flight where wholesome mallows grow our kids to drive and in our songs with pan himself to strive from pan the reeds first use the shepherd knew it is pan preserves the sheep and shepherd too disdain not then the tuneful reed to ply nor scorn the pastime of a deity what task would not amyntas undergo for half the noble skill i offer you a pipe with quills of various size i have the legacy damaetas dying gave and said possess thou this by right it is thine amntas then stood by and did repine besides two kids that i from danger bore with streaks of lovely white enameled over who drain the bagging udder twice a day and both at home for thy acceptance stay often thestylis for them has pined and she shall have them since thou scornst my gifts and me come to my arms thou lovely boy and take the richest presents that the spring can make see how the nymphs with lilies wait on thee fair nais scarce thyself so fair as she with poppies daffadils and violets joined a garland for thy softer brow has twined myself with downy peaches will appear and chestnuts amaryllis dainty cheer i will crop my laurel and my myrtle tree together bound because their sweets agree unbred thou art and homely corydon nor will alexis with thy gifts be won nor can thou hope if gifts his mind could sway that rich iolas would to thee give way ah me while i fond wretch indulge my dreams winds blast my flowers and boars bemire my streams whom flyst thou gods themselves have had abode in woods and paris equal to a god let pallas in the towns she built reside to me a groves worth all the world beside lions chase wolves those wolves a kid in prime that very kid seeks heaths of flowering thyme while corydon pursues with equal flame alexis thee each has his several game see how the ox unyokd brings home the plough the shades increasing as the sun goes low blessed fields relieved by nights approach so soon love has no night it is always raging noon ah corydon what frenzy fills thy breast thy vineyard lies half pruned and half undrest luxurious sprouts shut out the ripening ray the branches shorn not yet removed away recall thy senses and to work with speed of many utensils thou standst in need fall to thy labor quit the peevish boy time or some new desire shall this destroy the same eclogue the shepherd corydon woos alexis but finding he could not prevail he resolves to follow his affairs and forget his passion creech  by mr thomas creech see an account of mr creech vol i p   0 n  alexis young corydon hard fate an humble swain alexis loved the joy of all the plain he loved but could not hope for love again yet every day through groves he walked alone and vainly told the hills and woods his moan cruel alexis cannot my verses move have thou no pity must i die for love just now the flocks pursue the shades and cool and every lizard creeps into his hole brown thestylis the weary reapers seeks and brings their meat their onions and their leeks and whilst i trace thy steps in every tree and every bush poor insects sigh with me ah had it not been better to have borne the peevish amaryllis frown and scorn or else menalcas than this deep despair though he was black and thou art lovely fair ah charming beauty it is a fading grace trust not too much sweet youth to that fair face things are not always used that please the sight we gather blackberries when we scorn the white thou do despise me thou do scorn my flame yet do not know me nor how rich i am a thousand tender lambs a thousand kine a thousand goats i feed and all are mine my dairys full and my large herd affords summer and winter cream and milk and curds i pipe as well as when through theban plains amphion fed his flocks or charmed the swains nor is my face so mean i lately stood and viewed my figure in the quiet flood and think myself though it were judged by you as fair as daphnis if that glass be true oh that with me thee humble plains would please the quiet fields and lowly cottages oh that with me you would live and hunt the hare or drive the kids or spread the fowling snare then we would sing like pan in shady groves pan taught us pipes and pan our art approves pan both the sheep and harmless shepherd loves nor must you think the pipe too mean for you to learn to pipe what will not amyntas do i have a pipe wellseasond brown and tried which good damaetas left me when he died he said here take it for a legacy thou art my second it belongs to thee he said and dull amyntas envied me besides i found two wanton kids at play in yonder vale and those i brought away young sportive creatures and of spotted hue which suckle twice a day i keep for you these thestylis has begged and begged in vain but now they re hers since you my gifts disdain come lovely boy the nymphs their baskets fill with poppy violet and daffadil the rose and thousand other fragrant flowers to please thy senses in thy softest hours these nais gathers to delight my boy come dear alexis be no longer coy i will seek for chestnuts too in every grove such as my amaryllis used to love the glossy plumbs and juicy pears i will bring delightful all and many a pretty thing the laurel and the neighboring myrtle tree confusedly planted cause they both agree and prove more sweet shall send their boughs to thee ah corydon thou art a foolish swain and coy alexis does thy gifts disdain or if gifts could prevail if gifts could woo iolas can present him more than you what does the madman mean he idly brings storms on his flowers and boars into his springs ah whom do thou avoid whom fly the gods and charming paris too have lived in woods let pallas she whose art first raised a town live there let us delight in woods alone the boar the wolf the wolf the kid pursues the kid her thyme as fast as to other does alexis corydon and him alone each has his game and each pursues his own look how the wearied ox brings home the plough the sun declines and shades are doubled now and yet my passion nor my cares remove love burns me still what flame so fierce as love ah corydon what furys this of thine on yonder elm there hangs thy halfprund vine come rather mind thy useful work prepare thy harvest baskets and make those thy care come mind thy plough and thou shall quickly find another if alexis proves unkind  eclogue iii or palaemon menalcas and dametas upbraid each other with their faults by and by they challenge one another and pipe for a wager palaemon coming that way by

student of christ church and rector of staunton upon wye in herefordshire published by henry sacheverell dd      this volume of which a second edition was published the same year is inscribed to richard hopton esquire knight of the shire for the county of hereford to whom mr adams had been tutor at christ church an employment be appears to have been well qualified for discharging in his younger years he gave many admirable specimens of his polite genius in his accurate performances in poetry and oratory and had afterward the honor to be chosen his master dr busbys first catachetical lecturer in oxford to answer the pious and charitable design of that great founder of learning he bent the whole course of his studies to divinity of which he is said to have drawn out a comprehensive and useful plan which at his death he directed his executors to destroy with all his mss except the volume of discourses which appeared by his express injunction in the catalogue of oxford graduates there are three christchurch men of the name of willam adams each of them ma and all nearly of the same standing n  this eclogue is wholly pastoral and consists of the contention of two shepherds thyrsis and corydon to the hearing of which mcliboeus was invited by daphnis and thus relates it  while daphnis sat beneath a whispering shade thyrsis and corydon together fed their mingling flocks his sheep with softest wool were clothed his goats of sweetest milk were full both in the beauteous spring of blooming youth the worthy pride of blessed arcadia both each with like art his tuneful voice could raise each answer readily in rural lays hither the father of my flock had strayed while shelters i for my young myrtles made here i fair daphnis saw when me he spied come hither quickly gentle youth he cried your goat and kids are safe o seek not those but if you have leisure in this shade repose hither to water the full heifers tend when lengthening shadows from the hills descend mincius with reeds here interweaves his bounds and from that sacred oak a busy swarm resounds what should i do nor was alcippe there nor phyllis who might of my lambs take care yet to my business i their sports prefer for the two swains with great ambition strove who best could tune his reed or best could sing his love alternate verse their ready muses chose in verse alternate each quick fancy flows these sang young corydon young thyrsis those corydon ye muchloved muses such a verse bestow as does from codrus my loved codrus flow or if all cannot obtain the gift divine my pipe i will consecrate on yonder pine  thyrsis y arcadian swains with ivy wreaths adorn your youth that codrus may with spite be torn or if he praise too much apply some charm lest his ill tongue your future poet harm  corydon these branches of a stag this wildboars head by little mcons on thy altar laid if this continue delia thou shall stand of smoothest marble by the skilfulst hand  thyrsis this milk these cakes priapus every year expect a little garden is thy care thou rt marble now but if more land i hold if my flock thrive thou shall be made of gold  corydon o galatea sweet as hyblas rhyme white as more white than swans are in their prime come when the herds shall to their stalls repair o come if ever thy corydons thy care  thyrsis o may i harsh as bitterest herbs appear rough as wild myrtle vile as seaweeds are if years seem longer than this tedious day haste home my glutton herd haste haste away  corydon ye mossy springs ye pastures softer far than thoughtless hours of sweetest slumbers are ye shades protect my flock the heats are near on the glad vines the swelling buds appear  thyrsis here on my hearth a constant flame does play and the fat vapor paints the roof each day here we as much regard the cold north wind as streams their banks or wolves do number mind  corydon look how the trees rejoice in comely pride while their ripe fruit lies scattered on each side all nature smiles but if alexis stay from our sad hills the rivers weep away  thyrsis the dying grass with sickly air does fade no fields unparchd no vines our hills do shade but if my phyllis come all sprouts again and bounteous jove descends in kindly rain  corydon bacchus the vine the laurel phoebus loves fair venus cherishes the myrtle groves phyllis the hazels loves while phyllis loves that tree myrtles and laurels of less fame shall be  thyrsis the lofty ash is glory of the woods the pine of gardens poplar of the floods if often thy swain fair lycidas thou see to thee the ash shall yield the pine to thee  meliboeus these i remember well  while vanquished thyrsis did contend in vain thence corydon young corydon does reign the best the sweetest on our wondering plain  pharmaceutria another

echoing groves resound and mountains ring ye naiades what held you from his aid when to unpitied flames he was betrayed nor aganippe tempted you away nor was parnassus guilty of your stay the bays

melted in his eyes gallus to his arcadian friends replies ye gentle swains sing to the rocks my moan for you arcadian swains should sing alone how calm a rest my wearied ghost would have if you adorned my love and mourned my grave o that your birth and business had been mine to feed a flock or press the swelling vine had phyllis or had galatea been my love or any maid upon the green what if her face the nutbrown livery wear are violets not sweet because not fair secure in that unenvied state among the poplars i my careless limbs had flung phyllis had made me wreaths and galatea sung behold fair nymph what bliss the country yields the flowery meads the purling streams the laughing fields next all the pleasures of the forest see where i could melt away my years with thee but furious love denies me soft repose and hurls me on the pointed spears of foes while thou but ah that i should find it so without thy gallus for thy guide do go through all the german colds and alpine

of lady giffard sir williams favorite sister a lady of uncommon merit and goodness and companion to him in all his foreign embassies she was addressed by sir w giffard who dying during the courtship he begged the young lady to bear his name and to enable him to leave her his estate as a proof of his affection she was married to him on his deathbed by which means she became entitled to his large estate and that she might not show herself unworthy of his esteem she made a vow though in her tender youth never to marry any other man but to live his widow and this she faithfully performed she died in      at the age of    an oldfashioned monument with an epitaph which seems to have been designed by sir w temple in his lifetime is erected in westminster abbey to himself and those most dear to him to his most beloved daughter to his most beloved wife and to martha giffard his best of sisters n       by sir william temple bart sir william temple was descended from a younger branch of a family of that name seated at temple hall in leicestershire his grandfather was secretary to the unfortunate earl of essex favorite of queen elizabeth and his father was sir john temple master of the rolls in ireland he was as much above the common level of politicians as he was above the herd of authors he displayed his great abilities in several important treaties and negotiations the most considerable of which was the bringing to a happy conclusion the famous triple league betwixt england sweden and holland this alliance though the most prudent step ever taken by charles ii was soon defeated by the cabal a set of men who were as great a disgrace to their country as sir william temple was an honor to it he was strongly solicited to go over to holland in order to break that league which he had a little before concluded but he was too much a patriot to yield to any solicitations of that kind and chose to retire into the country where he was much better employed in writing his excellent observations on the united provinces and other elegant works few authors have been more read or more justly admired than sir william temple he displays his great knowledge of book and men in an elegant easy and negligent style much like the language of genteel conversation his vanity ofter prompts him to speak of himself but he and montaigne a never more pleasing than when they dwell on that difficul subject it is a happy circumstance for his readers that s polite and learned a writer was also a vain one they a great gainers by his foible he is sometimes inaccurate but his inaccuracies escape us unseen or are very little attended to we can easily forgive a little incorrectness o drawing in the paintings of a correggio when there is so much beauty and grace t atone for

title or date with ms corrections formerly belonging to lady giffard which there is great reason to believe was printed only for private use and never published whence the reader will be gratified with some poems which may not improperly be called original n  one labor more o arethusa yield before i leave the shepherds and the field some verses to my gallus ere we part such as may one day break lycoris heart as she did his who can refuse a song to one that loved so well and died so young so may thou thy beloved alpheus please when thou creepst under the sicanian seas begin and sing gallus unhappy fires whilst yonder goat to yonder branch aspires out of his reach we sing not to the deaf an answer comes from every trembling leaf what woods what forests had enticed your stay ye naiades why came ye not away when gallus died by an unworthy flame parnassus knew and loved too well his name to stop your course nor could your hasty flight be stayed by pindus which was his delight him the fresh laurels him the lowly heath bewailed with dewy tears his parting breath made lofty maenalus hang his piny head lycaean marbles wept when he was dead under a lonely tree he lay and pined his flock about him feeding on the wind as he on love such kind and gentle sheep even fair adonis would be proud to keep there came the shepherds there the weary hinds thither menalcas parched with frosts and winds all ask him whence for whom this fatal love apollo came his arts and herbs to prove why gallus why so fond he says thy flame thy care lycoris is anothers game for him she sighs and raves him she pursues thorough the midday heats and morning dews over the snowy cliffs and frozen streams through noisy camps up gallus leave thy dreams she has left thee still lay the drooping swain hanging his mournful head phoebus in vain offers his herbs employs his counsel here it is all refused or answered with a tear what shakes the branches what makes all the trees begin to bow their heads the goats their knees oh it is sylvanus with his mossy beard and leafy crown attended by a herd of woodborn fatyrs see he shakes his spear a green young oak the tallest of the year pan the acadian god forsook the plains moved with the story of his gallus pains we saw him come with oatenpipe in hand painted with berries juice we saw him stand and gaze upon his shepherds bathing eyes and what no end no end of grief he cries love little minds all thy consuming care or restless thoughts they are his daily fare nor cruel love with tears nor grass with showers nor goats with tender sprouts nor bees with flowers are ever satisfied thus spoke the god and touched the shepherd with his hazle rod he sorrowslain seemed to revive and said but yet arcadians is my grief allayed to think that in these woods and hills and plains when i am silent in the grave your swains shall sing my loves arcadian swains inspired by phoebus oh how gently shall these tired and fainting limbs repose in endless sleep while your sweet notes my love immortal keep would it had pleased the gods i had been born just one of you and taught to wind a horn or wield a hook or prune a branching vine and known no other love but phyllis thine or thine amyntas what though both are brown so are the nuts and berries on the down amongst the vines the willows and the springs phyllis makes garlands and amyntas sings no cruel absence calls my love away farther than bleating sheep can go astray here my lycoris here are shady groves here fountains cool and meadows soft our loves and lives may here together wear and end o the true joys of such a fate and friend i now am hurried by severe commands into remotest parts among the bands of armed troops there by my foes pursued here by my friends but still by love subdued thou far from home and me art wandering over the alpine snows the farthest western shore the frozen rhine when are we like to meet ah gently gently lest thy tender feet be cut with ice cover thy lovely arms the northern cold relents not at their charms away i ll go into some shady bowers and sing the songs i made in happier hours and charm my woes how can i better choose than among wildest woods myself to lose and carve our loves upon the tender trees there they will thrive see how my love agrees with the young plants look how they grow together in spite of absence and in spite of weather meanwhile i ll climb that rock and ramble over yon woody hill i will chase the grizly boar i ll find dianas and her nymphs resort no frosts no storms shall slack my eager sport methinks i m wandering all about the rocks and hollowsounding woods look how my locks are torn with boughs and thorns my shafts are gone my legs are tired and all my sport is done alas this is no cure for my disease nor can our toils that cruel god appease now neither nymphs nor songs can please me more nor hollow woods nor yet the chafd boar no sport no labor can divert my grief without lycoris there is no relief though i should drink up hebers icy streams or scythian snows yet still her fiery beams would scorch me up whatever we can prove love conquers all and we must yield to love virgils o fortunatos etc georg ii     and seqq  translated or rather imitated upon the desire of my lady temple by the same not in his works o happy swains if their own good they knew whom far from jarring arms the just and due returns of wellfraught fields with easy fare supply and cheerful heavens with healthy air what though no aged title grace the stock what though no troops of early waiters flock to the proud gates and with officious fear first beg the porters then the masters ear what though no stately pile amuse the eye of every gazer though no scarlet dye stain the soft native whiteness of the wool nor greedy painter ever rob the full untainted bowls of liquid olives juice destined for altars and for tables use though the bright dawn of gold be not begun and nothing shine about the house but sun yet secure peace reward of harmless life yet various sorts of treasures free from strife or envy careless leisure spacious plains cool shades and flowery walks along the veins of branched streams yet soft and fearless sleep amidst the tender bleating of the sheep want not there hollow gloomy groves appear and wilder thickets where the staring deer dare close their eyes there youth to homely fare and patient labor age to cheerful care accustomed sacred rites and humble fear of gods above fair truth and justice there trod their last footsteps when they left the earth which to a thousand mischiefs gave a birth for me the muses are my first desire whose gentle favor can with holy fire guide to great natures deep mysterious cells through paths untracd it is the chaste muse that tels poor grovelling mortals how the stars above some keep their station some unwearied move through the vast azure plains and what obscures the midday sun how the faint moon endures so many changes and so many fears as by the paleness of her face appears what shakes the bowels of the groaning earth what gives the thunder what the hail a birth why the winds sometimes whistle sometimes roar what makes the raging waves now brave it over the towering cliffs now calmly backwards creep into the spacious bosom of the deep but if cold blood about my heart shall damp this noble heat of rifling natures camp then give me shady groves and purling streams and airy downs then far from scorching beams of envy noise or cities busy fry careless and nameless let me live and die oh where where are the fields the waving veins of gentle mounts amidst the smoother plains the nymphs fair walks oh for the shady vale of some proud hill some fresh reviving gale oh who will lead me whither shall i run to find the woods and shroud me from the sun happy the man that gods and causes knows natures and reasons laws that scorns the blows of fate or chance lives without smiles or tears above fond hopes above distracting fears happy the swain that knows no higher powers than pan or old sylvanus and the bowers of rural nymphs so often by satires grieved all this unseen perhaps but well believed him move not princes frowns nor peoples heats nor faithless civil jars nor foreign threats not romes affairs nor transitory crowns the fall of princes or the rise of clowns all s one to him nor grieves he at the sad events he hears nor envies at the glad what fruits the laden boughs the willing fields what pleasures innocence and freedom yields he safely gathers neither skills the feat of arms or laws nor labors but to eat some rove through unknown seas with swelling sails some wait on courts and the uncertain gales of princes favor others led by charms of greedy honor follow fatal arms some mount the pulpit others ply the bar and make the arts of peace the arts of war one hugs his brooding bags and feels the woe he fears and treats himself worse than his foe another breaks the banks lets all run out but to be talked and gazed on by the rout some sow sedition blow up civil broils and venture exile death and endless toils only to sleep in scarlet drink in gold though other fair pretenses may be told meanwhile the swain rises at early dawn and turns his fallow or breaks up the lawn with crooked plough buries the hopeful grain folds his loved flock and lays a wily train for their old foe prunes the luxurious vine pleased with the thoughts of the next winters wine visits the lowing herd these for the pale those for the yoke designs the rest for sale each season of the sliding year his pains divides each season shares his equal gains the youthful spring scatters the tender lambs about the fields the parching summer crams his spacious barns bacchus the autumn crowns and fair pomona when the winter frowns and curls his rugged brow with hoary frost then are his feasts then thoughts and cares are lost in friendly bowls then he receives the hire of his years labor by a cheerful fire or else abroad he tries the arts and toils of war with trusty dog and spear he foils the grizly boar with traps and trains and nets the greedy wolf the wily fox besets at home he leaves at home he finds a wife sharer of all that is good or bad in life prudent and chaste yet gentle easy kind much in his eye and always of his mind he feeds no others children for his own these have his kisses these his cares he is known little abroad and less desires to know friend to himself to no man else a foe easy his labors harmless are his plays just are his deeds healthy and long his days his end nor wished nor feared he knows no odds tween life and death but even as please the gods among such swains saturn the scepter bore such customs made the golden age before trumpets were heard or swords seen to decide quarels of lust or avarice or pride or cruel men began to stain their feasts with blood and slaughter of poor harmless beasts thus lived the ancient sabines thus the bold eturians so renowned and feared of old thus romulus and thus auspicious rome from slender low beginnings by the doom of fates to such prodigious greatness came bounded by heavens and seas and vaster fame but hold for why the country swain alone though he be blessed cares not to have it known horace book i sat i being a translation or rather imitation of his way of writing upon the desire of my lady temple and my lady giffard by the same not in his works how is it maecenas that no man abides the lot which reason gives or chance divides to his own share still praises other stars oh happy merchants broken with the wars and age the soldier cries on the other side when the ships tossed by raging winds and tide happy the wars there in an hour one dies or conquers the repining merchant cries the lawyer past the fear of being poor when early clients taber at his door and break his sleep forgets his easy gains and mutters oh how blessed are country swains their times their own but when the unpracticed clow summoned by writ enters the busy town every mans prey or jest he meets how cursed his hap he cries in fields so rudely nursed the rest of the same kind would make a theme as long and tedious as a winters dream but to dispatch if any god shall say your vows are heard each has his wish away change all your stations soldier go and trade merchant go fight lawyer come take the spade and plough in hand farmer put on the gown learn to be civil and leave off the clown why what do you mean good sirs make haste you will find hardly one god another time so kind soft and consider they all stand and stare like what they would be worse than what they are well this is mirth and it is confessed though few can tell me what forbids jests to be true or gentle masters to invite their boys to spell and learn at first with plumbs and toys but to grow serious he that follows arms physic or laws thriving by others harms the fawning host and he that sweats at plough the adventurous merchant all agree and vow their ends the same they labor and they care only that rest and ease may be their share when they grow old and have secured the main just so we see the wise and heedful train of busy ants in restless journies spend the summermonths to gather and to mend their little heap foreseeing winters rage and in their youth careful to store their age but when it comes they snug at home and share the fruits in plenty of their common care a council safe and wise when neither fire nor sea nor frost nor steel tames thy desire of endless gain whilst there is any can so much as tell thee of one richer man where is the pleasure with a timorous hand and heart to bury treasures in the sand who would be rich must never touch the bank you rout an army if you break a rank but if never touched what helps the sacred heap of hidden gold thy sweaty hinds may reap large fields of corn and fill whole tuns with wine but yet thy belly holds no more than mine so the tanned slave that s made perhaps to stoop under the whole provisions of the troop upon their way alas eats no more bread than he that carried none upon his head or tell me what t imports the man that lives within the narrow bounds that nature gives to plough a hundred or a thousand fields oh but to draw from a great heap that yields more than is asked is pleasant sure but why if mine though little gives me more than i or you can use where is the difference why is your fortune better or your sense as if some traveller upon his way wanting one quart of water to allay his raging thirst should scorn a little spring and seek a river t were a pleasant thing and what comes on t that such as covet more than what they need perhaps are tumbled over into the stream by failing banks whilst he that only wants what cannot be spared is free and drinking at the spring nor water fears troubled with mud nor mingled with his tears yet most men say by false desire misled nothing s enough because you re valued just so much as you have what shall one say or do to such a man bid him away and he as wretched as he please himself whilst he so fondly doats on dirty pelf a sordid rich athenian to allay the scorn of all the peoples tongues would say they hiss me but i hug myself at home while i among my endless treasures roam tantalus catches at the sling streams that still beguile him like a lovers dreams why do thou laugh of thee the fable s told thou that art plunged in thy heaps of gold and gazest on them with such wakeful eyes and greedy thoughts yet dare not touch the prize no more than if t were sacred or enjoyed like pictures which with handling are destroyed do thou not know what money s worth what use it yields let bread be bought and cheerful juice of grapes warm easy clothes and wood to burn as much of all as serves kind natures turn or else go spend thy nights in broken dreams of thieves or fire by day try all extremes of pinching cold and hunger make thy fare of watchful thoughts and heartconsuming care are these thy treasures these thy goods may i in want of all such riches live and die but if thy body shakes with aguish cold or burns with raging fevers or grows old betimes with unkind usage thou art sped with friends and servants that surround thy bed make broths and beg physicians to restore a health now so bewailed so loved before by all thy dear relations wretched man neither thy wife nor child nor servant can endure thou should recover all the boys and girls thy neighbors hate thee make a noise to break thy sleeps and do thou wonder when thou love thy gold far above gods or men can thou teach others love thyself have none thou may as well get children all alone then let there be some end of gain the more thou do possess the less fear to be poor and end thy labor when thou have attained what first thou had in im nor be arraigned like base umidius who was wont to mete his money as his neighbors did their wheat by bushels yet a wretch to such degree that he was clothed and fed as beggaly as the worst slave and to his very last his fear of downright starving never was past but as the gods would have it a brave tull he kept with a plain hatchet cleft his skull what is your counsel then i pray to swill like nomentanus or like moenius still to pinch and cark why go thou on to join things so directly opposite it is fine and does become thee if i bid thee fly the prodigal a miser thou must die nor one nor the other like my counsel sounds there is a mean in things and certain bounds short or beyond the which the truth and right cannot consist nor long remain in sight but to return from whence i parted where is there one miser does content appear with what he is or has and does not hate his own or envy at his neighbors fate never regards the endless swarm of those that so much poorer are but still outgoes the next and then the next when he is past meeting still one or other stops his haste like a fierce rider in a numerous race that starts and spurs it on with eager pace while there is one before him vexed in mind but scorning all that he has left behind hence comes it that so seldom one is found who says his life has happy been and sound and having fairly measured out the span f posting age dies a contented man r rises from the table like a guest that even has filled his belly at the feast on mrs philippss death mrs catharine philipps better known by the poetical name of orinda was the daughter of john fowler merchant and born in london      as wood and ballard in      according to jacob was married to james philipps of the priory of cardigan esquire about the year      and died in fleet street in the month of june      her poems including two tragedies horace and pompey both translated from corneille were collected in a folio volume and afterward reprinted in octavo she was also the writer of  volume of letters published many years after her death  sir charles cotterel entitled letters from orinda to pliarchus which have been much admired  orindas works with courtly graces stored  true sense in nice expressions will afford dr king vol iii p  mrs philipps was as much famed for her friendship as  her poetry and had the good fortune to be equally esteem by the best poet and the best divine of her age dr jeremy tailor addressed his discourse on the nature and effects of friendship to this lady and mr cowley has celebrated her memory in an ode particularly distinguished by the very learned and sagacious editor of his select works  the industrious mr langbaine says she was one that equalled the lesbian sappho and roman sulpicia as they were praised by horace martial ausonius and other ancient poets so was this lady commended by the earls of orrery and roscommon by cowley flatman and other eminent poets sir john denham added a fifth act to her tragedy of horace which was performed at court by persons of quality in      in the prologue spoken by the duke of monmouth it was observed that  while a woman horace did translate  horace did rise above a roman state the commendation she received from lord roscommon is thus handsomely returned by mrs philipps lord roscommon is certainly one of the most promising young noblemen in ireland he has paraphrased a psalm admirably and a scene of pastor fido very finely in some places much better than sir richard fanshaw this was undertaken merely  compliment to me who happened to say that it was the be scene in italian and the worst in english he was only two hours about it it begins thus  dear happy groves and you the dark retreat  of silent horror rests eternal seat from these lines which are since somewhat mended it appears that he did not think a work of two hours fit to endure the eye of criticism without revisal when mrs philipps was in ireland some ladies that had seen her translation of pompey resolved to bring it on the stage at dublin and to promote their design lord roscommon gave them a prologue and sir edward dering an epilogue which says she are the best performances of those kinds i eve saw if this is not criticism it is at least gratitude the thought of bringing caesar and pompey into ireland the only country over which caesar never had any power is lucky  i need not point out the part of these remarks for which i am indebted to lord roscommons incomparab biographer n  at the desire of my lady temple by the same not in his works why all these looks so solemn and so sad who is that one can die and none be glad the rich leaves heirs the great makes room the wise pleases the foolish only when he dies men so divided are in hopes and fears that none can live or die with general tears it is sure some star is fallen and our hearts grow heavy as its gentle influence parts thus said i and like others hung my head when straight twas whispered it is orindas dead orinda what the glory of our stage crown of her sex and wonder of the age graceful and fair in body and in mind she that taught sullen virtue to be kind youth to be wise mirth to be innocent fame to be steady envy to relent love to be cool and friendship to be warm praise to do good and wit to do no harm orinda that was sent the world to give the best example how to write and live the queen of poets whosoeer s the king and to whose scepter all their homage bring who more than men conceived and understood and more than women knew how to be good who learnt all young that age could ever attain excepting only to be proud and vain and made alone so rich amends for all the faults her sex committed since the fall can she be dead can any thing be great and safe can day advance and not retreat into the shady night but she was young and might have lived to tune the world and sung us all asleep that now lament her fall and fate unjust heaven unrelenting call alas can any fruit grow ripe in spring and hang till autumn nature gives this sting to all below whatever thrives too fast decays too soon late growths may longer last orinda could not wait on slowpaced time having so far to go so high to climb but like a flash of heavenly fire that falls into some earthly dwelling first it calls the neighbors only to admire the light and luster that surprise their wondering sight till kindling all it grows a noble flame towering and spiring up from whence it came but ere arrived at those azure walls the house that lodged it here to ashes falls such was orindas soul but hold i see a troop of mourners in deep elegy make room and listen to their charming lays for they bring cypress here to trade for bays and he deserves it who of all the rest praises and imitates orinda best on my lady giffards loory from the description perhaps a species of singing parrot n  of all the questions which the curious raise either in search of knowledge or of praise none seem so much perplexed or so nice as where to find the seat of paradise but who could once that happy region name from whence the fair and charming loory came to end this doubt would give the best advice for this was sure the bird of paradise such radiant colors from no tainted air such notes and humor from no lands of care such unknown smells could from no common earth from no known climate could receive a birth for he alone in these alive outvyd all the perfumes with which the phoenix died about a gentle turtles was the size the sweetest shape that ever surprised eyes a longish hawked bill and yellow brown a stick black velvet cap upon the crown his back a scarlet mantle covered over one purple sploach upon his neck he wore his jetty eyes were circled all with flame his swelling breast was with his back the same all down his belly a deep violet hue was gently shaded to an azure blue his spreading wings were green to brown inclined but with a sweet pale strawcolour were lined his tail above was purples mixed with green under a color such as never was seen when like a fan it spread a mixture bold of green and yellow grideline and gold thus by fond nature was he dressed more gay than eastern kings in all their rich array for feather much as well as flower outvies in softness silk in color mortal dies but none his beauty with his humor dare nor can his body with his soul compare if that was wonder this was prodigy they differed as the finest earth and sky if ever any reasonable soul harbored in shape of either brute or fowl this was the mansion metamorphosy gained here the credit lost in poetry no passion moving in a human breast was plainer seen or livelier expressed no wit or learning eloquence or song acknowledged kindness or complained of wrong with accents half so feeling as his notes look how he rages now again he doats brave like the eagle meek as is the dove jealous as men like women does he love with bill he wounds you sudden as a dart then nibbling asks you pardon from his heart he calls you back if ever you go away he thanks you if you are so kind to stay when you return with exultation high he raises notes that almost pierce the sky but all in such a language that we guest though he spoke ours he found his own the best such a badeen from the french badin a person full of play n never came upon the stage so droll so monkey in his play and rage sprawling upon his back and pitching pyes twirling his head and flurring at the flies a thousand tricks and postures would he show then rise so pleased both with himself and you that the amazed beholders could not say whether the bird was happier or they with a soft brush was tipped his wanton tongue he lapt his water like a tiger young his ladys teeth with this he pricked and pruned with this a thousand various notes he tuned a chagrin q shagreen n fine covered his little feet which to wild airs would in wild measures meet with these he took you by the hand his prey with these he seized with these he hopt away with these held up he made his bold defense the arms of safety love and violence with all these charms loory endowed and dressed forsaking climates with such creatures blessed from eastern regions and remotest strands flew to the gentle artemisas hands and when from thence he gave the fatal start went to the gentle artemisas heart fed with her hands and perched upon her head from her lips watered nested in her bed nursed with her cares preserved with her fears and now alas embalmed with her tears but sure among the griefs that plead just cause this needs must be acquitted by the laws for never could be greater passion concernment jealousy for mistress shown content in presence and at parting grief trouble in absence by return relief such application that he was in the end company lover playfellow and friend could i but hope or live one man to find as much above the rest of humankind as this above the race of all that fly long should i live contented should i die had such a creature heretofore appeared when to such various gods were altars reared who came transformed down in twenty shapes for entertainment love revenge or rapes loory would then have mercury been thought and of him sacred images been wrought for between him sure was sufficient odds and all the egyptian gothic indian gods nay with more reason had he been adored than gods that parjurd goddesses that whord yet such the greatest nations chose or found and raised the highest plant from lowest ground aristaeus aristaeus was son of cyrene daughter to one of the ancient kings of arcadia and by apollo as was believed or at least reported his birth was concealed and he was sent to be privately brought up among the shepherds of arcadia where grown a man he applied himself wholly to the cares and stores of a country life in all which he succeeded so as to grow renowned for his knowledge and wealth he was esteemed the first inventor of cheese oil and honey or rather of the art of hiving bees which before were wild and their stocks found only by chance and in hollow trees for this he was worshipped among the arcadians as son of apollo and as other inventors of things necessary or most useful to human life he fell in love with eurydice newly espoused to orpheus and by his pursuit of her was the occasion of her death being bitten by a snake as she fled from him this was followed by the death of orpheus after a long and incurable grief whereupon aristaeus was by the nymphs companions of eurydice plagued in all his stores but most of all in his bees of which he was fondest till he lost them all and was in despair ever to recover them but by the advice of his mother and of proteus to whom she sent him he came to find out both the true cause of his loss and means of retrieving it temple  from virgils georgicks book iv by the same not in his works the shepherd aristaeus grieving sees the helpless loss of his beloved bees in vain he with the strong contagion strives the clustering stocks lie famished in their hives some from abroad return with droopy wing with empty thighs and most without a sting they with diseases he with sorrow pines and to his spited grief himself resigns abandons all his wonted cares and pains his flocks his groves his shepherds and his plains away he goes led by his raving dreams to the clear head of the peneian streams full of complaints he there his sorrow breaks and thus reproaching to his mother speaks cyrene sometime mother whofe abodes are at the bottom of these crystal floods if ever apollo charmed thy desire as i am told or was my sacred sire if ever thou brought forth this child the hate and scorn of angry unrelenting fate what is his care or where thy tender love that bid me hope for blessed seats above is this the advantage of immortal race are these the trophies that thy offspring grace is t not enough i pass inglorious life among the country shades in toil and strife with my hard fate but thou must envy bear that i lived private void of hope or fear sprung from such seed i should a hero be is it too much to be content and free what is the honor of poor sheep and bees that thou should envy or deny me these thou art a goddess i an humble swain and can my rural fortunes give thee pain if so then come and cut down all my groves parch all my eared sheaves and kill my droves famish my flocks and root up all my vines he that is once undone no more repines thus went he on until at length the sound reached fair cyrene she sat circled round with all her nymphs in vaulted chambers spread under the great and sacred rivers bed there was cydippe gentle sweet and fair and bright dycorias with golden hair the first a virgin free from wanton stains the other newly past lucinas pains clio and peroe from the ocean lately arrived each upon a swan opis and ephyre and deiopeia drymo ligaea and the young thalcia swift arethusa had her quiver laid and wanton speio with her garland played some spin milesian wools some entertain the rest with stories of the pleasing pain the gay climene told the crafty wiles of jealous vulcan how he mars beguiles how the sweet thefts are found the train is set and how the lovers struggle in the net whilst to such tales they lend a willing ear their time and work away together wear till arstaeus sad complaint begins to make them listen then proceeding wins all the attention of the crystal hall but arethusa moved before all the rest starts up and rears her sprightly head above the waves that murmured as they fled and oh the gods cyrene cries she out sister cyrene sister here without thy chiefest care sad aristaeus stands and sighs and swells and with his gentle hands wipes his wet eyes then to reproaches falls and thee unkind and cruel mother calls she struck and pale and feeling all the smart that at such news could pierce a mothers heart cries bring him to us bring him strait away for him it is lawful aristaeus may sprung of the gods their sacred portals tread then she commands the hasty streams that fled so fast away to stop and leave a room where the sad youth might to her palace come the waters hear their goddesss command and rising from their bed in arches stand he through the glazed vaults amazed descends guided by two of the kind nymphs his friends till the vast spacious caverns he descries where fair cyrenes watery kingdom lies and struck with wonder the new scene beheld where in vast regions mighty waters swelled here gloomy groves repeat the hollow sound of falling floods there rocky cliffs rebound the fainting echoes here great lakes remain enclosed in caves reserved to fill some vein of failing streams there mighty rivers roll in torrents raging and without control here gentle brooks with a soft murmur glide phasis and lycus coasting by his side cold cydnus hastening to cicilian strands old tyber winding through the tawny sands the troubled hypanis and anio fair all haste to show their heads in open air that way the rapid po in branched veins runs out to water many fertile plains at length the noble swain is wondering brought into a great and round pavilion wrought out of a crystal rock with moss oergrown within twas paved all with pumicestone the vaulted roof with motherpearl was spread fretted with coral in wild branches led the wall in grotesque imgery excels wrought in a thousand variouscolourd shells some representing the fierce seagods rapes others the fair and flying nymphs escapes here neptune with the tritons in his train there venus rising from the foamy main twenty light ivory chairs and covered all with mossy cushions stood about the hall to one of these is aristaeus led where sitting down at first he hung his head then sighing tells his story and his moan repeats but only lets reproach alone cyrene hearing all her sons complaints alas poor youth she cries alas he faints is it with fasting or with grief go bring a bowl of water from you crystal spring and bring a flaggon of old sparkling wine the nymphs dispatch some make the altar shine with spicy flams some the white napkins get and various dishes on the table set she takes a cup of one great pearl and cries first to the ocean let us sacrifice and while she holds it in her hand she prays to the great ocean sings the oceans praise invokes a hundred nymphs that him obey but in a hundred groves and rivers sway thrice she pours wine upon the sacred fires and thrice the flame to the arched roof aspires with which propitious signs cyrene pleased she thus her sons impatient grief appeased in the carpoethian gulf blue proteus dwells great neptunes prophet who the ocean quells he in a glittering chariot courses over the foaming waves him all the nymphs adore old nereus too because he all things knows the past the present and the future shows so neptune pleased who proteus thus inspired and with such wages to his service hired gave him the rule of all his briny flocks that feed among a thousand ragged rocks he is coasting now to the emathian shore near fair pallene where bright thetis bore this son of the ocean thou must him pursue and seize and bind and make him tell the true cause and events of thy sad disastrous chance by no fair words or prayers can thou advance nor gentle means hard force will make him bend and for his own be glad to serve thy end when next the radiant sun shall scorch the plain and thirsty cattle seek for shade in vain i will myself conduct thee to the cells and close retreats where this enchanter dwells when he the ocean leaves and takes his rest there seize him tired and with sleep oppressed and bind him fast with fetters and with chains and still the more he struggles and he strains the faster hold him and beware his wiles by which he other mortals still beguiles for into twenty various forms he will turn a marble pillar or a curved urn a flash of fire or else a gushing flood a shaggy lion smeared all with blood a scaly dragon or a rugged bear a chafed boar or tiger he will appear but thou the more he shifts his various shapes take the more care to hinder his escapes and hold him faster till at length he rise in the same form thou did him first surprise then will he tell whose anger has thee grieved and how thy loss may be again retrieved thus said cyrene and with a gentle look upon her son her golden tresses shook from whence ambrosian odours were diffused about the room by which the shepherd used so long to woe straight seemed to revive and thought his loved bees again alive his hair and weed the sweet perfume retains and sprightly vigor runs through all his veins there is a mighty gulf which many a tide had eaten out of a great mountains side sometimes the foaming waves come braving over the ragged cliffs that all infest the shore and a great sea covers this mighty bay but when with falling tides it steals away then does a dry and spacious strand appear which rough and scattered rocks does only bear about the midst one above all the rest with scraggy splints raises its lofty crest the spreading roof has two unequal sides half undermined by the beating tides which make two hollow chambers on the strand arched with rock and floored with the sand of these the larger is the cool retreat which proteus chooses from the scorching heat within the lesser fair cyrene hides bold aristaeus where the youth abides turned from the light and casting in his mind how he may seize the bard and how him bind thus all prepared the nymph no longer stays but in a mist away herself conveys and as she rises all the sky grows clear phoebus begins his flaming head to rear parching the corn and scorching up the blades the lowing cattle seek about for shades the panting lions with the heat oppressed and tigers tamed lay them down to rest the thirsty indians hasten to their caves and now the briny flocks forsake the waves here comes a triton on a dolphin borne there a great seahorse with his wreathed horn the snarling seals crawl up the sloping shore and deepmouthed hounds that in charybdis roar calves hogs and bears all monsters of the floods but those resembling which frequent the woods roll on the sand or sprawling on their sides in the hot sun they tan their tawny hides then proteus wafted over the curling waves leaps on the shore and hastens to his caves there sitting down he shakes his briny locks and eyes his herds scattered among the rocks just as some aged shepherd ere the night approaches and the wolves begin to fright his tender lambs gets on some rising ground and gathers all his flocks about him round views them with care and numbers all his sheep then on the grass securely falls asleep but proteus scarce is laid upon the sands in easy slumbers stretching out his hands when the fierce youth in haste upon him runs seizes him fast and with amazement stuns the frighted captive then he clapson bands upon his fainting legs and trembling hands yet it is not long the elf forgets his arts but at the first surprising fright departs come to himself he is himself no more nothing appears of what he was before but into twenty monstrous shapes he turns gushes like water or in flame he burns a serpent hisses or a lion roars a tigers likeness or a grizly boars but the warned swain never lets go his hold till proteus finding none of all his old accustomed wiles succeed he silence breaks and thus in human voice and shape he speaks but who thou boldest of all mortal race has sent thee here my lonely steps to trace and taught thee undiscerned thus to creep unto the secret closets of the deep or what is the thing thou seekst now i am tied and in thy hands the shepherd straight replied thou ask what thou know for none can thee eceive then think not of deceiving me it is by the gods commands we here are come to thee for help or else to know our doom t this the prophet rolls his fiery eyes and grinds his teeth awhile and then replies it is not in vain or for light cause decreed y angry fates that thy fond heart should bleed s well as his for whom this punishment oo too unequl to thy crime is sent it is wretched orpheus does thy life infest and both have lost what both have loved best thy heart was set upon thy rural stores he nothing but eurydice adores thou were the cause of her untimely fate and he pursues thee with an endless hate the lovely bride was wandering over the plain in hopes to meet her own desired swain when thou bold youth enflamed by her charms would fain have caught her in thy lustful arms away she springs like a light do that flies the bloody hound her nimble feet she plies along the downs but whilst away she runs and thy pursuit amazed and frighted shuns alas unwary she never spied the snake that as she passed lay lurking in the brake thus almost hopeless grown and out of breath she escapes thy rage by an untimely death but her last cries the echoes far report the nymphs about her shrieking all resort the hollow woods in murmur make their moan among their branches all the turtles groan the thracian mountains round with sorrow swell the very tigers all about them yell the towering heavens at her fate complain and brokenhearted clouds fall down in rain the following night her deepest sable wears and the next morning weeps in dewy tears but woeful orpheus all in grief excels all in complaints among the rocks he dwells in tears dissolving and with sighing pined calling the heavens unjust and gods unkind at length he takes up his melodious lyre which phoebus ever used to inspire thinking to charm his woes and lovesick heart a cure too hard for either time or art for now his warbling harp would yield no sounds but lost eurydice eurydice rebounds from every trembling string thee still he sung thy gentle name among the woods he rung thee on the lonely shore amidst the rocks thee on the hills among the herds and flocks thee at the dawning of the morning gray thee at the closing of the weary day but where alas thus wretched should he go tired with the light he seeks the shades below to the taenarian caves his course he bends and by the deep infernal gates descends into the ghastly leasless woods that spread over the gloomy regions of the dead trunks without sap and boughs that never bear some pale with fear some black with deep despair he crossed the sooty plains and miry lakes all full of croaking toads and hissing snakes came to the rusty iron gates that bring to the black towers of the great dreadful king hoping to touch a heart with his sad care that never relented yet with human prayer but at his powerful song the very seats of erebus were moved the retreats of all the ghosts were opened and they swarm like bees in clusters when the sun grows warm or when the evening drives them to the hive mothers and virgins as if still alive husbands and children heroes so renowned mixed with the nameless crowd and monarchs crowned among sweaty hinds and slaves about him throng admire and listen to his charming song the whole tartarian regions all amazed stood and attended or upon him gazed the slow cocytus stops its muddy flood and styx about him nine times circling stood the snaky tresses of the eumenides left off their hissing cerberus at ease laid down his threefold head and ceased to roar ixions restless wheel would turn no more and now the enchanting orpheus had prevailed his songs had more than ever prayers availed eurydices restored to human life and he returns close followed by his wife hears but not sees her for that law was made by proserpine and was upon him laid he should not once behold his lovely fair till both arrived above in open air but when the infernal mansions almost past approaching day a dawning twilight cast upon the lovers the unhappy swain forgetting all his woes and all his pain spent with desire and vanquished of his mind turned his impatient head and cast a kind and longing look upon his gentle mate now heedless of the doom imposed by fate a venial fault if pity or if grace had ever grown among the infernal race but here his labor all ran out in vain the unrelenting doom takes place again thrice from the avernian lake a horrid noise invades his ears and thrice the howling voice of cerberus thrice shook the vaulted cave and for the nymph opened a second grave she fainting cries what fury thee possessed what frenzy orpheus seized on thy breast ah me once more undone behold the fates again recall me to their iron gates once more my eyes are seized with endless sleep and now farewell i sink into the deep oblivious cells surrounded all with night no longer thine in vain to stop my flight i stretch my arms in vain thou stretchest thine in vain thou grievest i in vain repine thus said she and of the sudden from his eyes like smoke to air all vanishing she flies and leaves him catching at the empty shade in vain he called her and fond offers made to follow for no more hard fate allows his wished return nor hearkens to his vows black guards of orcus strongly him withstood nor suffered to approach the stygian flood what should he do where pass his woeful life twice had he got twice lost his dearest wife with what new vows should he the heavens please with what new songs should he the ghosts appease she now grown pale and cold was wafting over the stygian lake and near the hated shore full seven long months in sad and raving dreams or restless thoughts he passed near strimons streams under a lonely rock or in wild dens seeking the savage beasts avoiding mens commerce or sight but with his doleful lays he taught the flocking birds to ing her praise his own despair the very stones admire and rolling follow his melodious lyre he forced the heart of hardest oak to groan and made fierce tigers leave their rage and moan so the sweet nightingale that grieving stood and saw the untimely rape of her young brood snatched by some clown out of the downy nest under a poplar shade or else her breast against some thorn she spends the longsome night in mournful notes and shuns the approaching light but the dark thicket fills with endless moan charming all others sorrow but her own no heats new venus in him ever could raise no sense ever moved him of reproach or praise along the streams of tanais he goes alone he wanders over the scythian snows seeks the rough mountains covered all with frost and tells the trees eurydice is lost curses the vain concession of the fates himself and angry gods and men he hates women he scorns since she must be no more whom only he and ever could adore but the cyconian dames too long despised too much desiring by him to be prized amidst the sacred rites of bacchus feast rippd up his vainly loved and loving breast tore him in pieces and about the fields scattered his limbs what fruits religion yields and even then when into hebers streams they threw his head his eyes had lost their beams his lips their ruddy hue but still his voice called in a low and now expiring noise eurydice eurydice his tongue in broken notes now chill and trembling sung eurydice the echoes sounded over the neighboring banks and down the rocky shore thus proteus sung then leaped into the main for now the foaming tide returned again among the rocks the shepherd stood amazed but straight cyrene came on whom he gazed like one enchanted with the dreary song of charming proteus for the fatal wrong of orpheus touched him now more than his own in such sad notes and lively colors shown she cheered his troubled thoughts and thus began no more complaints my son no more these wan and careful looks the cause of all thy grief is now discovered so is the relief the angry nymphs that haunt the shady groves where orpheus and his bride began their loves and many a dance had taught her in their rings whilst he so sweetly to their measures sings it is they have plagued thee in all thy stores among thy sheep have caused so many sores blasted thy corn and made thy heifers pine blighted the fruitful olive and the vine but above all thy bees have felt the smart because they knew thou had them most at heart therefore with offerings thou must them appease they reconciled once will give thee ease the nymphs are gentle may their rage allay when thou beginst to worship and to pray but the whole order of their sacred rites i must explain unknown to mortal wights first choose four steers the fairest of thy herd which on lycaean mountains thou have reared four lovely heifers yet unhandled take then just as many unhewn altars make within the grove where ancient use allows arcadian swains to pay their holy vows unto the nymphs there as the day shall rise of all these offerings make one sacrifice upon the altars pour the reeking blood and leave the bodies in the shady wood first strowed over with fresh oaken boughs but when the ninth aurora thee shall rouse from thy soft sleep lethaean poppies bring and unto orpheus solemn dirgies sing with a black sheep his angry ghost appease and a white calf eurydice to please then to the grove return with humble gait and heart devout and there expect thy fate the swain instructed makes no long delay unto the shrine he straight begins his way raises the altars all the bullocks slays offers his humblest prayers and his praise unto the angry nymphs then home retires and lays sweet incense on his household fires full eight long days but when the dawning light upon the ninth restored the morning bright he to the grove returns and there he sees stupendous sight a thousand thousand bees out of the melted bowels of each steer as from a mighty swarming hive appear bursting from out the sides with vital heat from whence in clouds they rise then take their seat upon the leaning boughs till all the trees are hung with bunches of the clustering bees thus have i sung poor nymphs and shepherds dreams whilst caesar thunders at euphrates streams with conquering arms the vanquished nations awes

among his poems there are several excellent songs in his king arthur which should have been copied but that they are so interwoven with the story of the drama that it would be improper to separate them there is also a song in love in a nunnery and another in the duke of guise but neither of them worth transcribing n  i why should a foolish marriage vow which long ago was made oblige us to each other now when passion is decayed we loved and we loved as long as we could till our love was loved out of us both but our marriage is dead when the pleasures are fled twas pleasure first made it an oath ii if i have pleasures for a friend and farther love in store what wrong has he whose joys did end and who could give no more it is a madness that he should be jealous of me or that i should bar

high they haunt these alleys with their shricks and groans and pick up baneful herbs and human bones i saw canidia here her feet were bare black were her robes and loose her flaky hair with her fierce sagana went stalking round their hideous howlings shook the trembling ground a paleness casting horror round the place sat dead and terrible on eithers face their impious trunks upon the earth they cast and dug it with their nails in frantic haste a coleblack lamb then with their teeth they tore and in the pit they poured the reeking gore by this they force the tortured ghosts from hell and answers to their wild demands compel two images they brought of wax and wool the waxen was a little puling fool a chidden image ready still to skip whenever the woollen one but snapt his whip on hecate aloud this beldame calls tphone as loud the other bawls a thousand serpents hissed upon the ground and hell hounds compassed all the gardens round behind the tombs to shun the horrid sight the moon skulkd down or out of shame or fright may every crow and cuckoo if i lie aim at my crown as often as they fly and never miss a dab though never so high may villain julius and his rascal crew use me with just such ceremony too but how much time and patience would it cost to tell the gabblings of each hag and ghost or how the earth the ugly beldame scrapes and hides the beards of wolves and teeth of snakes while on the fire the waxen image fries vexed to the heart to see their sorceries my ears torn with their bellowing sprights my guts my fig tree bowels wambled at the sluts mad for revenge i gathered all my wind and bouncd like fifty bladders from behind scared with the noise they scud away to town while saganas false hair comes dropping down canidia tumbles over for want of breath and scatters from her jaws her set of teeth i almost burst to see their labors crossed their bones their herbs and all their devils lost the death of camilla from virgil aeneid xi by the same on death and wounds camilla looks with joy freed from a breast the siercer to destroy now thick as hail her fatal darts she ssings the twoedged ax now on their helmets rings her shoulders bore dianas arms and bow and if too strongly pressed she sled before a foe her shafts reversed did death and horror bear and found the rash who durst pursue the fair near her fierce tulla and tarpeia ride and bold larina conquering by her side these above all camillas breast did share for faith in peace and gallantry in war such were the thracian amazonian bands when first they died with blood thermodoons sands such troops hippolyta herself did head and such the bold penthesilca led when female shouts alarmed the trembling fields and glaring beams shot bright from maiden shields who gallant virgin who by thee were slain what gasping numbers strewn upon the plain thy spear first through eumenius passage found whole torents gushed out of his mouth and wound with gnashing teeth in pangs the earth he tore and rolled himself half deluged in his gore then hapless pegasus and lyris bleed the latter reining up his fainting steed the first as to his aid he stretched his hand both at an instant headlong struck the sand her arm amastrus next and tereas feel then follows chromis with her lifted steel of all her quiver not a shaft was lost but each attended by a trojan ghost strong orphitus in arms unknown before in battle an apulian courser bore his brawny back wrapped in a bullocks skin upon his head a wolf did fiercely grin above the rest his mighty shoulders show and he looks down upon the troops below aim and twas easy while his fellows fled she struck along and thus she triumphed while he bled some coward game thou did believe to chase but hunter see a woman stops thy race yet to requiring ghosts this glory bear thy soul was yielded to camillas spear the mighty butes next receives her lance while breast to breast the combatants advance clanging between his armours joints it ung while on his arm his useless target hung then from orsilochus in circle runs and follows the pursuer while she shuns for still with craft a narrow ring she wheels and brings herself up to the chacers heels her ax regardless of his prayers and groans she crashes through his amout and his bones redoubled strokes the vanquished foe sustains his reeking face bespattered with his brains chance brought unhappy aunus to the place who stopping short stard wildly in her face of all to whom liguria fraud imparts while fate allowed that fraud he was of subtlest arts who when he saw he could not shun the sight strives to avoid the virgin by his slight and cries aloud what courage can you show by cunning horsemanship to cheat a foe forego your horse and strive not to betray but dare to combat a more equal way it is thus we see who merits glory best so braved fierce indignation fires her breast dismounted from her horse in open field now first she draws her sword and lifts her shield he thinking that his cunning did succeed reins round his horse and urges all his speed his golden rowels hidden in his sides when thus his useless fraud the maid derides poor wretch that swellst with a deluding pride in vain thy countrys little arts are tried no more the coward shall behold his fire then plies her feet quick as the nimble fire and up before his horses head she strains when seizing with a furious hand his reins she wreaks her fury on his spouting veins so from a rock a hawk soars high above and in a cloud with ease oertakes a dove his pounces so the grappled foe assail and blood and seathers mingle in a hail now jove to whom mankind is still in sight with more than usual care beholds the fight and urging tarchon on to rage inspires the furious deeds to which his blood he fires he spurs through slaughter and his failing troops and with his voice lifts every arm that droops he shouts his name in every soldiers ears reviling thus the spirits which he chears ye shamed and everbranded tyrrhene race from whence this terror and your souls so base when tender virgins triumph in the field let every brawny arm let fall his shield and break the coward sword he dare not wield not thus you fly the daring she by night nor goblets that your drunken throats invite this is your choice when with lewd bacchanals y are called by the fat sacrifice it waits not when it calls thus having said  he spurs with headlong rage among his foes as if he only had his life to lose and meeting venulus his arms he clasps the armor dints beneath the furious grasps high from his horse the sprawling foe he rears and thwart his coursers neck the prize he beas the trojans shout the latins turn their eyes while swift as lightning airy tarchon slies who breaks his lance and views his armor round to find where he might fix the deadly wound the foe writhes doubling backward on his horse and to defend his throat opposes force to force as when an eagle high his course does take and in his griping talons bears a snake a thousand folds the serpent casts and high setting his speckled scales goes whistling through the sky the fearless bird but deeper gores his prey and through the clouds he cuts his airy way so from the midst of all his enemies triumphant tarchon snatched and bore his prize the troops that shrunk with emulation press to reach his danger now to reach at his success then aruns doomed in spite of all his art surrounds the nimble virgin with his dart and slily watching for his time would try to join his safety with his treachery wherever her rage the bold camilla sends there creeping aruns silently attends when tired with conquering she retires from fight he steals about his horse and keeps her in his sight in all her rounds from him she cannot part who shakes his treacherous but inevitable dart chloreus the priest of cybele did glare in phrygian arms remarkable afar a foaming steed he rode whose haunches case like feathers scales of mingled gold and brass he clad in foreign purple galled the foe with cretan arrows from a lycian bow gold was that bow and gold his helmet too gay were his upper robes which loosely flew each limb was covered over with something rare and as he sought he glisterd every where or that the temple might the trophies hold or else to shine herself in trojan gold him the fierce maid pursues through all her foes regardless of the life she did expose him eyes alone to other dangers blind and manly force employs to please a virgins mind his dart now aruns from his ambush throws and thus to heaven he sends his coward vows apollo oh thou greatest deity patron of blessed soractis and of me for we are all thy own whole woods of pine we heap in piles which to thy glory shine and when we trample on the fire our soles by

this raging female plague but overcome let me return unthankd inglorious home apollo heard to half his prayer inclined the rest he mingles with the fleeting wind he gives camillas ruin to his prayer to see his country that was lost in air as singing over the feld the javelin slies upon the queen the army turn their eyes but she intent upon her golden prey nor minds nor hears it cut the hissing way till in her side it takes its deadly rest and drinks the virgin purple of her breast the trembling amazons run to her aid and in their arms they catch the falling maid more quick than they the frightned aruns flies and fees a terror mingled with his joys he trusts no more his safety to his spear even her expiring courage gives him fear so runs the wolf smeared with some shepherds blood and strives to gain the shelter of a wood before the darts his panting sides assail and claps between his legs his shivering tail conscious of the audacious bloody deed as aruns seeks his troops stretched on his speed where in their center quaking he attends and skulks behind the targets of his friends she strives to draw the dart but wedged among her ribs deep to the wound the weapon clung then fainting rolls in death her closing eyes while from her cheeks the cheerful beauty flies to acca thus she breathes her last of breath acca that shared with her in all but death ah friend you once have seen me draw the bow but fate and darkness hover round me now make haste to turnus bid him bring with speed his fresh reserves and to my charge succeed cover the city and repel the foe thus having said her hands the reins forego down from her horse she sinks then gasping lies in a cold sweat and by degrees she dies her drooping neck declines upon her breast her swimming head with slumber is oppressed the lingering soul the unwelcome doom receives and murmuring with disdain the beauteous body leaves to my heart what ailst thou oh thou trembling thing to pant and languish in my breast like

free or rather is not tainted with all three mankind is criminal their acts their thoughts it is charity to tell them of their faults and show their failings in a faithful glass for who will not mend who sees himself an ass and this design it is that employs my muse that for her daily theme she s proud to choose a theme that she ll have daily need to use let other poets flatter fawn and write to get some guineas and a dinner by t such mercenary wretches should they starve they meet a kinder fate than they deserve but she could never cringe to a lord for meat or praise a prosperous villain though he is great quite contrary her practice shall appear unbribd impartial pointed and severe that way my nature leads composed of gall i must write sharply or not write at all though thyrsis wings the air in towering slights and to a wonder panegyric writes though he is still exalted and sublime scarce to be matched by past or present time though smooth and lofty all his lines appear the thoughts all noble the expression clear with judgment wit and sancy shining every where yet what instruction can from hence accrue it is flattery all too fulsome to be true urge not for it is to vindicate the wrong it causes emulation in the young a thirst to fame while some high act they read that prompts them to the same romantic deed as if some powerful magic lay in rhimes that made them braver than at other times it is false and fond heroes may huff and fight but who can merit so as he can write to say a glowworm is the morning star and that it may with ease be seen as far were most ridiculous so far from truth it justly would deserve a sharp reproof that slave is more to blame whose hireling pen calls knaves and coxcombs wise deserving men says the rank bawds are all with

tyrant which all ills comprize has been extolled and lifted to the skies whilst living such was the applause he gave counted high princely pious just and brave and with encomiums waited to his grave who then would give this for a poets praise which rightly understood does but debase and blast the reputation it would raise hence it is and it is a punishment that s fit they are contemned and scorned by men of wit it is true some scots may nibble at their praise and think it great to stand in the front of plays though most to that stupidity are grown they waive their patrons praise to write their own and yet they never fail of their rewards and faith in that i cannot blame the bards if coxcombs will be coxcombs let them rue if they love flattery let them pay for t too it is one sure method to convince the elves they spare my pains and satirize themselves in short naught helps like satyr to amend while in huge volumes motley priests contend and let their vain disputes never have an end they plunge us in those snares we else should shun like tinkers make ten holes in mending one our dearest friends too though they know our faults for pity or for shame conceal their thoughts while we who see our failings not forbid loosely run on in the vain paths we did it is satyr then that is our truest friend for none before they know their faults can mend that tells us boldly of our foulest crimes reproves illmanners and reforms the times how am i then to blame when all i write is honest rage not prejudice or spite truth is my aim with truth i shall impeach and i

cause corydon thee have i sought in every shady grove by purling streams and in each private place where we have used to sit and talk of love why do i find thee leaning on an oak by lightning blasted and by thunder rent what cursed chance has turned thy cheerful mind and why will thou have woes unknown to me but i would comfort and not chide my friend tell me thy grief and let me bear a part

all were ravished  swiftest streams withheld their course to hear the heavenly sound and murmured when by following waves pressed on the following waves forcing their way to hear often the fierce wolf pursuing of the lamb hungry and wildly certain of his prey left the pursuit rather than lose the sound of his alluring pipe the harmless lamb forgot his nature and forsook his fear stood by the wolf and listened to the sound he could command a general peace and nature would obey this youth this youth is dead the same disease that carried sweet orinda from the world seized upon astrophell  oh let

shepherds deeds so well whether to praise the good he turned his pen or lashed the egregious follies of the bad in both he did excel  his happy genius bade him take the pen and dictated more fast than he could write sometimes becoming negligence adorned his verse and nature showed they were her own yet art he used where art could useful be and sweated not to be correctly dull  corydon had fate allowed his life a longer thread adding experience to that wondrous fraught of youthful vigor how would he have wrote equal to mighty dryden  this and the two following lines are wanting in the copy

mind had he known age he would have seen the world put on its ugliest but its truest face malice had watched the droppings of his pen and ignorant youths who would for critics pass had thrown their

controversial writings against abp king  samuel was born in   0  and received his education at dublin at    he was sent to the university of glasgow and marrying before he was  0 returned to dublin with his wife where the conduct of neither was commendable the husband who had no graces of person and fewer still of conversation passed his time in abject trifling the wife in intrigue and their extravagance reduced his father to indigence in      young boyse resided at edinburgh where he published a volume of poems addressed to the countess of egleton the patroness of all men of wit here also mr boyse particularly distinguished himself by an elegy called the tears of the muses on the death of the viscountess stormont which introduced him to the noble viscount and also to the duchess of gordon who had engaged for him an office in the customs which he lost by an unpardonable remissness the duchess sent him to london with recommendations to mr pope and the lord chancellor king he went to twickenham but the po not being at home he never repeated the visit by the peer he was most graciously received from this period he wrote many poems but those though excellent in their kind and sufficient it is said to have filled at least six volumes were lost to the world by being introduced with no advantage he had so strong a propensity to grovelling that his acquaintance were generally of such a cast as could be of no service to him and those in higher life he addressed by letters not having sufficient confidence or politeness to converse familiarly with them a freedom to which he was entitled by the power of his genius his genius was not confined to poetry only but he had a taste for painting music and heraldry with the latter of which he was well acquainted many of his poems are in the gent mag signed y and alceus in      he published his albions triumph an ode on the battle of dettingen and in or about      wrote an admirable poem called the deity which mr pope declared on its publication contained many lines of which he should not be ashamed it was also commended by the late henry fielding who gave a quotation from it see tom jones b vii    and at the same time very justly styled it a noble on this unfortunate man by addicting himself to low vices among which were gluttony and extravagance rendered himself so contemptible and wretched that he frequently was without the least subsistence for days together after squanring away in a dirty manner any money which he acquired he has been known to pawn all his apparel and in that state was frequently confined to his bed sitting up with his arms through holes in a blanket writing verses in order to procure the means of existence it seems hardly credible but it is certainly true that he was more than once in that deplorable ituation and to the end of his life never derived any advange from the experience of his past sufferings a late colector of poems mr giles says he was informed by mr by

spring that rains sweets and plenty over the plains and with shady garlands crowned all the woods and groves around if she see the winged quire choose this season to retire to the shelter of the grove it is by instinct say of love if she see the herds and flocks wanton round the meads and rocks thus their wishing males to move it is the instinct say of love if she see the bull among crowds of females sleek and young fight his rival of the drove it is by instinct say of love if she see the blooming vines in their season fold their twines round the oak that near her grows say it is nature mixed their boughs then if instinct these do move we by reason ought to love tell the fairone every day youth and beauty steal away and within a little space will destroy her charming face every grace and smile that lies languishing in lips and eyes first he will make his prey and then leave to death what does remain who old time does only send to begin what he must end if she ask what hour and place where and when time wounds the face say it is not in the night nor when day renews her light in the morning or at noon or at evening when alone or when entertained at home or abroad this hour will come but swift time is always by first to perfect then destroy and in vain you seek a cure since his wounds are every hour bid her view aurelias brow naked of her glories now yet she once could charm the throng conquering with her eyes and tongue now only s left this weak relief to support her years and grief when she could she used her prime and enjoyed the fruits of time and wherever she professed love or hate she killed or blessed while the neighboring plains were filled with their names she loved and killed oh when youth and beautys past that poor pleasure that does last is to think they were admired and by every youth desired while the dotage of each swain she returned with scorn again oh then let my chloe know when her youth is faded so and a race of nymphs appears gay and sprightly in their years proud and wanton in their loves while the shepherds of the groves strive with presents who shall share most the favors of the fair and herself she does behold like aurelia now grown old sighing to herself she will say i was once adored as they yet with pleasure think that she loved and was beloved by me therefore bid her haste and prove while she may the joys of love i will lead her to a soil where perpetual summers smile without autumn which bereaves fairest cedars of their leaves where she shall behold the meads ever green the groves with shades lasting flowers the banks shall wear and birds shall warble all the year where the rustic swain does owe nothing to the spade and plow for their harvest natures care without toil relieves them there and no differing seasons bring changes to the constant spring in the morn she shall awake with the noise the shepherds make chearing with the echoing sounds of their horns the eager hounds nymphs as well as shepherds too in these groves the chase pursue while at their backs their flowing hair loosely wantons in the air gilded quivers on their thighs with darts less fatal than their eyes each the others sloth does blame while they seek the heart for game who poor fool his feet employs and through woods and dales he flies over plains and rivers bounds and outflies the winds and hounds when perhaps some nymph whose eyes makes both men and beast her prize swifter than camillas pace soon oertakes the winged race and with one bright glance she wounds and his fancied hope confounds who reflecting his faint eyes on her face with pleasure dies when the sports are done they rest underneath some shade and feast on sweet beds of violets crowned with sweet roses on the ground where they garlands weave and poses of green myrtle pinks and roses for which grace the ravished swains pay soft kisses for their pains thus they dally till the light falls behind the scene of night song i go tell amynta gentle

melantha it is that lovely fair that lies beneath this weeping marble here but would you know why she has took her flight into the bosom of eternal night before her beauties scarce had showed their light hak and lament her fate as the young god of love one day sat on a rock at play and wantonly let fly his darts among the nymphs and shepherds hearts melantha by unhappy chance came by love jesting cried i will make her prove the godhead she contemned of love in scorn she bade him strike and did his shaft defy while the boy slightly threw a dart to wound but not destroy her heart but greedy death fond of this beauteous prey caught the swift arrow as it flew and added to t his own strength too which made so deep a wound that as she lay in silent sighs she breathed her soul away then all the little gods began to weep oh let your sighs with theirs due measure keep for fair melantha she is dead her beauteous soul to deaths dark empire s fled flora the bounteous goddess of the plains who in fresh groves and sweetest meadows reigns hearing the fair melantha dead brought all her odorous wealth to spread over the grave where she was laid then straight the infant spring began to fade and all the fields where she did keep and sold her bleating flocks of sheep their influence lost with her fair eyes decayed for fair melantha by whose cruel pride so many sad despairing swains had died felt love at last but death she rather chose than own she loved or the hid flame disclose speak muses for ye hold immortal state with gods and know the mysteries of fate you all whatever s past or present see and read the unwritten pages over of times great chronicle before events and time had writ what fate resolved should be tell me what beauty is whose force controls reason and power and over mankind rules kings stoop to beauty and the crowns they wear shine not with so much luster as the fair beauty a larger empire does command than the great monarch of the seas and land she can the coldest anchorites inflame cool tyrants rage and stroke their passions tame she can call youth to her forsaken seat in withered veins and give new life and heat she can subdue the fierce the proud and strong give courage to the weak the fearful and the young beauty the only deity we know with fear and awe we to her altars go and there our purest zeal of prayers and vows bestow sure then it only seems to die and when it leaves us mounts above to the eternal roof of jove to be a constellation and enrich the sky but should i search the spangled sphere for metamorphosd beauty there nothing of helen now is seen nor the fair egyptian queen or thou whose eyes were constellations here oh then thy fate we cannot enough deplore with thee thy beauty died and it is no more then let us give melanthas fate its due strew cypress on her hearse and wreaths of yew for fair melantha poor melantha s dead her sighing soul to deaths eternal empire s fled the courtprospect by mr charles hopkins son of ezekiel bishop of londonderry who married the lady araminta one of the   daughters of john lord robartes of truro afterward earl of radnor he was born at exeter but his father being taken chaplain to ireland by lord robartes when lord lieutenant in      our poet received the early part of his education at trinity college dublin and afterward was a student at cambridge on the rebellion in ireland in      he returned thither and exerted his early valor in the cause of his country religion and liberty when public tranquillity was restored he came again into england and fell into an acquaintance with gentlemen of the best wit whose age and genius were most agreeable to his own in      he published some epistolary poems and translations which will all be inserted in this volume and in      he showed his genius as a dramatic writer by pyrrhus king of egypt a tragedy to which mr congreve wrote the epilogue see english poets vol xxix p    he published that year the history of love a connection of select fables from ovids metamorphoses      which by the sweetness of his numbers and easiness of his thoughts procured him considerable reputation with mr dryden in particular he became a great favorite he afterward published the art of love which jacob says added to his fame and happily brought him acquainted with the earl of dorset and other persons of distinction who were fond of his company through the agreeableness of his temper and the pleasantry of his conversation it was in his power to have made his fortune in any scene of life but he was always more ready to serve others than mindful of his own affairs and by the excesses of hard drinking and a too passionate fondness for the fair sex he died a martyr to the cause in the   th year of his age i shall preserve in this collection an admirable hymn written about an hour before his death when in great pain his courtprospect in which many of the principal nobility are very handsomely complimented is called by jacob an excellent piece and of his other poems he adds that they are all remarkable for the purity of their diction and the harmony of their numbers mr hopkins was also the author of two other tragedies boadicea queen of britain      and friendship improved or the female warrior with a humorous prologue comparing a poet to a merchant a comparison which will hold in most partculars except that of accumulating wealth our author who was at londonderry when this tragedy came out inscribed it to edward coke of norfolk esquire in a dedication dated nov        so modest and pathetic that i am persuaded i shall stand excused if i print it at full length the greatest and indeed almost the only advantage a poet reaps from what he writes is the opportunities he meets with of making himself known to the best and greatest men of his age a play is first made public in the theater and when it comes to the press if any one has spoken kindly and favorably of it in the representation the poet chooses him for his patron he having before according to the authors construction chosen him for his poet the distance i am at from the city and even from the kingdom too will keep me ignorant for some time what success this play which i humbly offer to your patronage may meet with if the town is pleased with it i shall be pleased with myself for pleasing them if they condemn it i shall be apt to conclude so many in the right rather than my single self you saw it in manuscript and i have this early and auspicious advantage that you approve of it boadicea pleased them and i received a very great additional satisfaction when i understood how particularly it pleased you i will not go to compare that play and this together nor follow the custom of reckoning the last performance best and showing the greatest fondness of the youngest brat the rhyme was the only thing that recommended that and for aught i know the only thing too that can recommend this i could wish for something distinguishing in it because it is sacred to you and i should desire to be known to you at advantage if the pains in writing will endear it to you it cost me much more than the former it has some sort of design besides such as it is but i was never very guilty of plotting i can hardly keep the characters in my play from being as honest and sincere as i would be myself in a dedication a vicious character disturbs me while i draw it and it grates me to delineate a villain it is certain no poet can excite any passion in another if he does not feel it first in himself who then will choose to describe discontent envy or revenge when they may have such fair fields as honor and virtue to range in all there is bright before them and the flight the muse takes the s heavenwards such characters artfully and justly drawn will excite the good and great to be patrons and such patrons as you sir will soon teach poets to draw such characters you are endowed with all the blessings of nature and fortune and you are as liberal of the gifts of the latter to others as she has been to you so great is your estate it would be unwieldy to have it more and such good use is made of it that envy does not wish it less it is not consumed in vain and superfluous equipage but laid out in maintaining the old open english hospitality desert in want is supplied and honesty in distress is succored and sustained great without titles and good above greatness rich rather to others than yourself and seeming only as your own steward your inclinations and endeavors are the general good of mankind and none ever went from you dissatisfied delighted in obliging others and pleased to see them pleased with your bounty wishing the welfare of all men and speaking well of all men is a sure way to meet with an universal return of good will and good wishes he doubly enjoys his fortune who has it wished double by all that know him among the prayers of others accept of the praises of the poet humbly and heartily though feebly offered i now begin to experience how much the mind may be influenced by the body my muse is confined at present to a weak and sickly tenement and the winter season will go near to overbear her together with her household there are storms and tempests to beat her down or frosts to bind her  and kill her and she has no friend on her side but youth to bear her through if that can sustain the attack and hold out till spring comes to relieve me one use i shall make of farther life shall be to show how much i am sir your most devoted humble servant charles hopkins  his feelings were prophetic he died i believe in the course of that winter n    to the duchess of ormond      madam that your grace has been pleased to speak favorably of what i have already writ is encouragement sufficient for a poet to boast of to the world and to embolden him to dedicate to your grace but i have more particular both obligations and excuses your illustrious consorts family having been the constant pations of ours which now depressed by the late wars and the chief pillar of it fallen must depend for support on the first founders the fate of this eminent but unfortunate prelate was extremely singular he was born at sandford in devonshire became choirister of magdalen college oxford in      at the age of about    was educated under presbyterian and independent discipline and about the time of the restoration became assistant to dr spurstow of hackney he was afterward elected preacher at one of the city churches but the bishop of london refused to admit him as he was a popular preacher among the fanatics he then obtained st marys church at exeter was countenanced by bishop ward and much admired for the comeliness of his person and elegance of preaching the lord robartes in particular was so pleased with him that he gave him one of his daughters in marriage took him chaplain to ireland in      gave him the deanery of raphoe and recommended him so effectually to his successor lord berkeley that he was consecrated bishop of raphoe october         and translated to londonderry in      driven thence by the forces under the earl of tyrconnel in      he retired into england and was elected minister of aldermanbury in september      where he died on the   th of june    0 he published expositions on the lords prayer and ten commandments and five single sermons n  thus the thanks for past favors are only petitions for more as some men pay off old debts in hopes to run deeper in for new i dare not hope the ensuing essay can merit your graces approbation let it if possible please others if it meets with your pardon it will abundantly satisfy the ambition of your graces most devoted most humble servant  charles hopkins  to the reader some writers perhaps may expect the thanks and favor of the nobility after attempting their praise but i am rather afraid of having incurred their displeasure they whom i have mentioned i doubt may with more reason find fault with me than they whom i have omitted for it is better not to be drawn at all than to be drawn imperfectly and lamely the poet however has the same excuse with the painter that art cannot equal nature nor the pencil nor the pen present a copy that comes up to her original the business of a poet is to please and he is very unhappy who gives offense where he designs acknowledgments or respects the whole body of the nobility of england would be a boundless subject painters own they find it more difficult to give a true and lively air and posture to a picture to place the legs and duly proportion all the parts than to draw the face and take the likeness but this piece was only intended for an halflength and that too is only a rough draught and in miniature though the following lines may want an excuse with the critics i will not despair of pardon from the nobles to whom it was designed and if i have failed in describing their greatness i have at the same time given them an opportunity of showing their goodness  above that bridge which lofty turrets crown joining two cities of itself a town as far as fair augustas buildings reach bent like a bow along a peaceful beach her gilded spires the royal palace show towering to clouds and fixed in floods below the silver thames washes her sacred sides and pays her prince her tributary tides thither all nations of the earth resort not only englands now but europes court blessed in the warriors which its walls contain blessed most in williams residence and reign where in his royal robes and regal state he meditates and dictates europes fate his heroes and his nobles standing round better by them than his gold circle crowned o could i represent that glorious show you whose great deeds form poets tell me how but lest my muse which much i fear should faint what dryden will not write let dauly from the manner in which this painter is mentioned he appears to have been a person of eminence in his profession his name however occurs neither in mr walpoles valuable work nor in mr pilkingtons n paint haste then and spread abroad thy canvass sheets wide as the fullblown sails that wing our fleets paint william first on an imperial throne large share of earth and all the seas his own over land and ocean let his realm extend and like his fame his empire never end give him that look which monarchs ought to have give him that awful look which nature gave mix majesty with mildness while he shows dear to his friends and dreadful to his foes seat him surrounded by his british peers and make them seem his strength as he is theirs no poet here dares sing the noble tribe which you can better draw than he describe you can plant each in his peculiar place give each the noblest features in his face each has his charms and all some certain grace let englands chancellor the great lord summers n the foremost stand that is his due whose laws support the land who governs influenced by his sovereign lord and holds the balance as the king the sword give the good shrewsbury the second seat in trust in secrecy and council great great as the best will the great ormond seem but in the field thou must delineate him born with auspicious stars and happy fate but more in merit than in fortune great on higher things he bends his nobler aim and in fierce wars has sought and purchased fame here could my grateful willing muse have sung sweet as cham flows when first her harp was strung here somerset should she thy praise proclaim and give thee what thou givst our cambridge the duke of somerset was chancellor of cambridge n  fame let youthful grafton there his station find grown man in body now but more in mind his looks are in the mothers beauty dressed and all the father has informed his breast why will thou then to distant shores convey our hopes in thee why trust the faithless sea why view the changing climates of the earth and bless all realms but that which gave thee birth thy country lovely youth thy stay demands and fears to venture thee in foreign lands all thou have seen and all thou go to see will not improve but be improved in thee a manly beauty is in devnshire seen and true nobility in dorsets mien but here great artist is thy skill confined thou can not paint his nobler muse and mind no pen the praise he merits can indite himself to represent himself must write next let young burlington receive his place adorned with every beauty every grace happy in fortune person and in parts himself not wanting them promoting arts with him let kingston be for ever joined alike in quality alike in mind for court or camp for love or glory fit possessing both both patronizing wit hither let montague the treasures bring which while he offers let his muses sing the patron of the rest so justly grown who served so well a nation with his own who seated on the sacred mountains brow inspires and cherishes the train below draw russel yonder ordered to maintain the power and honor of the british main wrap him in curling smoke and circling flames yet unconcerned as on his sovereigns thames while his loud cannon thunders through the deep makes seas attention give and silence keep then as he coasts the mauritanian shores paint pale the faces of the astonished moors whence england gives surrounding nations law and from the center keeps the world in awe no more let poets name inconstant seas for neptune knows his sovereign and obeys fled from that fatal field the watery plain no foe dares venture there our force again fierce gallia challenges to belgian fields but still her chosen plain small harvest yields the warlike cutts the welcome tidings brings the true brave servant of the best of kings cutts whose known worth no herald need proclaim his wounds and his own verse can speak his fame the dreadful news moves william with delight gladly he hears and gladly hastes to fight leaving his faithful substitutes behind he trusts himself to his own seas and wind the royal fleet a thousand heroes grace and mars in triumph rides over neptunes face now out of sight of land they plough the main and in some rolling tides make land again now sight of hostile tents their valor warms and each encourages his mate to arms fancy can scarce so swift and eager run their lines are drawn and the campwork is done the word is given and battle is begun they who have seen an ocean lash its shore when billows tumble and begin to roar when from all quarters clouds and tempests fly and from despairing sailors hide the sky such as have seen those elements at war may guess what welldisputed battles are description of a battle hark it is at hand drums beat and trumpets sound the horsemen mount the mounted horses bound the soldiers leap transported from the ground when such harmonious sounds invite to arms it is sure that valiant men feel secret charms such williams is when from his foaming horse he views the foe rejoicing at their force never so full of spirit and delight never so pleased as when prepared to fight paint him then yonder spurring from afar giving the charge guiding the raging war paint to the field party on party sent himself not waiting for the vast event now mingled in the war engage the whole and of his martial troops make him the soul now from all parts death and destruction fly the cries of grappling squadrons rend the sky mars rages and the rolling war runs high here horses rear at horses chest to chest there desperate men encounter breast to breast here trampled under foot fallen soldiers groan for help they call but with unpitied moan for every one now minds himself alone the cannons roar and flaming balls fly round men fall and die and hardly feel the wound stones from the ground that nourished them are tossed and all the fashion of the field is lost mortars shoot flaming meteors through the air and such as have not seen them fly would fear the stars dissolved and the last judgment near death through the broken battle makes a lane and horror and confusion fill the plain horses in troops without their riders run wild as were those of old that drew the sun madly they drag their reins and champ their bit and bear down all before them whom they meet sols offspring and their masters fate the same all lost like him in thunder smoke and flame as seamen fear yet struggle with a storm the soldiers start at what themselves perform paint then a fear in every face and make even william fear  but fear for ormonds sake ormond who spurred amidst the thundering war but to his sovereigns sorrow spurred too far dismounted make him even in falling great wounded half dying yet despising fate make william view him with excess of grief and strive but strive in vain to send relief till heaven inspires his very foes to save a life as strangely fortunate as brave who for that life may to more praise aspire than if the day had been their own entire proud of their prize more furious than before make them press on make english fury more make shattered squadrons rally on the plain and make enraged battalions charge again again make horses beat the suffering ground and toss with restless hoofs the dust around again their riders couch their ready lance and spurring them to warmth and foam advance foam which your pencil need not owe to chance make sheets of flame from smoking culverins fly and clouds of mounting smoke obscure the sky now draw beneath the dying and the dead and deluges of blood in battle shed overflowing flanders in her waters stead and now let clouds like feeble curtains fall protecting those that live and hiding all cast the black veil of night about the slain covering the purple horror of the plain and now with solid darkness shut the scene as tempests make the skies serene and clear as thunder serves to purify the air on rain as sunshine storms on calms attend peace is wars necessary certain end description of the goddess of peace and her palace pardon the muse if here she cannot hold the sight of her own goddess makes her bold she comes  over fields of standing corn she walks not crushed the tender ears nor bent the stalks her march attended with a numerous train yet with such discipline that none complain grass springs wherever she goes the flowery mead receives new flowers where she vouchsafes to tread her blooming beauties teeming earth displays the lovers myrtle and the poets bays from every touch of her a perfume flows the lovely hyacinth the blushing rose and spreading jessamine fresh sweets disclose thick palaces as she approaches rise and royal piles amaze beholders eyes built on a sudden they the sight confound and seem to start as from enchanted ground none this or that can her apartment call for she promiscuously resides in all at home in every one and all she keeps silent but splendider than that of sleeps which the reader will find described in a future poem n  her spacious halls with useless arms are hung with arrows broken and with bows unstrung no murmurs through her numerous train are heard she knows no danger and her court no guard secure as shades as skies unclouded bright as active yet as noiseless as the light no widows here their husbands deaths deplore none hears the drum or thundering cannon roar only love sighs which serves to lull her more plenty her bestlovd favorite duly waits and pleasure enters at her palace gates roses and myrtles mingled make her bed and heaps of flowers support her sacred head inspired by her the muse around her sings and cupids fan her with expanded wings no grief or anxious cares her peace molest she folds her arms above her quiet breast delightful are her dreams and soft her rest all at her rise their adoration pay the persians worship less the springing day sweet is her temper easy is her mien not the least frown in all her aspect seen but gracious as our late lamented queen nor are her blessings to her court confined but flow through nobles to the laboring hind all they can wish her own domestics share bestowing still yet has she still to spare the grateful soil the jocund peasants plow and with a certainty of reaping sow not now as heretofore with fears perplexed tilling these fields and armies in the next now spring comes on  and night and day in equal measures run and mounting laks salute the morning sun then ripening fruits the loaded trees adorn and laughing fields are crowned with lofty corn the summer so accustomed to alarms wonders she hears no more the sounds of arms no trumpets echo through the spacious plain nor earthborn brethren by themselves are slain the sun shines freely through the flowery field and suffers no reflection from the shield men to the date of nature draw their breath for nothing now but sickness causes death secure the merchants trade abroad for gain and sailors unmolested sweep the main unrolling waves steal softly to the shore they know their sovereign and they fear to roar the conscious winds within their caverns keep like them the seas are hushed and seem asleep and halcyon peace broods over the boundless deep how are these blessings thus dispensed and given to us from william and to him from heaven delight in blood let other heroes boast our ease and safety please our monarch most for that he fought for that was all his care he places all his pomp and glory there hail peace of all things in confusion hurled hail thou restorer of the christian world thou to the world art heavens chief blessing given and thou have rendered back the world to heaven thus in old times at our blessed saviors birth an universal calm was known on earth god to his son did the first gift assign and lets the second miracle be thine this compliment it must be acknowledged is extended to the verge of indecency n  how shall we thank thee for thy royal toil thou strength and glory of the british isle what trophies shall thy grateful subjects raise and what ambitious poets sing thy praise thy greatness surely is the stars design thy hands our noblest palaces refine on all our metals all the stamp is thine draw his triumphant entry dauly this painter see p     is twice called by dryden di he died oct        at the age of  0 n  draw him and his allies free  and all the rest of the whole world in awe but see all peaceable our hero comes no sound of trumpet nor alarm of drums long kept from rest by no inglorious foes he goes to take what he has brought repose his softer triumphs then prepare to grace prepare a train fit to attend on peace choose them from all that breathe the british air and like the goddess whom they wait on fair make beauteous grafton to this accomplished lady mr hopkins inscribed his history of love see p     she has been already menoned p     as daughter of the earl of arlington n with the first advance charming at every step with every glance  as her temper paint her heavenly face draw her but like you give your piece a grace blend for her all the beauties ever you knew for so his venus famed apelles drew but hold  to make her most divinely fair consult herself you will find all beauty there whom shall we think on now there is scarce beside any that can compare with her but hyde hyde who like her has beauties without blame hyde who like her is every poets theme hyde by all eyes admired all hearts adored courteous to all kind only to her lord hyde who so many powerful charms commands as will not shame the piece where grafton stands and now to make thy lasting fame renowned let all be with illustrious ormond crowned sm all in her that is fair and good and great place her in beautys and in virtues seat paint sweetness in her eyes at once and awe and make her looks give languishing and law o if my muse to her wished height could climb sweet as her subject as her theme sublime the noble ormond should engross her praise great ormonds name should sanctify her lays hers and her most illustrious consorts blood takes pleasure still like heaven in doing good ormond to whom fair lots on earth are given ormond who has her seat secured in heaven stop here  though others may attract the sight your pencil and my pen  dare not attempt to do so many right who strives to sing a patron or a friend though he omit some whom he should commend cannot be thought in justice to offend  and now you have finished so renowned a piece boast safely  challenge either rome or greece to charles earl of dorset of the earl of dorset the character has been drawn so largely and so elegantly by prior english poets vol xxx p   to whom he was familiarly known that nothing can be added by a casual hand  he was a man whose elegance and judgment were universally confessed and whose bounty to the learned and witty was generally known dr johnson  to this short but comprehensive eulogy it would be presumption to think of adding n  by the same as nature does in newborn infants frame with their first speech their careful fosterers name whose needful hands their daily food provide and by whose aid they have their wants supplied you are my lord the poets earliest theme and the first word he speaks is dorsets name to you the praise of every muse is due for every muse is kept alive by you their boasted stream from your rich ocean pours and all the helicon they drink is yours what other subject can the muses choose or who besides is worthy of a muse they shall to future ages make you known their verse shall give you fame but more your own immortal wit shall its great patron boast when others of an equal rank are lost while eating time all other tombs devours no mausoleum shall endure but yours life to yourself by your own verse you give and only you and whom you please shall live thus you must nassaus godlike acts proclaim and farther than his trumpets sound his fame whose hundred mouths of nothing else shall tell but him who fought and him who sung so well even after death you shall your honors share you for improving wit and he for war to walter moyle this ingenious writer was born in cornwall      after passing some years at oxford he was removed to the temple where he entered deeply into the nobler parts of the law for there was a drudgery says mr hammond in the lawlucrative which he could not submit to here first he formed an intimacy with dryden hammond hopkins and other contemporary wits he was for some time a member of parliament where he always acted a very honorable and disinterested part and afterward retired to his seat at bake in cornwall where he applied himself very diligently to study and died june        two volumes of his post humous writings were published in      and those he had printed in his lifetime were collected in      by his friend mr hammond who wrote his life n  esquire by the same to you dear youth in these unpolished strains and rural notes your exiled friend complains with pain this tedious banishment i bear from the dear town and you the dearest there hourly my thoughts present before my view those charming joys which once alas i knew in wine in love in friendship and in you now fortune has withdrawn that pleasing scene we must not for a while appear again here in its stead unusual prospects rise that dull the fancy and disgust the eyes bleak groves of trees shook by the northern winds and heavy aspects of unthinking hinds no beauteous nymph to fire the youthful heart no swain instructed in the muses art hammond alone is from this censure free hammond who makes the same complaint with me alike on both the want of you does strike which both repine at and lament alike while here i stay condemned to desert fields denied the pleasures which the city yields my fortunes by the chance of war deprest lost at these years when i might use them best to crown your youth conspiring graces join honor and bounty wealth and wit are thine with charms united every heart you move esteem in men in vanquished virgins love though clogged with cares i drag my restless hours i envy not the flowing ease of yours still may they roll with circling pleasures on nor you neglect to seize them as they run time hastes away with an impetuous flight and all its joys soon vanish from our sight which we shall mourn we used not while we might in full delights let sprightly southern live with all that women and that wine can give may generous wycherley all sufferings past enjoy a welldeservd estate at last fortune with merit and with wit be friends and sure though slowly make a large amends late very late may the great dryden die but when deceased may congreve rise as high to him my service and my love commend the greatest wit and yet the truest friend accept dear moyle a letter writ in haste which my impatient friendship dictates fast friendship like love imperfectly expressed yet by their being so they re both shown best each no cold leisure for our thoughts affords but at a heat strikes out our eager words the souls emotion most her truth assures such as i feel while i subscribe me yours to anthony hammond to this gentleman mr hopkins inscribed his epistolary poems and translations in a dedication worth preserving the following verses ought in justice to be yours since not only the best part of them were made at your house but they were made designedly for you so that this is not a deication written to a book but a book written to a dedication which however is the nicest part a writer has to manage for the most deserving men are the most averse to be told so and what would please all their friends and acquaintance would displease themselves which makes the poet at a loss whether to dissatisfy one or many his readers or his patron but since i have already found it easier to you to oblige than to receive thanks for an obligation to do no violence to your modesty i must do one to my own justice and desist from a theme which i could so willingly enlarge upon but you so unwillingly read i shall say little of the following essays either of the originals i translated them from or the translations one thing in general i find from my own experience that where there is most life and spirit in the author the translator is carried on with the greater vigor and vivacity as a man swims faster in a stream than a standing water but where the original is flat and low the translator must be at the pains to raise him so that the best things are the easiest to be done and the dullest the most difficult it were presumption in one of my years to pretend to give an account of the authors whom i have chosen or their works to commend their excellences or condemn their faults and of the two i dare venture to say the least of ovid when he himself and all that he has written have been already so well and so fully treated of in mr drydens preface before his epistles but i cannot choose but wonder that a book so extremely delightful so soft and sweet as tibullus has lain so long unattempted but there is a friend of ours whom i hope he has been all along reserved for and then he will be in the best hands he could have fallen into of the three elegies that i have ventured on the first from toward the middle to the end and the whole third pleased me infinitely the second i did merely for the sake of the last ten or twelve lines tibullus most certainly have felt all he wrote for he could never have feigned so much passion so well and i am apt to believe it was not his poetry made him so fond and tender a lover but rather his love that made him so sweet and excellent a poet were it not that i should take him out of better hands i would have attempted to have englished him all for i flatter myself with a fancy that in some things i am somewhat of his temper and how far short soever i come or him in his poetry i resemble him but too nearly in some other circumstances i was almost running into a complaint that would have been both unjust and ungrateful for since i knew you all occasion of complaint has been taken from me your acquaintance would have been of itself sufficient to endear you to any man but your favors to me began with and even outran your acquaintance i dare not proceed though on a subject which i am very loath to leave permit me to add only this that since most who ever wrote have sometimes stood in need of favors from other men and since the same fortune has attended me i am glad however that it threw me on you to receive them than whom i know none i could have been more willingly obliged to for them i am sir your most affectionate obliged humble servant charles hopkins  of mr hammond as a poet i shall have occasion to speak hereafter of his son the incomparable author of the love elegies much may be hoped for from dr johnson n    esquire by the same as when a prophet feels the god retired by whom he had a long time lain inspired his eyes no more with sacred fury roll no more divine impulses move his soul the fires that warmed him with the god are gone the deity withdrawn the charm is done so now my muse can no more rapture boast since you went hence her inspirations lost robbed of her flame all languishing she lies and swan like only sings before she dies but you my friend to different fortune move and crown your days with wine your nights with love in endless bliss unbounded time you waste your ravishing delights for ever last long long ere this you have often been possessed of all your wish could frame to make you blessed when you and southern moyle and congreve meet the best good men with the bestnaturd wit good wine good company the better feast and whenever wycherley is present best then then your joys are perfectly complete and sacred wit is at the noblest height oh how i long to be allowed to share and gain a fame by mingling with you there the country now can be no longer borne and since you first are gone i must return i come i come dear hammond to pursue pleasures i cannot know deprived of you restless as lovers till we meet i live and envy this because twill first arrive with joy i learnt dryden designs to crown all the great things he has already done no loss no change of vigor can he feel who dares attempt the sacred mantuan still see gent mag      p     n  adieu  and yet methinks i owe too much to you to part so coldly with a bare adieu but what requital can i make you more you have put all recompense beyond my power fain would my working thoughts contrive a way for every generous mans in pain to pay it is not a suitable return i give yet what it is my bestgood friend receive take the best wishes of a grateful soul congreve and moyle and you possess it whole take all the thanks a country muse can send and in accepting this oblige your friend to c c the above initials i have not been able to discover n esquire by the same in vain my friend so often i remove i find that absence full increases love the barbarous foe like an ungrateful guest too strongly lodged possesses all my breast gladly i suffered him to share my soul but now the traitor has usurped it whole i burn with pains too great to be endured and yet i neither can nor would be cured in other ills all remedies we try but fond of this we grow content to die for all were useless here to help my grief and i should strive in vain to find relief in vain i rushed amidst the thundering war endeavored all in vain to meet it there in all the heat of fight i thought on her if conquering camps refused to give me ease the town at my return affords me less without concern its wealth and pomp i see and all its pleasures are but lost on me it with my friends i should to plays resort without a smile i see the comic sport i mingle no applauses with the pit nor mind the action nor the authors wit i see the shining beauties sit around but have no room left for another wound i fly for refuge to the country now but that is savage and denies it too retirement still foments the raging fire and trees and fields and floods and verse conspire to spread the flame and heighten the desire wildly i range the woods and trace the groves to every oak i tell my hopeless loves torn by my passion to the earth i fall i kneel to all the gods i pray to all nothing but echo answers to my prayer and she speaks nothing but despair despair i give relentless heaven this last reply i do despair and will resolve to die to mrs mohun on her recovery by the same as when the queen of love engaged in war was rashly wounded with a grecian spear all parties were concerned to see her bleed and he himself did first repent the deed he left the inglorious field with grief and shame where his late conquest had destroyed his fame so sickness flies from you with such a grief ashamed that ever she began the strife better than venus in the fight you fare for though more wounded youre without a scar all claim to you the invader has resigned and left no marks of hostile rage behind no signs no tracks of tyranny remain but exiled beauty is restored again fixed in a realm which was before her own more firm than ever she secures the throne mildly ah mildly then your power maintain and take example from marias reign wide may your empire under hers be seen the fair vicegerent of the fairest queen through you may all our prayers to her be heard our humble verse be all by you preferred no blessing can the pious suppliant want where she the goddess is and you the saint to a lady by the same must all my life in fruitless love be spent and never never will your heart relent too well my charming dear your power you know and that which makes you play the tyrant so for ever be the fatal moment cursed when fondly i confessed my passion first oh that my flames had never been revealed oh that i now could keep the fire concealed resistless love your victory secures and you already know my soul is yours it shows itself through all the forced disguise breaks through my lips and trembles at my eyes my blood boils high and rages to be blessed my fluctuating thoughts will never rest and know no calm till harbored in your breast relent at last my cruel fair relent and listen kindly to my just complaint think on the passion that s already past think that the passion will for ever last o ee with what impatient fires i burn and let your pitying heart make some return m flames are so sincere my love is such some you should show  you cannot show too much how blessed should i in your possession be how happy might you make yourself in me no mistress ever led so sweet a life as you should in the exploded thing  a wife years should roll round on years and ages move les crowned in everlasting love our mutual joys should like your charms be new and all my business be to merit you what shall i say lines after lines rehearse naught but the fondness in the former verse on the dear theme i could for ever dwell for while i speak to you  my faultering tongue can never speak farewell in your cold breast let love an entrance find and think oh quickly think of growing kind my flames no more with dull indifference treat indifference is the lovers hardest fate but if my ruin is your fixed intent urge it i beg you with a closer bent all glimmerings of the faintest hope remove say that you do not will not cannot love extremely kind or in extremes severe make sure my bliss or mad me with despair forbid me banish me your charming sight shut from my view those eyes that shine so bright shut your dear image from my dreams by night drive them somewhere as far as pole from pole let winds between us rage and waters roll in distant climes let me my fate deplore in some lone island on a desert shore where i may see your fatal charms no more to the same lady i thought in silence to suppress my pain and never show my fond concern again whatever you showed  indifference or disdain but loves great god the vain resolve withstands at once inspires my breast and guides my hands my soul flows out in every line i write and rolls in numbers in my own despite then let me in poetic fury break for i can write the things i dare not speak my tongue still faulters as i move my suit and awful love confounds and keeps me mute out of your sight i can my wrongs proclaim and with unetterd words confess my flame why do you use me thus ungrateful fair oppressed with doubts yet buried bove despair like wounded fowl upon the flood i lie floating on wings with which they used to fly who would find ease could they but drown and die such still has been your conquering beautys spite cruel to wound not kind to kill outright be merciful and save or sink me quite toss not twixt hope and fear my laboring heart let us for ever join or ever part you know i love you and you love me too which you have kindly let me know you do all this i know oh there will be the fall from heaven to hell  should i be doomed to lose you after all but be not by mistaken notions led nor think that riches bless the nuptial bed this shall my only consolation be no fool of fortune can your merit see not have the wit and sense to love like me oh would that you had been but meanly born naked of friends abandoned and forlorn eft to the world  then should this wish ensue oh would i had a world to offer you you know this is no false poetic flight you know i feel more than the muse can write too well my cruel dear you keep the field too long hold out it is now high time to yield consent at last to mutual oys resign and let the smallest share of bliss be mine unalterable love your part secures my interest humor all my soul is yours i beg you let me know my doom at last naught worse than death can come then all is past but think and do not make a rash decree o think you never were nor ever can be so truly loved as you have been by me to doctor gibbons this is i believe dr w gibbons who died march        he succeeded ratcliffe in his attendance on queen anne when she was disgusted by the behavior of the latter he is characterized in the dispensary under the name of mmilo see what ratcliffe said of him life of ratcliffe p    r  by the same the fires that fell in ages past from heaven were to the charge of priests and augurs given life the most active most exalted fire the great creating godhead could inspire breathed into man while yet the world was new is now committed to the care of you how you discharge your trust maintain your post though you are silent i have cause to boast again the rising muse expands her wings again prepares to mount and mounting sings again would celebrate some sacred name and chooses you who raised her for her theme there are two poems expressive of gratitude to this physician in the works of the muses by mr john hopkins n  ye conscious poets be no longer vain confess your weakness and your pride contain quit your bold claim and end your idle strife it is not yours to give immortal life even you to him on all occasions fly without whose aid you and your muses die his succor is implored where wit declines where lovers languish and where beauty pines where monarchs faint beneath the weight of crowns and sicken in their robes on silver thrones his sacred art their sacred lives sustains and strengthens them again to guide the reins as iris entered with her golden beams the cave of sleep and chased away the dreams inases seem to fly at his approach and ccling blood keeps measure at his touch  laps the lovers heart so beats and moves when he lies folded in her arms he loves s influenced by the moon wide oceans oll and so the needle trembles to the pole o gibbons i am raised there s naught i see above my reach when thus revived by thee now could i paint a welldisputed field o praise proud beauties till i made them yield but gratitude a different song requires m breast enlarges and dilates my fires  the first blessing humankind can boast  which can never be restored when lost eneard by health from pain and sickness free is the blst gift bestowed by heaven and thee how shall i then or heaven or you regard the care of both has been beyond reward but grateful poets offering up their lays find you content with thanks and heaven with praise o may your stream of life run smooth but strong long may you live  that others may live long till healing plants no more on mountains grow till mineral waters have forgot to flow and paint the valleys where they glide below while silver helicon delights the taste and while the muses sacred mount shall last their songs for thee the sisters shall design the grateful subject of the tuneful nine often shall thou fill their songs  and always mine to mr congreve by the same let other poets other patrons choose get their best price and prostitute their muse with flattering hopes and fruitless labor wait and court the slippery friendship of the great some trifling present by my lord is made and then the patron thinks the poet paid on you my surer nobler hopes depend for you are all i wish you are a friend from you my muse her inspiration drew all she performs i consecrate to you you taught me first my genius and my power taught me to know my own but gave me more others may sparingly their wealth impart but he gives noblest who bestows an art nature and you alone can that confer and i owe you what you yourself owe her o congreve could i write in verse like thine then in each page in every charming line should gratitude and sacred friendship shine your lines run all on easy even feet clear is your sense and your expression sweet rich is your fancy and your numbers go serene and smooth as crystal waters flow smooth as a peaceful sea which never rolls and soft as kind consenting virgins souls nor does your verse alone our passions move beyond the poet we the person love in you and almost only you we find sublimity of wit and candor of the mind both have their charms and both give that delight it is pity that you should or should not write but your strong genius fortunes power defies and in despite of poetry you rise to you the favor of the world is shown enough for any merit but your own your fortune rises equal with your fame the best of poets but above the name o may you never miss deserved success but raise your fortunes till i wish them less here should i not to tire your patience end but who can part so soon with such a friend you know my soul like yours without design you know me yours and i too know you mine i owe you all i am and needs must mourn my want of power to make you some return since you gave all do not a part refuse but take this slender offering of the muse friendship from servile interest free secures my love sincerely and entirely yours to mr yalden in oxon by the same from londonderry august        my laboring muse grown tired of being hurled and tossed about in a tempestuous world prays for a calm implores some quiet seat and seeks what yours has found a sweet retreat now your blessed fields their summer livery wear their fruits your loaded trees in season bear but learning flourishes throughout the year from your full spring over britains isle it streams and spreads like isis when she meets the thames reared on her banks the muses laurel grows adorned by yours adorning others brows sweet are her streams sweet the surrounding air but sweeter are the songs she echoes there there the great ormonds daily praise is sung there addisons harmonious harp is strung and there lucretius translated by creech n learnt the english tongue well might i here the large account pursue but you have

both the theme and inspirer of poetry so it ought to be the patroness too and a poem of love should in justice be sacred to none but the loveliest it would therefore be adoring a false deity should i offer up this at any shrine but yours as it is the best i can do and written on the most pleasing subject i was resolved to lay it at the feet of the most beautiful and had i been myself at a loss where to fix the universal opinion of the world would have directed me and pointed out your grace for the patroness while the poem shall last and a poem of love ought to last longer than any other succeeding ages shall read that your grace was the ornament of this age it is an innocent and harmless ambition in poets whose only design in all they do is the pleasing others and in doing that please themselves best and as beauty is the chief object they bend their studies to delight all poets ought to aspire to please your grace in particular that ambition is the best excuse i can make for my presumption in this dedication since i am unknown to your grace and perhaps even unheard of yet but what is my crime is at the same time my plea for pardon or rather it is my merit the athenians when they dedicated an altar to the unknown god showed more devotion and directed their devotion to a truer deity than when they adored the many they knew that i might be sure of something acceptable in this offering and not fail to delight in a poem of love where all ought to be delightful i have taken all the most moving tender things that ovid and ibullus said to their mistresses to say to mine nor will i allow it to be a theft since i doubt not as it was their love that inspired them with those thoughts mine would have infused the same into me and no man that thinks naturally of love can avoid running into the same thoughts with them i have borrowed the examples to every passion from those stories which i thought the most pleasing in ovid where certainly the most pleasing were to be met with some few places in every story i have translated but for the most part i have only kept him in view i have gone on with him and left him where i thought it proper and by that means have avoided the absurdities of his metamorphoses save only that of pigmalions statue but that was a metamorphosis that pleased me it was a delightful surprise to see life breathed into an inanimate beauty as it would be a killing affliction to see it taken away from one already animated it would occasion as much joy and wonder to have a duchess of grafton made by art if art could do it as it would cause consternation to have the gods unmake one but those miracles of art are now ceased and none but the heavenly artist could have drawn you who has drawn you so that he has left the painter and the poet at a loss to copy you as to the success of this poem i hope i am secure since it is sacred in general to the fair sex and committed in particular to the protection of the fairest if they are once pleased who will dare to find fault or disoblige them by disliking what they approve under the shelter of your graces patronage i shall stand like aeneas guarded by the goddess of love and no diomedes shall be found as desperate as the first to wound me through you thus as all dedicating poets who write more to raise their own reputation than their patrons i have taken the most effectual means to establish mine and doubt not to make a strong party since every lover will defend what is sacred to the lovely your graces most devoted most humble servant  charles hopkins   thy forest windsor and

while woods shall grow while stars shall shine and while the seas shall flow while there remains alive a tender maid o amorous youth or lovesick swain to read others may artfully the passions move in

thou who alone do all my thoughts infuse and art at once my mistress and my muse inspired from thee flows every sacred line thine is the poetry the poet thine thy service shall my only business be and all my life employed in pleasing thee crowned with my songs of thee each day shall move and every listening sun hear naught but love with flowing numbers every page shall roll where as you read my

my fame believe me delia lovers have their wars and cupid has his camp as well as mars that age which suits a soldier best will prove the fittest for the sharp fatigues of love none but young men the toils of war can bear none but young men can serve and please the fair youth with the foe maintains the vigorous fight youth gives the longing maid the full delight on either hand like hardship it sustains great are the soldiers great the lovers pains the event of war no general can foreknow and that alas of love is doubtful too in various fields whatever chance shall fall the soldier must resolve to bear it all with the like constancy must lovers wait enduring bad and hoping better fate through doubts and fears desires and wishes tossed undaunted they must strain to reach the coast all will a while look hideous to their eye the threatening storm still thickening in the sky no sight of land no friendly harbor nigh yet through all this the venturous lover steers to reap the golden crop that beauty bears so the bold mariners the seas explore though winds blow hard and waves like thunder roar rather than live in poverty on shore emboldened thus let every youth set sail and trust to fortune for a prosperous gale let them launch boldly from the lazy shore nor fear a storm which will at last blow over set all the reins to all their passions free give wings to their desires and love like me happy that youth who when his stars incline his soul to love can make a choice like mine admiration thee delia all that see thee must admire and mankind in its own despite desire as a blind man restored to sudden sight starts in amaze at the first flash of light so was i struck such sudden wonder knew when my eyes dazzled with the sight of you i aw whatever could inflame desire up the veins and set the blood on fire from every charm the pointed lightning came and fast as they dispersed i caught the flame like stars your glittering eyes were seen to shine and oll with motions that were all divine where majesty and softness mingled meet and show a soul at once sublime and sweet i gazed and as i gazed from every view nw wonders i descried new passion drew  were the charms less powerful of your tongue my ravished soul on every accent hung glowed when you spoke and melted when you sung those lips unopend cannot fail to move but silently are eloquent in love that face and neck those shoulders hands and arms each limb each feature has peculiar charms ach of itself might singly win a soul and never need the assistance of the whole on this one part a poets praise might dwell did not this other part deserve as well beauty is surely near allied to wit of which none can the just description hit by their own selves they may be shown the best and only are in being seen expressed beautys true charms no poem can present which but imperfectly are done in paint that too comes short of life and only takes faint images of those which nature makes an imitation of part of the fourth book of ovids metamorphoses book iv n propitious chance led perseus once to view the fairest piece that ever nature drew chained on a rocky shore the virgin stood naked and whiter than the foaming flood whom as he coursd the confines of the sky amazed he saw and kept his wondering eye so fixed he had almost forgot to fly had not the winds dispersed her flowing hair and held it waving in the liquid air or had not streams of tears apace rolled down her lovely cheeks he would have thought her stone straight he precipitates his hasty flight impatient to attain a nearer sight now all at once he feels the raging fires sees all the maid and all he sees admires with awe and wonder mixed with love and fear he stands as motionless as shame made her urgdon at last but still by slow degrees loath to offend he draws to what he sees  oh why he cries most matchless fairone why are you thus used can you be doomed to die have you done any guilt that guilt relate how can such beauty merit such a fate i am thy champion and espouse thy cause in thy defense the thunderers offspring draws say if thou rt rescued by the son of jove say for thy life will thou return thy love the bashful virgin no return affords but sends ten thousand sighs instead of words with grief redoubled with her shame she mourns she weeps he joys she blushes and he burns in chains extended at her length she lay while he with transport took a full survey fain would her hands her conscious blushes hide but that the fetters which they wore denied what could she do all that she could she did for drowned in floods of tears her eyes she hid much urged to speak she turned her bashful look far as she could aside and trembling spoke  my mother conscious of her beauty strove alas too conscious with the wife of jove who by a cruel and unjust decree to punish her takes this revenge on me here am i doomed a dreadful monsters prey who now now now is issuing from the sea haste generous youth our common foe subdue and if

jealousies an endless train desire from ovids metamorphoses book x n how thou art envied let pigmalion prove who by a miracle obtained his love who living in an age when women led the lewdest lives all shame and honor fled for a long time declined the nuptialbed he saw them all debauched with monstrous crimes no virtuous maid no delia blessed the times had she lived then his skill had never been shown nor the strange miracle that crowned it known there had he fixed not formed his fancied maid nor fondly been by his own art betrayed the nymph in polished ivory glittered bright so smooth she seemed too slippery for his sight so curious was her shape so just her frame so quick her eyes appeared so full of flame they would have rolled if not restrained by shame from his strange art the statue had received such lively strokes one would have thought it lived even he himself could hardly hardly know but doubted long whether it lived or no yet from her as she was he gathered fires and fierce and boundless were his mad desires he felt her flesh his fancy thought it such and feared to hurt her with too rude a touch he kissed her with belief so strong and vain that he imagined how she kissed again now makes his court his mad addresses moves and tells a long fond tale how well he loves presents her now with all he thought might please with procious gums distilled from weeping trees small singingbirds who strain their tuneful throats and hovering round repeat their pretty notes with sweetest flowers he crowns her lovely head and lays her on the softest downy bed in richest robes his charming idol dressed bright sparkling gems adorn her neck and breast and she  looked well in all but looked when naked best now venus kept her feast a goodly train of lovesick youths frequent and fill her fane the snowwhite heifers fall by sacred strokes while with rich gums the loadend altar smokes among the rest the hopeless lover stands tears in his eyes and offerings in his hands more furious than before he feels his fires even his despair redoubles his desires a long long time his orisons deferred he durst not pray lest he should not be heard till urged by love his timorous silence broke thus but still timorously at last he spoke  if you ye sacred powers that rule above and you great goddess of propitious love if all we want is placed within your power and you can give whatever we implore exert your godhead now now lend your aid give me the wife i wish one like  he said but durst not say give me my ivory maid this finished thrice auspicious flashes rise and wreaths of curling smoke ascended thrice half hoping now and yet still half afraid with doubtful joy he seeks his ivory maid doats more than ever on her fancied charms and closely clasps her in his longing arms when all at once with joy and wonder filled he feels her stubborn sides begin to yield soft was her bosom grown her throbbing breast heaved with her breath swelled gently to be pressed surpised and glad he feels her often and often and more and more perceives her warm and soft warm were her lips and every pointed kiss with melting touches met and moistened his her blood now circled and her pulses beat and life at last enjoyed a settled seat slowly she lifts her new and fearful sight and sees at once her lover and the light an unborn maid both life and lover found and he too had his desperate wishes crowned desperate indeed what prospect could he see or how at first hope any more than me hope from ovids metamorphoses book x n hippomanes alone with hope inspired might well rejoice to find his wishes fired since well assured of all his wish desired his passion was all life all soul and flame he dauntless to the fatal barriers came with joy his vanquished rivals he beheld assured to win where all besides had failed he saw the lovely nymph outfly the wind and leave her breathless suitors far behind saw atalanta swift as lightning pass yet soft as zephyrs sweep along the grass he knew the law whose cruelty decreed that every youth who lost the race should bleed yet if like them he could not run so fast he saw her worth the dying for at last her every charm his praise and wonder moved and still the more he praised the more he loved now had he viewed the last unhappy strife and seen the vanquished youth resign his life when with his love transported from his place lest any other first should claim the race rising he runs regardless of their fate and presses where the panting virgin sat with eyes all sparkling with his hope and love and such a look as could not fail to move  tell me he cries why barbarous beauty why are you so pleased to see these wretches die why have you with my feeble rivals strove betrayed to death by their too daring love with me a less unequal race begin with me exert your utmost speed to win by my defeat you will your conquests crown and in my fall establish your renown then undisturbed you may your conquests boast for none will dare to strive when i have lost thus while the prince his bold defiance spoke she eyes him with a soft relenting look already does his distant fate deplore concerned for him though never concerned before doubtful she stands and knows not what to choose and cannot wish to win nor yet to lose but murmurs to herself ye powers divine how hard alas a destiny is mine why must i longer such a law obey and daily throw so many lives away why must i by their deaths my nuptials shun or else by marrying be mysef undone why must i still my cruelty pursue why must a prince so charming perish too such is his youth his beauty valor such even to myself i seem not worth so much fly lovely stranger ere it is yet too late fly from thy too ah too too certain fate i would not send thee hence i would not give such a command could thou but stay and live thou with some fairer maid wilt happier be the fairest maid might be in love with thee so many suitors have already bled who rashly ventred for my nuptial bed i fear lest thou should run like them in vain should lose like them and ah like them be slain yet why should he alone my pity move it is but pity sure it is not love i wish bold youth thou would the race decline or rather wish thy speed could equal mine would thou had never seen this fatal place nor i alas thy too too charming face were i by rigorous fate allowed to wed thou should alone enjoy and bless my bed were it but left to my own partial choice thou of all mankind should obtain my voice twas here she paused when urged with long delay the trumpets sound to hasten them away strait at the summons is the race begun and side by side for some short time they run while the spectators from the barriers cry fly prosperous youth with all thy vigor fly make haste make haste thy utmost speed enforce love give thee wings to win the noble course see how unwillingly the virgin flies pursue and save thy life and seize the prize it is doubtful yet whether the general voice made the glad youth or virgin most rejoice often in the swiftest fury of the race the nymph would slacken her impetuous pace and halt and gaze and almost fasten on his face then fleet away again as swift as wind not without sighs to leave him so behind by this he saw his strength would never prevail but still he had a charm that could not fail from his loose robe a golden apple drawn with force he hurled along the flowery lawn strait at the sight the virgin could not hold but starts aside to catch the rolling gold he takes the wished occasion passes by while all the field resounded shouts of joy this she recovers with redoubled haste till he far off the second apple cast again the nymph diverts her near pursuit and running bak secures the tempting fruit but her strange speed recovers her again again the foremost in the flowery plain now near the goal he summons all his might and prays to venus to direct him right with his last apple to retard her flight though sure to lose if she the race declined for such a bribe the victory she resigned pleased that she lost to the glad victors arms she gives the prize and yields her dearbought charms he by resistless gold the conquest gained in vain he ran till that the race obtained possessed of that he could not but subdue for gold alas would conquer delia too yet oh thou bestbelovd thou loveliest maid be not by too much avarice betrayed prize thyself high no easy purchase prove nor let a fool with fortune buy thy love like atalantas conqueror let him be brave generous young from every failing free and to complete him let him love like me what pains against my wretched self i take even i myself my jealousies awake such men there are blessed with such gifts divine who if they knew thee would be surely thine jealousy how wretched then alas should daphnis grow gods how the very thought distracts him now even now perhaps some youth with happier charms lies folded in the faithless delias arms even now the favors you denied me seem to be too prodigally heaped on him close by your side all languishing he stands and on your panting bosom warms his hands straight in your lap he lays his envied head and makes the shrine of love his sacred bed then glows his ravished soul with pointed flames and thoughts of heavenly joys fill all his dreams let not your passion be to me revealed but if you love keep him you love concealed from cephaluss tragic story read what fatal mischiefs jealousy may breed hear that unhappy wretched huntsman tell how by his hands his muchloved procris fell hear him lamenting his mischance complain in the soft ovids sadly charming strain from ovids metamorphoses book x n happy a while thrice happy was my life blessed in a beautiful and virtuous wife love joined us first and love made life so sweet we praised the gods that t was our lot to meet our breasts glowed gently with a mutual flame the same were our desires our fears the same whatever one did the other would approve for one our liking was as one our love then happy days were crowned with happier nights and some few months rolled on in full delights joys crowded to appear and pleasures ran a while in circles ere our woes began till i one fatal morn the chase pursued of a wild boar through an adjacent wood where as i hunted eager on my prey aurora stopped me in my hasty way you may believe i do not dare not feign for misery never made a man so vain she though a goddess straight began to move a fruitless suit and vainly talked of love though she looked bright as when she shines on high in all the glories of a morning sky though earlier than the suns her beams display and show the first approaches of the day i told her procris all my soul possessed that she alone reigned sovereign of my breast which never would admit another guest  enjoy thy procris then the goddess cried whom thou shall one day wish the had never enjoyed stung with her words with doubts and fears oppressed a sudden jealousy destroys my rest mads all my brain and poisons all my breast i thought the sex all false even procris too again i thought she could not but be true her youth and beauty kindled anxious cares but her known chastity condemned my fears but then my absence does again revive and keep the torturing fancy still alive i thought her faith too firmly fixed to fall yet a true lover is afraid of all i knew not what to think but straight i go resolved to cure or to complete my woe an habit different from my own i took while with cursed aid aurora changed my look to athens straight unknown by all i came even to myself i scarce could seem the same hardly i got admission to my house but far far harder to my weeping spouse the house itself from aught of blame was free and every place expressed its grief for me a dismal silence reigned through every room to mourn my loss already safe at home even that sad pomp of woe some charms could boast but when my procris come she charmed me most black were her robes her solemn pace was slow her dress was careless yet becoming too a virtuous grief dwelt deeply in her face but matchless beauty gave that grief a grace whole showers of tears her streaming eyes let fall yet something wondrous lovely shone through all scarce could i at the charming sight forbear from running to embrace my mournful fair scarce hold from telling whom she saw though altered there but yet at length my first design pursued with words i flattered and with gifts i wooed all the most moving arguments i used often prayed and pressed but was as often refused she said another had before engrossed all her affection and my suit was lost would any but a madman farther try but ah that mad that desperate fool was i i grew the more industrious to destroy her matchless truth and ruin all my joy redoubled presents and redoubled vows i made and offered to betray my spouse at last her staggering faith began to yield and i ad just won the long disputed field  thy falsehood straight i cried too late i see false to thy cephalus for i am he since you are perjured since my procris grew forsworn and false what woman can be true she at these words almost of sense bereaved with sad confusion found herself deceived fixed on the ground she kept her downcast eye and silent with her shame made no reply but to the mountains like an huntress hies and for my sake from all mankind she slies which when i found abandoned and alone my dearer half through my own folly gone love fiercer than before began to burn till i was raging for my wifes return my prayers dispatched with eagerness and haste that she would pardon all offenses past found her as kind as she was truly chaste she came and crowned my joys a second time forgot my jealousy forgave my crime twas then i thought my greatest miseries over but fate it seems had worse far worse in store soon as each early sun began to rise to glad the enlightened earth and gild the skies i with his first appearance rise and trace the woods and hills that yielded game to chase alone i hunt a long and tedious way and seldom fail to kill sufficient prey then spent with toil to cooler shades retreat and seek a refuge from the scorching heat where pleasant valleys breathe a freer air for my refreshment i address this prayer see this burlesqued english poets vol xx p     n  come air i cry joy of oerlabourd swains come and diffuse thyself through all my veins breathe on my burning lips and feverish breast and reign at large an evergrateful guest glide to my soul and every vital part distill thyself upon my panting heart by chance i other blandishments bestow or destiny decreed it should be so as o thou greatest pleasure of the plains thou who assuagest all my raging pains thou who do natures richest sweets excite and make me in these desert woods delight breathless and dead without thee should i be for all the life i have i draw from thee while this i sung some one who chanced to hear thought her a nymph to whom i made my prayer and told my procris of her rival air she kind good soul half dying at the news would now condemn me now again excuse now hopes it is all a falsehood now she fears suspects my faith as i suspected hers resolved at last to trust no busy tongue but be herself the witness of her wrong when the next day with fatal haste came on and i was to my loved diversion gone she rose and sought the solitary shade where after hunting i was daily laid close in a thicket undiscerned she stood when i took shelter in the shady wood then stretching on the grass my fainting weight  come muchloved air i cry oh come abate with thy sweet breath this most immoderate heat at this a sudden noise invades my ear and rustling boughs showed something living there i rashly thinking it some savage beast threw my unerring dart with heedless haste which pierced oh gods my procris through the breast she at the wound with fearful shriekings fell and i alas knew the dear voice too well thither distracted with my grief i flew to give my dying love a sad adieu all bloody was her lately snowy breast her soul was hastening to eternal rest with rage i tore my robe which close i bound to stop the blood about the gaping wound what pardons did i beg what curses frame for my damned fate that was alone in blame when weakly raising up her dying head with a faint voice these few sad words she said  draw nearer yet dear author of my death hear my lastsigns and snatch my parting breath but ere i die by all that s sacred swear that you will never let my rival air profane my bed or find reception there this i conjure you by your nuptial vow the faith you gave me then renew me now by all your love if any love remain and by that love which dying i retain assure me but of this before i go and i shall bless thee for the fatal blow to her sad speech abruptly i replied in haste to show her error ere she died quickly i ran the tragic story over which made her pleased amidst the pangs she bore that done she rolls in death her dizzy eyes and with a sigh which i received she dies here did the youth his doleful tale conclude a tale too doleful to be long pursued but this illchosen instance will not do unless my delia could be jealous too but she whenever i woo some other fair shows no resentment and betrays no care she sees me court another as unmoved as she has always seen herself beloved that dreadful thought redoubles all my fear that drowns my hopes and drives me to despair despair no foreign instance need of this be shown to draw it best i must describe my own though of this kind all ages can produce examples proper for the mourning muse yet all to me must the first place resign none ever was so just so deep as mine all day and night i sing and all day long  i love and i despair makes all my song revolving days the same sad music hear unchanged those notes i love and i despair to me as to the echo fate affords no power of speech but for those doleful words some glimpse of sun some cheerful beams appear even through the gloomiest season of the year my clouded life admits no dawn of light no ray can pierce through my eternal night all there is dismal as the shades beneath and all is dark as hell and sad as death my anxious hours roll heavily away deprived of sleep by night and peace by day my soul no respite from her sufferings knows and sees no end of her eternal woes i a long line they run for ever on and ll increase and lengthen as they run by flght to lose my ills in vain i try from my despairing self i cannot fly wherever i go i bear about my flame in cities countries seas it is still the same scorched with my burning pains i shun my house and strive in open air to seek repose my lames like torches shook in open air grow with dilated heat more furious there now to the most retired remotest place even to obscurity i fly for ease retirement still foments the raging fire and trees and fields and floods and verse conspire to spread the flame and heighten the desire wildly i range the woods and trace the groves to every oak i tell my hopeless loves torn by my passion to the earth i fall i kneel to all the gods i pray to all nothing but echo answers to my prayer and she speaks nothing but despair despair from woods and wilds i no relief receive but wander on to try what seas can give deep through the tide not knowing where i walk to the deaf winds not knowing what i talk mad as the foaming main aloud i rave while every tear keeps time with every wave from ovids metamorphoses book x n so in old times the mournful orpheus stood drowning his sorrows in the stygian flood whose lamentable story seems to be the nearest instance of a wretch like me already had he passed the courts of death and charmed with sacred verse the powers beneath while hell with silent admiration hung on the soft music of his harp and tongue and the black roofs restored the wondrous song no longer tantalus essayed to sip the springs that fled from his deluded lip their urn the fifty maids no longer fill ixion leaned and listned on his wheel and sysiphuss stone for once stood still the ravenous vulture had forsook his meal and titius felt his growing liver heal relenting fiends to torture souls forbore and furies wept who never wept before all hell in harmony was heard to move with equal sweetness as the spheres above nor longer was his charming prayer denied all hell consented to release his bride yet could the youth but short possession boast for what his poem gained his passion lost ere they restored her back to him and life they made him on these terms receive his wife if till he quite had passed the shades of night and reached the confines of ethereal light he turned to view his prize his wretched prize again was doomed to vanish from his eyes long had he wandered on and long forborne to look but was at last compelled to turn and now arrived where the suns piercing ray struck through the gloom and made a doubtful day backwards his eyes the impatient lover cast for one dear look and that one look his last straight from his sight flies his unhappy wife who now lived twice and twice was robbed of life in vain to catch the fleeting shade he sought she too in vain bent backwards to be caught gods what tumultuous raging passions tossed his anxious heart when he perceived her lost how wildly did his dreadful eye balls roll how did all hell at once oppress his soul to what sad height was his distraction grown how deep his just despair how near my own in vain with her he labored to return all he could do was to sit down and mourn in vain but never before in vain he sings at once the saddest and the sweetest things  stay dear eurydice he cries ah stay why fleets the lovely shade so fast away why am not i permitted to pursue why will not rigorous hell receive me too already has she reached the farther shore and i alas allowed to pass no more imprisoned closer in the dismal coast she is now for ever ever ever lost no charms a second time can set her free hell has her now again would hell had me from all his pains let titius be released and in his stead unhappier orpheus placed he feels no torture i will refuse to bear her loss is worse than all he suffers there is this your bounty then ye powers below and these the shortlived blessings you bestow why did you such a cruel covenant make which you but too well knew i needs must break ah by this artifice too late i find your envious nature never was inclined to be entirely good or thoroughly kind had you persisted to refuse the grant i should not then have known the double want this was contrived by some malicious power to swell my woes and make my miseries more plunged in despair far deeper than at first and blessed a short short while to be for ever cursed ah yet again relent again restore my wretched bride be bounteous as before ah let the force of verse as powerful be over you as was the force of love over me and the dear forfeit once again resign which but for too much love had still been mine by that immense and awful sway you bear that silent horror that inhabits here by these vast realms and that unquestioned right by which you rule this everlasting night by these my tears and prayers which once could move once more i beg you to release my love let her a little while with me remain a little while and she is yours again the date of mortal life is finished soon swift is the race and short the time to run inevitable fate your right secures and she and i and all at last are yours so sung the charming youth in such a strain but sung and charmed the second time in vain no longer could he move the powers below lost were his numbers then as mine are now torn with despair he leaves the stygian lakes and back to light a loathsome journey takes no light could cheer him in his cruel woes who bears about his grief wherever he goes in sacred verse his sad complaints he vents and all the day and all the night laments incessantly he sings whose moving song draws trees and stones and listening herds along the sylvan gods and woodnymphs stood around and melting maids were ravished at the sound all heard the wondrous notes and all that heard with utmost art addressed the mournful bard not all their charms his constancy could move who fled the thoughts of any second love when mad to see him slight their raging fire to mortal hate converting fierce desire with their own hands they made the youth expire such proofs my delia would i gladly give for thee i would die without thee will not live i have felt already the severest smart death can inflict for it was death to part the parting what souls about to leave their bodies bear forced to forsake their longlovd mansions there the dying anguish the convulsive pain and all the racking tortures they sustain and most of all the doubt the dreadful fear when thrust out thence to go they know not where my soul such pangs such sad distractions knew forced by despairing love to part with you fixed on that face where i could ever dwell charmed into silence by some magic spell i sighed and shook and could not say farewell down my sad cheeks did tears in torrents roll and deaths cold damp sat heavy on my soul my trembling eyes swam in a native flood as fast as they wept tears my heart wept blood all signs of desperate grief possessed my face my sinking feet seemed rooted to their place and scarce could bear me to the last embrace gods where was then my soul that parting kiss was both the last and dearest taste of bliss ah since that fatal time i could not boast of love or life or soul all all is lost when the last moment that i had to stay called me like one condemned to death away with staggering steps i did my path pursue yet often i turned to take another view often gazed and sighed and murmured but adieu thus young achilles in bithynias court had made a private and a long resort dressed like a maid the better to improve with his fair princess undiscovered love where hours and days he might secure receive the mighty bliss that mutual love could give where in full joys the youthful pair remained and naught a while but laughing pleasures reigned till at the last the gods were envious grown to see the bliss of man surpass their own all greece was now with helens rape alarmed and all its princes to revenge her armed when spiteful powers foretold them their descent would be in vain unless achilles went in vain they might the phrygian coasts invade scale troy in vain no onset could be made that should succeed without that heros aid and now ulysses by a crafty flight had found him out in his disguises spite who though betrayed by his unhappy fate had too much sense of honor to retreat which when his charming deidamia knew she to her latediscoverd achilles had a long time lain disguised like a woman in the court of nicomedes king of bthynia making use of that habit the better to carry on his amors with deidamia nicomedess daughter but he was at last discovered by the subtilty of ulysses who putting a sword into his hands which he wielded too dexterously for a woman so betrayed him and carried him to the trojan war the greeks having been warned by the oracle that troy should never be taken unless achilles assisted at the siege hopkins lover flew on his dear neck her snowy arms she hung and streaming tears awhile restrained her tongue but at the last her dismal silence broke these mournful words the weeping princess spoke  whither ah whither would achilles flee from all he is dearest to from love and me are not my charms the same the same their power have i lost mine or has bellona more oh let me not so poorly be forsook but view me view me with your usual look would you unkind from these embraces break is glory grown so strong or i so weak glory is not your only call i fear you go to meet some other mistress there go then ungrateful though from me you fly you will never meet with one so fond as i but some campmistress lavish of her charms devoted to a thousand rival arms then will you think when she is common grown on deidamia who was all your own thus will i clasp thee to my panting breast and thus detain thee to my bosom pressed and while i fold thee thus and thus dispense these kisses to restore thy wandering sense what dismal sound of war shall snatch thee hence what though the gods have ordered you should go or greece return inglorious from her foe have not the selfsame cruel gods decreed that if you went you should as surely bleed then since your fate is destined to be such ah think can any troy be worth so much let greece whatever she please for vengeance give secure at home shall my achilles live troy built by heavenly hands may stand or fall you never shall obey the fatal call your deidamia swears you shall not go life would be dear to you if she were so if not your own at least my safety prize for with achilles deidamia dies all this and more the lovely mournful maid told the sad youth who sighed at all she said yet would he not his resolution break where all his fame and honor lay at stake now would he think on arms but when he gave a sidelong glance on her he was to leave then his tumultuous thoughts began to jar and love and glory held a doubtful war till with a deepdrawn sigh and mighty course of tears which nothing else but love could force to the dear maid he turns his watery eyes and to her sad discourse as sad replies  thou late best blessing of my joyful heart now grown my grief since i must now depart behold the pangs i bear look up and see how much i grieve to go and comfort me curse on that cunning traitors smooth deceit whose craft has made me to my ruin great curse on that artifice by which i fell curse on these hands for wielding swords so well though i should never so fit for battle prove all my ambition s to be fit for love in his soft wars i would my life beguile with thee contend in the transporting toil ravished to read my triumph in thy smile boldly i would strive yet even when conquering yield to thee the glory of the bloodless field with liquid fires melt thy rich beauties down rifle thy wealth yet give thee all my own so should our wars be rapture and delight but now i am summoned to another fight it is not my fault that i am forced away but when my honor calls i must obey durst i not death and every danger brave i were not worthy of the bliss i have more hazards than another would i meet only to lay more laurels at your feet oh do not fear that i should faithless prove for you my only life have all my love the thought of you shall help me to subdue i will conquer faster to return to you but if my honors should be laid in dust and i must fall as heaven has said i must even in my death my only grief will be that i for ever shall be snatched from thee that that alone occasions all my fears shakes my resolves and melts me into tears my beating heart pants to thee as i speak and wishes rather than depart to break feel how it trembles with a panic fright sure it will never fail me thus in fight i cannot longer hold this fond discourse for now the trumpets sound our sad divorce sound every trumpet there beat every drum use all your charms to make achilles come farewell alas i have not time to tell how wondrous loath i part once more farewell remember me as i will remember you like me be constant and like me be true gods i shall never be gone adieu adieu adieu absence happy that amorous youth whose mistress hear his swelling sighs and sees his falling tears what savage maid her pity can deny a breaking heart and a still streaming eye absent alas hs spends them all in vain while the dear cause is ignorant of his pain yet wretched as he is he might be blessed would he himself contribute to his rest would he resolve to struggle through the net and but a while endeavor to forget but his mad thoughts run every passage over and anxious memory makes his passion more perplexing memory that renews the scene of his past cares and keeps him still in pain keeps a poor wretch perpetually oppressed and never lets unhappy lovers rest lets them no pangs no cruel sufferings lose but heaps their past upon their present woes such was leanders memory when removed and sunderd by the seas from all he loved the gathered winds had wrought the tempest high tossed up the ocean and obscured the sky and at this time with an impetuous sway poured sorth their forces and possessed the sea when the bold youth stood raging on the beach to view the muchloved coast he could not reach his restless eyes ran all the distance over and from afar discerned his heros tower thrice naked in the waves his skill he tried and strove as he was used to stem the tide but tumbling billows threatened present wreck and rising up against him dashed him back then like a gallant soldier forced to go full of brave wrath from a prevailing foe again to town he makes his sad resort to see what ships would loosen from the port finding but one durst launch into the seas he writes a letter filled with words like these in imitation of ovid ep xviii leander to hero n  read this yet be not troubled when you read your lover comes not in his letters stead on you all health all happiness attend which i would much much rather bring than send but now these envious storms obstruct my way and only this bold bark durst put to sea i too had come had not my parents spies stood by to watch me with suspicious eyes how many tedious days and nights are past since i was suffered to behold you last y spightful gods and goddesses who keep your watery courts within the spacious deep why at this time are all the winds broke forth why swell the seas beneath the furious north it is summer now when all should be serene the skys unclouded undisturbed the main winter is yet unwilling to appear but you invert the seasons of the year yet let me once attain the wished for beach out of the now malicious neptunes reach then blow ye winds ye troubled billows roar roll on your angry waves and lash the shore ruffle the seas drive the tempestuous air be one continued storm to keep me there ah hero when to you my course is bent i seem to slide along a smooth descent but in returning thence i clamber up and scale methinks some lofty mountains top why when our souls by mutual love are joined why are we sunderd by the sea and wind either make my abydos your retreat or let your sestos be my muchloved seat this plague of absence i can bear no more come what can come i will shortly venture over not all the rage of seas nor force of storms nothing but death shall keep me from thy arms yet may that death at least so friendly prove to float me to the coast of her i love let not the thought occasion any fear doubt not i will be soon and safely there but till that time let this employ your hours and show you that i can be none but yours mean while the vessel from the land withdrew when heaven took pity on a love so true the winds to blow the waves to toss forbore in leaps the ravished youth and ventures over with a smooth passage to the farther shore now to the port the prosperous lover drives and safely after all his toils arrives dissolved in bliss he lies the livelong night melts languishes and dies in vast delight but that delight my muse forbears to sing she knows the weakness of her infant wing as when the painter strove to draw the chief of all the grecians in his height of grief in every limb the wellshapd piece excelled but coming to the face his pencil failed there modestly he staid and held for fear he should not reach the woe he fancied there but round the mournful head a veil he threw that men might guess at what he could not show so when our pleasure rises to excess no tongue can tell it and no pen express love will not have his mysteries revealed and beauty keeps the joys it gives concealed and till those joys my delia lets me know to me they shall continue ever so ah delia would indulgent love decree thy faithful slave that heaven of bliss with thee what then should be my verse what daring flights should my muse take reach what celestial heights now in despair with drooping notes she sings no dawn of hope to raise her on her wings in the warm spring the warbling birds rejoice and in the smiling sunshine tune their voice bakd in the beams they strain their tender throats where cheerful light inspires the charming notes such and so charming should my numbers be if you my only light would smile on me your influence would inspire as moving airs and make my song as soft and sweet as theirs would you but once auspiciously incline to raise his fame who only writes for thine i would sing such notes as none but you could teach and none but one who loves like me can reach secure of you what raptures could i boast how wretched shall i be when you are lost ah think what pangs despairing lovers prove and what a blessed estate were mutual love how might my soul be with your favor raised and how in pleasing you myself be pleased with what delight what transport could i burn did but my flames receive the least return how would one tender look one pitying smile or one kind word from you reward my toil it must and would your tenderest pity move were you but once convinced how well i love by every power that reigns and rules on high by love the mightiest power of all the sky by your dear self my last great oath i swear that neither life nor soul are half so dear what need i these superfluous vows repeat already sighed so often at your feet you know my passion is sincere and true i love you to excess you know i do no tongue no pen can what i feel express even poetry itself must make it less you haunt me still wherever i remove there is no retreat secure from fate or love my soul from yours no distance can divide no rocks nor caves can from your presence hide by day your lovely form fills all my sight nor do i lose you when i lose the light you are the charming phantom of the night still your dear image dances in my view and all my restless thoughts run still on you you only are the sleeping poets dream and when awake you only are his theme were i by some yet harder fortune hurled to the remotest parts of all the world the coldest northern clime the torrid zone should hear me sing of you and you alone that pleasing task should all my hours employ spent in a charming melancholy joy the chorus of the birds the whispering boughs and murmuring streams should join to sooth my woes my thoughts of you should yield a sad delight while joy and grief contend like day and night with smiles and tears resembling sun and rain to keep the pleasure i would endure the pain if such content my troubled soul could know such satisfaction mixed with so much woe if but my thoughts could keep my wishes warm ah how would your transporting presence charm how pleasant would these pathless wilds appear were you alone my kind companion here what should i then have left me to deplore oh what society to wish for more no country thou art in can desert be and towns are desolate deprived of thee banished with thee i could an exile bear banished from thee the banishment lies there i to some lonely isle with thee could fly where not a creature dwells but thou and i whre a widespreading main around us roars besprinkling with its foam our desert shores where winds and waves in endless wars engage and highwrought tides roll with eternal rage where ships far off their fearful courses steer and no bold vessel ever ventures near should rising seas swell over every coast were mankind in a second deluge lost did only two of all the world survive only one man one woman left alive and should the gods that lot to us allow were i deucalion and my pyrtha thou contentedly i should my fate embrace and would not beg them to renew our race all my most ardent wishes should implore all i should ask from each indulgent power would be to keep thee safe and have no more your cruelty occsions all my smart your kindness could restore my bleeding heart you wrk me to a storm you make me calm you give the wound and can infuse the balm of you i boast of you alone complain my greatest pleasure and my greatest pain whenever you grieve i can no comfort know and when you first are pleased i must be so while you are well there is no disease i feel and i enjoy no health when you are ill whatever you do my actions does direct your smile can raise me and your frown deject whomeer you love i by the selfsame fate love too and hate whatever wretch you hate with yours my wishes and my passions join your humor and your interest all is mine i share in all nor can my fortunes be unhappy let but fortune smile on thee you can preserve you only can destroy increase my sorrow or create my joy from you and you alone my doom i wait you are the star whose influence rules my fate on yours my being and my life depend and mine shall last no more when yours must end no toil would be too great no task too hard were you at last to be my rich reward in serving you i would spend my latest breath brave any danger run on any death i live but for your sake and when i die all i shall pray for is may you be by no life like living with thee can delight no death can please like dying in thy sight oh when i must by heavens severe decree be snatched from all that is dear be snatched from thee may thou be present to displ my fear and soften with thy charms the pangs i bear while on thy lips i pour my panting breath look thee all over and clasp thee close in death sigh out my soul upon thy panting breast and with a passion not to be expressed sink at thy feet into eternal rest a pastoral elegy on the death of delia by the same  quam referent musae vivet dum robora tellus  dum coelum stellas dum vehet amnis aquas tibullus i iv    thyrsis stay wretched swain lie here and here lament press not too far your strength already spent long has distracting sorrow made you rove through every desert plain and dismal grove still silent with excess of grief and love feebly your trembling legs beneath you go and bend oerburdened with their load of woe stay and this melancholy grotto choose a proper mansion for a mourning muse lay your tired limbs extended on the moss and tell the listening woods of delias loss here the sad muse need no disturbance fear for not a living thing inhabits here music may give your sorrows some relief and i by listening to you share your grief  daphnis what music now can my sad numbers boast what muse invoke alas my muse is lost long since my useless pipe was thrown aside my reeds were broke that hour that delia died from her alone their inspiration came she gave the verse and was the verses theme for ever should my sorrows keep me dumb silent as death and hushed as delias tomb did not the force of love unlock my tongue lest her dear beauties should remain unsung her charms let every muse conspire to tell and that once done let every muse farewell this the last tribute of my verse i bring to sing her death and then no more to sing be still ye winds or in soft whispers blow ye purling streams with gentler murmurs flow let lambs forbear to bleat and herds to low let all in easy mournful numbers move let all be soft and artless as my love oh she was every way divinely fair charming in person and in soul sincere she was alas more than the muse can tell well worthy love and was beloved as well she was  alas these tears that saying draws oh it is a cruel killing word  she was now she no more must tread the flowery plains no more be gazed at by admiring swains no more the choicest flowers and daisies choose or pluck the pasture for her tender ewes say ye poor flocks how often have ye stood and from her lovely hands received your food now ye no more from those fair hands must feast those hands which gave the flowers a sweeter taste mourn her by whom ye were so often fed and cry with me the shepherdess is dead this the last tribute of my verse i bring to sing her death and then no more to sing weep for her loss relenting heaven and keep time with our tears heaven seems apace to weep in murmuring drops the mournful rain distills and fable clouds wrap round the sides of hills the goat forbears to browze the tender ewe will drink no longer of the falling dew no morning larks their mounting wings display or cheer with warbling airs the dusky day on dropping boughs sad nightingales complain join in my songs but sing like me in vain in doleful notes the murmuring turtles coo each of them seems to have lost a delia too the melting air in mists its sorrows shows and cold damp sweat the face of earth bedews with tears the rivergods enlarge their spring swans in sad strains on swelling waters sing in sighs the god of winds his passion vents and all all nature for her loss laments this the last tribute of my verse i bring to sing her death and then no more to sing how often on the banks of silver thames my eyes on hers and hers upon the streams has she stood listening when i told my flames how often has a sudden sidelong look seemed to confess her pity when i spoke pity i had though i could never move in her cold breast the least return of love pity from her more welcome did receive than all the love another fair could give and it was some some small relief to see she loved not others though she loved not me say gentle thames how often have i stood viewing her dear reflection in your flood when on her face i durst not gaze for fear how often have i looked and found it there how often have i wish d my verse might prove smooth as your stream whenever i writ of love say how your courteous waves would never flow over any path where she was used to go now let your river like my eyes run over insult with fuller tides the desert shore and drown those banks where delia walks no more this the last tribute of my verse i bring to sing her death and then no more to sing blue violets and blushing roses fade fold your silk leaves and hang your drooping head shut up your sweets and seem like delia dead let spring run backwards and the vintage blast let constant showers lay all the country waste let flames unto the center downwards tend and let the floods untossd by winds ascend let all things change and wear another face let nature not appear the same she was let fowl to dwell beneath the waters try and let the watery herd attempt to fly let wolves protect the flocks upon the plains let bashful virgins woo disdainful swains let savage death its cruelty pursue and since my delias dead let me die too this the last tribute of my verse i bring to sing her death and then no more to sing see where the god of love all sad appears his smoking torch extinguished with his tears well may he weep for his declining power his charm is done since delia is no more through her he conquered and through her he reigned her beauties his decaying sway sustained and she now gone his empire is disdained see where diana with a stately train of goodly nymphs descends upon the plain each of them weeps and leans upon her bow and mourns her fellow delia wanting now the goddess grieves to see her train decreased and swelling sighs shake every virgin breast unhurt they let the stags beside them pass nor follow boars that tempt them to the chase in several forms of woe their grief they vent and all with me for delias loss lament this the last tribute of my verse i bring to sing her death and then no more to sing look yonder where the lovely nymph is laid i will go and on her earth recline my head choke with my sighs and hasten to the dead come hither all ye swains with garlands come pour out your richest perfumes on her tomb let myrtles on her grave unplanted grow in ready wreaths for every lovers brow let flowers unknown before be daily seen to raise their heads above the spacious green millions of blooming sweets her earth surround and balmy gums distill upon the ground here let the tuneful muse for ever cease to give unutterable sorrow place let sighs and streaming tears resume their course and my sad eyes be their eternal source i will go and choose some melancholy cave as undisturbed and secret as the grave i will feast my eyes with nothing fair on earth nor shall my ears hear any sound of mirth farewell ye charming choiristers that dwell in sacred groves ye warbling birds farewell adieu ye nymphs adieu ye fellow swains ye silver streams sweet swans and flowery plains farewell all happy days and smiling hours refreshing valleys and delightful bowers adieu to every grotto every grove adieu to poetry adieu to love  phoebus and daphne from ovids metamorphoses book i by the same no beauteous nymph could youthful phoebus move till daphnes charms inspired him first with love a virgin sprung from peneus silver stream fair as the crystal waters whence she came no blind effects of chance subdued the god but just revenge which injured cupid owed for phoebus saw him as his bow he drew and scoffing cried those are not arms for you to me your quiver and your shafts resign they load your shoulders but sit well on mine your arrows drop from your enervate arm and are not sent with force enough to harm but when i shoot with my unerring hands on the fleet shaft as fleet a death attends witness the monstrous python lately slain against whose scales your darts had been in vain he still had lived and ravaged all the plain in yonder vale by me behold him killed shedding his poisonous gore over all the field be you content to kindle amorous fires inspiring childish loves and soft desires attempt not things beyond your feeble powers hold your own empire and usurp not ours the slighted god in short replies by thee let other breasts be pierced but thine by me as human force is conquered by divine so shall thou find my powers excelling thine he spoke and spread his wings and mounted up nor rested till he reached parnassus top from his full quiver all his darts he drew and from them all he made his choice of two differing the passions which their points create the one producing love the other hate with this the beauteous virgins breast he pierced but he wounds phoebus deeper with the first high on the mountains utmost cliff he stood and took his fatal aim and shot the god swiftly it flies through his envenomed reins fires all his blood and poisons all his veins the deadly shafts their purposed ends obtain work love in him in her as fierce disdain her only joy was ranging through the grove to shun her lovers and their tales of love there the wild boars were wounded with her spear her only passion was to conquer there all her attire was like dianas train alike her humor in avoiding men her numerous courtiers met with numerous slights she fled from hymen and his hated rites often had her father prompted her to wed by fond desires of future grandsons led often had he told her that she owed a debt of smiling nephews which he hopdfor yet she starts and thinks she understands him wrong nor would have heard it from another tongue then hanging on her father thus she prayed  oh only loved of all your sex she said oh give me leave to live and die a maid he too indulgent yields but yields in vain to what she cannot from herself obtain that matchless form was made to be admired and she is in her own despite desired the youthful phoebus courts her for his bride and loves too fiercely to be long denied with hopes he would not for his godhead lose by his own oracles deceived he wooes as fies in spacious fields of stubble thrown when the first blaze of flame is once begun the winds with fury drive the torrent on so burns the god and so receives the fires and sooths with flattering hopes his fond desires he sees her hair disheveled on her back and part in circles twining round her neck  if such their charms disordered thus he cried ah what if nature were with art supplied he sees her sparkling eyes that shine like stars but with an influence far more strong than theirs he sees her balmy lips and longs to kiss for oh he is not satisfied he sees her hands and arms fill his unwearied sight he looks on all with wonder and delight he sees her snowy thighs her swelling breast if aught lay hid he still concludes it best and yet in vain is all the god can say the dear disdainful virgin will not stay but flies the swifter as she hears him pray  stay daphne stay it is no foe pursues i follow not as lustful satyrs use the trembling deer fly from the lion so the lambs from wolves each from his mortal foe they by their swift pursuit their prey design but love the tenderest love occasions mine beware dear maid lest any barbarous thorn tear those soft limbs too beauteous to be torn rough are the ways you follow with such speed ah yet beware be cautious how you tread or stay or do not make such dangerous haste i too will stay or not pursue so fast stay daphne stay ah whither do you run alas fond nymph you know not whom you shun no rustic laboring hind no savage swain i keep no lowing herds upon the plain delphos and tenedos my rule obey in several isles i several sceptres sway all nations offer incense at my shrine and all those beams that light the world are mine jove does acknowledge me his darling son and gives me power the greatest next his own i know what time bears in her teeming womb and all that was and is and is to come i teach soft numbers to the mighty nine the wondrous harmony they make is mine sure are the wounds i send from every dart but love made surer when he pierced my heart to the sick earth safe remedies i give allotting man a longer time to live to me the use of every herb is known vain art alas since love is cured by none to all besides they do their aid afford unable only to relieve their lord much more he would have told the flying fair but the regardless virgin would not hear with doubled swiftness she outruns the wind and leaves his yet unfinished speech behind the winds that tossed her flowing robes abroad showed a whole heaven of beauty to the god her naked limbs to his full view displayed the god the ravished god saw all the maid her every step inflames his fierce desires her every motion fans the raging fires still the fair nymph grew lovelier as she fled loose in the air her golden locks were spread and her cheeks glowed with an unusual red the impatient god admits no more delay and throws no more unheeded words away stronger his pliant limbs he strives to move love urges on he takes new force from love so the swift greyhound when his game he views with eager stretch over all the plain pursues now comes so near that he is forced to stoop with the false hopes he has to snatch her up the trembling hare runs on with dreadful doubt whether she is already seized or not she uses all her art to help her flight and doubles just enough to escape the bite so daphne flies winged with her mortal fear winged with his love so phoebus follows her but he still gains advantage in the race for love redoubles his impetuous pace with arms expanded he pursues the fair and plies his eager feet so very near she feels his breath warm through her flying hair now as her utmost force was wellnigh spent and her oerlabourd legs began to faint her course to that delightful stream she bends which from her fathers silver urn descends with moving looks the water she surveys and thus the sad and lovely suppliant prays oh save me yet ere i am quite betrayed exert your godhead and preserve a maid to some new form change my too charming shape or let me lose my being to escape immediate grant was given her as she prayed and sudden numbness through her limbs was spread thin films over all her lovely frame are cast and with close folds they compassin her waist her hair to leaves her arms to branches shoot her feet deprived of swiftness form the root her beauteous head changed to the leafy top and yet not wholly ere the god came up for now he ran with more immoderate speed but not with haste enough to embrace the maid till lovely though of human shape bereft and he still loves her in the shape she as left he lays his hand upon the newmade plant while yet her heart beneath the rind did pant he clasped her with the thought of what she ad been and oh he wished her still the same as then with the same scorn his kisses she disdained her scorn alas was all she still retained  i have thee now such as thou art he cried and thou shall be my tree though not my bride my quiver shall be hung upon thy boughs and thy dear leaves be wreathed about my brows thou shall the heads of demi gods adorn and be by poets and their heroes worn when caesar shall from vanquished nations come drawn in his chariot through the streets of rome when to the capitol their spoils they bring and io paeans make the temple ring then planted at augustus gilded doors thou like an household god shall guard his floors and as the tresses on my youthful head keep their first luster still and never fade the verdant beauty of thy leaves shall last not to be withered by the winters blast thus the god finished and the laurel bowed her branches down to thank the bounteous god jupiter and europa from ovids metamorphoses book ii by the same greatness does always our desires oppose and majesty and love are mortal foes jove knew too well it hindered the design he could not compass in a form divine he casts his eagle off and royal crown and lets his bolts fall to the pavement down divested thus he quits the blessed abode without one mark left to reveal the god he that was wont to reign and rule on high and shake the world with thunder from the sky of all the gods the most adored and feared now changes to a bull and joins the hed large curls adorned his front and hid his chest of all he seemed by far the noblest beast by something still distinguished from the rest his whiteness did the new fallen snow excel while it remains unsullied as it fell his horns were small like glittering jewels bright and seemed designed for beauty more than fight his peaceful look no signs of fury shows he wears no marks of terror on his brows the royal maid beheld him with delight surpised with pleasure at the unusual sight yet was her pleasure first allayed with fear till by degrees at last advancing near with flowers more welcome than his heavenly food given by those hands she fed the ravishd god softly with secret joy those hands he pressed and too too eager to be wholly blessed hardly ah hardly he forbears the rest now with large leaps he bounds upon the land anon he rolls along the golden sand as ner fears vanished she approached the beast and venturing farther stroakd his panting breast and crowned his horns with flowers too venturous at the last more favors thus the unwary nymph bestowed than she had given him had he seemed a god still daring more down on his back she sat alas she knew not who sustained her weight then then the god rose with his wished for prey and winged with his success soon reached the sea vain were her cries all her resistance vain while jove in triumph bore her through the main she casts her eyes on the forsaken coast which lessened till the view was wholly lost she sighed and wept and looked despairing back yet still she held his horns still clasped his neck while with the winds her looser garments flowed and spread a grateful covering over the god narcissus and echo from ovids metamorphoses book iii by the same the vocal nymph this lovely huntsman viewed as he into the toils his prey pursued though of the power of speaking first debarred she could not hold from answering what she heard the jealous juno by her wiles betrayed took this revenge on the deceitful maid for when she might have seized her faithless jove often in amorous thefts of lawless love her tedious talk would make the goddess stay and give her rivals time to run away which when she found she cried for such a wrong small be the power of that deluding tongue immediately the deed confirmed the threats for echo only what she hears repeats now at the sight of the fair youth she glows and follows silently wherever he goes the nearer she pursued the more she moved through the dear track he trod the more she loved still her approach inflamed her fierce desile as sulphurous torches catch the neighboring fire how often would she strive but strive in vain to tell her passion and confess her pain a thousand tender things her thoughts suggest with which she would have wooed but they suppressed for want of speech lay buried in her breast begin she could not but she stayed to wait till he should speak and she his speech repeat now several ways his young companions gone and for some time narcissus left alone  where are you all at last she hears him call and she strait answers him where are you all around he lets his wandering eyesight roam but sees no creature whence the voice should come  speak yet again he cries is any nigh again the mournful echo answers i  why come not you says he appear in view she hastily returns why come not you once more the voice the astonished huntsman tried louder he called and louder she replied  then let us join at last narcissus said then let us join replied the ravished maid scarce had she spoke when from the woods she sprung and on his neck with close embraces hung but he with all his strength unlocks her fold and breaks unkindly from her feeble hold then proudly cries life shall this breast forsake ere you loose nymph on me your pleasure take on me your pleasure take the nymph replies while from her the disdainful huntsman flies repulsed with speed she seeks the gloomiest groves and pines to think on her rejected loves alone laments her illrequired flame and in the closest thickets shrouds her shame her rage to be refused yields no relief but her fond passion is increased by grief the thoughts of such a slight all sleep suppressed and kept her languishing for want of rest now pins she quite away with anxious care her skin contracts her blood dissolves to air nothing but voice and bones she now retains these turn to stones but still the voice remains in woods caves hills for ever hid she lies heard by all ears but never seen by eyes thus her and other nymphs his proud disdain with an unheard of cruelty hd slain many on mountains and in rivers borne thus perished underneath his haughty scorn when one who in their sufferings bore a share with suppliant hands addressed this humble prayer  thus may he love himself and thus despair nor were her prayers at an ill hour preferred rhamnusia the revengeful goddess heard nature had placed a crystal fountain near the water deep but to the bottom clear whose silver spring ascended gently up and bubbled softly to the silent top the surface smooth as icy lakesappeard unknown by herdsman undisturbed by herd no bending tree above its surface grows or scatters thence its leaves or broken boughs yet at a just convenient distance stood all round the peaceful spring a stately wood through whole thick tops no sun could shoot his beams nor view his image in the silver streams thither from hunting and the scorching heat the wearied youth was one day led by fate down on his face to drink the spring he lies but as his image in that glass he spies he drinksin passion deeper at his eyes his own reflection works his wild desire and he himself sets his own self on fire fixed as some statue he preserves his place intent his looks and motionless his face deep through the spring his eye balls dart their beams like midnight stars that twinkle in the streams his ivory neck the crystal mirror shows his waving hair above the surface flows his cheeks reflect the lily and the rose his own perfection all his passions moved he loves himself who for himself was loved who seeks is sought who kindles the desires is scorched himself who is admired admires often would he the deceitful spring embrace and seek to fasten on that lovely face often with his downthrust arms he thought to fold about that neck that still deludes his hold he gets no kisses from those cozening lips his arms grasp nothing from himself he slips he knows not what he views and yet pursues his desperate love and burns for what he views catch not so fondly at a fleeting shade and be no longer by yourself betrayed it borrows all it has from you alone and it can boast of nothing of its own with you it comes with you it stays and so would go away had you the power to go neither for sleep nor hunger would he move but gazing still augments his hopeless love still over the spring he keeps his bending head still with that flattering form his eyes he fed and silently surveys the treacherous shade to the deafwoods at length his grief he vents and in these words the wretched youth laments  tell me ye hills and dales and neighboring groves you that are conscious of so many loves say have you ever seen a lover pine like me or ever known a love like mine i know not whence this sudden flame should come i like and see but see i know not whom what grieves me more no rocks nor rolling seas no strongwalld cities nor untrodden ways only a slender silver stream destroys and casts the bar between our sundered joys even he too seems to feel an equal flame the same his passion his desires the same as often as i my longing lips decline to join with his his mount to meet with mine so near our faces and our mouths approach that almost to ourselves we seem to touch come forth whoever thou art and do not fy from one so passionately fond as i i have nothing to deserve your just disdain but have been loved as i love you in vain yet all the signs of mutual love you give and my poor hopes in all your actions live when in the stream our hands i strive to join yours straight ascend and halfway grasp at mine you smile my smiles when i a tear let fall you shed another and consent in all and when i speak your lovely lips appear to utter something which i cannot hear alas it is i myself too late i see my own deceitful shade has ruined me with a mad passion for myself i m cursed and bear about those flames i kindled first in so perplexed a case what can i do ask or be asked shall i be wooed or woo all that i wish i have what would i more ah it is my too great plenty makes me poor divide me from myself ye powers divine nor let his being intermix with mine all that i love and wish for now retake a strange request for one in love to make i feel my strength decay with inward grief and hope to lose my sorrows with my life nor would i mourn my own untimely fate where he i love allowed a longer date this makes me at my cruel stars repine that his much dearer life must end with mine this said again he turns his watery face and gazes wildly in the crystal glass while streaming tears from his full eyelids fell and drop by drop raised circles in the well the several rings larger and larger spread and by degrees dispersed the fleeting shade which when perceived oh whither would you go he cries ah whither whither fly you now stay lovely shade do not so cruel prove in leaving me who to distraction love let me still see what never can be possessed and with the sight alone my frenzy feast now frantic with his grief his robe he tears and tokens of his rage his bosom bears the cruel wounds on his pure body show like crimson mingling with the whitest snow like apples with vermilion circles stripe or a fair bunch of grapes not fully ripe but when he looks and sees the wounds he made writ on the bosom of the charming shade his sorrow would admit of no relief but all his sense was swallowed in his grief as wax near any kindled fuel placed melts and is sensibly perceived to waste as morning frosts are found to thaw away when once the sun begins to warm the day so the fond youth dissolves in hopeless fires and by degrees consumes in vain desires his lovely cheeks now lost their white and red diminished was his strength his beauty fled his body from its just proportions fell which the scorned echo lately loved so well yet though her first resentments she retained and still remembered how she was disdained she sighed and when the wretched lover cried  alas alas the woeful nymph replied then when with cruel blows his hands would wound his tender breast she still restored the sound now hanging over the spring his drooping head with a sad sigh these dying words he said  ah boy beloved in vain through all the plain echo resounds ah boy beloved in vain  farewell he cries and with that word he died farewell the miserable nymph replied now pale and breathless on the grass he lies for death had shut his selfadmiring eyes now wafted over to the stygian coast the waters there reflect his wandering ghost in loud laments his weeping sisters mourn which echo makes the neighboring hills return all signs of desperate grief the nymphs express great is the moan yet is not echos less the story of salmacis and hermaphroditus from the fourth book of ovid and that of cinyras and myrrha from the tenth book are purposely omitted no elegance of numbers can atone for gross indecency n scyllas passion for minos from ovids metamorphoses book viii by the same a tower with sounding walls erected stands the sacred fabric of apollos hands his harp laid by the strings their airs dispense and vocal stones received their virtue thence this scylla in the time of peace ascends and thence her look over all the lawns extends now with delight she views the spacious town now pleased with dropping little pebbles down strikes a sweet music from the warbling stone in times of war the selfsame prospect yields the pleasing horror of the bloody fields long had they now in equal balance hung and doubtful victory depended long this gave her leisure to discern and know the several leaders of the neighboring foe minos their general most of all she knew more than a virtuous virgin ought to do whether his helmet glittered from afar and with its waving feathers threatened war whether his hands his shining sword would weild or his strong arm raise his refulgent shield whatever she saw him do she praised and loved and kept him still in view wherever he moved whenever he shok a spear or cast a dart she knew not which excelled his strength or art whenever he drew a shaft she would swear that so even phoebus would himself discharge his bow but when his naked visage he disclosed his charming face to public view exposed when on his foaming horse he rode the plains ruling with skilful hands the stubborn reins then like tempestuous seas her passions roll mad her sick brain and rack her troubled soul happy she calls the courser which he pressed happy the lance he couched within his rest happy the vamplate that secured his breast now would she think of flying to the foe and would have gone had she a way to go now headlong from the tower herself have sent and ventured life to reach her lovers tent open the brazen gates when love inspired or act whatever the foe she loved desired silent she ate with a distracted look till passion gave her leave and then she spoke  in this unhappy war and fatalstrife i know not which to yield to joy or grief though it is my fate to love my countrys foe i had not seen him had he not been so yet might they let their fierce contentions fall and making peace make me the pledge for all minos and i once joined our wars might cease and that alliance fix a lasting peace well might your mothers charms a god subdue if ever she could charm dear youth like you happy thrice happy had i wings to fly to yonder tents where the loved foe does lie i would tell the dear disturber of my rest all that i feel could it he all expressed and pour my soul into the charmers breast give all i can to make him once my own all he should ask all  but my fathers crown this love shall cease these fierce desires shall die re i by treachery my wish enjoy yet when a generous foe disputes the field it is not safest to resist but yield the tragic destiny of his darling son has brought at last these fatal mischiefs on in a just cause his vengeful sword he draws strong is his army to maintain his cause needs must my charming hero prosperous prove then let him owe his conquest to my love thus thousands will be saved who else must bleed and daily perish if the wars proceed minos will thus be safe and i be blessed else he may chance to perish with the rest some rash unknowing hand his spear may dart against my too too venturous heros heart for who without concern his wounds could see or who would wound him if he knew t was he it is then resolved lest such a chance should fall on him i love so well i ll hazard all my country and myself one gift i will join and make the merit of his conquest mine to will is nothing when we cannot fulfill for wretched want of power the things we will the gates are kept with a sufficientguard and every night my father sees them barred it is he destroys my bliss it is him i fear would he were with the dead or i were there might i not injuring him my bliss pursue indulgent gods but why invoke i you we our own gods have power ourselves to bless and from ourselves derive our own success the only way to prosper is to dare for fortune listens not to lazy prayer others inflamed with such a fierce desire have forced through all to quench their raging fire shall any other then more resolute prove through fire and sword i would force my way to love yet to assist me here i need not call for fire or sword my fathers hair opus est mihi crine paterno ovid met viii    the expression is explained by the commentators to betray the secret counsels of her father n is all that that must crown my joys and make me blessed beyond whatever else can be possessed beyond what can be by my words expressed ceyx and halcyone from ovids metamorphoses book xi by the same ceyx the son of lucifer and king of trachis a city in thessaly having been alarmed by several prodigies prepares to go and consult apollos oracle at claros ad clarium parat ire deum ovid met xi     n  to learn the will of heaven and receive the gods instructions his voyage the description of a storm and shipwreck the description of the god of sleep and his palace the lamentation of halcyone the daughter of aeolus and wife to ceyx for the loss of her husband with the change of both into seafowls called after her name halcyous are the subjects of the following verses beginning with her speech to her husband to dissuade him from his intended voyage   how are you changed of late my love how grown so tired of me so pressing to be gone what have i done to make my lord remove so far from her who once had all his love is your halcyone no longer dear or to whatever place your course you steer can you enjoy yourself and she not there yet if you went by land t were some relief for all that would torment me then were grief but now at once with grief and fear oppressed a thousand anxious thoughts destroy my rest and not on dawn of comfort chears my breast the faithless seas are what alas i fear i must not let my ceyx venture there often have i heard their troubled waters roar and seen their foaming waves surmount the shore often seen the wreck come floating to the coast and venturous wretches by their folly lost nor have i seldom sad inscriptions read on marble tombs which yet enclosed no dead let me alone my ceyx be believed and be not by your flattering hopes deceived trust not the seas although my father binds within his rocky caves the struggling winds if once broke loose naught can their rage restrain they sweep over all the earth swell all the main drive clouds on clouds by an abortive birth from their dark wombs flashing the thunder forth more more than what my feeble words express which only represent their fury less let me persuade for i have seen them rage seen all the wars the fighting winds could wage did you like me their stern encounters know as daring as you are you would not go if all this fail to move your stubborn mind and you will go oh leave not me behind take me along let me your fortunes share there is naught too hard for love like mine to bear in storms and calms together let us keep together brave the dangers of the deep the grant of this my flattering love assures which knows no joys and feels no griefs but yours thus spoke the lovely queen all drowned in tears nor was her husbands passion less than hers yet would he not his first resolves recall nor suffering her to venture hazard all he said whatever he fancied might abate her griefs although his own were full as great yet all in vain he labored to remove the tender fears of her prophetic love still the same sighs from her heaved heart arise and the same streams still bubble at her eyes all this succeeding not my love he cried the last best speech that could be then applied to you should ceyx absence tedious seem believe that yours is not less so to him for by my fathers brightest fires i swear by your dear self believe my mournful dear ere twice the moon renews her blunted horns if destiny permits your love returns this just sufficed to ease her troubled heart and of her many cares dispel a part and now he bids them launch without delay while she took truce with grief to sail away that last command awaked her sleeping fears and she again seemed all dissolved in tears around his neck her circling arms she threw and mixed with sighs forcdout a faint adieu then as he left her hold too feeble grown robbed of her dear support to stand alone the last sad pangs at parting sunk her down the impatient seamen call upon their lord and almost bear him thence by force aboard then having fixed their oars begin to sweep and cleave with welltimd strokes the yielding deep faintly her opening eyes the ship survey which bears her lord and her last hopes away in their own tears her trembling eye balls swim which hindered not but she distinguished him too distant now for words aloft he stands on the tall deck and she upon the sands wafts her last farewell with her lifted hands then as the ship drove farther from the coast and that dear object in the crowd was lost the flying bark her following eyes pursue that gone the sails employed her latest view all out of sight she seeks the widowed bed where ceyx and herself so often were laid but now half filled the sad remembrance moved of the dear man who made the whole beloved by this the gathering winds began to blow their useless oars the joyful seamen stow then hoist their yards while loosened from the masts the widestretchd sails receive the coming blasts description of a storm and shipwreck now far from either shore they ploughd their way and all behind them and before was sea when with the growing night the winds rose high and swelling seas presaged a tempest nigh aloud the mater crie url all the sails no longer spread to catch the flying gales but his commands are borne unheard away drowned in the roar of a far louder sea yet of themselves their tasks the sailors know and are by former storms instructed now some to the masts the struggling canvass bind and leave free passage to the raging wind some stop the leaks while some the billows cast back on the sea which rolls them back as fast thus in confusion they their parts perform while fighting winds increase the impetuous storm amazed the pilot sees the waves come on too thick and fast for his weak skill to shun on every side the threatening billows fall and art is a a loss to escape them all the cries of men the rattling of the shrouds flods dashed on floods and clouds encountering clouds fierce winds beneath above a thundering sky unite their rage to work the tempest high vast billows after bilows tumbling come and rolling seas grow white with angry foam to mountainous heights the swelling surges rise waves pild on waves seem equal with the skies now rushing headlong with a rapid force look black as hell to which they bend their course the ship on rising seas is lifted up and now seems seated on a mountain top surveying thence the stygian lakes that flow and roll their distant waters far below now downwards with the tumbling billows driven from hells profoundest depth looks up to heaven waves after waves the shattered vessel crush all sides alike they charge on all they rush while with a noise the assaulting billows roar as loud as battering rams that force a tower as lions fearless and secure from harms rush with prodigious rage on pointed arms chafed if repulsed they run the fiercer on and lash themselves to fury as they run so roll the seas with such resistless force and gather strength in their impetuous course now start the planks and leave the vessels sides wide open to receive the conquering tides in at the breach the raging waters come all pressing to pursue their conquest home fierce neptune now who long alone had strove as if too weak himself seeks aid from jove whole heaven dissolves in one continued rain descending in a deluge to the main whose mounting billows toss it back again seeming by turns each other to supply the sky the seas and now the seas the sky showers join with waves and pour in torrents down and all the floods of heaven and earth grow one no glimpse of light is seen no sparkles fly from friendly stars through the benighted sky double the horror of the night is grown the tempests darkness added to her own till thundering clouds strike out a dismal light more dreadful than the depth of blackest night upwards the waves to catch the flames aspire and all the rolling surges seem on fire now over the hatches mad with rage they tower and strive possessed of them to conquer more as a brave soldier whom the strong desire and burning thirst of glory set on fire with more than common ardor in his breast and higher hopes spurred farther than the rest often scales in vain a welldefended town but mounts at length and leaps victorious down alone of all the dreadful shock abides while thousand others perish by his sides so the tenth billow rolling from afar more vigorous than the rest maintains the war now gains the deck and with success grown bold pours thence in triumph down and sacks the hold part still without the battered sides assail and where that led the way attempt to scale a in a town already half possessed by foes within it and without it pressed all tremble of their last defense bereft and see no hope of any safety left no aid their often successful arts can boast at once their courage and their skill is lost helpless they see the raging waters come each threatens death and each presents a tomb one mourns his fate in loud complaints and tears another more astonished quite forbears from sighs or words too faint to tell his fears this calls them blessed who funeral rites receive possessed in quiet of a peaceful grave this rears his suppliant hands unto the sky and vainly looks to what he cannot spy this thinks upon the friends he left behind and his now orphan children rack his mind halcyone alone could ceyx stir his anxious thought ran all alone on her one farewell view of her was all his care and yet he then rejoiced she was not there for a last look fain would he turn his eyes on her abode but knows not where it lies the seas so whirl with such prodigious might while pitchy clouds obscuring heaven from sight increase the nativehorror of the night now splits the mast by furious whirlwinds torn and now the rudder to the seas is borne a billow with those spoils encouraged rides aloft in triumph over the lower tides thence as some god had plucked up rocks and thrown whole mountains on the main she tumbles down down goes the ship with her unhappy freight unable to sustain the pressing weight part of her men along with her are borne sunk in a gulf whence they must never return part catch at planks in hopes to float to shore or stem the tempest till its rage were over even ceyx of the like support possessed swims undistinguished now among the rest to his wifes father and his own prefers his ardent vows for help which neither hears to both repeats his stillneglected prayer calls often on both but oftener calls on her the more his danger grew the more it brought her dear remembrance to his restless thought whose dying wish was that the friendly stream would roll him to those coasts whence late he came to her dear hands to be interred by them still as the seas a breathing space afford haleyone rehearsed forms every word half of her name his lips now sinking sound when the remaining half in him was drowned an huge black arch of waters which had hung high in the gloomy air and threatened long busting asunder hurls the dreadful heap all on his head and drives him down the deep his father lucifer that dismal night sought to retire to shun the tragic sight but since he could not leave his destined sphere drew round the blackest clouds to veil him there meanwhile his wife counts every tedious hour and knew not yet she was a wife no more but works two robes against his wished return to be by her and her dear ceyx worn she pays her vows to every power divine but pays them frequentest at junos shrine bribes every goddess at a mighty cost of precious gums but still bribes her at most vain were the gifts she offered in her fane she made her aded altars smoke in vain where for his life and safe return she prayed who was already lost already dead  let me again she cried my ceyx see and while away by your severe decree let him give none the love that is due to me let none she prayed before me be preferred and this alone of all her prayers was heard the pitying goddess would no more receive vows for that succor which she could not give but from her altar shakes her awful hand and gives her faithful his this command  haste quickly where the drowsy god of sleep remote from day does his dark mansions keep tell him i bid him in a dream reveal to sad haleyone how ceyx fell all her misfortunes in her sleep unfold and by the vision let her loss be told thus speaks the queen of heaven nor iris stays to make reply but as she speaks obeys straight in a thousandcolourd robe arrayed and all her orient bow over heaven displayed downwards she slides to find the dark abode and bear her message to the slothful god description of the god of sleep and his palace near the cimmerians hid from human sight lies a vast hollow cave all void of light where deep in earth the god his court maintains and undisturbed in ease and silence reigns not seen by phoebus at his morning rise nor at midday with his most piercing eyes nor when at evening he descends the skies thick gloomy mists come steaming from the ground and the fog spreads a dusky twilight round no crested fowls foretell the days return nor with shrill notes call forth the springing morn no watchful dogs the secret entry keep nor geese more watchful guard the court of sleep no tame nor savage beast dwells there no breeze shakes the still boughs or whispers through the trees no voice of man is heard no human call sounds through the cave deep silence reigns over all yet from the rock a silver spring flows down which purling over the stones glides gently on her easy streams with pleasing murmurs creep at once inviting and assisting sleep at the caves mouth spring pregnant poppies up and hide the entrance with their baleful top whose drowsy juice affords the nightly birth of all the sleep diffused and shed on earth no guards the passage to this court secure no jarring hinge sustains a creaking door yet in the midst with fable coverings spread high but unshaken stands a downy bed where his soft limbs the slothful monarch lays dissolved in endless luxury and ease fantastic dreams lie scattered on the ground and compass him in various figures round more numerous than the sands that bind the seas or ears of standing corn or leaves on trees but iris now arrived divinely bright fills all the palace with unusual light her garments flowing with diffusive beams gild the dark cell and chase the frighted dreams away they fly to leave her passage clear and shun the glories which they cannot bear the god his eyelids struggling to unloose sealed by his deep unbroken slumbers close half way his head uprears with sluggish pain which heavily anon sinks down again frequent attempts without success he makes but at the last with long endeavor wakes half raised and half reclining in his bed and leaning on his hands his nodding head with faultering words he asks the heavenly fair what message from her goddess brought her there at once the god and goddess she obeys delivering her commands in words like these  thou peace of mind thou most propitious power thou meekest deity that men adore thou who givst ease to every troubled breast and setst tired limbs and feverish souls at rest thou at whose presence cares and sorrows flee under whose guard the fettered slave is free lovers the worst of slaves still finding ease in thee send thou a dream assuming ceyx form like him appearing shipwrecked in a storm from whose pale lips his widowed queen may know his certain loss and her as certain woe here ends the shining nymph who dares not stay for farther words but flies in haste away she feels the thickening mists begin to rise and conquering sleep steal over her yielding eyes thence by her painted bow her course she bends and the same way she came again aseends around his drowsy offspring goes the god and chooses morpheus from among the crowd none can like him a perfect man express his speech and mien his aion and his dress for he alone in human shape appears while the less noble forms a second wears of snakes or birds of lions or of bears still there is a third still meaner in degree which shows a field a river or a tree of things inanimate presents the scene hills valleys ships or houses earth or main these three to generals kings or courts belong more vulgar dreams wait the more vulgar throng the frst of thse their monarch sets at large dispatched to trachs on thaumantias charge then staggering he returns and seeks his bed in whose soft down he sinks his drooping head again his eyelids are with sleep oppressed and the whole god dissolves again to rest swift as a thought and secret as the night morpheus on noiseless pinions takes his flight his sleeting wings their silent course pursue soft as the liquid air they traveled through who now arrived laysby his useless plumes and ceyx form in his own court assumes naked he stood as late bereaved of life close by the bed of his unhappy wife his hair still dropping seemed still wet his beard still shivering with the cold all his pale frame appeared when with a mournful gesture over the bed pensively hanging his dejected head all drowned in welldissembling tears he said  is not your ceyx wretched woman known is he so altered or forgot so soon turn here halcyone behold him lost or in your ceyx stead behold his ghost to the relentless gods in vain you prayed you are deceived alas and i am dead surpised by storms in the aegean sea which cast my life and all my hopes away where as i called on thy loved name my breath with half thy name pronounced was stopped in death this from no doubtful messenger you hear it is i who tell it i who perished there arise and weep now let your eyes run over your oncelovd ceyx is alas no more let a few tears be to my memory paid and as you loved me living mourn she dead he speaks and adds to these his doleful words a voice she too well knew expressed her lords the same the gesture of his hands appears unforced his action and unfeigned his tears she frighted with the vision sighs and weeps torn with most mortal anguish as she sleeps then stretches out her arms to hold him there which came back empty through the yielding air  stay stay she cries ah whither would you now we ll go together if again you go with her own voice and her dead husbands sight starting she leaves her dream but not her fright awaked she turns her fearful eyes around and looks for him who could no more be found for now her maids raised with her shrieks were come and with their lamps enlightened all the room not seeing what she sought enraged she tare at once her face her habit and her hair when asked the cause whence such despair should spring and what sad loss could such distraction bring she wrings her hands and beats her panting breast long silent with a load of sorrow pressed but thus at last her cruel loss confessed  there is no halcyone ah none she cried with ceyx dearer than herself she died now let no sounds of comfort reach my car all mention of a future hope forbear leave me oh leave me to my just despair ah these these eyes my shipwrecked lord did see and knew too well it could be none but he these hands i stretched in hopes to make him stay but from these hands he slid unfelt away no motal grasp could hold his fleeting ghost and i a second time my ceyx lost he looked not with the same majestic grace as when he lived nor shone his awful face with the peculiar glories of his heavenly race his eyes were fixed and all their fires gone out no longer rolled their sparkling beams about the color from his faded cheek was fled and all his beauty with himself lay dead retaining naught of all except the shade retaining still though all the rest was gone too much alas to make his shadow known pale wan and meagre by the bed he stood his hair still dropping with the briny flood here here in this ah this unhappy place twas here he stood  she cried and sought to trace but found no footsteps of his airy pace   oh this my too presaging soul divined when you forsook me to pursue the wind but since compelled by rigorous fate you went and this was destined for the sad event oh that together we had put to sea that so with you it might have swallowed me absent i am lost and ah though not with you yet am i wrecked yet am i ruined too oh i were sprung from a most savage kind my soul as barbarous as the seas or wind if i now you are gone should wish to stay behind no ceyx no my muchloved lord i come and though not laid together in a tomb though far from mine your floating corse is borne nor with my ashes mingled in an urn yet on one marble shall our names be told and the same stone shall both our stories hold where ages yet unborn with praise shall read how i disdained to live when you were dead here choked with grief she the sad tale gave over her swelling sorrows would permit no more sobs mingling with her words their accents part and sighs fly faster from her throbbing heart now dawns the day when she with fearful haste goes to that shore where she had seen him last there while she stood reflecting on her loss forgetting naught that might augment her woes  here he took leave she cried and here she said unwilling to be gone again he staid he gave me here alas the last embrace then launched from this ah this unhappy place while all that past she labored to recall severely for herself remembering all and while around her watery eyes survey the wavebeat coast and the stilltroubled sea something she spies from far come floating on though at the first too distant to be known which as the tide drove nearer to the coast presents a man in a late shipwreck lost she pities him whom yet she does not know and mourns his fate since ceyx perished so pities his wife if he a wife had left like her of all she reckoned dear bereft now floating nearer to the fatal shore she eyes him more distinctly than before while all her hopes diminish all her fears grow more apace her beating heart begins to pant and all at once her sinking spirits faint now on the beach by tossing billows thrown the corse was to her sad confusion known herself the wife she mourned the man her own  it is he she cried my dear my shipwrecked lord whom i but too too justly have deplored then with her hands stretched to him where he lay she said what grief would give her leave to say  fed with false hopes have i your absence borne and is it thus ah thus that you return and do i live and you bereaved of life ah wretched man but more more wretched wife far in the sea a pier erected stood to break the rapid fury of the flood thither almost beyond belief she springs borne through the yielding air on newgrown wings along the surface of the sea she flies and wonders at her own unusual cries now hovering over his pale and bloodless corse in newfound notes laments her sad divorce now stooping perches on his watery face and gives him with her bill a strange embrace whether he felt it or the circling flood then chanced to move him is not yet allowed yet he took sense from her transporting touch even on the dead the force of love is such aloft his now reviving head he rears and munts on pinions which resemble hers both changed to birds their wings together move and  ght remained unchanged except their love in close embraces as before they joined and now over seas produce and spread their kind seven days she sits upon her floating nest while each rude blast imprisoned and suppressed close in its cavern leaves the sea at rest then every sail may safely trust the deep while all the winds lie hushed the waves asleep tibullus book i el i by the same see our authors own

rugged grass the mighty pleasure would endear the place who can in softest down be reckoned blessed whose unsuccessful love destroys his rest when nor the purple coverings of his bed nor the fair plumes that nod above his head nor all his spacious fields nor pleasant house nor purling streams can lull him to repose what foolish brave allowed by thee to taste thy balmy breath to press thy panting breast rifle thy sweets and run over all thy charms and melt thy beauties in his burning arms would quit the vast delights which thou could yield for all the honors of the dusty field let such as he his highprizd wars pursue and conquering thee leave me to conquer you let him adorned i all the pomp of war sit on his prancing horse and shine afar proud when the crowd assembles to behold his troops in polished steel himself in gold at my last hour all i shall wish to see all i shall love to look on will be thee close by my deathbed may my delia stand that i may grasp her with my fainting hand breathe on her lips my last expiring sighs and full of her dea image shut my eyes then delia you will relent and mourn my fate and then be kind but kind alas too late on my pale lips print an unfelt embrace and mingling tears with kisses bathe my face from your full eyes the flowing tears will stream and be like me lost in the funeral flame i know you will weep and make this rueful moan you are not flint you are not perfect stone wrong not my ghost my delia but forbear from this unprofitable grief and spare your tender cheeks and golden locks of hair in the mean time let us ou joys improve spend all our hours our years our lives in love grim death pursues us with impatient haste and age its fure forerunner comes too fast the swets of life are then no more enjoyed and love the life of all is first destroyed that first departs from our declining years from weak decrepid limbs and hoary hairs now let us now enjoy the full delight while vigorous youth can raise it to the height while we can storm a stubborn damsels door and with our quarrels make our pleasure more i am the general here and this my war and in this fight to conquer all my care all other battles hence all other arms go carry wounds to those who covet harms give them the dearbought wealth their wars can yield with all the bloody harvest of the field while i at home my muchloved ease secure contented

slave no more my native freedom can i boast but all my oncelovd liberty is lost yet why such heavy fetters must i wear and why obey a mistress so severe why must i drag such a perplexing chain which tyrant love will never loose again whether i merit her esteem or scorn offending or deserving still i burn ah cruel maid these scorching flames remove extinguish mine or teach yourself to love oh rather than endure the pains i feel how would i choose so to shake off my ill to grow a senseless stone fixed on a barren hill or a blak rock amidst the seas be set by raging winds and rolling billows beat for now in torment i support the light and in worse torment waste the lingering night my crowding griefs on one another roll and give no truce to my distracted sul no succor now from sacred verse i find nor can their god himself compose my mind the greedy maid will naught but gold receive and that alas is none of mine to give hence hence unprofitable muse remove hence if you cannot aid me in my love no battles now my mournful lines recite i sing not how the roman legions fight nor how the sun performs his daily race nor how the moon at night supplies his place all that i wish the charms of verse may prove is for a free access to her i love for that alone is all my constant care be gone ye muses if ye fail me there but i by rapine must my gifts procure or lie unheard unpitied at her door or from the shrines of gods the trophies bear and what i rob from heaven present to her treat her at other goddesses expense and cost but treat her at the charge of venus most her chiefly shall my daring hands invade i to this misery am by her betrayed she gave me first this mercenary maid o to all ages let him stand accursed whoever began this trade in loving first whoever made silly nymphs their value know who will not yield without their purchase now he was the fatal cause of all this ill and brought up customs we continue still hence first the doors of mistresses were barred and howling dogs appointed for their guard but if you bring the price the mighty rate at which her beauties by herself are set the bars unloosd lay open every door and even the conscious mastiffs bark no more whatever unwary inconsiderate god beauty on mercenary maids bestowed how ill to such was the vast present given who fell the invaluable gift of heaven oh how unworthily were such endowed with so much ill confounding so much good from hence our quarrels and our strifes commence all our dissentions take their spring from hence hence it is so few to cupids altars move and without zeal approach the shrines of love but you who thus his sacred rights profane and shut his votaries out for sordid gain may storms and fire your illgot wealth pursue and what you took from us retake from you while we with pleasure see the flames aspire and not a man attempts to quench the fire or may you haste to your eternal home and no fond youth no mournful lover come to pay the last sad service at your tomb while the kind generous she who scorned to prize or rate herself at less than joys for joys though she her liberal pleasures should outlive and reach an age unfit to take or give yet when she dies she shall not die unmournd nor on her funeral pile unwept be burned but some old man who knew her in her bloom with reverence of their past delights shall come and with an annual garland crown her tomb then shall he wish her in her endless night her sleep may pleasing be her earth be light all this my cruel fair is truth i tell but what will unregarded truth avail love his own way his empire will maintain and have no laws prescribed him how to reign he rules with too too absolute a sway and we must in our own despite obey should my fair tyrant nemesis command her humbled slave to sell his native land all at her order should convert to gold nor house nor householdgod remain unsold take the most baneful simples circe used or mad medea in her bowls infused gather the deadliest herbs and rankest weeds the magic country of thessalia breeds mingle the surest poisons in my cup and let my love command i will drink them up tibullus book iv eleg xiii to his mistress by the same no other maid my settled faith shall move no other mistress shall supplant your love my flames were sealed with this auspicious vow that which commenced them then confirms them now in you alone my constant pleasure lies for you alone seem pleasing in my eyes oh that you seemed to none but me divine let others look with other eyes than mine then might i of no rival youth afraid all to myself enjoy my charming maid i am not ambitious of the public voice to speak your beauties or applaud my choice none of their envious praises are desired i would not have the nymph i love admired he that is wise will not his bliss proclaim nor trust it to the lavish tongue of fame but a safe silent privacy esteem which gives him joys unknown to all but him to woods and wilds i could with thee remove secure of life when once secure of love to wait on thee could desert paths explore where never human footstep trod before peace of my soul and charmer of my cares thou courage of my heart thou conqueror of my fears disposer of my days unerring light and safe conductress in my darkest night thou who alone art all i wish to see thou who alone art all the world to me should the bright dames of heaven the wives of gods to court my bed forsake their blessed abodes with all their charms endeavoring to divert my fixed affections and estrange my heart to thee vain rivals all the train should prove vain suit the glorious nymphs to me should move who would not change thee for the queen of love all this i swear by all the powers divine but swear by juno most because she is thine fool that i am to let you know your power on this confession you will insult the more in fiercer flames make your poor vassal burn and treat your suppliant slave with greater scorn but take it all all that i can confess and oh believe me that i feel no less to thee my fate entirely i resign my love and life and all my soul is thine you know my cruel fair you know my pains and pleased and proud you see me drag your chains but if to venus i for succor flee she will end your tyrant reign and rescue me a farewell to poetry first printed in the monthly miscellany february       with the following introduction by mr p motteux an ingenious gentleman seems to bid adieu to his muse in the following lines but spite of his angry fit i hope that he is too much in love with her to be in earnest mr hopkins continued to write till within a few hours of his death as will appear by the poem which next follows n  by the same as famished men whom pleasing dreams delude seem to grow full with their imagined food appease their hunger and indulge their taste with fancied dainties while their visions last till some rude hand breaks up the flattering scene awakened with regret they starve again so the false muse prepares her vainer feasts and so she treats her disappointed guests she promises vast things immortal fame vast honor vast applause a deathless name but well awake we find it all a dream soft tales she tells with an enchanting tongue and luls our souls with the bewitching song how she alone makes heroes truly great how dead long since she keeps them living yet shows her parnassus like a flowery grove fair and delightful as the bowers above the fittest place for poetry and love we hunt the pleasures through the fairy coast till in our fruitless search ourselves are lost so the great artist drew the lively scene where hungry birds snatched at the grapes in vain tired with the chase i give the phantom over and am resolved to be deceived no more thus the fond youth who long in vain has strove with the fierce pangs of unsuccessful love with joy like mine breaks the perplexing chain freed by some happy chance from all his pain with joy like mine he grows himself again a hymn by the same about an hour before his death when in great pain first printed in the student      n  to thee my god though late at last i turn not for my sufferings but my sins i mourn for all my crimes thy mercy i implore and to those mercies thou have shown before add lord thy grace that i may sin no more i beg thy goodness to prolong my breath and give me life but to prepare for death pardon o pardon my transgressions past lord i repent let my repentance last  let me again this mortal race begin let me live on but not live on to sin  which if thy heavenly wisdom find unfit thy will be done i humbly do submit but let thy sovereign mercy bear the sway let justice throw the flaming sword away or man can never abide the dreadful day o by the cross and passion of thy son whose sacred death the life of man begun by that dear blood which our redemption cost and by the coming of the holy ghost deliver us amidst the life to come in the last hour and at the day of doom an epistle to a friend by mr john hopkins another son of the good bishop of londonderry born jan        like his elder brother his poetry was principally on subjects of love like him too his prospects in life appear to have terminated unfortunately he published in school the triumphs of peace or the glories of nassau a pindarie poem occasioned by the conclusion of the peace between the confederacy and france written at the time of his grace the duke of ormonds entrance into dublin the design of this poem the author says in his preface begins after the method of pindar to one great man and rises to another first touches the duke then celebrates the actions of the king and so returns to the praises of the duke again  but the principal performance of mr j hopkins was amasia or the works of the muses a collection of poems in three volumes   00 each of these little volumes is divided into three books and each book is inscribed to some beautiful patroness amongst whom the duchess of grafton stands foremost the last book is inscribed to the memory of amasia whom he addresses throughout these volumes in the character of sylvius there is a vein of seriousness if not of poetry runs through the whole performance many of ovids stories are very decently imitated most of them he says have been very well performed by my brother and published some years since mine were written in another kingdom before i knew of his in one of his dedications he tells the lady olimpia robartes your ladyships father the late earl of radnor when governor of ireland was the kind patron to mine he raised him to the first steps by which he afterward ascended to the dignities he bore to those which rendered his labors more conspiuous and set in a more advantageous light those living merits which now make his memory beloved these and yet greater temporal honors your family heaped on him by making even me in some sort related and allied to you by his intermarriage with your sister the lady araminta how imprudent a vanity is it in me to boast a father so meritorious how may i be ashamed to prove myself his son by poetry that only qualification he so much excelled in but yet esteemed no excellence i bring but a bad proof of birth laying my claim in that only thing he would not own these are however madam but the products of immaturer years and riper age may i hope bring forth more solid works  i have never seen any other of his writings nor have been able to collect any farther particulars of his life but have a portrait of him under his poetical name of sylvius n  to you dear youth now banished from the swains your rural friend in rural notes complains from my blessed groves those longlovd mansions hurled urged by misfortunes i must view the world but with as much regret to see it fly as they to leave it who are doomed to die from these dear shades unwillingly i go as men condemned to visit shades below since my late ills which will be ever new still fresh misfortunes your lost friend pursue amasias fall struck me to deep despair and now fates utmost malice i can bear inured to storms now let the billows roar with fullspread sails i will shun the lazy shore he who has oce been wrecked  has flt the worst and cannot suffer more just over my head the breaking clouds have gone the bolts have struck then sure their fury s done i fear no flashes now  let the heavens thunder on by grave acquaintance whom the world calls friends i am advised to quit my purposed ends but now long planted in the muses land i can no other language understand all worldly gains beyond my reach must prove for i am bent on poetry and love should frowning heaven its usual storms abate which i cannot think without a wrong to fate my joys would grow as now my sorrows great but should no fortunes no success attend the bold aspiring fondness of your friend trust me no disappointment shall i find nor be deceived unless the gods grow kind in vain you move me with your charming strain and tell of fancied generous nymphs in vain the british beauties sure have noble souls but still it is gold it is gold my friend controls no charming fair will hear the suppliant sue who spaks not golden words  it is gold must woe and all despair who want it all  but you oh should some beauty in her heavenly bloom to the embraces of your sylvius come some bright dear maid framed of a nobler mould who scorns to sell her charms for sordid gold above her sexs meanest pride and generously bold blessed by our nuptials sure we both should grow i though the husband still the lover too a mistress so divine should be for ever so my loftiest muse should sing her matchless fame the fires of love should yield my fancy flame she should for ever live  named my amasia and adorn the name give my respects to those few friends we know to those few friends whom i found always so my real service and chief thoughts commend who serves no mistress best can serve his friend borne on m muses wings i haste to you leave these low vales and glorys heights pursue adieu my friend  adieu dear shades adieu to the lord cutts of whom see p     n  by the same school let some with servile mean devices bow and bend their souls as well as bodies low flatter the great cringe deep to gain esteem and by their own dishonor honor them by wiles like these new  ours poorly claim i pay your lordship but what s paid by fame it is through your merits not my own i choose thus to salute you by my rising muse not fawning low like others must she sue she must fly up to pay respect to you let others spread their patrons feathers far the toys of peace your laurels spread through war some pride in wreaths which bolder arms have made but your own conquering hands have decked your head to you my lord a double crown is due at once the hero and the poet too since nassaus actions still remain untold while dryden lives immortal yet he is old it is you we hope will make them far adored and serve him with your pen as well as sword

sovereign choose wars your delight bellona is your muse your pen and sword with like success you wield famed through your study glorious through the field with the same vigor and impulse of thought now may you write as through the plains you fought in the attempt though my weak genius fail be pleased at least to recommend my zeal unknown this favor dare i humbly claim unknown to you my lord unknown to fame i like those soldiers which in war you led disdain to fear while i have you my head your wellraisd greatness my success secures i grow assured of fame by trusting yours great both in arts and arms our jove in you secures his lightning and his thunder too thus should your judgment my presumption blame pleased shall this semele expire in flame to you my lord most fit this suit i

mankind excel he was what no man ever was before nor can indulgent nature give us more for to make him she exhausted all her store against the fear of death by sir robert howard of whom see vol i p     n  since all must certainly to death resign why should we make it dreadful or repine how vain is fear where nothing can prevent the loss which he that loses cannot lament the fear of death is by our folly brought we fly the acquaintance of it in a thought from something into nothing is a change grown terrible by making it so strange we always should remember death is sure what grows familiar most we best endure for life and death succeed like night and day and neither gives increase nor brings decay no more or less by what takes birth or dies and the same mass the teeming world supplies from death we rose to life it is but the same through life again to pass from whence we came with shame we see our passions can prevail where reason certainty and virtue fail honor that empty name can death despise scorned love to death as to a refuge flies and sorrow waits for death with longing eyes hope triumphs over the thought of death and fate cheats fools and flatters the unfortunate perhaps deceived by lustsupplying wealth nowenjoyd pleasures and a present health we fear to lose what a small time must waste till life itself grows the disease at ast begging for life we beg for more decay and to be long a dying only pray no just and temperate thought can tell us why we should fear death or grieve for them that die the time we leave behind is ours no more nor our concern than time that was before twere a fond sight if those that stay behind for the same passage waiting for a wind to drive them to their port should on the shore lamenting stand for those that went before we all must
