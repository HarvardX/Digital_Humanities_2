the character of katharine late duchess of buckinghamshire and normanby  by the late mr pope  london printed for m cooper in paternoster row mdccxlvi  the character of katharine late duches of buckinghamshire etc etc she was the daughter of james the second and of the countess of dorchester who inherited the integrity and virtue of her father with happier fortune she was married first to james earl of anglesey and secondly to john sheffield duke of buckinghamshire and normanby with the former she exercised the virtues of patience and suffering as long as there was any hopes of doing good by either with the latter all other conjugal virtues the man of finest sense and sharpest discernment she had the happiness to please and in that found her only pleasure when he died it seemed as if his spirit was only breathed into her to fulfill what he had begun to perform what he had concerted and to preserve and watch over what he had left his only son in the care of whose health the forming of whose mind and the improvement of whose fortune she acted with the conduct and sense of the father softened but not overcome with the tenderness of the mother her understanding was such as must have made a figure had it been in a man but the modesty of her sex threw a veil over its luster which nevertheless suppressed only the expression not the exertion of it for her sense was not superior to her resolution which when once she was in the right preserved her from making it only a transition to the wrong the frequent weakness even of the best women she often followed wise counsel but sometimes went before it always with success she was possessed of a spirit which assisted her to get the better of those accidents which admitted of any redress and enabled her to support outwardly with decency and dignity those which admitted of none yet melted inwardly through almost her whole life at a succession of melancholy and affecting objects the loss of all her children the misfortunes of relations and friends public and private and the death of those who were dearest to her her heart was as compassionate as it was great her affections warm even to solicitude her friendship not violent or jealous but rational and persevering her gratitude equal and constant to the living to the dead boundless and heroical what person soever she found worthy of her esteem she would not give up for any power on earth and the greatest on earth whom she could not esteem obtained from her no farther tribute than decency her good will was wholly directed by merit not by accident not measured by the regard they professed for her own desert but by her idea of theirs and as there was no merit which she was not able to imitate there was none which she could envy therefore her conversation was as free from detraction as her opinions from prejudice or prepossession as her thoughts were her own so were her words and she was as sincere in uttering her judgment as impartial in forming it she was a safe companion many were served none ever suffered by her acquaintance inoffensive when unprovoked when provoked not stupid but the moment her enemy ceased to be hurtful she could cease to act as an enemy she was therefore not a bitter but consistent enemy though indeed when forced to be so the more a finished one for having been long a making and her proceeding with ill people was more in a calm and steady course like justice than in quick and passionate onsets like revenge as for those of whom she only thought ill she considered them not so much as once to wish them ill of such her contempt was great enough to put a stop to all other passions that could hurt them her love and aversion her gratitude and resentment her esteem and neglect were equally open and strong and alterable only from the alteration of the persons who created them her mind was too noble to be insincere and her heart too honest to stand in need of it so that she never found cause to repent her conduct either to a friend or an enemy there remains only to speak of her person which was most amiably majestic the nicest eye could find no fault in the outward lineaments of her face or proportion of her body it was such as pleased wherever she had a desire it should yet she never envied that of any other which might better please in general in the same manner as being content that her merits were esteemed where she desired they should she never depreciated those of any other that were esteemed or prefered elsewhere for she aimed not at a general love or a general esteem where she was not known it was enough to be possessed of both wherever she was having lived to the age of sixtytwo years not courting regard but receiving it from all who knew her not loving business but discharging it fully wheresoever duty or friendship engaged her in it not following greatness but not declining to pay respect as far as was due from independency and disinterest having honorably absolved all the parts of life she forsook this world where she had left no act of duty or virtue undone for that where alone such acts are rewarded on the   th day of march       the above character was written by mr pope some years before her graces death
