hecuba a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  rectius iliacum carmen deducis in actus quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxii price one shilling and sixpence  to thomas barrett esquire the following tragedy is inscribed by his obliged and very affectionate humble servant the author  advertisement it may perhaps be necessary to acquaint the reader that the author has ventured to make polydore a person of the drama on the authority of hyginus a greek grammarian who tells us in one of his fables that ilione by a feigned murder deceived polymestor and preserved her brothers life  prologue written by mr lloyd and spoken by mr garrick a grecian bard two thousand years ago pland this sad fable of illustrious woe wakened each soft emotion of the breast and called forth tears that would not be suppressed yet o ye mighty sirs of judgment chaste who lacking genius have a deal of taste can you forgive our modern ancient piece which brings no chorus though it comes from greece kind social chorus which all humors meets and sings and dances up and down the streets  oh might true taste in these unclassic days revive the grecian fashions with their plays then raised on stilts our players would stalk and rage and at three steps stride over a modern stage each gesture then would boast unusual charms from lengthened legs stuffed body sprawling arms your critic eye would then no pigmies see but buskins make a giant even of me no features then the poets mind would trace but one blank vizor blot out all the face o glorious times when actors thus could strike expressive inexpressive all alike less change of face than in our punch they saw for punch can roll his eyes and wag his jaw with one set glare they mouthed the rumbling verse our gog and magog look not half so fierce yet though deprived of instruments like these nature perhaps may find a way to please which wheresoeer she glows with genuine flame in greece in rome in england is the same of raillery then ye modern wits beware nor damn the grecian poet for the player theirs was the skill with honest help of art to win by just degrees the yielding heart what if our shakespeare claims the magic throne and in one instant makes us all his own they differ only in the point of view for shakespeares nature was their nature too dramatis

womanish weakness call it nothing bett i feel a crimson blush burn on my cheek even at the thought was it for this dread i we led our argives to scamanders banks to toil ten tedious years was it for this you crowned those toils with conquest oh for pity send thy sage spirit to direct our councils that veer as passion drives see where our sails stand bent at chersonesus to transport us and our spoils to greece and shall we leave the noblest most important part behind the queen of troy and her young dangerous daughter because pyrechmes bids what is pyrechmes that greece in her full glory fears his frown greece has more cause to fear a future foe yes from released polyxena may spring new hectors armed to wreak revenge hereafter and send our sons to people plutos realms by force i must detain her or by fraud for my own sake i must for on ulysses the shame the weakness want of policy all fall upon ulysses  talthybius yet the queens distressful state   ulysses talthybius do not think

charge as twere beneath his wing i do not like that caution it means mischief else wherefore ventured not the youth alone what needed this greybearded monitor to help him pay the ransom  say to nestor i will meet him at his tent exit tal my doubts were just danger does lurk beneath the hoary locks of this melanthus there is some secret plot  it is scarce engendered yet and prudence bids we crush the dangerous birth yes if the wizard i have conjured up wave skilfully his wand the princess shall be fettered with a charm faster than his fond efforts can undo and for the queen  why let the queen go free it harms not us her barren womb no more shall teem with trojan pests and such an act may smooth the roughness of our enterprise and calm pyrechmes true we fear him not yet policy forbids us to

seems and free and from his shallow mind my art may draw the dangerous schemes of his grave monitor and do the chiefs rich service  he approaches but with him the old man i will withdraw till a fit time and muse on some device to lure this youngling from his tutors beck  exit eriphilus melanthus aethron aethron here does my guidance end behold the place where all the livelong day the royal captives pour forth their piteous plaints that little tent spread in the darksom gloom of yon lone beech contains all troy  eriphilus thanks for thy conduct soldier yet sure it needed not this faroff station these interrupted bursts of female sorrow proclaim it the queens dwelling there she lies the daughter of affliction whelmed with woes so vast humanity trembles to think her of its own species  melanthus from the book of fate joves equal hand to every mortal man deals his due portion be it bliss or woe think not i mean to check thy noble nature thou too art born a man and as thou art thy soul perforce must melt at human sufferings but learn dear youth with reverential awe to kiss heavens ministering rod  eriphilus oh good melanthus cast but a thought on that illustrious scene which once was troy where now her menacing bulwarks rich palaces proud towers that propt the skies where her intrepid heroes reverend seers all all are fallen even godlike priams fallen the good old king deaths ruthless scythe has swept him amid the general carnage to the tomb him and his numerous race but oh ye powers if i am ordained to save these royal captives  if i am sent your aweful delegate to counteract their fate  they shall be free i feel they shall i come heavens minister and glory in the sacred embassy  melanthus hear me eriphilus    aethron do not repress his noble ardor here at chersonesus the greeks but stay to raise achilles tomb that finished the first favoring wind transports their fleet to greece go then illustrious strangers go like two guardian gods and sooth their souls  exit eriphilus i go  come on melanthus my soul burns to tell the joyful tidings  melanthus yet bethink thee when at achilles tomb thou did unfold pyrechmes will did hecubas redemption meet a full promise thy impetuous zeal even in the cause of virtue makes me tremble oh temper it dear youth think on the perils that lurk around thee on this dreadful isle there is not a greek but were thy secret known wears for thy life a dagger  eriphilus i will be calm soon shall thou find i will  but should atrides refuse the ransom  by the immortal powers distress like hecubas   melanthus the queens distress sinks in my heart as deep as thine which prompts my steadiest caution trust me this compliance with each rash impulse howsoeer disguised in friendships or in virtues specious form is but mean incense to our own fond passions then calmly to the tent back from the port i shall return before thou have dispatched thy business with the queen be quick be cautious be secret too  remember thou have sworn  exit eriphilus i have and powerful must the pang be found that scorn my soul the secret does extort  ulysses eriphilus ulysses well have thou sped brave youth soon as the tomb raised by our chiefs to great achilles shade is finished thou shall tender to troys queen the first best gift of jove her liberty  eriphilus thanks to the greeks the queen will soon be free   ulysses the princess too thy happy hand leads forth to gay paeonias court her eyes will dart new luster mid the charms that glitter there in beautys brilliant circle  eriphilus every tongue grows rapturous in her praise speaks her most fair yet not more fair than wise more wise than virtuous the powers of love and wisdom seem to vie which most should deck her minion  ulysses blessed the youth who could inspire a heart like hers with love  eriphilus oh blessed indeed if there be such a youth whose peerless qualities   ulysses sometimes it is seen that modest worth shrinks from the proffered bliss which the soul inly pines for that is false shame there is a time when merit may step forth and claim its due reward  eriphilus surely there is   ulysses then fear not gallant youth that thy mild virtues want power to draw from her enchanting eyes a favoring smile on thee  eriphilus on me good heavens a favoring smile on me  ulysses and wherefore not large is her worth but she is of mortal mould and know that on this sublunary scene perfection dwells not natures purest ore bears some alloy nay even yon glorious sun whose quickening beams all nature animate often sends forth barren droughts and purple deaths  eriphilus but she the princess    ulysses think thou she enjoys a sole exemption from a general fate  eriphilus yes virtue white as hers    ulysses the whitest virtue escapes not unblemished envys baleful breath soils even the snow that circles dians heart what wonder therefore should it brand the princess  eriphilus oh heavens for what   ulysses for that she was accomplice with paris in the murder of achilles even at the sacred shrine where her base tongue plighted the full assurance of her faith  eriphilus infernal falsehood   ulysses how  this bold behavior i will suits thy humble birth  eriphilus i am to blame  but were the villain here whose slandrous tongue thus wounds my honor   ulysses wounds your honor  yours    eriphilus did i say mine it was too proud a word yet  virtues is the general cause it is mine it is yours oh king and each affront it bears wounds both our honors and demands revenge polyxenas no murderer   ulysses but should pyrrhus credit the babbling rumor where were then thy embassy young man might not revenge devote her virgin beauties to the bed of a vile slave  eriphilus by heaven he dares not    ulysses dares not   eriphilus is he a king and dares he prostitute a subjects virtue for she is now his subject  ulysses she is his slave and not his subject youth   eriphilus is he a man and dares he do a deed humanity must shudder but to hear  ulysses yet duty to his fathers reverend shade may prompt him to confine the captive princess till the doubts cleared  or happily she may gain permission to depart so the queen stays a hostage in her stead and what imports it where hecuba dreams out her few last hours  eriphilus ye powers imports it not to the poor queen who tends her sickening age what pious hands pay the last dismal office to her shade wash her pale corse and in the hallowed urn her sacred ashes close  ulysses much do i love thy mild humanity that thus can melt at even a strangers woe for hardly coudst thou show tendrer feelings for a trojans fate were thou of trojan birth  how now talthybius  talthybius ulysses eriphilus talthybius great agamemnon and the grecian chiefs entreat your royal presence  ulysses at my tent to eriphilus meet me anon and do not fear success but yet take heed young man be not too sure for danger loves to lurk close by the side of negligent security repeat thy suit no more till the due rites are done to great achilles importunity creates suspicion know thou can not act with too much caution even the surest step may lose its footing on this slippery world  exit uly and tal eriphilus false cozning greek  but ah what fairy vision breaks on m enchanted sight  it comes upon me the floating form of some divinity that tends this mansion eriphilus polyxena say thou beauteous virgin if to the presence of the queen of troy thy guidance can conduct my friendly step i bring her welcome tidings  polyxena stranger no she shuns each human eye  eriphilus if thou art polyxena as something in my soul does more than whisper o royal maid permit an unknown youth one moments converse never till this hour did his heart melt with such soft sympathy  polyxena brief be thy speech young stranger   eriphilus hapless princess of fire of kingdom liberty bereft with scarce a friend to save thee from the scoffs of cruel conqurors   polyxena true i have no friend my fire my brethren all have left the sun but why should my distress wake in thy breast these sighs of pity  had thou known the queen   eriphilus i know the iron hand of destiny lies heavy on the queen but would fain hope my tidings might relume her lamp of life had grief its flame extinguished  polyxena vain attempt  but say whence come thou youth and what thy errand  eriphilus from blessed paeonias king sweet maid i come bear says pyrechmes to the queen of troy and to her peerless daughter our best greetings inform them that the rugged blasts of fortune have firmer in my soul that friendship rooted their virtues planted there and if the calm that lulls my court can blunt the edge of grief tell them my kingdom opens all its gates to give them entrance  polyxena he is a friend indeed   eriphilus unworthy he to bear the name of king unworthy even to bear the name of man who shares not such distress  to stop the ears of pity to the cries of common misery were a disgrace to nature but when fate frowns on an aged queen  a beauteous princess  i meant not to offend believe me fair one this tongue never learned to gloze in flattrys school  polyxena i do believe thee flattery may fawn lackey the heels of fortunes golden minions and kiss the stool of majesty  but oh can hecuba can i her child be flattered  eriphilus hear my soul speak  dear as my own i hold your welfares nearest to my heart they lie mixed with my own and stranger as i seem i for your precious lives would pour my blood  thou wonderst at my words and my fond heart is all on fire to tell thee  but an oath a solemn oath in silence locks my lips till we quit chersonesus quickly therefore lead to the queen  polyxena oh still i fear i fear the attempt were vain believe me gentle youth no power on earth can aid her and in heaven no power will aid her an inhuman wretch has murdered every hope  eriphilus and has no hand planted a poniard in the villains heart  polyxena no he still walks the earth drinks the pure breath of morn and on his breast the sun of heaven darts a warm ray of gladness as it shone for him alone   eriphilus oh name the inhuman foe    polyxena alas the fellest rancour of a foe patience might bear  but when the open heart unarmed with cautions or suspicions shield receives a stab from friendship  nay from duty  from filial duty  for oh earth and heaven the villain polymestor was her son  her daughters husband   eriphilis what the thracian king who wedded her ilione  polyxena to him guarded by good eumelus at the time when troy was first besieged she sent her son her infant polydore and with him sent treasures of such vast value as might raise another kingdom should troy yield to fate tempted by these the barbarous monster murdered his innocent brother  oh had you beheld the queens dread transports when she first received the fatal tidings   eriphilus fluttering heart be still   polyxena prone on the earth she fell with one deep groan deep as if life went in it then as struck by some quick impulse steadfast gazed on heaven in speechless agony her bosom heaved she grasped her hands and bursting into tears fell trancd into my arms  eriphilus my struggling soul will bear no more  thy polydore sweet maid  hah whither would my frenzy  polyxena what of him what of my polydore thy words thy actions thy looks i have marked a mystery in all oh answer me good youth say did thou know my polydore thou tremblest thy mild nature melts at the mention of that tragic tale alas who knows but thy fastflowing eyes did see the ruthless dagger rend his breast and let out his sweet life while vainly thou did wish for vengeance on the bloody villain  eriphilus vengeance shall overtake him else were i as very a slave sweet maid as he a villain  polyxena good youth  and will thou purge the groaning earth of such a wretch   eriphilus else should i blush to live   polyxena then hie thee to the queen for the blessed hope of such revenge may rouse her sorrowing soul to listen to thy suit  ah go and prosper  eriphilus lead on lead on  now bloody polymestor tremble  thy fate approaches   polyxena may the spirit of my dead hector march with thee along thrice noble youth bear a broad shield before thee and edge thy mortal sword  now to the tent for happily ere this time the dewy finger of morn has beckoned from the queens sad couch the friendly sleep that crept upon her woe and lo she comes  perhaps twere best retire for a short space anon thou may return why do thou tremble why thus gaze upon her haste screen thyself behind yon spreading beech  exit eriphilus hecuba sigea virgins hecuba lend virgins lend your aid a little onward lead from the tent support your queen support your fellowslave  oh dearer far to me to polyxena than life than liberty child of my heart what have i seen  all cheering light of heaven and thou tremendous night why these dread visions that rouse me from my couch and chill my breast with fearful drops like these  thou sable mother of duskypiniond dreams my soul abhors the ominous phantom thrice it stalked before me a terrible spectre stern achilles ghost  polyxena his ghost   hecuba it stopped and pointed at its wound then grinnd a horrid smile and disappeared  polyxena it is the mere coinage of a troubled mind   hecuba but then my virgins then  oh would to heaven sage helenus were here whose piercing eye does look into futuritys dark womb  methought sigea a gaunt ravening wolf did from my bosom tear with bloody tooth a milkwhite hind  ye ever gracious gods protect my dearest child  polyxena the gracious gods will

but give its tide a freer flow it is natures kind relief to her poor children she bids affliction weep away its woe  hecuba friend if i yet can call one mortal friend be not deceived nor let the good pyrechmes thy sovereign be deceived indeed i would not your kindness should misdeem poor hecuba an object fit for pity generous youth i will tell thee what i will not tell the greeks but should it ever scape thee   eriphilus it shall never but your heart will not suffer you to speak the tear starts in your eye repress the secret till happier times permit  hecuba till happier times   eriphilus oh rest on hope that heavenborn champion which never forsakes the virtuous but in perils lends confidence and leads them unappalld even to the gates of death  polyxena she heeds thee not but i will watch the first calm interval for now her mind seems hurrying through the waste of desolate despair too fast to mark compassions call  ah see  hecuba the dreadful gods who in their ireful mood have turned me forth this terrible example to mankind doubtless have cause wretched mortality believes and trembles but perforce must yield i yield me too i bow to your dread wills yet when my mind with scrutiny severe tries judges a long life of fourscore years and finds no crime but what dares look at pardon forgive forgive me if my bursting heart wishes that hecuba had never been born  eriphilus
