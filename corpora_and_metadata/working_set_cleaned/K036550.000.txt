faithful service how could she pass unseen by hell it is false thou have betrayed me  officer noble sir my duty   count your fraud your negligence  away reply not find her within this hour else by my life the gates of narbonne shall be closed against thee make the world thy country exit officer fabian stay misfortunes fall so thick upon my head they will not give me time to think to breathe  fabian heaven knows i wish your peace but am to learn what grief more fresh than my young lords decease a sorrow but of three days passed can move you  count o bitter memory gone gone for ever the pillar of my house my only son  fabian twas terrible indeed  count ay was it not and then the manner of it think on that disease that robbed me of two infant sons approaching slow bade me prepare to lose them i saw my lilies drooping and accustomed to see them dying bore to see them dead but o my edmund  thou rememberst fabian how blithe he went to seek the forests sport  fabian would i could not remember  count that cursed barb my fatal gift that dashed him down the cliff seemed proud or his gay burden  breathless mangled they bore him back to me fond man i hoped this day his happy match with isabel had made our line perpetual and this day the unfruitful grave receives him yes it is fate that dreadful denunciation against my house no prudence can avert nor prayers can soften  fabian think not on that some visionarys dream what house what family could ever know peace if each enthusiasts ravings were believed and frenzy deemed an insight of the future but may i dare to ask is it of moment to stir your anger thus that isabel has left the castle  count of the deepest moment my best hope hangs on her some future time i may instruct thee why  these cares unhinge me just now a herald from her angry father left me this dire election  to resign my titles and this ample signory worthy a monarchs envy or to meet him and try my right by arms but prythee tell nor let a fear to wound thy masters pride restrain thy licensed speech have thou ever heard my father raymond  cast not down thine eye  by any indirect or bloody means procured that instrument alphonsos will that made him heir to narbonne  fabian my best lord at all times would i fain withold from you intelligence unwelcome but most now at seasons such as this a friendly tongue should utter words like balm but what you ask   count  i ask to be informed of have thou known me from childhood up to man and can thou fear i am so weak of soul like a thin reed to bend and stagger at each puny blast no when the tempest rages round my head i give my branches wider to the air and strike my root more deeply  to thy tale away with palliatives and compliment  speak plainly  fabian plainly then my lord i have heard what for the little breath i have to draw i would not to the black extent of rumor give credit to  but you command me speak   count thy pauses torture me  can i hear worse than this black scroll contains this challenge here from isabellas father haughty godfrey in broad and unambiguous words he tells me my father was a murderer and forged alphonsos testament  fabian from palestine that tale crept hither where foul slander says the good alphonso not as we believe died of a fever but a venomed draught your father his companion of the cross did with his own hand mingle his hand too assisted by some cunning practisers modeled that deed which barring godfreys right and other claims from kindred named count raymond lord of these fair possessions  count ha i have it it is godfreys calumny he has coined this lie and his late visit to the holy land no doubt has furnished likelihood of proof to give his fiction color  fabian sure it is so  count he too has forged this idle prophecy to shake me with false terrors this prediction which but to think of used to freeze my veins that no descendant from my fathers loins should live to see a grandson nor heavens wrath cease to afflict us till alphonsos heir succeeded to his just inheritance hence superstition mines my tottering state loosens my vassals faith and turns their tears which else would fall for my calamities to gloomy pause and gaping reverence while all my woes to their perverted sense seem but the mavelous accomplishment of revelation out of natures course  fabian reason must so interpret good my lord what answer was returned to godfreys challenge  count defiance  fabian heaven defend you  count heaven defend me i hope it will and this right arm to boot but hark i hear a noise  perhaps my people have found the fugitive  haste bid them enter exit fabian scene ii count alone she eyed me with abhorrence at the sound of love of marriage sled indignant from me yet i must win her should she meet my wish godfrey would prop the right he strives to shake securing thus to his fair daughters issue all that now hangs on the swords doubtful point her beauty too each soft attractive grace i saw with jealous pleasure even when destined to my sons arms his death removes one bar and fortune to my double aim conspiring i will silence saucy conscience  scene iii to the count fabian officer and attendants bringing in a young peasant now what tidings where is the lady officer we have searched in vain the castle round left not an aile or vault unvisited  count damnation  officer near the cloister from whence by the flat doors descent a passage beneath the ground leads onward to the convent we heard the echo of a falling weight and sought it by the sound  count well and what then  officer the unsettled dust left us no room to doubt the door had just been raised  count she has escaped and by confedracy to force that bar without more aid had baffled twice her strength go on  officer we entered with resistance bold this peasant pushed us backward from the spot my arm was raised to smite him but respect for something in his aspect checked the blow he chiding parlying by turns gave time for whosoever had descended there the lady doubtless to elude our search the rest himself will tell  count to the peasant ha what art thou  peasant it seems thy prisoner disengage me first from their rude gripe and i may tell thee more  count unhand him i should know thee i have seen features like thine answer me were thou found as these men say  peasant i was  count and what thy purpose  peasant chance brought me there  count and did chance lead thee too to aid a fugitive  peasant they saw not that  count they saw it not how could her delicate hands weak soft and yielding to the gentlest touch sustain that ponderous mass no those tough arms thy force assisted else thou young dissembler   peasant she had been seized and by compulsion brought where i stand now  count thou do avow it then boast it even to my face audacious stripling such insolence and these coarse rustic weeds are contradictions answer me who art thou  peasant less than i should be more than what i seem  count hence with this saucy ambiguity what is thy name thy country that mean habit which should teach humbleness speaks thy condition  peasant my name is theodore my country france my habit little suited to my mind less to my birth yet sit for my condition  count o thou art then some young adventurer some roving knight a hero in disguise who scorning forms of vulgar ceremony no leave obtained waiting no invitation enters our castles wanders over our halls to succor dames distressed or pilfer gold where are your train your pages and your squires perhaps but poorly lodged i am to blame but must excuse my scanted courtesy by ignorance of your high character  peasant there is a source of reverence for thee here forbids me though provoked retort thy taunts  count if i endure this more i shall grow vile even to my hinds   peasant hold let me stop thy wrath i see thy quivering lip thy fiery eye forerun a storm of passion to prevent thee from terms too harsh perhaps for thee to offer or me to hear poor as i seem with honor i will cut short thy interrogatories and on this theme give thee the full extent of all i know or thou can wish to learn  count do it  peasant without a view to thwart thy purpose be what it might was i within thy walls in a dim passage of the castleailes musing alone i heard a hasty tread and breath drawn short like one in fear of peril a lady entered fair she seemed and young guiding her timorous footsteps by a lamp the lord the tyrant of this place she cried for a detested purpose follows me aid me good youth then pointing to the ground that door she added leads to sanctuary i seized an iron hold and while i tugged to heave the unwilling weight i learned her title  count the lady isabel  peasant the same a gleam shot from their torches who pursued her track prevented more she hastened to the cave and vanished from my sight  count and did no awe no fear of him she called this castles lord its tyrant chill thee  peasant awe nor fear i know not and trust shall never for i know not guilt  count then thou it seems art master here not i thou can control my projects blast my schemes and turn to empty air my power in narbonne nay should my daughter choose to fly my castle against my bidding guards and bolts were vain this frizeclad champion gallant theodore would lend his ready arm and mock my caution  peasant thy daughter o i were indeed too blessed could i but live to render her a service  count my daughter would i hope disdain thy service  peasant wherefore am i to blame what i have done were it to do again again i would do it and may this arm drop palsied by my side when its cold sinews shrink to aid affliction  count indeed  peasant indeed frown on ask thy own heart  did innocence and beauty bend before thee hunted and trembling would thou tamely pause scanning pale counsel from deliberate fear and weigh each possibility of danger no the instinctive nobleness of blood would start beyond the reach of such cold scruples and instant gratify its generous ardour  count aside i must know more of this his phrase his look his steady confidence raise something here bids me beware of him  i have no time to bandy idle words with slaves like thee i doubt not thy intent was mischievous booty perhaps or blood till more enquiry clear or condemn him hold him in your guard give none admittance  take him from my sight  peasant secure in her integrity my soul casts back thy mean suspicions and forgives thee theodore is led out scene iv count fabian count away with him  what means this heaviness my heart that like a welltrimmd gallant bark was wont to mount the waves and dash them off in ineffectual foam now seems to crack and let in each assailing tide to sink me i must not yield to this dull lethargy good fabian hie thee to saint nicholas bid holy austin straight repair to me exit fabian scene v count alone his sanctity and reverend character his pious eloquence made engines for me might save a world of anguish to my soul and smooth my unwelcome purpose to hortensia but how prevail with him  ambition  no the world is dead in him and gold is trash to one who neither needs nor values it interest and love shall wear the guise of conscience i must pretend nice scruples which i feel not and make him mediate for me with the church yet he reveres the countess and i fear will spy more sin in doubts that wound her quiet than in my stifling them but see she comes with downcast eye and sad dejected mien i will not yet disclose it  scene vi to him the countess where is my child my all of comfort now my adelaide countess dear as she is i would not have her all for i should then be nothing time has been when after three long days of absence from you you would have questioned me a thousand times and bid me tell each trifle of myself then satisfied at last that all were well at last unwilling turn to meaner cares  count this is the nature still of womankind if fondness be their mood we must cast off all gravecomplexiond thought and turn our souls quite from their tenor to wild levity vary with all their humors take their hues as unsubstantial iris from the sun our bosoms are their passive instruments vibrate their strain or all our notes are discord  countess o why this new unkindness from thy lips never till now fell such ungentle words nor ever less was i prepared to meet them  count never till now was i so urged beset hemmed round with perils  countess ay but not by me  count by thee and all the world but yesterday with uncontrolable and absolute sway i ruled this province was the unquestioned lord of this strong castle and its wide domains stretched beyond sight around me and but now the axe perhaps is sharpning may hew down my perished trunk and give the soil i sprung from to cherish my proud kinsman godfreys roots  countess heaven guard thy life his dreadful summons reached me this urged me hither on my knees i beg and i have mighty reasons for my prayer o do not meet him on this argument by gentler means strive to divert his claim fly this detested place this house of horror and leave its gloomy grandeur to your kinsman  count rise fearful woman what renounce my birthright go forth like a poor friendless banished man to gnaw my heart in cold obscurity thou weak adviser should i take thy counsel thy tongue would first upbraid thy spirit scorn me  countess no on my soul  is narbonne all the world my country is where thou art place is little the sun will shine the earth produce its fruits cheerful and plenteously wherever we wander in humbler walks blessed with my child and thee i would think it eden in some lonely vale nor heave one sigh for these proud battlements  count such flowery softness suits not matron lips but thou have mighty reasons for thy prayer they should be mighty reasons to persuade their rightful lord to leave his large possessions a soldier challenged to decline the combat  countess and are not prodigies then mighty reasons the owl mistakes his season in broad day screaming his hideous omens specter glide gibbering and pointing as we pass along while the deep earths unorganized caves send forth wild sounds and clamours terrible these towers shake round us though the untroubled air stagnates to lethargy  our children perish and new disasters blacken every hour blood shed unrighteously blood unappeasd though we are guiltless cries i fear for vengeance  count blood shed unrighteously have i shed blood no natures common frailties set aside i will meet my audit boldly  countess mighty lord o not on us with justice too severe visit the sin not ours  count what can this mean something thou would reveal that is terrible  countess too long alas it has weighed upon my heart a thousand times i have thought to tell thee all but my tongue falterd and refused to wound thee  count distract me not but speak  countess i must your father was wise brave politic but mad ambition heaven pardon him it prompts to desperate deeds  count i scarce can breathe prythee be quick and ease me  countess your absence on the italian embassy left him you know alone to my fond care long had some hidden grief like a slow fire wasted his vitals  on the bed of death one object seemed to harrow up his soul the picture of alphonso in the chamber on that his eye was set  methinks i see him his ashy hue his grizzled bristling hair his palms spread wide for ever would he cry that aweful form how terrible he frowns see how he bares his livid leprous breast and points the deadly chalice  count ha even so  countess sometimes he would seize my hands and grasp them close and strain them to his hollow burning eyes then falter out i am i am a villain mild angel pray for me stir not my child it comes again oh do not leave my side at last quite spent with mortal agonies his soul went forth and heaven have mercy on him  count enough thy tale has almost iced my blood let me not think hortensia on thy duty suffer no breath like this to pass thy lips i will not taint my noble fathers honor by vile suspicions sucked from natures dregs and the loose ravings of distempered fancy  countess yet o decline this challenge  count that hereafter mean time prepare my daughter to receive a husband of my choice should godfrey come strife might be so prevented bid her try her beautys power stand thou but neuter fate courage and art shall arm me from mankind exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i a chamber fabian jaqueline fabian no no it cannot be my lords commands were absolute that none should visit him  jaqueline what need he know it  fabian but perchance he should the study of my life has been his pleasure nor will i risk his favor to indulge such unavailing curiosity  jaqueline call it not so i have kind counsel for him which if he follow it may serve to speed the hour of his deliverance and appease the unjustlyangerd count  fabian pray be content i dare not do it have this castles walls housed thee nine years and art thou yet to learn the temper of the count served and obeyed there lives not one more gracious liberal offend him and his rage is terrible i would rather play with serpents but fair jaqueline setting aside the comeliness and grace of this young rustic which i own are rare and baits to catch all women prythee tell why are you thus solicitous to see him  jaqueline in me twere base to be indifferent he was my lifes preserver nay preserved a life more precious yes my dear young mistress but for his aid the eternal sleep of death had closed the sweetest eyes that ever beamed aloof and frighted stood her coward train and saw a furious band of desperate slaves inured to blood and rapine bear her off  fabian what when the gang of outlawed thiery rushed on her chariot near the wood of zart was he the unknown youth who succored her all good betide him for it  jaqueline yes twas he from one tame wretch he snatched a halfdrawn sword and dealt swift vengeance on the ruffian crew two at his seet stretched dead the rest amazed fled muttering curses while he bore her back unhurt but by her fears  fabian he should be worshipped have statues raised to him for by my life i think there does not breathe another like her it makes me young to see her lovely eyes such charity such sweet benevolence so fair and yet so humble praised for ever nay wondered at for natures rarest gifts yet lowlier than the lowest  jaqueline is it strange fair adelaide and i thus bound to him are anxious for his safety what offense and sure twas unintended could provoke the rigorous count thus to imprison him  fabian my lord was ever proud and choleric the youth perhaps unused to menaces brookd them but ill and darted frown for frown this stirred the count to fury but fear nothing all will be well i will wait the meetest season and be his advocate  jaqueline mean time repair to him bid him be patient let him want no comfort kind care can minister my lady comes may i assure her of your favor to him  fabian assure her that the man who saved her life is dear to fabian as his vital blood exit scene ii to jaqueline adelaide adelaide i sent thee to his prison quickly tell me what says he does he know my sorrow for him does he confound me with the unfeeling crew who act my fathers bidding can his love pity my grief and bear this wrong with patience  jaqueline i strove in vain to enter fabian holds him by the counts charge in strictest custody and fearful to awake his masters wrath though much unwilling bars me from his presence  adelaide unkind old man i would myself entreat him but fear my earnest look these starting tears might to the experience of his prying age reveal a secret which in vain i strive to hide from my own breast  jaqueline alas dear lady did not your tongue reveal it your changed mien once lighter than the airy woodnymphs shade now turned to pensive thought and melancholy  involuntary sighs  your cheek unlike its wonted bloom as is the redveind rose to the dim sweetness of the violet  these had too soon betrayed you but take heed the color of our fate too often is tinged mournful or bright but from our first affections  adelaide foul disproportion draws down shame on love but where is the crime in fair equality mean birth presumes a mind uncultivate left to the coarseness of its native soil to grow like weeds and die like them neglected but he was born my equal lineagd high and titled as our great ones then his soul  the blood of valois circling in his veins could add no jot to its true royalty  jaqueline how easy is our faith to what we wish his story may be feigned  adelaide i will not mistrust him since the blessed hour that brought him first to save me how often have i listened to the tale it varies not for truth s invariable he needs no vouchers gallant generous youth thy sport misfortune from his infant years  will thou pursue him still  jaqueline indeed it is hard  adelaide but oh the pang that these ungrateful walls should be his prison here if i were aught his presence should have made it festival these gates untouched had leaped to give him entrance and songs of joy made glad the way before him instead of this think what has been his welcome dragged by rude hands before a furious judge insulted menaced like the vilest slave and doomed unheard to ignominious bondage  jaqueline your father knew not of his service to you  adelaide no his indignant soul disdained to tell it great spirits conscious of their inborn worth scorn by demand to force the praise they merit they feel a flame beyond their brightest deeds and leave the weak to note them and to wonder  jaqueline suppress these strong emotions the counts eye is quick to find offense should he suspect this unpermitted passion twould draw down more speedy vengeance on the helpless youth turning your fatal fondness to his ruin  adelaide indeed i want thy counsel yet oh leave me find if my gold my gems can ransom him had i the world it should be his as freely i would go kirtled like a villagemaid plain all my life in natures simplest dress rather than decked with proud superfluous wealth while one more worthy wanting lifes poor means upbraids the insulting splendor of abundance  jaqueline trust to my care the countess comes to seek you her eye is this way bent conceal this grief all may be lost if you betray such weakness exit  scene iii adelaide alone o love thy sway makes me unnatural the tears which should bedew the grave yet green of a dear brother turning from their source forget his death and fall for theodore  scene iv to her the countess countess come near my love when thou art from my side methinks i wander like some gloomy ghost who doomed to tread alone a dreary round remembers the lost things that made life precious yet sees no end of cheerless solitude  adelaide we have known too much of sorrow yet twere wise to turn our thoughts from what mischance has ravished and rest on what it leaves my fathers love   countess was mine but is no more it is passed it is gone that ray at least i hoped would never set my guide my light through fortunes blackest shades it was my dear reserve my secret treasure i stored it up as misers hoard their gold sure counterpoise for lifes severest ills vain was my hope for loves soft sympathy he pays me back harsh words unkind reproof and looks that stab with coldness  adelaide oh most cruel and were he not my father i could rail call him unworthy of thy wondrous virtues blind and unthankful for the greatest blessing heavens everbounteous hand could shower upon him  countess no adelaide we must subdue such thoughts obedience is thy duty patience mine just now with stern and peremptory briefness he bade me seek my daughter and dispose her to wed by his direction  adelaide the saints forbid to wed by his direction wed with whom  countess i know not whom he counsels with himself  adelaide i hope he cannot mean it  countess twas his order  adelaide o madam on my knees   countess what would my child why are thy hands thus raised why stream thine eyes why flutters thus thy bosom adelaide speak to me tell me wherefore art thou thus  adelaide surprise and grief  i cannot cannot speak  countess if it is a pain to speak i would not urge thee but can my adelaide fear aught from me am i so harsh  adelaide oh no the kindest best but would you save me from the stroke of death if you would not behold your daughter stretched a poor pale corse and breathless at your feet oh step between me and this cruel mandate  countess but this is strange  i hear your fathers step he must not see you thus retire this moment i will come to you anon  adelaide yet ere i go o make the interest of my heart your own nor like a senseless undiscerning thing incapable of choice nor worth the question suffer this hasty transfer of your child plead for me strongly kneel pray weep for me and angels lend your tongue the power to move him exit scene v countess alone what can this mean this ecstacy of passion can such reluctance such emotions spring from the mere nicety of maiden fear the source is in her heart i dread to trace it must then a parents mild authority be turned a cruel engine to inflict wounds on the gentle bosom of my child and am i doomed to register each day but by some new distraction  edmund edmund in apprehending worse even than thy loss my sense confused rests on no single grief for that were ease to this eternal pulse which throbbing here says blacker fates must follow while reason just has power enough to whisper poor wretch thy peace may come when death comes with it  scene vi to her count austin count i sought thee and thou do prevent me austin welcome thrice welcome by our holy mother my house seems hallowed when thou enterst it tranquillity and peace dwell ever round thee that robe of innocent white is thy souls emblem made visible in unstained purity once more thy hand  austin my daily task has been so to subdue the frailties we inherit that my fair estimation might go forth nothing for pride but to an end more righteous for not the solemn trappings of our state tiaras mitres nor the pontiffs robe can give such grave authority to priesthood as one good deed of grace and charity  count we deem none worthier but to thy errand  austin i come commissioned from fair isabel  count to me or to the countess  austin thus to both for your fair courtesy and entertainment she rests your thankful debtor you dear lady and her sweet friend the gentle adelaide have such a holy place in all her thoughts that twere irreverence to waste her sense in wordy compliment  countess alas where is she till now i scarce had power to think of her but it is the mournful privilege of grief to stand excused from kind observances which else neglected might be deemed offense  austin she dwells in sanctuary at saint nicholas why she took refuge there   count retire hortensia i would have private conference with austin no second ear must witness  countess may i not by this good man solicit her return  count another time it suits not now  retire exit countess scene vii count austin count you come commissioned from fair isabel  austin i come commissioned from a greater power the judge of thee and isabel and all the offer of your hand in marriage to her with your proposed divorce from that good lady that honored injured lady you sent hence she has disclosed to me  count  which you approve not so speaks the frowning prelude of your brow  austin approve not did i not protest against it with the bold fervor of enkindled zeal i were the pander of a love like incest betrayer of my trust my functions shame and thy eternal souls worst enemy  count yet let not zeal good man devour thy reason hear first and then determine well you know my hope of heirs has perished with my son since now full seventeen years the unfruitful curse has fallen upon hortensia are these signs tremendous signs that startle natures order graves casting up their sleepers earth convulsed meteors that glare my childrens timeless deaths obscure to thee alone  i have found the cause there is no crime our holy church abhors not one high heaven more strongly interdicts than that commixture by the marriage rite of blood too near as mine is to hortensia  austin what when the avenging arm is stretched abroad angry and red at mans enormities can more audacious sin dissolve the bolt to healing dews of peace and blessedness too near of blood oh specious mockery where have these doubts been buried twenty years why wake they now and am i closetted to sanction them take back your hasty words that called me wise or virtuous while you offer such shallow fictions to insult my sense and strive to win me to a villains office  count the virtue of our churchmen like our wives should be obedient meekness proud resistance bandying high looks a port erect and bold are from the canon of your order priest learn this for here will i be teacher austin our temporal blood must not be stirred thus rudely a front that taunts a scanning scornful brow are silent menaces and blows unstruck  austin not so my lord mine is no priestly pride when i put off the habit of the world i had lost all that made it dear to me and shook off to my best its heat and passions but can i hold in horror this ill deed and dress my brow in falseapproving smiles no could i carry lightning in my eye or roll a voice like thunder in your ears so should i suit my utterance to my thoughts and act as fits my sacred ministry  count o father did you know the conflict here how love and conscience are at war within me most sure you would not treat my grief thus harshly i call the saints to witness were i master to wive the perfect model of my wish for virtue and all female loveliness i would not rove to an ideal form but beg of heaven another like hortensia  yet we must part  austin and think you to excuse a meditated wrong to excellence by giving it acknowledgement and praise rather pretend insensibility feign that thou do not see like other men hearst with peculiar organ have no relish for all the good and wise admire in woman so may abhorrence be exchanged for wonder or men from cursing fall to pity thee  count you strive in vain no power on earth can shake me i grant my present purpose seems severe yet are there means to smooth severity which you and only you can best apply  austin oh no the means hang there there by your side enwring your fingers in her flowing hair and with that weapon drink her hearts best blood so shall you kill her but not cruelly compared to this deliberate lingering murder  count away with this perverseness get thee to her tell her my heart is hers here deep engraved in characters indelible shall rest the sense of her perfections why i leave her is not from cloyed or fickle appetite for infinite is still her power to charm  but heaven will have it so  austin oh name not heaven it is too profane abuse  count win her consent i know thy sway is boundless over her will then join my hand to blooming isabel thus will you do to all most worthy service the curse averted thus shall pass from narbonne my house again may flourish and proud godfrey who now disputes will ratify my title pleased with the rich succession to his heirs  austin has passion drowned all sense all memory she was affianced to your son young edmund  count she never loved my son our importunity won her consent but not her heart to edmund  austin did not that speak her soul preoccupied some undivulged and deepfelt preference  count ha thou have roused a thought this theodore dull that i was not to perceive it sooner he is her paramour by heaven she loves him her coldness to my son her few tears for him her flight this peasants aiding her all all make it unquestionable  but he dies  austin astonishment what does thy frenzy mean  count i thank thee priest thou servst me against thy will that slave is in my power come follow me thou shall behold the minions head struck off then to his mistress bear the ghastly present exeunt  end of the second act act iii scene i a hall adelaide jaqueline following jaqueline where do you fly heavens have you lost all sense  adelaide oh would i had for then i should not feel but i have sense enough to know i am wretched to see the full extent of misery yet not enough to teach me how to bear it  jaqueline i did not think your gentleness of nature could rise to such extremes  adelaide am i not tame what are these tears this wild disheveled hair are these fit signs for such despair as mine women will weep for trifles bawbles nothing for very frowardness will weep as i do a spirit rightly touched would pierce the air call down invisible legions to his aid kindle the elements  but all is calm no thunder rolls no warning voice is heard to tell my frantic father this black deed will sink him down to infinite perdition  jaqueline rest satisfied he cannot be so cruel rash as he is to shed the innocent blood of a defenseless unoffending youth  adelaide he cannot be so cruel earth and heaven did i not see the dreadful preparations the slaves who tremble at my fathers nod pale and confounded dress the fatal block but i will fly fall prostrate at his feet if nature is not quite extinguished in him my prayers my tears my anguish sure will move him  jaqueline move him indeed but to redoubled fury he dooms him dead for loving isabel think will it quench the fever of his rage to find he durst aspire to charm his daughter  adelaide did i hear right for loving isabel i knew not that before does he then love her  jaqueline nothing i heard distinctly wild confusion runs through the castle every busy fool all ignorant alike tells different tales  adelaide away it cannot be i know his truth oh i despise myself that for a moment pardon me love could suffer mean suspicion usurp the seat of generous confidence think all alike unjust my theodore when even thy adelaide could join to wrong thee  jacqueline yet be advised   adelaide oh leave me to my grief  to whom shall i complain he but preserved my life a little space to make me feel the extremes of joy and sorrow ere we met my heart was calm as the unconscious babe that slumbers cradled tween the mothers breasts from him i learned new wishes new affections to hope to fear to dread

would falter even to speak but see he comes   scene ii to her austin jaqueline o let me bend to thank you in this extreme distress from you alone for my poor art is vain can she hope comfort austin how heard she the ill tidings i had hopes his cooler reason would subdue the thought and heaven in pity to her gentle virtues might spare her knowing how he meant to wrong them  jaqueline the rumor of the castle reached her first but his own lips confirmed the barbarous secret sternly but now he entered her apartment and stamping frowned her women from her presence after a little while they had passed together  his visage flushed with rage and mingled shame he burst into the chamber where we waited bade us return and give our lady aid then covering his face with both his hands went forth like one half crazed  adelaide oh good kind father there is a charm in holy eloquence if words can medicine a pang like this perhaps may sooth her sighs and trickling tears are all my love can give as i kneel by her she gazes on me clasps me to her bosom cries out my child my child then rising quick severely lifts her streaming eyes to heaven laughs wildly and half sounds my fathers name till quite oerpowerd she sinks from my embrace while like the grasp of death convulsions seize her  austin remorseless man this wound will reach her heart and when she falls his last best prop falls with her and see the beauteous mourner moves this way time has but little injured that fair fabric but crueltys hard stroke more fell than time works at the base and shakes it to the center  scene iii to them the

incestuous name falls on my house and spreads the ruin wide for our offense over this afflicted land these were his words  adelaide o ponder them no more lo where the blessed minister of peace he

count them drops of water from my eyes could they but wash out from your memory the deep affliction you now labor with  countess then still there is some pity left in man i judged you all by him and so i wronged you i would have told my story to the sea when it roared wildest bid the lioness robbed of her young look with compassion on me rather than hoped in any form of man to find one drop of human gentleness  austin approaching her most honored lady   countess  pray you come not near me i am contagion all some wicked sin prodigious unrepented sin has stained me father twould blast thee but to hear the crimes this woman who was once the wife of raymond this cursed forsaken woman here has acted  austin what slanderous tongue dare thus profane your virtue madam i know you well and by my order each day each hour of your unspotted life might give as fair a lesson to the world as churchmens tongues can preach or saints could practice  countess he charges me with all  thou poor hortensia what guilt prepostrous guilt is thine to answer  adelaide in mercy wound not thus your daughters soul  austin a villain or a madman might say this  countess what shall i call him he who was my husband my child thy father  he will disclaim thee too but let him cast off all the ties of nature abandon us to grief and misery still will i wander with thee over the world i will not wish my reason may forsake me nor sweet oblivious dullness steep my sense while thy soft age may want a mothers care a mothers tenderness to wake and guard thee  adelaide and if the love of your dear adelaide her reverence duty endless gratitude for all your angel goodness now can move you oh for my sake lest quite you break my heart wear but a little outside show of comfort a while pretend it though you feel it not and i will bless you for deceiving me  countess i know it is weakness folly to be moved thus and these i hope are my last tears for him alas i little knew deluded wretch his riotous fancy glowed with isabel that not a thought of me possessed his mind but coldness and aversion how to shun me and turn me forth a friendless wanderer  austin vain were the attempt to palliate injuries too foul in their own nature to receive whiteness from words but lady for your peace think conscience is the deepest source of anguish a bosom free like yours has lifes best sunshine it is the warm blaze in the poor herdsmans hut that when the storm howls over his humble thatch brightens his claybuilt walls and cheers his soul you pay the forfeit of the aggressors wrong suffering the pangs which guilt alone should suffer  countess o father reason is for moderate sorrow for wounds which time has balmd but mine are fresh all bleeding fresh and pain beyond my patience ungrateful cruel how have i deserved it  thou tough tough heart break for my ease at once  austin i scarce methinks can weigh him with himself vexations strange have fallen on him of late and his distempered fancy drives him on to rash designs where disappointment mads him  countess ah no his wit is settled and most subtle pride and wild blood are his distemper father but here i bid farewell to grief and fondness let him go kneel and sigh to isabel and may he as obdurate find her heart as his has been to me  austin why that is well said  it is better thus than with consuming sorrow to feed on your own life give anger scope time then at length will blunt this killing sense and peace he never must know again be yours  countess i was a woman full of tenderness i am a woman stung by injuries narbonne was once my husband my protector he was  what was he not  he is my tyrant the unnatural tyrant of a heart that loved him with cool deliberate baseness he forsakes me with scorn as steadfast shall my soul repay it  austin you know the imminent danger threatens him from godfreys fearful claim  countess too well i know it a fearful claim indeed  austin tomorrows sun will see him at these gates but trust my faith no violence shall reach you the rash count lost to himself by force detains me here vain is his force  our holy sanctuary whatever betides shall give your virtue shelter and peace and piety alone approach you  countess o that the friendly bosom of the earth would close on me for ever  austin these ill thoughts must not be cherished that all righteous power whose hand inflicts knows to reward our patience farewell command me ever as your servant and take the poor mans all my prayers and blessing exit austin scene iv countess adelaide adelaide will you not strive to rest alas it is long since you have slept i will lead you to your couch and gently touch my lute to wake some strain may aid your slumbers  countess my sweet comforter i feel not quite forlorn when thou art near me  adelaide lean on my arm  countess no i will in alone my sense is now unapt for harmony but go thou to alphonsos holy shrine there with thy innocent hands devoutly raised implore his sainted spirit to receive thy humble supplications and to avert from thy dear head the stillimpending wrath for one black deed that threatens all thy race exit countess scene v adelaide alone for thee my prayers shall rise not for myself and every kindred saint will bend to hear me but o my fluttering breast  it is theodore how sad and earnestly he views that paper it turns him pale beshrew the envious paper why should it steal the color from that cheek which danger never could blanch he sees me not i will wait and should sad thoughts disturb his quiet if love has power with loves soft breath dispel them adelaide retires scene vi theodore with a paper my importunity at last has conquered weeping my father gave and bade me read it it is there he cried the mystery of thy birth there view thy long divorce from adelaide why should i read it why with ravenous haste gorge down my bane the worst is yet concealed then wherefore eager for my own destruction enquire a secret which when known must sink me my eye starts back from it my heart stands still and every pulse and motion of my blood with prohibition strong as sense can utter cries out beware  but does my sight deceive is it not she up up

unwishd for  theodore my best angel were seas between us thou art still where i am i bear thy precious image ever round me as pious men the relics they adore scarce durst i hope to be so blessed to see thee but could not wish a joy beyond thy presence  adelaide o theodore what wondrous turns of fortune have given thee back to a dears parents arms and spite of all the horrors which surround me and worse each black eventful moment threatens my bosom glows with rapture at the thought thou will at last be blessed  theodore but one way only can i be blessed on thee depends my fate lord raymond harsh and haughty as he is and adverse to my fathers rigid virtue when he shall hear our pure unspotted vows will yield thee to my wishes  but cursed stars how shall i speak it  adelaide what  theodore that holy man that clarinsal whom i am bound to honor perversely bids me think of thee no more  adelaide alas in what have i offended him  theodore not so he owns thy virtues and admires them but with a solemn earnestness that kills me he urges some mysterious dreadful cause must sunder us for ever  adelaide oh then fly me i am not worth his frown be gone this moment leave me to weep my mournful destiny and find some fairer happier maid to bless thee  theodore fairer than thee oh heavens the delicate hand of nature in her daintiest mood never fashioned beauty so rare loves roseate deity fresh from his mothers kiss breathed over thy mould that soft ambrosial hue  fairer than thee twere blasphemy in any tongue but thine so to disparage thy unmatched perfections  adelaide no theodore i dare not hear thee longer perhaps indeed there is some fatal cause  theodore there is not cannot be it is but his pride stung by resentment against thy furious father   adelaide ah no he is too generous just and good to hate me for the offenses of my father but find the cause at good alphonsos tomb i go to offer up my orisons there bring me comfort and dispel my fears or teach me oh hard thought to bear our parting exit adelaide scene viii theodore alone she is gone and now firm fortitude support me for here i read my sentence life or death takes out the paper thou art the grandson of

stretched over all the land but most this guilty race  theodore the murderer was guilty not his race  austin great crimes like this have lengthened punishments why speak the fates by signs and prodigies why one by one falls this devoted line accomplishing the dreadful prophecy that none should live to enjoy the fruits of blood why owning every virtue in the maid when thou but talk of this prepostrous union feels my divining soul such chill reluctance they are not sent in vain such aweful warnings but waive this argument  thou will be called i know him well all process he disdains but violence and war to prove thy right by combat with the count  theodore in arms i will meet him tomorrow now   austin and reeking with his blood offer the hand which shed it to his daughter  theodore

and stripes bring back their senses perhaps i may relent and turn them loose to new offenses and fresh chastisement  fabian you bleed my lord prisoners led out  count a scratch  death to be bayd by mungrels curs they yelpd and showed their fangs growld too as they would bite but was it not poor unlike the generous strain of godfreys lineage to stir the rabble up in nobles quarrels and bribe my hinds and vassals to assault me  austin they were not stirred by godfrey  count who then stirred them thyself perhaps was it thou and yet i wrong thee thou did preach peace and straight they crouchd and shrunk more tamed by the cold medicine of thy tongue than losing the hot drops my steel drew from them  austin i might perhaps have looked for better thanks than taunts to pay my service  but no matter  my son too served thee nobly he bestrode thee and drove those peasants back whose staves and clubs but for his aid had shivered that stout frame but both too well accustomed to thy transports nor ask nor hope thy courtesy  count your pardon i knew my life was saved but not by whom i wished it not yet thank him i was down stunned in the inglorious broil and naught remember more than the shame of such a paltry danger where is he  austin here theodore advances count starting ha angels shelter me  theodore why starts he thus  count are miracles renewed art thou not risen from the

your danger  count it is most strange i strive but cannot conquer this amazement i try to take them off yet still my eyes again are drawn as if by magic on him  austin aside to theodore hear you my son  theodore yes and it wakes within me sensations new till now  austin tomorrows light will show him wonders greater  sir it pleased you wherefore you best can tell to make us here your prisoners but the alarm of your danger threw wide your gates and freed us we returned to give you safeguard  may we now depart  count ay to the confines of the farthest earth for here thy sight unhinges

what horror shook all his frame when thus i stood before him  austin no wonder a prediction terrible not yet in all fulfilled hangs over him and if the presage of my breast deceive not in thee twill be accomplished he affects to call it visionary fear and scorn it but like a curb in the fierce coursers jaw the strong controlment mightier than his force reins in his pride  theodore it is fate then stirs within him and darkly intimates his hour draws near but was this all  austin the statue of thy grandsire thy very figure as thou stoodst before him armed just as thou art seemed to move and live that breathing marble which the peoples love reared near his tomb within our convents walls anon i will lead thee to it  theodore let me hence to shake these trappings off  austin wear them and mark me ere night thy kinsman godfrey will be master of all thy story a tried messenger bears my dispatch to him not far from hence advancing with his train to meet lord raymond he rests till morning he is brave and just and will support thy claim should proof and reason fail with the usurper thou must try thy sword and heaven will strike for thee in combat with him the conscious flash of this thy grandsires mail worse than the horrors of the fabled gorgon that curdled blood to stone will shrink his sinews and cast the withered boaster at thy feet  theodore grant it ye powers but not to shed his blood the father of my adelaide that name   austin is dearer far than mine  my words are air my counsels pass unmarked but come my son tonight my cell must house thee let me show thee the humble mansion of thy lonely father proud once and prosperous where i have wept and prayed and lost in cold oblivion of the world twice nine long years thy mother and thyself and god were all my thoughts

besides and their crazed notions are so full of wonder there is scarce a common passage of the times but straight their folly makes it ominous  count fame that like water widens from its source thus often swells and spreads a shallow falsehood at first a twilight tale of village terror the hair of boors and beldams bristled at it such bloodless fancies wake to naught but fear then heard with

calling tainted prates conscience and in craft abets earl godfrey that isabel may wed his upstart son let rome dart all her lightnings at my head till her gray pontiff singe in his own fires spite of their rage i will force the sanctuary and bear her off this night beyond their power my bride if she consents if not my hostage  scene v to the count two officers come hither sirs take twenty of your

in theodore why comes he not it is torture for the unblessed to suffer such suspense as my heart aches with what can it be  this secret dreadful cause this shaft unseen that is winged against our love perhaps  i know not what  at yonder shrine bending i will seal my irrevocable vow hear and record it choirs of saints and angels if i am doomed to sigh for him in vain no second flame shall ever enter here but faithful to thy fond thy first impression turn thou my breast to every sense of joy cold as the paleeyd marbles which surround me adelaide withdraws scene vii austin theodore austin look round my son this consecrated place contains the untimely ashes of thy grandsire with all the impious mockery of grief here were they laid by the dire hand which sped him since that black hour the thunder scarce has slept nature seemed fearful of her wonted course as if the angry spirit of alphonso driving the loosened orbs in storm and fire wrecked all this elemental vast machine to break the tenor of mens peaceful souls there stands his statue were a glass before thee so would it give thee back thy outward self  theodore and may the power which fashioned thus my outside with all his nobler ornaments of virtue sustain my soul till generous emulation raise me by deeds to equal his renown and   austin  to avenge him not by treachery but casting off all thoughts of idle love of love illmatchd unhappy ominous  to keep the memory of his wrongs do justice to his great name and prove the blood you spring from  theodore o were the bold possessor of my rights a legion armed the terrors

join me to my child falls on the body of adelaide a slight alteration having been made in the representation of the last scene of this tragedy by the friends of the author in his absence it has been

above shall crown thee for this rash man etc  epilogue written by edmond malone esquire spoken by miss young of all the laws by tyrant custom made the hardest sure are those on authors laid no easy task in this enlightened time it is with art to build the lofty rhyme to choose a fable nor too old nor new to keep each character distinctly true the subtle plot with happy skill combine and chain attention to the nervous line with weighty clashing interests to perplex through five  long acts  each person  of each sex and then at last by dagger or by bowl with poignant grief to harrow up the soul  all this achievd the bard at ease carouses and dreams of laurels and overflowing houses alas poor man his work is done but half  he has made you cry  but he must make you laugh and the same engine like the fabled steel the spear of achilles mysus et aemonia juvenis qua cuspide vulnus senserat hac ipsa cuspide sensit opem propert lib ii el    must serve at once to wound you and to heal our bard of this had taken too little care and by a friend besought me to appear madam he said so often you have graced the scene an injured princess or a weeping queen so often been used to die in anguish bitter and then start up  to make the audience titter that doubtless you know best what is in vogue and can yourself invent an epilogue you can supply our authors tardy quill and gild the surface of his tragic pill your ready wit a recipe can bring for this capricious seriocomick thing a recipe for epilogues  why not have you each vaunting chronicle forgot have we not recipes each day each hour to give to mortal man immortal power to give the ungraceful timid speaker breath and save his quivering eloquence from death a quack medicine has been long recommended in a printed advertisement for its efficacy in composing the agitated nerves of those who speak in public  have we not now a geometrick school to teach the crosslegd youth  to snip by rule a tailor has lately informed the public in most of the newspapers that he sits his customers by geometrick rules  when arts like these each moment meet your eyes why should receipts for epilogues surprise well sir i will try  i first advance with simper forgotten quite my tragic state and whimper  ladies tonight my fate was surely hard what could possess our inconsiderate bard a wife to banish  that his miss might wed when modern priests allow them both one bed thus i will begin  but it will never do unless some recent anecdotes ensue  has no frail dame been caught behind a screen no panting virgin flown to gretna green  have we no news of digby  or the dutch  at some rich nabob cannot i have a touch or the famed quack who but for duns terrestrial had gained the indies by his bed celestial if he were not prevented by unprecedented cruelty he would in a few years have become one of his majestys richest and most respectable subjects dr grahams advertisement from the temple of hymen  bravo miss young the thought my friend will bless this modish medley must ensure success won by this smoothtongued flatterer i have dared to do what even our fluent anthour feared if i succeed tonight the trade i will follow and dedicate my leisure to apollo before my house a board shall straight be hung with  epilogues made here by dr young nor will i like my brethren take a fee  your hands and smiles are wealth enough for me  the following epilogue which was spoken on the first two nights of the exhibition of this tragedy was obligingly written by r j goodenough esquire who did not know that an epilogue had been prepared for it by mr malone at the authors request  it is an old maxim with dramatick sages to draw their tragic lore from distant ages the ruder manners and impetuous vein which no trim rules of etiquette restrain the generous plainness of the unpracticed heart natures free powers yet unsubdued by art the rough simplicity  the darksome time  improve the pathos  heighten the sublime while all the poets deepest skill might fail if used to decorate some modern tale in me you have seen a wife  who though abhorred abandoned threatened by her tyrant lord did patient long her firm affection prove midst the keen tortures of insulted love you have seen a maiden  fair and nobly born attached to merit wretched and forlorn and then her lover in a mean disguise in native worth above all titles rise a priest  with zeal and holy ardour fraught practice the lessons which his preaching taught  but while at scenes like these your bosoms glow you will recollect they happened  long ago in our gay times a wife forsaken scorned had never in doleful guise her fortune mourned but with frail schemes in fashionable course had been the first to furnish a divorce the maiden had her peasant swain despised and stars and lace and livries more had prized nor could in this perhaps her choice be blamed for say what lover now had other merit claimed as for our priests  in reverence let them rest  on modern saints  the least that is said is best of manners then so different in their kind the old are rude  the new are too refined that author well deserves our warmest praise who those examples which we need displays who midst the placid murmurings of ton rolls the rough tide of gothic force along and when true worth seems withering at the root turns the rich soil whence towering virtues shoot never can the muse be more our natures friend than when she strives its wide extremes to blend bids simple truth with polished fashion join and ancient strength with modern grace combine finis
