westsmithfield j hatchard no     piccadilly and s hazard bath       the two wealthy farmers or the history of mr bragwell   mr bragwell and mr worthy happened to meet last year at weyhillfair they were glad to see each other as they had but seldom met of jate mr bragwell having removed some years before from mr worthys neighborhood to a distant village where he had bought an estate  mr bragwell was a substantial farmer and grazier he had risen in the world by what worldly men call a run of good fortune he had also been a man of great industry that is he had paid a diligent and constant attention to his own interest he understood business and had a knack of turning almost every thing to his own advantage he had that sort of sense which good men call cunning and knaves call wisdom he was too prudent ever to do any thing so wrong that the law could take hold of him yet he was not over scrupulous about the morality of an action when the prospect of enriching himself by it was very great and the chance of hurting his character was small the corn he sent home to his customers was not always quite so good as the samples he had produced at market and he now and then forgot to name some capital blemish in the horses he sold at fair he scorned to be guilty of the petty frauds of cheating in weights and measures for he thought that was a beggarly sin but he valued himself on his skill in making a bargain and fancied it showed his knowledge of the world to take advantage of the ignorance of a dealer  it was his constant rule to undervalue every thing he was about to buy and to overvalue every thing he was about to sell but as he prided himself on his character he avoided every thing that was very shameful so that he was considered merely as a hard dealer and a keen hand at a bargain now and then when he had been caught in pushing his own advantage too far he contrived to get out of the scrape by turning the whole into a jest saying it was a good take in a rare joke and that he had only a mind to divert himself with the folly of his neighbor who could be so easily imposed on  mr bragwell had one favorite maxim namely that a mans success in life was a sure proof of his wisdom and that all failure and misfortune was the consequence of a mans own folly as this opinion was first taken up by him from vanity and ignorance so it was more and more confirmed by his own prosperity he saw that he himself had succeeded greatly without either money or education to begin with and he therefore now despised every man however excellent his character or talents might be who had not had the same success in life his natural disposition was not particularly bad but prosperity had hardened his heart he made his own progress in life the rule by which the conduct of all other men was to be judged without any allowance for their peculiar disadvantages or the visitations of providence he thought for his part that every man of sense could command success on his undertakings and control and dispose the events of his own life  but though he considered those who had less success than himself as no better than fools yet he did not extend this opinion to mr worthy whom he looked upon not only as a good but wise man they had been bred up when children in the same house but with this difference that worthy was the nephew of the master and bragwell the son of the servant  bragwells father had been ploughman in the family of mr worthys uncle a sensible man who farmed a small estate of his own and who having no children bred up young worthy as his son instructed him in the business of husbandry and at his death left him his estate the father of worthy was a pious clergyman who lived with his brother the farmer in order to help out a narrow income he had bestowed much pains on the instruction of his son and used frequently to repeat to him a saying which he had picked up in a book written by one of the greatest men in this country  that there were two things with which every man ought to be acquainted religion and his own business while he therefore took care that his son should be made an excellent farmer he filled up his leisure hours in improving his mind so that young worthy had read more good books and understood them better than most men in his station his reading however had been chiefly confined to husbandry and divinity the two subjects which were of the most immediate importance to him  the reader will see by this time that mr bragwell and mr worthy were likely to be as opposite to each other as two men could well be who were nearly of the same age and condition and who were neither of them without credit in the world bragwell indeed made far the greater figure for he liked to cut a dash as he called it and while it was the study of worthy to conform to his station and to set a good example to those about him it was the delight of bragwell to vie in his way of life with men of larger fortune he did not see how much this vanity raised the envy of his inferiors the ill will of his equals and the contempt of his betters  his wife was a notable stirring woman but vain violent and ambitious very ignorant and very highminded she had married bragwell before he was worth a shilling and as she had brought him a good deal of money she thought herself the grand cause of his rising in the world and thence took occasion to govern him most completely whenever he ventured to oppose her she took care to put him in mind that he owed every thing to her that had it not been for her he might still have been stumping after a plowtail or serving hogs in old worthys farmyard but that it was she who had made a gentleman of him in order to set about making him a gentleman she had begun by teazing him till he had turned away all his poor relations who worked in the farm she next drew him off from keeping company with his old acquaintance and at lad persuaded him to remove from the place where he had got his money poor woman she had not sense and virtue enough to see how honorable it is for a man to raise himself in the world by fair means and then to help forward his poor relations and friends engaging their services by his kindness and endeavoring to keep want out of the family  mrs bragwell was an excellent mistress according to her own notions of excellence for no one could say that she ever lost an opportunity of scolding a servant or was ever guilty of the weakness of overlooking a fault toward her two daughters her behavior was far otherwise in them she could see nothing but perfections but her extravagant fondness for these girls was full as much owing to pride as to affection she was bent on making a family and having found out that she was too ignorant and too much trained to the habits of getting money ever to hope to make a figure herself she looked to her daughters as the persons who were to raise the family of bragwells and in this hope she foolishly submitted to any drudgery for their sakes and bore every kind of impertinence from them  the first wish of her heart was to set them above their neighbors for she used to say what was the use of having substance if her daughters might not carry themselves above girls who had nothing to do her justice she herself would be about early and late to see that the business of the house was not neglected she had been bred to great industry and continued to work when it was no longer necessary both from early habit and the desire of heaping up money for her daughters yet her whole notion of gentility was that it consisted in being rich and idle and though she was willing to be a drudge herself she resolved to make her daughters gentlewomen on this principle to be well dressed and to do nothing or nothing which is of any use was what she fancied distinguished people in genteel life and this is too common a notion of a fine education among some people they do not esteem things by their use but by their show they estimate the value of their childrens education by the money it costs and not by the knowledge and goodness it bestows people of this stamp often take a pride in the expense of learning instead of taking pleasure in the advantages of it and the silly vanity of letting others see that they can afford any thing often sets parents on letting their daughters learn not only things of no use but things which may be really hurtful in their situation either by setting them above their proper duties or by taking up their time in a way inconsistent with them  mrs bragwell sent her daughters to a boarding school where she instructed them to hold up their heads as high as any body to have more spirit than to be put upon by any one never to be pitiful about money but rather to show that they could spend with the best to keep company with the richest girls in the school and to make no acquaintance with farmers daughters  they came home at the usual age of leaving school with a large portion of vanity grafted on their native ignorance the vanity was added but the ignorance was not taken away of religion they could not possibly learn any thing since none was taught for at that place it was considered as a part of education which belonged only to charity schools of knowledge they got just enough to laugh at their fond parents rustic manners and vulgar language and just enough taste to despise and ridicule every girl who was not as vainly dressed as themselves  the mother had been comforting herself for the heavy expense of their bringing up by looking forward to the pleasure of seeing them became fine ladies and to the pride of marrying them above their station  their father hoped also that they would be a comfort to him both in sickness and in health he had had no learning himself and could write but poorly and owed what skill he had in figures to his natural turn for business he hoped that his daughters after all the money he had spent on them would now write his letters and keep his accounts and as he was now and then laid up with a fit of the gout he was enjoying the prospect of having two affectionate children to nurse him  when they came home however he had the mortification to find that though he had two smart showy ladies to visit him he had neither dutiful daughters to nurse him nor faithful stewards to keep his books nor prudent children to manage his house they neither soothed him by kindness when he was sick nor helped him when he was busy they thought the maid might take care of him in the gout as she did before and as to their skill in cyphering he soon found to his cost that though they knew how to spend both pounds shillings and pence yet they did not know so well how to cast them up  mrs bragwell one day being very busy in preparing a great dinner for the neighbors ventured to request her daughters to assist in making the pastry they asked her scornfully whether she had sent them to boarding school to learn to cook and added that they supposed she would expect them next to make puddings for the haymakers so saying they coolly marched off to their music when the mother found her girls were too polite to be of any use she would take comfort in observing how her parlour was set out with their fillagree and flowers their embroidery and cut paper they spent the morning in bed the noon in dressing the evening at the spinnet and the night in reading novels  with all these fine qualifications it is easy to suppose that as they despised their sober duties they no less despised their plain neighbors when they could not get to a horse race a petty ball or a strolling play with some company as idle and as smart as themselves they were driven for amusement to the circulatinglibrary jack the plowboy on whom they had now put a livery jacket was employed half his time in trotting backwards and forwards with the most wretched trash the little neighboring book shop could furnish the choice was often left to jack who could not read but who had general orders to bring all the new things and a great many of them  things were in this state or rather growing world for idleness and vanity are never at a stand when these two wealthy farmers bragwell and worthy met at weyhill fare as was said before after many hearty salutations had passed between them it was agreed that mr bragwell should spend the next day with his old friend whose house was not many miles distant bragwell invited himself in the following manner  we have not had a comfortable days chat for years said he and as i am to look at a drove of lean beasts in your neighborhood i will take a bed at your house and we will pass the evening in debating as we used to do you know i always loved a bit of an argument and am reckoned not to make the worst figure at our club i had not to be sure such good learning as you had because your father was a parson and you got it for nothing but i can bear my part pretty well for all that when any man talks to me about his learning i ask if it has helped him to get a good estate if he says no then i would not give him a rush for it for of what use is all the learning in the world if it does not make a man rich but as i was saying i will come and see you tomorrow but now dont let your wife put herself into a fuss for me dont alter your own plain way for i am not proud i assure you nor above my old friends though i thank god i am pretty well in the world  to all this flourishing speech mr worthy coolly answered that certainly worldly prosperity ought never to make any man proud since it is god who gives strength to get riches and without his blessing it is in vain to rise up early and to eat the bread of carefulness  about the middle of the next day mr bragwell reached mr worthys neat and pleasant dwelling he found every thing in it the reverse of his own it had not so many ornaments but it had more comforts and when he saw his friends good old fashioned arm chair in a warm corner he gave a sigh to think how his own had been banished to make room for his daughters piano forte instead of made flowers in glass cases and a tea chest and screen too fine to be used which he saw at home and about which he was cautioned and scolded as often as he came near them he saw a neat shelf of good books for the service of the family and a small medicine chest for the benefit of the poor  mrs worthy and her daughters had prepared a plain but neat and good dinner the tarts were so excellent that bragwell felt a secret kind of regret that his own daughters were too genteel to do any thing so very useful indeed he had been always unwilling to believe that any thing which was very proper and very necessary could be so extremely vulgar and unbecoming as his daughters were always declaring it to be and his late experience of the little comfort he found at home inclined him now still more strongly to suspect that things were not so right as he had been made to suppose but it was in vain to speak for his daughters constantly stopped his mouth by a favorite saying of theirs better be out of the world than out of the fashion  soon after dinner the women went out to their several employments and mr worthy being left alone with his guest the following discourse took place  bragwell you have a couple of sober pretty looking girls worthy but i wonder they dont tiff off a little more why my girls have as much fat and flour on their heads as would half maintain my reapers in suet pudding   worthy mr bragwell in the management of my family i dont consider what i might afford only though that is one great point but i consider also what is needful and becoming in a man of my station for there are so many useful ways of laying out money that i feel as if it were a sin to spend one unnecessary shilling having had the blessing of a good education myself i have been able to give the like advantage to my daughters one of the best lessons i have taught them is to know themselves and one proof that they have learnt this lesson is that they are not above any of the duties of their station they read and write well and when my eyes are bad they keep my accounts in a very pretty manner if i had put them to learn what you call genteel things these might either have been of no use to them and so both time and money might have been thrown away or they might have proved worse than nothing to them by leading them into wrong notions and wrong company though we dont wish them to do the laborious parts of the dairy work yet they always assist their mother in the management of it as to their appearance they are every day nearly as you see them now and on sundays they are very neatly dressed but it is always in a decent and modest way there are no lappets fringes furbelows and tawdry ornaments fluttering about among my cheese and butter and i should feel no vanity but much mortification if a stranger seeing farmer worthys daughters at church should ask who those fine ladies were   bragwell now i own i should like to have such a question asked concerning my daughters i like to make people stare and envy it makes one feel oneself somebody but as to yourself to be sure you best know what you can afford and indeed there is some difference between your daughters and the miss bragwells   worthy for my part before i engage in any expense i always ask myself these two short questions first can i afford it  secondly is it proper for me   bragwell do you so now i own i ask myself but one for if i find i can afford it i take care to make it proper for me if i can pay for a thing no one has a right to hinder me from having it   worthy certainly but a mans own prudence and sense of duty ought to prevent him from doing an improper thing as effectually as if there were somebody to hinder him   bragwell now i think a man is a fool who is hindered from having any thing he has a mind to unless indeed he is in want of money to pay for it i am no friend to debt a poor man must want on   worthy but i hope my children have learnt not to want any thing which is not proper for them they are very industrious they attend to business all day and in the evening they sit down to their work and a good book i think they live in the fear of god i trust they are humble and pious and i am sure they seem cheerful and happy if i am sick it is pleasant to see them dispute which shall wait upon me for they say the maid cannot do it so tenderly as themselves    this part of the discourse staggered bragwell vain as he was he could not help feeling what a difference a religious and a worldly education made on the heart and how much the former regulated even the natural temper another thing which surprised him was that these girls living a life of domestic piety without any public diversions should be so very cheerful and happy while his own daughters who were never contradicted and were indulged with continual amusements were always sullen and illtempered that they who are more humoured should be less grateful and less happy disturbed him much he envied worthy the tenderness of his children though he would not own it but turned it off thus  bragwell but my girls are too smart to make mopes of that is the truth though ours is such a lonely village it is wonderful to see how soon they get the fashions what with the descriptions in the magazines and the pictures in the pocket books they have them in a twinkling and outdo their patterns all to nothing i used to take in the county journal because it was useful enough to see how oats went the time of high water and the price of stocks but when my ladies came home forsooth i was soon wheedled out of that and forced to take a london paper that tells a deal about caps and feathers and all the trumpery of the quality when i want to know what hops are a bag they are snatching the paper to see what violet soap is a pound and as to the dairy they never care how cows milk goes as long as they can get some stuff which they call milk of roses   worthy but do your daughters never read   bragwell read i believe they do too why our jack the plowboy spends half his time in going to a shop in our market town where they let out books to read with marble covers and they sell paper with all manner of colors on the edges and gimcracks and powderpuffs and washballs and cards without any pips and every thing in the world that is genteel and of no use twas but the other day i met jack with a basket full of these books so having some time to spare i sat down to see a little what they were about   worthy well i hope you there found what was likely to improve your daughters and teach them the true use of time   bragwell o as to that you are pretty much out i could make neither head nor tail of it it was neither fish flesh nor good redherring it was all about my lord and sir harry and the captain but i never met with such nonsensical fellows in my life their talk was no more like that of my old landlord who was a lord you know nor the captain of our fencibles than chalk is like cheese i was fairly taken in at first and began to think i had got hold of a godly book for there was a deal about hope and despair and heaven and angels and torments and everlasting happiness but when i got a little on i found there was no meaning in all these words or if any twas a bad meaning misery perhaps only meant a disappointment about a bit of a letter and everlasting happiness meant two people talking nonsense together for five minutes in short i never met with such a pack of lies the people talk such gibberish as no folks in their sober senses ever did talk and the things that happen to them are not like the things that ever happen to any of my acquaintance they are at home one minute and beyond sea the next beggars today and lords tomorrow waiting maids in the morning and duchesses at night you and i master worthy have worked hard many years and think it very well to have scraped a trifle of money together you a few hundreds i suppose and i a few thousands but one would think every man in these books had the bank of england in his scrutoire then there is another thing which i never met with in true life we think it pretty well you know if one has got one thing and another has got another i will tell you how i mean you are reckoned sensible our parson is learned the squire is rich i am rather generous one of your daughters is pretty and both mine are genteel but in these books except here and there one whom they make worse than satan himself every man and womans child of them are all wise and witty and generous and rich and handsome and genteel and all to the last degree nobody is middling or good in one thing and bad in another like my live acquaintance but it is all up to the skies or down to the dirt i had rather read tom hickathrift or jack the giant killer a thousand times   worthy you have found out mr bragwell that many of these books are ridiculous i will go farther and say that to me they appear wicked also and i should account the reading of them a great mischief especially to people in middling and low life if i only took into the account the great loss of time such reading causes and the aversion it leaves behind for what is more serious and solid but this though a bad part is not the worst these books give false views of human life they teach a contempt for humble and domestic duties for industry frugality and retirement want of youth and beauty is considered in them as ridiculous plain people like you and me are objects of contempt parental authority is set at naught nay plots and contrivances against parents and guardians fill half the volumes they consider love as the great business of human life and even teach that it is impossible to be regulated or restrained and to the indulgence of this passion every duty is therefore sacrificed a country life with a kind mother or a sober aunt is described as a state of intolerable misery and one would be apt to fancy from their painting that a good country house is a prison and a worthy father the jailer vice is set off with every ornament which can make it pleasing and amiable while virtue and piety are made ridiculous by tacking to them something that is silly or absurd crimes which would be considered as hanging matter at the old bailey are here made to take the appearance of virtue by being mixed with some wild flight of unnatural generosity those crying sins adultery gaming duels and selfmurder are made so familiar and the wickedness of them is so disguised that even innocent girls get to lose their abhorrence and to talk with complacency of things which should not be so much as named by them  i should not have said so much on this mischief continued mr worthy from which i dare say great folks fancy people in our station are safe enough if i did not know and lament that this corrupt reading is now got down even among some of the lowest class and it is an evil which is spreading every day poor industrious girls who get their bread by the needle or the loom spend half the night in listening to these books thus the labor of one girl is lost and the minds of the rest are corrupted for though their hands are employed in honest industry which might help to preserve them from a life of sin yet their hearts are at that very time polluted by scenes and descriptions which are too likely to plunge them into it and i think i dont go too far when i say that the vain and shewy manner in which young women who have to work for their bread have taken to dress themselves added to the poison they draw from these books contribute together to bring them to destruction more than almost any other cause now tell me dont you think these vile books will hurt your daughters   bragwell why i do think they are grown full of schemes and contrivances and whispers that is the truth on it every thing is a secret they always seem to be on the lookout for something and when nothing comes on it then they are sulky and disappointed they will not keep company with their equals they despise trade and farming and i own i am for the stuff i should not like for them to marry any but a man of substance if he was ever so smart now they will hardly fit down with a substantial country dealer but if they hear of a recruiting party in our market town on goes the finery  off they are some flimsy excuse is patched up they want something at the book shop or the milliners because i suppose there is a chance that some jackanapes of an ensign may be there buying stickingplaister in short i do grow a little uneasy for i should not like to see all i have saved thrown away on a knapsack   so saying they both rose and walked out to view the farm mr bragwell affected greatly to admire the good order of every thing he saw but never forgot to compare it with something larger and handsomer or better of his own it was easy to see that self was his standard of perfection in every thing all he possessed gained some increased value in his eyes from being his and in surveying the property of his friend he derived food for his vanity from things which seemed least likely to raise it every appearance of comfort of success of merit in any thing which belonged to mr worthy led him to speak of some superior advantage of his own of the same kind and it was clear that the chief part of the satisfaction he felt in walking over the farm of his friend was caused by thinking how much larger his own was  mr worthy who felt a kindness for him which all his vanity could not cure was on the watch how to turn their talk to some useful point and whenever people resolve to go into company with this view it is commonly their own fault if some opportunity of turning it to account does not offer  he saw bragwell was intoxicated with pride and undone by prosperity and that his family was in the highroad to ruin he thought that if some means could be found to open his eyes on his own character to which he was now totally blind it might be of the utmost service to him the more mr worthy reflected the more he wished to undertake this kind office he was not sure that mr bragwell would bear it but he was very sure it was his duty to attempt it mr worthy was very humble and very candid and he had great patience and forbearance with the faults of others he felt no pride at having escaped the same errors himself for he knew who it was had made them to differ he remembered that god had given him many advantages a pious father and a religious education this made him humble under a sense of his own sins and charitable toward the sins of others who had not the same privileges  just as he was going to try to enter into a very serious conversation with his guest he was stopped by the appearance of his daughter who told them supper was ready  this interruption obliges me to break off also and i shall reserve what follows to the next month when i promise to give my readers the second part of this history  part ii my readers may remember that the first part of this history concluded with a walk taken by mr bragwell and mr worthy over the grounds of the latter in which walk mr bragwell though he seemed to admire took care to lower every thing he saw by comparing it with something better which he had of his own soon after supper mrs worthy left the room with her daughters at her husbands desire for it was his intention to speak more plainly to bragwell than was likely to be agreeable to him to hear before others  the two farmers being seated at their little table each in a handsome oldfashioned great chair bragwell began  it is a great comfort neighbor worthy at a certain time of life to be got above the world my notion is that a man should labor hard the first part of his days and that he may then sit down and enjoy himself for the remainder now though i hate boasting yet as you are my oldest friend i am about to open my heart to you let me tell you then i reckon i have worked as hard as any man in my time and that i now begin to think i have a right to indulge a little i have got my money with a good character and i mean to spend it with credit i pay every one his own i set a good example i keep to my church i serve god i honor the king and i obey the laws of the land  this is doing a great deal indeed replied mr worthy but added he i doubt that more goes to the making up all these duties than men are commonly aware of suppose then that you and i talk the matter over coolly we have the evening before us what if we sit down together as two friends and examine one another  bragwell who loved argument and who was not a little vain both of his sense and his morality accepted the challenge and gave his word that he would take in good part any thing that should be said to him worthy was about to proceed when bragwell interrupted him for a moment by saying  but stop friend before we begin i wish you would remember that we have had a long walk and i want a little refreshment have you no liquor that is stronger than this cider i am afraid it will give me a sit of the gout  mr worthy immediately produced a bottle of wine and another of spirits saying that though he drank neither spirits nor even wine himself yet his wife always kept a little each as a provision in case of sickness or acidents  farmer bragwell preferred the brandy a began to taste it why said he this is no bett than english i always use foreign myself bought this for foreign said mr worthy no no it is english spirits i assure you but i c put you into a way to get foreign nearly as che as english mr worthy replied that he thoug that was impossible  bragwell o no there are ways and means  a word to the wise  there is an acquaintance o mine that lives upon the south coast  you a a particular friend and i will get you a gallon so a trifle   worthy not if it be smuggled mr bragwell though i should get it for sixpence a bottle  ask no questions said the other i never say anything to any one and who is the wiser  and  this is your way of obeying the laws of the land said mr worthy  here is a fine specimen o your morality   bragwell come come dont make a fu about trifles if every one did it indeed it would be another thing but as to my getting a drop of good brandy cheap why that cannot hurt the revenue much   worthy pray mr bragwell what should you think of a man who would dip his hand into a bag and take out a few guineas   bragwell think why i think that he should  hanged to be sure   worthy but suppose that bag stood in the ngs treasury   bragwell in the kings treasury worse and orse what rob the kings treasury well hope the robber will be taken up and executed r i suppose we shall all be taxed to pay the amage   worthy very true if one man takes money ut of the treasury others must be obliged to pay e more into it but what think you if the felw should be found to have stopped some money  its way to the treasury instead of taking it out f the bag after it got there   bragwell guilty mr worthy it is all the ame in my opinion if i was a juryman i should ay guilty death   worthy hark ye mr bragwell he that deals in smuggled brandy is the man who takes to himself the kings money in its way to the treasury and he as much robs the government as if he dipped his hands into a bag of guineas in the treasury chamber it comes to the same thing exactly here bragwell seemed a little offended  what mr worthy do you pretend to say i am not an honest man because i like to get my brandy as cheap as i can and because i like to save a shilling to my family sir i repeat it i do my duty to god and my neighbor i say the lords prayer most days i go to church on sundays i repeat my creed and keep the ten commandments and though i may now and then get a little brandy cheap yet upon the whole i will venture to say i do as much as can be expected of any man   worthy come then since you say you keep the commandments you cannot be offended if i ask you whether you understand them   bragwell to be sure i do i dare say i do lookee mr worthy i dont pretend to much reading i was not bred to it as you were if my father had been a parson i fancy i should have made as good a figure as some other folks but i hope good sense and a good heart may teach a man his duty without much scholarship   worthy to come to the point let us now go through the ten commandments and let us take along with us those explanations of them which our savior gave us in his sermon on the mount   bragwell sermon on the mount why the ten commandments are in the  0th chapter of exodus come come mr worthy i know where to find the commandments as well as you do for it happens that i am churchwarden and i can see from the altar piece where the ten commandments are without your telling me for my pew directly faces it   worthy but i advise you to read the sermon on the mount that you may see the full meaning of them   bragwell what do you want to make me believe that there are two ways of keeping the commandments   worthy no but there may be two ways of understanding them   bragwell well i am not afraid to be put to the proof i defy any man to say i do not keep at least all the four first that are on the left side of the altarpiece   worthy if you can prove that i shall be more ready to believe you observe those of the other table for he who does his duty to god will be likely to do his duty to his neighbor also   bragwell what do you think that i serve two gods do you think then that i make graven images and worship stocks or stones do you take me for a papist or an idolator   worthy dont triumph quite so soon master bragwell pray is there nothing in the world you prefer to god and thus make an idol of do you not love your money or your lands or your crops or your cattle or your own will and your own way rather better than you love god do you never think of these with more pleasure than you think of him and follow them more eagerly than your religious duty   bragwell o there is nothing about that in the  0th chapter of exodus   worthy but jesus christ has said he that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me now it is certainly a mans duty to love his father and mother nay it would be wicked not to love them and yet we must not love even these more than our creator and our savior well i think on this principle your heart pleads guilty to the breach of the first and second commandments let us proceed to the third   bragwell that is about swearing is it not mr worthy who had observed bragwell guilty of much profaneness in using the name of his maker though all such offensive words have been avoided in writing this history now told him that he had been waiting the whole day for an opportunity to reprove him for his frequent breach of the third commandment  good l  d i break the third commandment said bragwell no indeed hardly ever i once used to swear a little to be sure but i vow to g  d i never do it now except now and then when i happen to be in a passion and in such a case why good g  d you know the sin is with those who provoke me and not with me but upon my soul i dont think i have sworn an oath these three months no not i faith as i hope to be saved   worthy and yet you have broken this holy law no less than five or six times in the last speech you have made   bragwell lord bless me sure you mistake good heavens mr worthy i call g  d to witness i have neither cursed nor swore since i have been in the house   worthy mr bragwell this is the way in which many who call themselves very good sort of people deceive themselves what is it no profanation of the name of god to use it lightly reverently and familiarly as you have done our savior has not only told us not to swear by he immediate name of god but he has said  swear not at all neither by heaven nor by the arth and in order to prevent our inventing any other irreligious exclamations or expressions e has even added but let your communication be yea yea and nay nay for whatsoever is more than this simple affirmation and denial comes of evil   bragwell well well i must take a little more care i believe i vow to heaven i did not know there had been so much harm in it but my daughters seldom speak without using some of these words and yet they wanted to make me believe the other day that it is monstrous vulgar to swear   worthy women even gentlewomen who ought to correct this evil habit in their fathers and husbands and children are too apt to encourage it by their own practice and indeed they betray the profaneness of their own minds also by it for none who truly venerate the holy name of god can either profane it in this manner themselves or hear others do so without being exceedingly pained at it   bragwell well since you are so hard upon me i believe i must even give up this point  so let us pass on to the next and here i tread upon sure ground for as sharp as you are upon me you cant accuse me of being a sabbathbreaker since i go to church every sunday of my life unless on some very extraordinary occasion   worthy for those occasions the gospel allows by saying the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath our own sickness or attending on the sickness of others are lawful impediments   bragwell yes and i am now and then obliged to look at a drove of beasts or to go a journey or to take some medicine or perhaps some friend may call upon me or it may be very cold or very hot or very rainy   worthy poor excuses mr bragwell i am afraid these will not pass on the day of judgment but how is the rest of your sunday spent   bragwell o why i assure you i often go to church in the afternoon also and even if i am ever so sleepy   worthy and so you finish your nap at church i suppose   bragwell why as to that to be sure we do contrive to have something a little nicer than common for dinner on a sunday in consequence of which one eats you know a little more than ordinary and having nothing to do on that day one has more leisure to take a cheerful glass and all these things will make one a little heavy you know   worthy and dont you take a little ride in the morning and look at your sheep when the weather is good and so fill your mind just before you go to church with thoughts of them and when you come away again dont you settle an account or write a few letters of business   bragwell i cannot say but i do but that is nothing to any body as long as i set a good example by keeping to my church   worthy and how do you pass your sunday evenings   bragwell my wife and daughters go a visiting of a sunday afternoon my daughters are glad to get out at any rate and as to my wife she says that being ready dressed it is a pity to lose the opportunity besides it saves her time on a week day so then you see i have it all my own way and when i have got rid of the ladies who are ready to faint at the smell of tobacco i can venture to smoke a pipe and drink a sober glass of punch with half a dozen friends   worthy which punch being made of smuggled brandy and drank on the lords day in very vain as well as profane and worldly company you are enabled to break both the law of god and that of your country at a stroke and i suppose when you are got together you speak of your cattle or of your crops after which perhaps you talk over a few of your neighbors faults and then you brag a little of your own wealth or your own achievements   bragwell why you seem to know us so well that any one would think you had been sitting behind the curtain and yet you are a little mistaken too for i think we have hardly said a word for several of our last sundays on any thing but politics   worthy and do you find that you much improve your christian charity by that subject   bragwell why to be sure we do quarrel till we are very near fighting that is the worst on it   worthy and then you call names and swear a little i suppose   bragwell why when one is contradicted and put in a passion you know flesh and blood cannot bear it   worthy and when all your friends are gone home what becomes of the rest of the evening   bragwell that is just as it happens sometimes i read the newspaper and as one is generally most tired on the days one does nothing i go to bed earlier than on other days that i may be more fit to get up to my business the next morning   worthy so you shorten sunday as much as you can by cutting off a bit at both ends i suppose for i take it for granted you lie a little later in the morning   bragwell come come we shall not get through the whole ten tonight if you stand snubbing one at this rate you may pass over the fifth for my father and mother have been dead since i was a boy so i am clear of that scrape   worthy there are however many relative duties in that commandment unkindness to all kindred is forbidden   bragwell o if you mean my turning off my nephew tom the plowboy you must not blame me for that it was all my wifes fault he was as good a lad as ever lived to be sure and my own brothers son but my wife could not bear at a boy in a carters frock should be about e house calling her aunt we quarrelled like dog and cat about it and when he was turned away we did not speak for a week   worthy which was a fresh breach of the commandment a worthy nephew turned out of oors and a wife not spoken to for a week e no very convincing proofs of your observance of the fifth commandment   bragwell well i long to come to the sixth for you dont think i commit murder i hope   worthy i am not sure of that   bragwell what kill any body   worthy why the laws of the land indeed and the disgrace attending it are almost enough to keep any man from actual murder let me ask however do you never give way to unjust anger and passion and revenge as for instance do you never feel your resentment kindle against some of the politicians who contradict you on a sunday night and do you never push your animosity against somebody that has affronted you further than the occasion will justify   bragwell harkee mr worthy i am a man of substance and nobody shall offend me without my being even with him so as to injuring a man if he affronts me first there is nothing but good reason in that   worthy very well only bear in mind that you wilfully break this commandment whether you abuse your servant are angry at your wife watch for a moment to revenge an injury on your neighbor or even wreak your passion on a harmless beast for you have then the seeds of murder working in your breast and if there were no law no gibbet to check you and no fear of disgrace neither i am not sure where you would stop   bragwell why mr worthy you have a strange way of explaining the commandments so you set me down for a murderer merely because i bear hatred to a man who has done me a hurt and am glad to do him a like injury in my turn  i am sure i should want spirit if i did not   worthy i go by the scripture rule which says he that hates his brother is a murderer and again love your enemies bless them that curse you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you besides mr bragwell you made it a part of your boast that you said the lords prayer every day wherein you pray to god to forgive you your trespasses as you forgive them that trespass against you  if therefore you do not forgive them that trespass against you in that case you pray daily that your own trespasses may never be forgiven   bragwell well come let us make haste and get through these commandments the next is thou shall not commit adultery thank god neither i nor my family can be said to break the seventh commandment   worthy here again remember how christ himself has said whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart these are no faretched expressions of mine mr bragwell they are the words of jesus christ i hope you will not charge him with having carried things too far for if you do you charge him with being mistaken in the religion he taught and this can only be accounted for by supposing him an impostor   bragwell why upon my word mr worthy i dont like these sayings of his which you quote upon me so often and that is the truth of it and i cannot say i feel much disposed to believe them   worthy i hope you believe in jesus christ i hope you believe that creed of yours which you also boasted of your repeating so regularly   bragwell well well i will believe any thing you say rather than stand quarrelling with you   worthy i hope then you will allow that since it is committing adultery to look at a woman with even an irregular thought it follows from the same rule that all immodest dress in your daughters or indecent jests and double meanings in yourself all loose songs or novels and all diversions also which have a like dangerous tendency are forbidden by the seventh commandment for it is most plain from what christ has said that it takes in not only the act but the inclination the desire the indulged imagination the act is only the last and highest degree of any sin the topmost round as it were of a ladder to which all the lower rounds are only as so many steps and stages   bragwell strict indeed mr worthy but let us go on to the next you will not pretend to say i steal mr bragwell i trust was never known to rob on the highway to break open his neighbors house or to use false weights or measures   worthy no nor have you ever been under any temptation to do it and yet there are a thousand ways of breaking the eighth commandment besides actual stealing for instance do you never hide the faults of the goods you fell and heighten the faults of those you buy do you never take advantage of an ignorant dealer and ask more for a thing than it is worth do you never turn the distressed circumstances of a man who has something to sell to your own unfair benefit and thus act as unjustly by him as if you had stolen do you never cut off a shilling from a workmans wages under a pretense which your conscience cannot justify do you never pass off an unsound horse for a sound one do you never conceal the real rent of your estate from the overseers and thereby rob the poorrates of their legal due   bragwell pooh these things are done every day i shall not go to set up for being better than my neighbors in these sort of things these little matters will pass muster  i dont set up for a reformer  if i am as good as the rest of my neighbors no man can call me to account i am not worse i trust and i dont pretend to be better   worthy you must be tried hereafter at the bar of god and not by a jury of your fellow creatures and the scriptures are given us in order to show by what rule we shall be judged how many or how sew do as you do is quite aside from the question jesus christ has even told us to strive to enter in at the strait gate so that we ought rather to take fright from our being like the common run of people than to take comfort from our being so   bragwell come i dont like all this close work  it makes a man feel i dont know how  i dont find myself so happy as i did  i dont like this fishing in troubled waters  i am as merry as a grig when i let these things alone  i am glad we are got to the ninth but i suppose i shall be lugged in there too head and shoulders any one who did not know me would really think i was a great sinner by your way of putting things i dont bear false witness however   worthy you mean i suppose you would not swear a mans life away falsely before a magistrate but do you take equal care not to slander or backbite him do you never represent a good action of a man you have quarrelled with as if it were a bad one or do you never make a bad one worse than it is by your manner of telling it even when you invent no false circumstance do you never give such a color to those you relate as to leave a false impression on the mind of the hearers do you never twist a story so as to make it tell a little better for yourself and a little worse for your neighbor than truth and justice warrant   bragwell why as to that matter all this is only natural   worthy aye much too natural to be right i doubt well now we are got to the last of the commandments   bragwell yes i have run the gauntlet finely through them all you will bring me in guilty here i suppose for the pleasure of going through with it for you condemn without judge or jury master worthy   worthy the culprit i think has hitherto pleaded guilty to the evidence brought against him the tenth commandment however goes to the root and principle of evil it dives to the bottom of things this command checks the first rising of sin in the heart teaches us to strangle it in the birth as it were before it breaks out in those acts which are forbidden as for instance every man covets before he proceeds to steal nay many covet who dare not steal lest they should suffer for it   bragwell why lookee mr worthy i dont understand these new fashioned explanations one should not have a grain of sheer goodness left if every thing one does is to be frittered away at this rate i am not i own quite so good as i thought but if what you say were true i should be so miserable i should not know what to do with myself why i tell you all the world may be said to break the commandments at this rate   worthy very true all the world and i myself also are but too apt to break them if not in the letter at least in the spirit of them why then all the world are as the scripture expresses it guilty before god and if guilty they should own they are guilty and not stand up and justify themselves as you do mr bragwell   bragwell well according to my notion i am a very honest man and honesty is the sum and substance of all religion say i   worthy all truth honesty justice order and obedience grow out of the christian religion the true christian acts at all times and on all occasions from the pure and spiritual principle of love to god on this principle he is upright in his dealings true to his word kind to the poor helpful to the oppressed in short if he truly loves god he must do justice and cannot help loving mercy christianity is a uniform consistent thing it does not allow us to make up for the breach of one part of gods law by our strictness in observing another there is no sponge in one duty that can wipe out the spot of another sin   bragwell well but at this rate i should be always puzzling and blundering and should never know for certain whether i was right or nor whereas i am now quite satisfied with myself and have no doubts to torment me   worthy one way of knowing whether we really desire to obey the whole law of god is this when we find we have as great a regard to that part of it the breach of which does not touch our own interest as to that part which does for instance a man robs me i am in a violent passion with him and when it is said to me do thou well to be angry i answer i do well thou shall not steal is a law of god and this fellow has broken that law aye but says conscience it is thy own property which is in question  he has broken thy hedge  he has stolen thy sheep  he has taken thy purse art thou therefore sure whether it is his violation of thy property or of gods law which provokes thee i will put a second case  i hear another swear most grievously or i meet him coming drunk out of an alehouse or i find him singing a loose profane song if i am not as much grieved for this blasphemer or this drunkard as i was for the robber if i do not take the same pains to bring him to a sense of his sin which i did to bring the robber to justice how dwells the love of god in me is it not clear that i value my own sheep more than gods commandments that i prize my purse more than i love my maker in short whenever i find out that i am more jealous for my own property than for gods law more careful about my own reputation on than his honor i always suspect i am ot upon wrong ground and that even my right ctions are not proceeding from a right principle   bragwell why what in the world would you ave me do   worthy you must confess that your sins are ns you must not merely call them sins while you see no guilt in them but you must confess them so us to hate and detest them so s to be habitually humbled under the sense of them so as to trust for salvation not in your freedom from them but in the mercy of a savior and so as to make it the chief business of your life to contend against them and in the main to forsake them and remember that if you seek for a deceitful gaiety rather than a well grounded cheerfulness if you prefer a false security to final safety and now go away to your cattle and your farm and dismiss the subject from your thoughts left it should make you uneasy i am not sure that this simple discourse may not appear against you at the day of account as a fresh proof that you loved darkness rather than light and so increase your condemnation   mr bragwell was more affected than he cared to own he went to bed with less spirits and more humility than usual he did not however care to let mr worthy see the impression which it had made upon him but at parting next morning he shook him by the hand more cordially than usual and made him promise to return his visit in a short time  what besel mr bragwell and his family on his going home may perhaps make the subject of a future history z  part iii mr bragwell when he returned home from his visit to mr worthy as recorded in the second part of this history found that he was not quite so happy as he had formerly been the discourses of mr worthy had broken in not a little on his comfort and he began to suspect that he was not so completely in the right as his vanity had led him to believe he seemed also to feel less satisfacton in the idle gentility of his own daughters since he had been witness to the simplicity modesty and usefulness of those of mr worthy and he could not help seeing that the vulgar violence of his wise did not produce so much family happiness at home as the humble piety and quiet diligence of mrs worthy produced in the house of his friend  happy would it have been for mr bragwell if he had followed up those new convictions of his own mind which would have led him to struggle against the power of evil principles in himself and to have controuled the force of evil abits in his family but his convictions were st strong enough to make him uneasy under is errors without driving him to reform them the slight impression soon wore off and he fell ack into his old practices still his esteem for mr worthy was not at all abated by the plain ealing of that honest friend it is true he readed his piercing eye he felt that his example held out a constant reproof to himself yet such is the force of early affection and rooted everence that he longed to see him at his house this desire indeed as is commonly the case was made up of mixed motives he wished for he pleasure of his friends company he longed for that favorite triumph of a vulgar mind an opportunity of showing him his riches and he thought it would raise his credit in the world to have a man of mr worthys character at his house  mr bragwell it is true still went on with the same eagerness in gaining money and the same oftentation in spending it but though he was as covetous as ever he was not quite so sure that it was right to be so while he was actually engaged abroad indeed in transactions with his dealers he was not very scrupulous about the means by which he got his money and while he was indulging in festivity with his friends at home he was easy enough as to the manner in which he spent it but a man can neither be making bargains nor making feasts always there must be some intervals between these two great objects for which worldly men may be said to live and in some of these intervals the most worldly form perhaps some random pians of amendment and though many a one may say in the fullness of enjoyment soul take thine ease eat drink and be merry yet hardly any man perhaps allows himself to say even in the most secret moments i will never retire from business  i will never repent  i will never think of death  eternity shall never come into my thoughts the most that such an one probably ventures to say is i need not repent yet i will continue such a sin a little longer it will be time enough to think on the next world when i am no longer sit for the business or the pleasures of this  such was the case with bragwell he set up in his own mind a general distant sort of resolution that some years hence when he should be a few years older and a few thousands richer when a sew more of his present schemes should be completed he would then think of altering his course of life he would then certainly set about spending a religious old age he would reform some practices in his dealings or perhaps quit business entirely he would think about reading good books and when he had completed such and such a purchase he would even begin to give something to the poor but at present he really had little to spare for charity the very reason why he should have given more was just the cause he assigned for not giving at all namely the hardness of the times the true grand source of charity selfdenial never came into his head spend less that you may save more he would have thought a shrewd maxim enough but spend less that you may spare more never entered into his book of proverbs  at length the time came when mr worthy had promised to return his visit it was indeed a little hastened by the notice that mr bragwell would have in the course of the week a piece of land to sell by auction and though mr worthy believed the price was likely to be above his pocket yet he knew it was an occasion which would be likely to bring the principal farmers of that neighborhood together some of whom he wanted to meet and it was on this occasion that mr bragwell prided himself that he should show his neighbors so sensible a man as his dear friend mr worthy  worthy arrived at his friends house on the saturday time enough to see the house and garden and grounds of mr bragwell by daylight he saw with pleasure for he had a warm and generous heart those evident signs of his friends prosperity but as he was a man of a sobber mind and was a most exact dealer in truth he never allowed his tongue the license of immodest commendation which he used to say eicher favored of flattery or envy indeed he never rated mere worldly things so highly as to bestow upon them undue praise his calm approbation probation somewhat disappointed the vanity of mr bragwell who could not help secretly suspecting that his friend as good a man as he was was not quite free from envy he felt however very much inclined to forgive this jealousy which he feared the sight of his ample property and handsome habitation must naturally awaken in the mind of a man whole own possessions were so inferior he practiced the usual trick of ordinary and vulgar minds that of pretending himself to find some fault with those things which were particularly deserving praise when he found worthy disposed to pass them over in silence  when they came in to supper he affected to talk of the comforts of mr worthys little parlour by way of calling his attention to his own large one he repeated the word snug as applied to every thing at mr worthys with the plain design to make comparisons favorable to his own more ample domains he contrived as he passed by to his chair by a seeming accident to push open the door of a large beauset in the parlour in which all the finery was most oftentatiously set out to view he protected with a look of satisfaction which belied his words that for his part he did not care a farthing for all this trumpery and then smiling and rubbing his hands added with an air of no small importance what a good thing it is though for people of substance that the tax on plate is taken off you are a happy man mr worthy you do not feel these things tax or no tax it is all the same to you he took care during this speech by a cast of his eye to direct mr worthys attention to a great profusion of the brightest cups salvers and tankards and other shining ornaments which crowded the beauset mr worthy gravely answered mr bragwell it was indeed a tax which could not affect so plain a man as myself but as it fell on a mere luxury and therefore could not hurt the poor i was always sorry that it could not be made productive enough to be continued a man in my middling situation who is contented with a good glass of beer poured from a handsome earthen mug the glass the mug and the beer all of english manufacture will be but little disturbed at taxes on plate or on wine but he will regret as i do that many of these taxes are so much evaded that new taxes are continually brought on to make up the deficiencies of the old  during supper the young ladies sat in disdainful silence not deigning to bestow the smallest civility on so plain a man as mr worthy they left the room with their mamma as soon as possible being impatient to get away to ridicule their fathers friend at full liberty  the dance or the christmas merrymaking  as soon as they were gone mr worthy asked bragwell how his family comforts stood and how his daughters who he said were really fine young women went on o as to that replied bragwell pretty much like other mens handsome daughters i suppose that is worse and worse i really begin to apprehend that their fantastical notions have gained such a head that after all the money i have scraped together i shall never get them well married betsy has just lost as good an offer as any girl could desire young wilson an honest substantial grazier as any in the county he not only knows every thing proper for his station but is pleasing in his behavior and a pretty scholar into the bargain he reads history books and voyages of a winters evening to his infirm father instead of going to the card assembly in our town he neither likes drinking nor sporting and is a sort of favorite with our parson because he takes in the weekly numbers of a fine bible with cuts and subscribes to the sunday school and makes a fuss about helping the poor these dear times as they call them but i think they are good times for us mr worthy well for all this betsy only despised him and laughed at him but as he is both handsome and rich i thought she might come round at last and so i invited him to come and stay a day or two at christmas when we have always a little sort of merrymaking here but it would not do he scorned to talk that palavering stuff which she has been used to in the marble covered books i told you of he told her indeed that it would be the happiness of his heart to live with her which i own i thought was as much as could be expected of any man but miss had no notion of marrying one who was only desirous of living with her no no forsooth her lover must declare himself ready to die for her which honest wilson was not such a fool as to offer to do in the afternoon however he got a little into her favor by making out a rebus or two in the ladys diary and she condescended to say she did not think mr wilson had been so good a scholar but he soon spoilt all again we had a bit of a hop in the evening the young man though he had not much taste for those sort of gambols yet thought he could soot it a little in the oldfashioned way so he asked betsy to be his partner but when he asked what dance they should call miss drew up her head and in a strange gibberish said she should dance nothing but a menuct de la cour and ordered him to call it wilson stared and honestly told her she must call it herself for he could neither spell nor pronounce such outlandish words i burst out a laughing and told him i supposed it was something like questions and commands and if so that was much merrier than dancing seeing her partner standing stock still and not knowing how to get out of the scrape the girl began by herself and fell to swimming and sinking and capering and flourishing and posturing for all the world just like the man on the slack rope at our fair but seeing wilson standing like a stuck pig and we all laughing at her she resolved to wreak her malice upon him so with a look of rage and disdain she advised him to go down country bumkin with the dairy maid who would make a much fitter partner as well as wise for him than she could do i am quite of your mind miss said he with more spirit than i thought was in him you may make a good partner for a dance but you would make a sad one to go through life with i will take my leave of you miss with this short story i had lately a pretty large concern in hayjobbing which took me to london i waited a good while in the haymarket for my dealer and to pass away the time i stepped into a sort of singing playhouse there where i was grieved to the heart to see young women painted and dizened out and capering away just as you have been doing i thought it bad enough in them and wondered the quality could be entertained with such indecent mummery but little did i think to meet with the same paint sinery and tricks in a farm house i will never marry a woman who despises me nor the station in which i should place her and so i take my leave  poor girl how she was provoked to be publicly refused and turned off as it were by a grazier but it was of use to some of the other girls who have not held up their heads quite so high since nor painted quite so red but have condescended to speak to their equals  but how i run on i forget it is saturday night and that i ought to be paying my workmen who are all waiting for me without  saturday night or the workmens wages  as soon as mr bragwell had done paying his men mr worthy said to him i have made it a habit and i hope not an unprofitable one of trying to turn to some moral use not only all the events of daily life but all the employments of it too and though it occurs so often i hardly know one that sets me a thinking more seriously than the ordinary business you have been just discharging aye said bragwell it sets me thinking too and seriously as you say when i observe how much the price of wages is increased yes yes you are ready enough to think of that said worthy but you say not a word of how much the value of your land is increased and that the more you pay the more you can afford to pay but the thoughts i spoke of are quite of another cast when i call in my laborers on a saturday night to pay them it often brings to my mind the great and general day of account when i and you and all of us shall be called to our grand and awful reckoning when we shall go to receive our wages master and servants farmer and labourer when i see that one of my men has failed of the wages he should have received because he has been idling at a fair another has lost a day by a drinking bout a third confesses that though he had task work and might have earned still more yet he has been careless and has not his full pay to receive this i say sometimes sets me on thinking whether i also have made the most of my time and when i come to pay even the more diligent who have worked all the week when i reflect that even these have done no more than it was their duty to do i cannot help saying to myself night is come saturday night is come no repentance or diligence on the part of these poor men can now make a bad weeks work good this week is gone into eternity tomorrow is the season of rest working time is over my life also will soon be swallowed up in eternity soon the space allotted me for diligence for labor will be over soon will the grand question be asked what have thou done did thou use thy working days to the end for which they were given with some such thoughts i commonly go to bed and they help to quicken me to a keener diligence for the next week  some account of a sunday in mr bragwells family  mr worthy had been for so many years used to the sober ways of his own wellordered family that he greatly disliked to pass a sunday in any house of which religion was not the governing principle indeed he commonly ordered his affairs and regulated his journies with an eye to this object to pass a sunday in an irreligious family said he is always unpleasant often unsafe i seldom find i can do them any good and they may perhaps do me some harm at least i am giving a sanction to their manner of passing it if i pass it in the same manner if i reprove them i subject myself to the charge of singularity and of being righteous over much if i do not reprove them i confirm and strengthen them in evil and whether i reprove them or not i certainly partake of their guilt if i spend it as they do  he had however so strong a desire to be useful to mr bragwell that he at length determined to break through his common practice and pass the sunday at his house mr worthy was surprised to find that though the church bell was going the breakfast was not ready and expressed his wonder how this should be the case in so industrious a family bragwell made some awkward excuses he said his wife worked her servants fo hard all the week that even she as notable as she was a little relaxed from the strictness of her demands on sunday mornings and he owned that in a general way no one was up early enough for church he confessed that his wife commonly spent the morning in making puddings pies and cakes to last through the week as sunday was the only leisure time she and her maids had mr worthy soon saw an uncommon bustle in the house all hands were busy it was nothing but baking and boiling and frying and roasting and running and scolding and eating the boy was kept from church to clean the plate the man to gather the fruit the mistress to make the cheese cakes the maids to dress the dinner and the young ladies to dress themselves  the truth was mrs bragwell who had heard much of the order and good management of mr worthys family but who looked down with disdain upon them as far less rich than herself was resolved to indulge her vanity on the present occasion she was determined to be even with mrs worthy in whole praises bragwell had been so loud and felt no small pleasure in the hope of making her guest uneasy when he should be struck with the display both of her skill and her wealth mr worthy was indeed struck to behold as large a dinner as he had been used to see at a justices meeting he whose frugal and pious wife had accustomed him only to such a plain sundays dinner as could be dressed without keeping any one from church when he surveyed the loaded table of his friend instead of feeling that envy which these grand preparations were meant to raise felt nothing but disgust at the vanity of his friends wife mixed with much thankfulness for the piety of his own  after having made the dinner wait a long time the miss bragwells marched in dressed as if they were going to the assizeball they looked very scornful at having been so hurried though they had been dressing ever since they got up and their fond father when he saw them so fine forgave all their impertinence and cast an eye of triumph on mr worthy who felt he had never loved his own humble daughters so well as at that moment  in the afternoon the whole party went to church to do them justice it was indeed their common practice once a day when the weather was good and the road was neither dusty nor dirty when the minister did not begin too early when the young ladies had not been disappointed of their new bonnets on the saturday night and when they had no smart company in the house who rather wished to stay at home when this last was the case which to say the truth happened pretty often it was thought a piece of good manners to conform to the humor of the guests mr bragwell had this day forborne to ask any of his usual company well knowing that their vain and worldly conversation would only serve to draw on him some new reprimand from his friend  mrs bragwell and her daughters picked up as usual a good deal of acquaintance at church many compliments passed and much of the news of the week was retailed before the service began they waited with impatience for the reading the lessons as a licensed season for whispering and the subject begun during the lessons was finished while they were singing the young ladies made an appointment for the afternoon with a friend in the next pew while their mamma took the opportunity of enquiring the character of a dairy maid which she observed with a compliment to her own good management would save time on a weekday  mr worthy who found himself quite in a new world returned home with his friend alone in the evening he ventured to ask bragwell if he did not on a sunday night at least make it a custom to read and pray with his family bragwell told him he was sorry to say he had no family at home else he should like to do it for the sake of example but as his servants worked hard all the week his wife was of opinion that they should then have a little holiday mr worthy pressed it home upon him whether the utter neglect of his servants principles was not likely to make a heavy article in his final account and asked him if he did not believe that the too general liberty of meeting together jaunting and diverting themselves on sunday evenings was not often found to produce the worst effects on the morals of servants and the good order of families i put it to your conscience said he mr bragwell whether sunday which was meant as a blessing and a benefit is not as it is commonly kept turned into the most mischievous part of the week by the selfish kindness of masters who not daring to set their servants about any public work allot them that day to follow their own devices that they themselves may with more rigor refuse them a little indulgence and a reasonable holiday in the working part of the week which a good servant has now and then a fair right to expect those masters who will give them half or all the lords day will not spare them a single hour of a working day their work must be done gods work may be let alone  mr bragwell owned that sunday had produced many mischiefs in his own family that the young men and maids having no eye upon them frequently went to improper places with other servants turned adrist like themselves that in these parties the poor girls were too frequently led astray and the men got to public houses and fives playing but it was none of his business to watch them his family only did as others do indeed it was his wifes concern and as she was so good a manager on other days that she would not spare them an hour to visit a sick father or mother it would be hard she said if they might not have sunday afternoon to themselves and she could not blame them for making the most of it indeed she was so indulgent in this particular that she often excused the men from going to church that they might serve the beasts and the maids that they might get the milking done before the holiday part of the evening came on she would not indeed hear of any competition between doing her work and taking their pleasure but when the difference lay between their going to church and taking their peasure he must say that for his wife she always inclined to the goodnatured side of the question she is strict enough in keeping them sober because drunkenness is a costly sin and to do her justice she does not care how little they sin at her expense  well said mr worthy i always like to examine both sides fairly and to see the different effects of opposite practices now which plan produces the greatest share of comfort to the master and of profit to the servants in the long run your servants it is likely are very much attached to you and very fond of living where they get their own way in so great a point  o as to that replied bragwell you are quite out my house is a scene of discord mutiny and discontent and thoug there is not a better manager in england than my wife yet she is always changing her servants so that every quarterday is a sort of jaildeliver at my house and when they go off as they often do at a moments warning to own the truth i often give them money privately that they may not carry my wife before the justice to get their wages  i see said mr worthy that all your worldly compliances do not procure you even worldly happiness as to my own family i take care to let them see that their pleasure is bound up with their duty and that what they may call my strictness has nothing in view but their safety and happiness by this means i commonly gain their love as well as secure their obedience i know that with all my care i am liable to be disappointed from the corruption that is in the world through sin but whenever this happens so far from encouraging me in remisseness it only serves to quicken my zeal if by gods blessing my servant turns out a good christian i have been an humble instrument in his hand of saving a soul committed to my charge  mrs bragwell came home but brought only one of her daughters with her the other she said had given them the slip and was gone with a young friend and would not return for a day or two mr bragwell was greatly displeased as he knew that young friend had but a slight character and kept bad acquaintances mrs bragwell came in all hurry and bustle saying if her family did not go to bed with the lamb on sundays when they had nothing to do how could they rise with the lark on mondays when so much was to be done  mr worthy had this night much matter for reflection we need not said he go into the great world to look for dissipation and vanity we can find both in a farm house as for me and my house continued he we will serve the lord every day but especially on sundays it is the day which the lord has made has made for himself we will rejoice in it and consider the religious use of it not only as a duty but as a privilege  the next morning mr bragwell and his friend set out early for the golden lion what passed on this little journey my readers shall hear next month  part iv it was mentioned in the last part of this history that the chief reason which had drawn mr worthy to visit his friend just at the present time was that mr bragwell had a small estate to sell by auction mr worthy though he did not think he should be a bidder wished to be present as he had business to settle with one or two persons who were expected at the golden lion on that day and he had put off his visit till he had seen the sale advertised in the county paper  mr bragwell and mr worthy set out early on the monday morning on their way to the golden lion a small inn in a neighboring market town as they had time before them they had agreed to ride slowly that they might converse on some useful subject but here as usual they had two opinions about the same thing mr bragwells notion of an useful subject was something by which money was to be got and a good bargain struck mr worthy was no less a man of business than his friend his schemes were wise and his calculations just his reputation for integrity and good sense made him the common judge and umpire in his neighbors affairs while no one paid a more exact attention to every transaction of his own but the business of getting money was not with him the first much less was it the whole concern of the day every morning when he rose he remembered that he had a maker to worship as well as a family to maintain religion however never made him neglect business though it sometimes led him to postpone it he used to say no man had any reason to expect gods blessing through the day who did not ask it in the morning nor was he likely to spend the day in the fear of god who did not begin it with his worship but he had not the less sense spirit and activity when he was among men abroad because he had first served god at home  as these two farmers rode along mr worthy took occasion from the fineness of the day and the beauty of the country through which they passed to turn the discourse to the goodness of god and our infinite obligations to him he knew that the transition from thanksgiving to prayer would be natural and easy and he therefore slid by degrees into that important subject and he observed that secret prayer was a duty of universal obligation which every man had it in his power to fulfill and which he seriously believed was the groundwork of all religious practice and of all devout affections  mr bragwell felt conscious that he was very negligent and irregular in the performance of this duty indeed he considered it as a mere ceremony or at least as a duty which might give way to the slightest temptation of drowsiness at night or of business in the morning as he knew he did not live in the conscientious performance of this practice he tried to ward off the subject knowing what a home way his friend had of putting things after some evasion he at last said he certainly thought private prayer a good custom especially for people who have time and those who were sick or old or out of business could not do better but that for his part he believed much of these sort of things was not expected from men in active life  mr worthy i should think mr bragwell that those who are most exposed to temptation stand most in need of prayer now there are few methinks who are more exposed to temptation than men in business for those must be in most danger at least from the world who have most to do with it and if this be true ought we not to prepare ourselves in the closet for the trials of the market the field and the shop it is but putting on our armor before we go out to battle   bragwell for my part i think example is the whole of religion and if the master of a family is orderly and regular and goes to church he does every thing which can be required of him and no one has a right to call him to account for any thing more   worthy give me leave to say mr bragwell that highly as i rate a good example still i must set a good principle above it i know i must keep good order indeed for the sake of others but i must keep a good conscience for my own sake to god i owe secret piety i must therefore pray to him in private  to my family i owe a christian example and for that among other reasons i must not fail to go to church   bragwell you are talking mr worthy as if i were an enemy to christianity sir i am no heathen sir i belong to the church i go to church i always drink prosperity to the church you yourself as strict as you are in never missing it twice a day are not a warmer friend to the church than i am   worthy that is to say you know its value as an institution but you do not seem to know that a man may be very irreligious under the best religious institutions and that even the most excellent of them are but means of being religious and are no more religion itself than brick and mortar are prayers and thanksgivings i shall never think however high their profession and even however regular their attendance that those men truly respect the church who bring home little of that religion which is taught in it into their own families or their own hearts or who make the whole of christianity to consist in their attendance there excuse me mr bragwell   bragwell mr worthy i am persuaded that religion is quite a proper thing for the poor and i dont think that the multitude can ever be kept in order without it and i am a sort of a politician you know we must have bits and bridles and restraints for the vulgar   worthy your opinion is very just as far as it goes but it does not go far enough since it does not go to the root of the evil for while you value yourself on the soundness of this principle as a politician i wish you also to see the reason of it as a christian depend upon it if religion be good for the community at large it is equally good for every family and what is right for a family is equally right for each individual in it you have therefore yourself brought the most unanswerable argument why you ought to be religious yourself by asking how we shall keep others in order without religion for believe me mr bragwell there is no particular clause to except you in the gospel there are no exceptions there in favor of any one class of men the same restraints which are necessary for the people at large are equally necessary for men of every order high and low rich and poor bond and free learned and ignorant if jesus christ died for no particular rank class or community there is no one rank class or communion exempt from the obedience to his laws enjoined by the gospel may i ask you mr bragwell what is your reason for going to church   bragwell sir i am shocked at your question how can i avoid doing a thing so customary and so creditable not go to church indeed what do you take me for mr worthy i am afraid you suspect me to be a papist or a heathen or of some religion or other that is not what it should be   worthy if a foreigner were to hear how violently one set of christians in this country often speak against another how earnest would he suppose us all to be in religious matters and how astonished to discover that many a man has perhaps little other proof to give of the sincerity of his own religion except the violence with which he hates the religion of another party it is not irreligion which such men hate but the religion of the man or the party whom they are set against now hatred is certainly no part of the religion of the gospel well you have told me why you go to church now pray tell me why do you confess there on your bended knees every sunday that you have erred and strayed from gods ways that there is no health in you that you have done what you ought not to do and that you are a miserable sinner   bragwell because it is in the common prayer book to be sure a book which i have heard you yourself say was written by wise and good men the pillars of the protestant church   worthy but have you no other reason   bragwell no i cannot say i have   worthy when you repeat that excellent form of confession do you really feel that you are a miserable sinner   bragwell no i cannot say i do but that is no objection to my repeating it because it may suit the case of many who are so i suppose the good doctors who drew it up intended that part for wicked people only such as drunkards and thieves and murderers for i imagine they could not well contrive to make the same prayer quire suit an honest man and a rogue and so i suppose they thought it safer to make a good man repeat a prayer which suited a rogue than to make a rogue repeat a prayer which suited a good man and you know it is so customary for every body to repeat the general confession that it cannot hurt the credit of the most respectable persons though every respectable person must know they have no particular concern in it   worthy depend upon it mr bragwell those good doctors you speak of were not quite of your opinion they really thought that what you call honest men were grievous sinners in a certain sense and that the best of us stand in need of making that humble confession mr bragwell do you believe in the fall of adam   bragwell to be sure i do and a sad thing for adam it was why it is in the bible is it not it is one of the prettiest chapters in genesis dont you believe it mr worthy   worthy yes truly i do but i dont believe it merely because i read it in genesis though i know indeed that i am bound to believe every part of the word of god but i have still an additional reason for believing in the fall of the first man   bragwell have you indeed now i cannot guess what that can be   worthy why my own observation of what is within myself teaches me to believe it it is not only the third chapter of genesis which convinces me of the truth of the fall but also the sinful inclinations which i find in my own heart corresponding with it this is one of those leading truths of christianity of which i can never doubt a moment first because it is abundantly expressed or implied in scripture and next because the consciousness of the evil nature i carry about with me confirms the doctrine beyond all doubt besides is it not said in scripture that by one man sin entered into the world and that all we like sheep have gone astray that by one mans disobedience many were made sinners and so again in twenty more places that i could tell you of   bragwell well i never thought of this but is not this a very melancholy sort of doctrine mr worthy   worthy it is melancholy indeed if we stop here but while we are deploring this sad truth let us take comfort from another that as in adam all die so in christ shall all be made alive   bragwell yes i remember i thought those very fine words when i heard them said over my poor fathers grave but as it was in the burial of the dead i did not think of taking it to myself for i was then young and hearty and in little danger of dying and i have been so busy ever since that i have hardly had time to think of it   worthy and yet the service pronounced at the burial of all who die is a solemn admonition to all who live it is there said as indeed the scripture says also i am the resurrection and the life whosoever believes in me shall never die but i will raise him up at the last day now do you think you believe in christ mr bragwell   bragwell to be sure i do why you are always fancying me an atheist   worthy in order to believe in christ we must believe first in our own guilt and our own unworthiness and when we do this we shall see the use of a savior and not till then   bragwell why all this is a new way of talking i cannot say i ever meddled with such subjects before in my life but now what do you advise a man to do upon your plan of religion   worthy why all this leads me back to the ground from which we set out i mean the duty of prayer for if we believe that we have an evil nature within us and that we stand in need of gods grace to help us and a savior to redeem us we shall be led of course to pray for what we so much need and without this conviction we shall not be led to pray   bragwell well but dont you think mr worthy that you good folks who make so much of prayer have lower notions than we have of the wisdom of the almighty you think he wants to be informed of the things you tell him whereas i take it for granted that he knows them already and that being so good as he is he will give me every thing he sees fit to give me without my asking it   worthy god indeed who knows all things knows what we want before we ask him but still has he not said that with prayer and supplication we must make known our requests unto him prayer is the way in which god has said that his favor must be sought it is the channel through which he has declared it is his sovereign will and pleasure that his blessings should be conveyed to us what ascends up in prayer descends again to us in blessings it is like the rain which just now fell and which had been drawn up from the ground in vapors to the clouds before it descended from them to the earth in that refreshing shower besides prayer has a good effect on our minds it tends to excite a right disposition toward god in us and to keep up a constant sense of our dependence but above all it is the way to get the good things we want ask says the scripture and ye shall receive   bragwell now that is the very thing which i was going to deny for the truth is men do not always get what they ask i believe if i could get a good crop for asking it i should pray oftener than i do   worthy sometimes mr bragwell men ask and receive not because they ask amiss they ask worldly blessings perhaps when they should ask spiritual ones now the latter which are the good things i spoke of are always granted to those who pray to god for them though the former are not i have observed in the case of some worldly things i have sought for that the grant of my prayer would have caused the misery of my life so that god equally consults our good in what he withholds and in what he bestows   bragwell and yet you continue to pray on i suppose   worthy certainly but then i try to mend as to the object of my prayers i pray for gods blessing and favor which is better than riches   bragwell you seem very earnest on this subject   worthy to cut the matter short i ask then whether prayer is not positively commanded in the gospel when this is the case we can never dispute about the necessity or the duty of a thing as we may when there is no such command here however let me just add also that a mans prayers may be turned to no small use in the way of discovering to him whatever is amiss in his life   bragwell how so mr worthy   worthy why suppose now you were to try yourself by turning into the shape of a prayer every practice in which you allow yourself for instance let the prayer in the morning be a sort of preparation for the deeds of the day and the prayer at night a sort of observation on those deeds you mr bragwell i suspect are a little inclined to covetousness excuse me sir now suppose after you have been during a whole day a little too eager to get rich suppose i say you were to try how it would sound to beg of god at night on your knees to give you still more money though you have already so much that you know not what to do with it suppose you were to pray in the morning o lord give me more riches though those i have are a snare and a temptation to me and ask him in the same solemn manner to bless all the grasping means you intend to make use of in the day to add to your substance   bragwell mr worthy i have no patience with you for thinking i could be so wicked   worthy hear me out mr bragwell you turned your good nephew tom broad out of doors you know you owned to me it was an act of injustice now suppose on the morning of your doing so you had begged of god in a solemn act of prayer to prosper the deed of cruelty and oppression which you intended to commit that day i see you are shocked at the thought of such a prayer well then would not hearty prayer have kept you from committing that wicked action in short what a life must that be no act of which you dare beg god to prosper and bless if once you can bring yourself to believe that it is your bounden duty to pray for gods blessing on your days work you will certainly grow careful about passing such a day as you may safely ask his blessing upon the remark may be carried to sports diversions company a man who once takes up the serious use of prayer will soon find himself obliged to abstain from such diversions occupations and societies as he cannot reasonably desire that god will bless to him and thus he will see himself compelled to leave off either the practice or the prayer now mr bragwell i need not ask you which of the two he that is a real christian will give up sinning or praying   mr bragwell began to feel that he had not the best of the argument and was afraid he was making no great figure in the eyes of his friend luckily however he was relieved from the difficulty into which the necessity of making some answer must have brought him by finding they were come to the end of their little journey and he never beheld the bunch of grapes which decorated the sign of the golden lion with more real satisfaction  i refer my readers for the transactions at the golden lion and for the sad adventures which afterward besel mr bragwells family to the fifth part of the history of the two wealthy farmers  part v bragwell in a passion at hearing of his daughters marriage   mr bragwell and mr worthy alighted at the golden lion it was market day the inn the yard the town was all alive mr bragwell was quite in his element money company and good cheer always set his spirits afloat he felt himself the principal man in the scene he had three great objects in view the sale of his land the letting mr worthy see how much he was looked up to by so many substantial people and the showing these people what a wise man his most intimate friend mr worthy was it was his way to try to borrow a little credit from every person and every thing he was connected with and by that credit to advance his interest and increase his wealth  the farmers met in a large room and while they were transacting their various concerns those whose pursuits were the same naturally herded together the tanners were drawn to one corner by the common interest which they took in bark and hides a useful debate was carrying on at another little table whether the practice of sowing wheat or of planting it were most profitable another set were disputing whether horses or oxen were best for plows those who were concerned in canals sought the company of other canallers while some who were interested in the new bill for enclosures wisely looked out for such as knew most about waste lands  mr worthy was pleased with all these subjects and picked up something useful on each it was a saying of his that most men understood some one thing and that he who was wise would try to learn from every man something on the subject he best knew but mr worthy made a further use of the whole what a pity is it said he that christians are not as desirous to turn their time to good account as men of business are when shall we see religious persons as anxious to derive profit from the experience of others as these farmers when shall we see them as eager to turn their time to good account while i approve these men for not being slothful in business let me improve the hint by being also servent in spirit  showing how much wiser the children of this generation are than the children of light  when the hurry was a little over mr bragwell took a turn on the bowlinggreen mr worthy followed him to ask why the sale of the estate was not brought forward let the auctioneer proceed to business said he the company will be glad to get home by daylight i speak mostly with a view to others for i do not think of being a purchaser myself  i know it said bragwell or i would not be such a fool as to let the cat out of the bag but is it really possible proceeded he with a smile of contempt that you should think i will sell my estate before dinner mr worthy you are a clever man at books and such things and perhaps can make out an account on paper in a handsomer manner than i can but i never found much was to be got by fine writing as to figures i can carry enough of them in my head to add divide and multiply more money than your learning will ever give you the fingering of you may beat me at a book but you are a very child at a bargain sell my land before dinner indeed  mr worthy was puzzled to guess how a man was to show more wisdom by selling a piece of ground at one hour than at another and desired an explanation bragwell felt rather more contempt for his understanding than he had ever done before lookee mr worthy said he i do not know that knowledge is of any use to a man unless he has sense enough to turn it to account men are my books mr worthy and it is by reading spelling and putting them together to good purpose that i have got up in the world i shall give you a proof of this today these farmers are most of them come to the lion with a view of purchasing this bit of land of mine if they should like the bargain now as you know a thing cannot be any great bargain both to the buyer and the seller too to them and to me it becomes me as a man of sense who has the good of his family at heart to secure the bargain to myself i would not cheat any man sir but i think it fair enough to turn his weakness to my own advantage there is no law against that you know and this is the use of one mans having more sense than another so whenever i have a bit of land to sell i always give a handsome dinner with plenty of punch and strong beer we fill up the morning with other business and i carefully keep back any talk about the purchase till we have dined at dinner we have of course a bit of politics this puts most of us into a passion and you know anger is thirsty besides church and king naturally bring on a good many other toasts now as i am master of the feast you know it would be shabby in me to save my liquor so i push about the glass one way and the tankard the other till all my company are as merry as kings every man is delighted to see what a fine hearty fellow he has to deal with and mr bragwell receives a thousand compliments by this time they have gained as much in good humor as they have lost in sober judgment and this is the proper moment for setting the auctioneer to work and this i commonly do to such good purpose that i go home with my purse a score or two of pounds heavier than if they had not been warmed by their dinner in the morning men are cool and suspicious and have all their wits about them but a cheerful glass cures all distrust and what is lucky i add to my credit as well as my pocket and get more praise for my dinner than blame for my bargain  mr worthy was struck with the absurd vanity which could tempt a man to own himself guilty of an unfair action for the sake of showing his wisdom he was beginning to express his disapprobation when they were told dinner was on table they went in and were soon seated all was mirth and good cheer every body agreed that no one gave such hearty dinners as mr bragwell nothing was pitiful where he was master of the feast bragwell who looked with pleasure on the excellent dinner before him and enjoyed the good account to which he should turn it heard their praises with delight and cast an eye on worthy as much as to say who is the wise man now having a mind for his own credit to make his friend talk he turned to him saying mr worthy i believe no people in the world enjoy life more than men of our class we have money and power we live on the fat of the land and have as good a right to gentility as the best  as to gentility mr bragwell replied worthy i am not sure that this is among the wisest of our pretensions but i will say that ours is a creditable and respectable business in ancient times farming was the employment of princes and patriarchs and nowadays an honest humane sensible english yeoman i will be bold to say is not only a very useful but an honorable character but then he must not merely think of enjoying life as you call it but he must think of living up to the great ends for which he was sent into the world a wealthy farmer not only has it in his power to live well but to do much good he is not only the father of his own family but of his workmen his dependants and the poor at large especially in these hard times he has it in his power to raise into credit all the parish offices which have fallen into disrepute by getting into bad hands and he can convert what have been falsely thought mean offices into very important ones by his just and christianlike manner of filling them an upright juryman a conscientious constable a humane overseer an independent elector an active superintendant of a workhouse a just arbitrator in public disputes a kind counselor in private troubles such a one i say fills up a station in society no less necessary and as far as it reaches scarcely less important than that of a magistrate a sheriff of a county or even a member of parliament that can never be a slight or a degrading office on which the happiness of a whole parish may depend  bragwell who thought the good sense of his friend reflected credit on himself encouraged worthy to go on but he did it in his own vain way aye very true mr worthy said he you are right a leading man in our class ought to be looked up to as an example as you say in order to which he should do things handsomely and liberally and not grudge himself or his friends any thing casting an eye of complacency on the good dinner he had provided true replied mr worthy he should be an example of simplicity sobriety and plainness of manners but he will do well added he not to affect a frothy gentility which will set but clumsily upon him if he has money let him spend prudently lay up moderately for his children and give liberally to the poor but let him rather seek to dignify his own station by his virtues than to get above it by his vanity if he acts thus then as long as this country lasts a farmer of england will be looked upon as one of its most valuable members nay more by this conduct he may contribute to make england last the longer the riches of the farmer corn and cattle are the true riches of a nation but let him remember that though corn and cattle enrich a country nothing but justice integrity and religion can preserve it  young wilson the worthy grazier whom miss bragwell had turned off because he did not understand french dances thanked mr worthy for what he had said and hoped he should be the better for it as long as he lived and desired his leave to be better acquainted most of the others declared they had never heard a finer speech and then as is usual proceeded to show the good effect it had on them by loose conversation hard drinking and whatever could counteract all that worthy had said  mr worthy was much concerned to hear mr bragwell after dinner whisper to the waiter to put less and less water into every fresh bowl of punch  this was his way if the time they had to sit was long then the punch was to be weaker as he saw no good in wasting money to make it stronger than the time required but if time pressed then the strength was to be increased in due proportion as a small quantity must then intoxicate them as much in a short time as would be required of a greater quantity had the time been longer this was one of mr bragwells nice calculations and this was the sort of skill on which he so much valued himself  at length the guests were properly primed for business just in that convenient stage of intoxication which makes men warm and rash yet keeps short of that absolute drunkenness which disqualifies for business the auctioneer set to work all were bidders and if possible all would have been purchasers so happily had the feast and the punch operated they bid on with a still increasing spirit till they had got so much above the value of the land that bragwell with a wink and a whisper said who would sell his land fasting eh worthy at length the estate was knocked down at a price very far above its worth  as soon as it was sold bragwell again said softly to worthy five from fifty and there remain forty five the dinner and drink will not cost me five pounds and i have got fifty more than the land was worth spend a shilling to gain a pound this is what i call practical arithmetic mr worthy  mr worthy was glad to get out of this scene and seeing that his friend was quite sober he resolved as they rode home to deal plainly with him bragwell had found out among his calculations that there were some sins which could only be committed by a prudent man one at a time for instance he knew that a man could not well get rich and get drunk at the same moment so that he used to practice one first and the other after but he had found out that some vices made very good company together thus while he had watched himself in drinking lest he should become as unfit to sell as his guests were to buy he had indulged without measure in the good dinner he had provided mr worthy i say seeing him able to bear reason rebuked him for this days proceedings with some severity bragwell bore his reproofs with that sort of patience which arises from an opinion of ones own wisdom and a recent flush of prosperity he behaved with that gay good humor which grows out of vanity and good luck you are too squeamish mr worthy said he i have done nothing discreditable these men came with their eyes open there is no compulsion used they are free to bid or to let it alone i make them welcome and i shall not be thought a bit the worse of by them tomorrow when they are sober others do it besides me and i shall never be ashamed of any thing as long as i have custom on my side  worthy i am sorry mr bragwell to hear you support such practices by such arguments there is not perhaps a more dangerous snare to the souls of men than is to be found in that word custom it is a word invented to reconcile corruption with credit and sin with safety but no custom no fashion no combination of men to set up a false standard can ever make a wrong action right that a thing is often done is so far from a proof of its being right that it is the very reason which will set a thinking man to inquire if it be not really wrong lest he should be following a multitude to do evil right is right though only one man in a thousand pursues it and wrong will be for ever wrong though it be the allowed practice of the other nine hundred and ninetynine if this shameful custom is really common which i can hardly believe that is a fresh reason why a conscientious man should set his face against it and i must go so far as to say you will excuse me mr bragwell that i see no great difference in the eye of conscience whatever there may be in the eye of law between your making a man first lose his reason and then getting fifty guineas out of his pocket because he has lost it and your picking the fifty guineas out of his pocket if you had met him dead drunk in his way home tonight nay he who meets a man already drunk and robs him commits but one sin while he who makes him drunk first that he may rob him afterward commits two   bragwell gravely replied mr worthy while i have the practice of people of credit to support me and the law of the land to protect me i see no reason to be ashamed of any thing i do  mr bragwell answered worthy a truly honest man is not always looking sharp about him to see how far custom and the law will bear him out if he be honest on principle he will consult the law of his conscience and if he be a christian he will consult the written law of god  notwithstanding this rebuff mr bragwell got home in high spirits for no arguments could hinder him from feeling that he had the fifty guineas in his purse as soon as he came in he gaily threw the money he had received on the table and desired his wife to lock it up instead of receiving it with her usual satisfaction she burst into a violent fit of passion and threw it back to him you may keep your cash yourself said she it is all over we want no more money you are a ruined man a wicked creature scraping and working as we have done for her bragwell trembled but durst not ask what he dreaded to hear his wise spared him the trouble by crying out as soon as her rage permitted polly is gone off poor bragwells heart sunk within him he grew sick and giddy and as his wifes rage swallowed up her grief so in his grief he almost forgot his anger the purse fell from his hand and he cast a look of anguish upon it finding for the first time that money could not relieve his misery  mr worthy who though much concerned was less discomposed now called to mind that the young lady had not returned with her mother and sister the night before he begged mrs bragwell to explain this sad story she instead of soothing her husband fell to reproaching him it is all your fault said she you were a fool for your pains if i had had my way the girls never would have kept company with any but men of substance and then they could not have been ruined mrs bragwell said mr worthy if she has chosen a bad man it would be still a misfortune even though he had been rich o that would alter the case said she a fat sorrow is better than a lean one but to marry a beggar there is no sin like that here miss betsy who stood sullenly by put in a word and said her sister however had not disgraced herself by having married a farmer or a tradesman she had at least made choice of a gentleman what marriage what gentleman cried the afflicted father tell me the worst he was now informed that his darling daughter was gone off with a strolling player who had been acting in the neighboring villages lately miss betsy again put in saying he was no stroller but a gentleman in disguise who only acted for his own diversion does he so said the now furious bragwell then he shall be transported for mine at this moment a letter was brought him from his new soninlaw who desired his leave to wait upon him and implore his forgiveness he owned he had been shopman to a haberdasher but thinking his person and talents ought not to be thrown away upon trade and being also a little behind hand he had taken to the stage with a view of making his fortune that he had married miss bragwell entirely for love and was sorry to mention so paltry a thing as money which he despised but that his wants were pressing his landlord to whom he was in debt having been so vulgar as to threaten to send him to prison he ended with saying i have been obliged to shock your daughters delicacy by confessing my unlucky real name i believe i owe part of my success with her to my having assumed that of augustus frederic theodosius she is inconsolable at this confession which as you are now my father i must also make to you and subscribe myself with many blushes by the vulgar name of your dutiful son timothy incle  o cried the afflicted father as he tore the letter in a rage miss bragwell married to a strolling actor how shall i bear it why i would not bear it at all cried the enraged mother i would never see her i would never forgive her i would let her starve at one corner of the barn while that rascal with all those pagan popish names was ranting away at the other nay said miss betsy if he is only a shopman and if his name be really timothy incle i would never forgive her neither but who would have thought it by his looks and by his monstrous genteel behavior no he never can have so vulgar a name  come come said mr worthy were he really an honest haberdasher i should think there was no other harm done except the disobedience of the thing mr bragwell this is no time to blame you or hardly to reason with you i feel for you sincerely i ought not perhaps just at present to reproach you for the mistaken manner in which you have bred up your daughters as your error has brought its punishment along with it you now see because you now feel the evil of a false education it has ruined your daughter your whole plan unavoidably led to some such end the large sums you spent to qualify them as you thought for a high station could do them nothing but harm while your habits of life properly confined them to company of a lower station while they were better dressed than the daughters of the first gentry they were worse taught as to real knowledge than the daughters of your plowmen their vanity has been raised by excessive finery and kept alive by excessive flattery every evil temper has been fostered by indulgence their pride has never been controuled their selfwill has never been subdued their idleness has laid them open to every temptation and their abundance has enabled them to gratify every desire their time that precious talent has been entirely wasted every thing they have been taught to do is of no use while they are utterly unacquainted with all which they ought to have known i deplore miss pollys false step that she should have married a runaway shopman turned stroller i truly lament but for what husband was she qualified for the wife of a farmer she was too idle for the wife of a tradesman she was too expensive for the wife of a gentleman she was too ignorant you yourself was most to blame you expected her to act wisely though you never taught her that fear of god which is the beginning of wisdom i owe it to you as a friend and to myself as a christian to declare that your practices in the common transactions of life as well as your present misfortune are almost the natural consequences of those false principles which i protested against when you were at my house see second part of two farmers   mrs bragwell attempted several times to interrupt mr worthy but her husband would not permit it he felt the force of all his friend said and encouraged him to proceed mr worthy thus went on it grieves me to say how much your own indiscretion has contributed even to bring on your present misfortune you gave your countenance to this very company of strollers though you knew they are acting in defiance to the laws of the land to say no worse they go from town to town and from barn to barn stripping the poor of their money the young of their innocence and all of their time do you remember with how much pride you told me that you had bespoke the bold stroke for a wife for the benefit of this very mr frederic theodosius to this pernicious ribaldry you not only carried your own family but wasted i know not how much money in treating your workmens wives and children in these hard times too when they have scarcely bread to eat or a shoe on their feet and all this only that you might have the absurd pleasure of seeing those flattering words by desire of mr bragwell stuck up in print at the publichouse on the blacksmiths shed at the turnpikegate and on the barndoor  mr bragwell acknowledged that his friends rebuke was but too just and he looked so very contrite as to raise the pity of mr worthy who in a mild voice thus went on what i have said is not so much to reproach you with the ruin of one daughter as from a desire to save the other let miss betsy go home with me i do not undertake to be her jailer but i will be her friend she will find in my daughters kind companions and in my wife a prudent guide i know she will dislike us at first but i do not despair in time of convincing her that a sober humble useful pious life is as necessary to make us happy on earth as it is to fit us for heaven  poor miss betsy though she declared it would be frightful dull and monstrous vulgar and dismal melancholy yet was she so terrified at the discontent and grumbling which she would have to endure at home that she sullenly consented she had none of that filial tenderness which led her to wish to stay and sooth and comfort her afflicted father all she thought about was to get out of the way of her mothers ill humor and to carry so much finery with her as to fill the miss worthies with envy and respect poor girl she did not know that envy was a feeling they never indulged and that fine clothes was the last thing to draw their respect mr worthy took her home next day when they reached his house they found there young wilson miss betsys old admirer she was much pleased at this and resolved to treat him well but her good or ill treatment now signified but little this young grazier reverenced mr worthys character and ever since he had met him at the lion had been thinking what a happiness it would be to marry a young woman bred up by such a father he had heard much of the modesty and discretion of both the daughters but his inclination now determined him in favor of the elder  mr worthy who knew him to be a young man of good sense and sound principles allowed him to become a visitor at his house but deferred his consent to the marriage till he knew him more thoroughly mr wilson from what he saw of the domestic piety of this family improved daily both in the knowledge and practice of religion and mr worthy soon formed him into a most valuable character during this time miss bragwells hopes had revived but though she appeared in a new dress almost every day she had the mortification of being beheld with great indifference by one whom she had always secretly liked mr wilson married before her face a girl who was greatly her inferior in fortune person and appearance but who was humble frugal meek and pious miss bragwell now strongly felt the truth of what mr wilson had once told her that a woman may make an excellent partner for a dance who would make a very bad one for life  hitherto mr bragwell and his daughters had only learnt to regret their folly and vanity as it had produced them mortification in this life whether they were ever brought to a more serious sense of their errors may be seen in a future part of this history  part vi mr bragwell was so much afflicted at the disgraceful marriage of his daughter who ran off with timothy incle the strollingplayer that he never fully recovered his spirits his cheerfulness which had arisen from an high opinion of himself had been confirmed by a constant flow of uninterrupted success and that is a sort of cheerfulness which is very liable to be impaired because it lies at the mercy of every accident and cross event in life but though his pride was now disappointed his misfortunes had not taught him any humility because he had not discovered that they were caused by his own fault nor had he acquired any patience or submission because he had not learnt that all afflictions come from the hand of god to awaken us to a deep sense of our sins and to draw off our hearts from the perishing vanities of this life besides mr bragwell was one of those people who even if they would be thought to bear with tolerable submission such trials as appear to be sent more immediately from providence yet think they have a sort of right to rebel at every misfortune which befalls them through the fault of a fellow creature as if our fellow creatures were not the agents and instruments by which providence often sees fit to try or to punish us this imprudent daughter bragwell would not be brought to see or forgive nor was the degrading name of mrs incle ever allowed to be pronounced in his hearing he had loved her with an excessive and undue affection and while she gratified his vanity by her beauty and finery he deemed her faults of little consequence but when she disappointed his ambition by a disgraceful marriage all his natural affection only served to increase his resentment yet though he regretted her crime less than his own mortification he never ceased in secret to lament her loss she soon found out she was undone and wrote in a strain of bitter repentance to ask his forgiveness she owned that her husband whom she had supposed to be a man of fashion in disguise was a low person in distressed circumstances she implored that her father though he refused to give her husband that fortune for which alone it was now too plain he had married her would at least allow her some subsistence for that mr incle was much in debt and she feared in danger of a gaol the fathers heart was half melted at this account and his affection was for a time awakened but mrs bragwell opposed his sending her any assistance she always made it a point of duty never to forgive for she said it only encouraged those who had done wrong once to do worse next time for her part she had never yet been guilty of so mean and pitiful a weakness as to forgive any one for to pardon an injury always showed either want of spirit to feel it or want of power to resent it she was resolved she would never squander the money for which she had worked early and late on a baggage who had thrown herself away on a beggar while she had a daughter single who might raise her family by a great match i am sorry to say that mrs bragwells anger was not owing to the undutifulness of the daughter or the worthlessness of the husband poverty was in her eyes the grand crime the doctrine of forgiveness as a religious principle made no more a part of mr bragwells system than of his wifes but in natural feeling particularly for this offending daughter he much exceeded her  in a few months the youngest miss bragwell desired leave to return home from mr worthys she had indeed only consented to go thither as a less evil of the two than staying in her fathers house after her sisters elopement but the sobriety and simplicity of mr worthys family were irksome to her habits of vanity and idleness were become so rooted in her mind that any degree of restraint was a burden and though she was outwardly civil it was easy to see that she longed to get away she resolved however to profit by her sisters faults and made her parents easy by assuring them she never would throw herself away on a man who was worth nothing encouraged by these promises which were all that her parents thought they could in reason expect her father allowed her to come home  mr worthy who accompanied her found mr bragwell gloomy and dejected as his house was no longer a scene of vanity and festivity mr bragwell tried to make himself and his friend believe that he was grown religious whereas he was only become discontented as he had always fancied that piety was a melancholy gloomy thing and as he felt his own mind really gloomy he was willing to think that he was growing pious he had indeed gone more constantly to church and had taken less pleasure in feasting and cards and now and then read a chapter in the bible but all this was because his spirits were low and not because his heart was changed the outward actions were more regular but the inward man was the same the forms of religion were resorted to as a painful duty but this only added to his misery while he was utterly ignorant of its spirit and its power he still however reserved religion as a loathsome medicine to which he feared he must have recourse at last and of which he even now considered every abstinence from pleasure or every exercise of piety as a bitter dose his health also was impaired so that his friend found him in a pitiable state neither able to receive pleasure from the world which he so dearly loved nor from religion which he so greatly feared he expected to have been much commended by worthy for the change in his way of life but worthy who saw that the alteration was only owing to the loss of animal spirits and to the casual absence of temptation was cautious of flattering him too much i thought mr worthy said he to have received more comfort from you i was told too that religion was full of comfort but i do not much find it you were told the truth replied worthy religion is full of comfort but you must first be brought into a state fit to receive it before it can become so you must be brought to a deep and humbling sense of sin to give you comfort while you are puffed up with high thoughts of yourself would be to give you a strong cordial in a high fever religion keeps back her cordials till the patient is lowered and emptied emptied of self mr bragwell if you had a wound it must be examined and cleansed aye and probed too before it would be safe to put on a healing plaster curing it to the outward eye while it was corrupt at bottom would only bring on a mortification and you would be a dead man while you trusted that the plaster was curing you you must be indeed a christian before you can be entitled to the comforts of christianity  i am a christian said bragwell many of my friends are christians but i do not see it has done us much good  christianity itself answered worthy cannot make us good unless it be applied to our hearts christian privileges will not make us christians unless we make use of them on that shelf i see stands your medicine the doctor orders you to take it have you taken it  yes replied bragwell are you the better for it said worthy  i think i am he replied  but added worthy are you the better because the doctor has ordered it merely or because you have also taken it  what a foolish question cried bragwell why to be sure the doctor might be the best doctor and his physic the best physic in the world but if it stood for ever on the shelf i could not expect to be cured by it my doctor is not a mountebank he does not pretend to cure by a charm the physic is good and as it suits my case though it is bitter i take it  you have now said worthy explained undesignedly the reason why religion does so little good in the world it is not a mountebank it does not work by a charm but offers to cure your worst corruptions by wholesome though sometimes bitter prescriptions but you will not take them you will not apply to god with the same earnest desire to be healed with which you apply to your doctor you will not confess your sins to the one as honestly as you tell your symptoms to the other nor read your bible with the same faith and submission with which you take your medicine in reading it however you must take care not to apply to yourself the comforts which are not suited to your case you must by the grace of god be brought into a condition to be entitled to the promises before you can expect the comfort of them conviction is not conversion that worldly discontent which is the effect of worldly disappointment is not that godly sorrow which works repentance besides while you have been pursuing all the gratifications of the world do not complain that you have not all the comforts of religion too could you live in the full enjoyment of both the bible would not he true  bragwell now seemed resolved to set about the matter in earnset but he resolved in his own strength and unluckily the very day mr worthy took leave there happened to be a grand ball at the next town on account of the assizes an assizeball is a scene to which gentlemen and ladies periodically resort to celebrate the crimes and calamities of their fellow creatures by dancing and music and to divert themselves with feasting and drinking while unhappy wretches are receiving sentence of death  to this ball miss bragwell went dressed out with a double portion of finery pouring out on her own head the whole bandbox of feathers and flowers her sister had left behind her while she was at the ball her father formed many plans of religious reformation he talked of lessening his business that he might have more leisure for devotion though not just now while the markets were so high and then he began to think of sending a handsome subscription to the infirmary though on second thoughts he concluded he need not be in a hurry but leave it in his will but to give and repent and reform were three things he was bent upon but when his daughter came home at night so happy and so fine and telling how she had danced with squire squeeze the great corn contractor and how many fine things he had said to her mr bragwell felt the old spirit of the world return in its full force a marriage with mr dashall squeeze the contractor was beyond his hope for mr squeeze was supposed from a very low beginning to have got rich during the war as for mr squeeze he had picked up as much of the history of his partner between the dances as he desired he was convinced there would be no money wanting for miss bragwell who was now looked on as an only child must needs be a great fortune and he was too much used to advantageous contracts to let this slip as he was gaudily dressed and possessed all the arts of vulgar flattery miss bragwell eagerly caught at his proposal to wait on her father next day squeeze was quite a man after bragwells own heart a genius at getting money a fine dashing fellow at spending it he told his wife that this was the very sort of man for his daughter for he got money like a jew and spent it like a prince but whether it was fairly got or wisely spent he was too much a man of the world to inquire mrs bragwell was not so run away with by appearances but she desired her husband to be careful and quite sure that it was the right mr squeeze and no impostor but being assured that betsey would certainly keep her carriage she never gave herself one thought with what sort of man she was to ride in it to have one of her daughters drive in her own coach filled up all her ideas of human happiness the marriage was celebrated with great splendour and mr and mrs squeeze set off for london where they had a house  mr bragwell now tried to forget that he had any other daughter and if some thoughts of the resolutions he had made of entering on a more religious course would sometimes force themselves upon him they were put off like the repentance of felix to a more convenient season and finding he was likely to have a grandchild he became more worldly and ambitious than ever thinking this a just pretense for adding house to house and field to field and there is no stratagem by which men more deceive themselves than when they make even unborn children a pretense for that rapine or that hoarding of which their own covetousness is the true motive whenever he ventured to write to mr worthy about the wealth the gaiety and the grandeur of mr and mrs squeeze that faithful friend honestly reminded him of the vanity and uncertainty of worldly greatness and the error he had been guilty of in marrying his daughter before he had taken time to inquire into the real character of the man saying that he could not help foreboding that the happiness of a match made at a ball might have an end notwithstanding mr bragwell had paid down a larger fortune than was prudent for fear mr squeeze should fly off yet he was surprised to receive very soon a pressing letter from him desiring him to advance a considerable sum as he had the offer of an advantageous purchase which he must lose for want of money bragwell was staggered and refused to comply but his wife told him he must not be shabby to such a gentleman as squire squeeze for that she heard on all sides such accounts of their grandeur their feasts their carriages and their liveries that she and her husband ought even to deny themselves comforts to oblige such a generous son who did all this in honor of their daughter besides if he did not send the money soon they might be obliged to lay down their coach and then she should never be able to show her face again at length mr bragwell lent him the money on his bond he knew squeezes income was large for he had carefully enquired into this particular and for the rest he took his word mrs squeeze also got great presents from her mother by representing to her how expensively they were forced to live to keep up their credit and what honor she was conferring on the family of the bragwells by spending their money in such grand company among many other letters she wrote her the following   to mrs bragwell you cannot imagine dear mother how charmingly we live  i lie abed almost all day and am up all night but it is never dark for all that for we burn such numbers of candles all at once that the sun would be of no use at all in london  then i am so happy for we are never quiet a moment sundays or workingdays nay i should not know which was which only that we have most pleasure on a sunday because it is the only day in which people have nothing to do but divert themselves  then the great folks are all so kind and so good they have not a bit of pride for they will come and eat and drink and win my money just as if i was their equals and if i have got but a cold they are so very unhappy that they send to know how i do and though i suppose they cannot rest till the footman has told them yet they are so polite that if i have been dying they seem to have forgot it next time we meet and not to know but they have seen me the day before oh they are true friends and for ever smiling and so fond of one another that they like to meet and enjoy one anothers company by hundreds and always think the more the merrier  your dutiful daughter betsey squeeze   the style of her letters however altered in a few months she owned that though things went on gayer and grander than ever yet she hardly ever saw her husband except her house was full of company and cards or dancing was going on that he was often so busy he could not come all night that he always borrowed the money her mother sent her when he was going out on this nightly business and that the last time she had asked him for money he cursed and swore and bid her apply to the old farmer and his rib who were made of money this letter mrs bragwell concealed from her husband  at length on some change in public affairs mr squeeze who had made an overcharge of some thousand pounds in one article lost his contract he was found to owe a large debt to government and his accounts must be made up immediately this was impossible he had not only spent his large income without making any provision for his family but had contracted heavy debts by gaming and other vices his creditors poured in upon him he wrote to bragwell to borrow another sum but without hinting at the loss of his contract these repeated demands made bragwell so uneasy that instead offending him the money he resolved to go himself secretly to london and judge by his own eyes how things were going on as his mind strangely misgave him he got to mr squeezes house about eleven at night and knocked gently concluding that they must needs be gone to bed but what was his astonishment to find the hall was full of men he pushed through in spite of them though to his great surprise they insisted on knowing his name this affronted him he refused saying i am not ashamed of my name it will pass for thousands in any market in the west of england is this your london manners not to let a man of my credit in without knowing his name indeed what was his amazement to see every room as full of cardtables and of fine gentlemen and ladies as it would hold all was so light and so gay and so festive and so grand that he reproached himself for his suspicions thought nothing too good for them and resolved secretly to give squeeze another five hundred pounds to help to keep up so much grandeur and happiness at length seeing a footman he knew he asked him where were his master and mistress for he could not pick them out among the company or rather his ideas were so confused with the splendor of the scene that he did not know whether they were there or not the man said that his master had just sent for his lady up stairs and he believed that he was not well mr bragwell said he would go up himself and look for his daughter as he could not speak so freely to her before all that company he went up and knocked at the chamber door and its not being opened made him push it with some violence he heard a bustling noise within and again made a fruitless attempt to open the door at this the noise increased and mr bragwell was struck to the heart at the found of a pistol from within he now kicked so violently against the door that it burst open when the first sight he saw was his daughter falling to the ground in a fit and mr squeeze dying by a shot from a pistol which was dropping out of his hand mr bragwell was not the only person whom the found of the pistol had alarmed the servants the company all heard it and all ran up to this scene of horror those who had the best of the game took care to bring up their tricks in their hands having had the prudence to leave the very few who could be trusted to watch the stakes while those who had a prospect of losing profitted by the confusion and threw up their cards all was dismay and terror some ran for a surgeon others examined the dying man while some removed mrs squeeze to her bed while poor bragwell could neither see nor hear nor do any thing one of the company took up a letter which lay open upon the table addressed to him they read it hoping it might explain the horrid mystery it was as follows  to mr bragwell sir fetch home your daughter i have ruined her myself and the child to which she every hour expects to be a mother i have lost my contract my debts are immense you refuse me money i must die then but i will die like a man of spirit they wait to take me to prison i have two executions in my house but i have ten card tables in it i would die as i have lived i invited all this company and have drank hard since dinner to get primed for the dreadful deed my wife refuses to write to you for another thousand and she must take the consequences vanity has been my ruin it has caused all my crimes whoever is resolved to live beyond his income is liable to every sin he can never say to himself thus far shall thou go and no farther vanity led me to commit acts of rapine that i might live in splendour vanity makes me commit selfmurder because i will not live in poverty the new philosophy says that death is an eternal sleep but the new philosophy lies do you take heed it is too late for me the dreadful gulf yawns to swallow me  i plunge into perdition there is no repentance in the grave no hope in hell  yours dashall squeeze   the dead body was removed and mr bragwell remaining almost without speech or motion the company began to think of retiring much out of humor at having their party so disagreeably broken up they comforted themselves however that as it were so early for it was now scarcely twelve they could finish their evening at another party or two so completely do habits of pleasure as it is called harden the heart and steel it not only against virtuous impressions but against natural feelings now it was that those who had nightly rioted at the expense of those wretched people were the first to abuse them not an offer of assistance was made to this poor forlorn woman not a word of kindness or of pity nothing but censure was now heard why must those upstarts ape people of quality though as long as these upstarts could feast them their vulgarity and their bad character had never been produced against them as long as thou do well unto thyself men shall speak good of thee one guest who unluckily had no other house to go to coolly said as he walked off  squeeze might as well have put off shooting himself till the morning it was monstrous provoking that he could not wait an hour or two  as every thing in the house was seized mr bragwell prevailed on his miserable daughter weak as she was next morning to set out with him for the country his acquaintance with polite life was short but he had seen a great deal in a little time they had a slow and a sad journey in about a week mrs squeeze layin of a dead child she herself languished a few days and then died and the afflicted parents saw the two darling objects of their ambition for whose sakes they had made too much haste to be rich carried to the land where all things are forgotten mrs bragwells grief like her other passions was extravagant and poor bragwells sorrow was rendered so bitter by selfreproach that he would quite have sunk under it had he not thought of his old expedient in distress that of sending for mr worthy to comfort him it was mr worthys way to warn people of those misfortunes which he saw their faults must needs bring on them but not to reproach or desert them when the misfortunes came he had never been near bragwell during the short but flourishing reign of the squeezes for he knew that prosperity made the ears deaf and the heart hard to good counsel but as soon as he heard his friend was in trouble he set out to go to him bragwell burst into a violent fit of tears when he saw him and when he could speak said this trial is more than i can bear mr worthy kindly took him by the hand and when he was a little composed said i will tell you a short story there was in ancient times a famous man who was a slave his master who was very good to him one day gave him a bitter melon and bade him eat it he eat it up without one word of complaint how was it possible said the master for you to eat so very nauseous and disagreeable a fruit the slave replied my good master i have received so many favors from your bounty that it is no wonder if i should once in my life eat one bitter melon from your hands this generous answer so struck the master that the history says he gave him his liberty with such submissive sentiments my friend should man receive his portion of sufferings from god from whom he receives so many blessings you in particular have received much good at the hand of god shall you not receive evil also  o mr worthy said bragwell this blow is too heavy for me i cannot survive this shock i do not desire it i only desire to die we are very apt to talk most of dying when we are least fit for it said worthy this is not the language of that submission which makes us prepare for death but of that despair which makes us out of humor with life o mr bragwell you are indeed disappointed of the grand ends which made life so delightful to you but till your heart is humbled till you are brought to a serious conviction of sin till you are brought to see what is the true end of life you can have no hope in death you think you have no business on earth because those for whose sake you too eagerly heaped up riches are no more but is there not under the canopy of heaven some afflicted being whom you may yet relieve some modest merit which you may bring forward some helpless creature you may save by your advice some perishing christian you may sustain by your wealth when you have no sins of your own to repent of no mercies of god to be thankful for no miseries of others to relieve then and not till then i consent you should sink down in despair and call on death to relieve you  mr worthy attended his afflicted friend to the funeral of his unhappy daughter and her babe the solemn service the committing his late gay and beautiful daughter to darkness to worms and to corruption the sight of the dead infant for whose sake he had resumed ail his schemes of vanity and covetousness when he thought he had got the better of them the melancholy conviction that all human prosperity ends in in ashes to ashes and dust to dust had brought down mr bragwells self sufficient and haughty soul into something of that humble frame in which mr worthy had wished to see it as soon as they returned home he was beginning to seize the favorable moment for fixing these serious impressions when they were unseasonably interrupted by the parish officer who came to ask mr bragwell what he was to do with a poor dying woman who was traveling the country with her child and was taken in a fit under the churchyard wall at first they thought she was dead said the man but finding she still breathed they have carried her into the workhouse till she could give some account of herself mr bragwell was impatient at the interruption which was indeed unseasonable and told the man he was at that time too much overcome by sorrow to attend to business but he would give him an answer tomorrow but my friend said mr worthy the poor woman may die tonight your mind is indeed not in a frame for worldly business but there is no sorrow too great to forbid our attending the calls of duty an act of christian charity will not disturb but improve the seriousness of your spirit and though you cannot dry your own tears god may in great mercy permit you to dry those of another this may be one of those occasions for which i told you life was worth keeping do let us see this woman bragwell was not in a state either to content or refuse and his friend drew him to the workhouse about the door of which stood a crowd of people she is not dead said one she moves her head but she wants air said they all while they all according to custom pushed so close upon her that it was impossible she should get any a fine boy of two or three years old stood by her crying mammy is dead mammy is starved mr worthy made up to the poor woman holding his friend by the arm in order to give her air he untied a large black bonnet which hid her face when mr bragwell at that moment casting his eyes on her saw in this poor stranger the face of his own runaway daughter mrs incle he groaned but could not speak and as he was turning away to conceal his anguish the little boy fondly caught hold of his hand lisping out  o stay and give mammy some bread his heart yearned toward the child he grasped his little hand in his while he sorrowfully said to mr worthy it is too much send away the people it is my dear naughty child my punishment is greater than i can bear mr worthy desired the people to go and leave the stranger to them but by this time she was no stranger to any of them pale and meagre as was her face and poor and shabby as was her dress the proud and flaunting miss polly bragwell was easily known by every one present they went away but with the mean revenge of little minds they paid themselves by abuse for all the airs and insolence they had once endured from her pride must have a fall said one i remember when she was too good to speak to a poor body said another where are her flounces and her furbelows now it is come home to her at last her child looks as if he would be glad of the worst bit she formerly denied us  in the mean time mr bragwell had sunk in an old wicker chair which stood behind and groaned out lord forgive my hard heart lord subdue my proud heart create a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me this was perhaps the first word of genuine prayer he had ever offered up in his whole life worthy overheard it and his heart rejoiced but this was not a time for talking but doing he asked bragwell what was to be done with the unfortunate woman who now seemed to recover fast but she did not see them for they were behind she embraced her boy and faintly said my child what shall we do i will arise and go to my father and say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee this was a joyful sound to mr worthy who began to hope that her heart might be as much changed for the better as her circumstances were altered for the worse and he valued the goods of fortune so little and contrition of soul so much that he began to think the change on the whole might be a happy one the boy then sprung from his mother and ran to bragwell saying do be good to mammy mrs incle looking round now perceived her father she fell at his feet saying o forgive your guilty child and save your innocent one from starving bragwell sunk down by her and prayed god to forgive both her and himself in terms of genuine sorrow to hear words of real penitence and heartfelt prayer from this once highminded father and vain daughter was music to worthys ears who thought this moment of outward misery was the only joyful one he had ever spent in the bragwell family he was resolved not to interfere but to let the fathers own feelings work out the way in which he was to act bragwell said nothing but slowly led to his own house holding the little boy by the hand and pointing to worthy to assist the feeble steps of his daughter who once more entered her fathers doors but the dread of seeing her mother quite overpowered her mrs bragwells heart was not changed but sorrow had weakened her powers of resistance and she rather suffered her daughter to come in than gave her a kind reception she was more astonished than pleased and even in this trying moment was more disgusted with the little boys mean clothes than delighted with his rosy face as soon as she was a little recovered mr bragwell desired his daughter to tell him how she happened to be at that place just at that time  in a weak voice she began my tale sir is short but mournful  now i am very sorry that my readers must wait for this short but mournful tale till next month  part vii i left your house my dear father said mrs incle with a heart full of vain triumph i had no doubt but my husband was a great man who had put on that disguise to obtain my hand judge then what i felt to find that he was a needy impostor who wanted my money but did not care for me this discovery though it mortified did not humble me i had neither affection to bear with the man who had deceived me nor religion to improve by the disappointment i have found that change of circumstances does not change the heart till god is pleased to do it my misfortunes only taught me to rebel more against him i thought god unjust i accused my father i was envious of my sister i hated my husband but never once did i blame myself my husband picked up a wretched subsistence by joining himself to any low scheme of idle pleasure that was going on he would follow a mountebank carry a dicebox or fiddle at a fair he was always taunting me for that gentility on which i so much valued myself if i had married a poor working girl said he she could now have got her bread but a fine lady without money is a burden to her husband and a plague to society every trial which affection might have made lighter we doubled by animosity at length my husband was detected in using false dice he fought with his accuser both were seized by a pressgang and sent to sea i was now left to the wide world and miserable as i had thought myself before i soon found there were higher degrees of misery i was near my time without bread for myself or hope for my child i set out on foot in search of the village where i had heard my husband say his friends lived it was a severe trial to my proud heart to sloop to those low people but hunger is not delicate and i was near perishing my husbands parents received me kindly saying that though they had nothing but what they earned by their labor yet i was welcome to share their hard fare for they trusted that god who sent mouths would send meat also they gave me a small room in their cottage and many necessaries which they denied themselves  o my child interrupted bragwell every word cuts me to the heart these poor people gladly gave thee of their little while thy rich parents lest thee to starve  how shall i own continued mrs incle that all this goodness could not soften my heart for god had not yet touched it i received all their kindness as a favor done to them when my father brought me home any little dainty which he could pick up and my mother kindly dressed it for me i would not condescend to eat it with them but devoured it sullenly in my little garret alone suffering them to fetch and carry every thing i wanted as my haughty behavior was not likely to gain their affection it was plain they did not love me and as i had no notion that there were any other motives to good actions but fondness or selfinterest i was puzzled to know what could make them so kind to me for of the powerful and constraining law of christian charity i was quite ignorant to cheat the weary hours i looked about for some books and found among a few others of the same cast doddridges rise and progress of religion in the soul but all those books were addressed to sinners now as i knew i was not a sinner i threw them away in disgust indeed they were ill suited to a taste formed by novels to which reading i chiefly trace my ruin for vain as i was i should never have been guilty of so wild a step as to run away had not my heart been tainted and my imagination inflamed by those pernicious books  at length my little george was born this added to the burden i had brought on this poor family but it did not diminish their kindness and we continued to share their scanty fare without any upbraiding on their part or any gratitude on mine even this poor baby did not soften my heart i wept over him indeed day and night but they were tears of despair i was always idle and wasted those hours in sinful murmurs at his fate which i should have employed in trying to maintain him hardship grief and impatience at length brought on a fever death seemed now at hand and i felt a gloomy satisfaction in the thought of being rid of my miseries to which i fear was added a sullen joy to think that you sir and my mother would be plagued to hear of my death when it would be too late and in this your grief i anticipated a gloomy sort of revenge but it pleased my merciful god not to let me thus perish in my sins my poor motherinlaw sent for a good clergyman who pointed out to me the danger of dying in that hard and unconverted state so forcibly that i shuddered to find on what a dreadful precipice i stood he prayed with me and for me so earnestly that at length god who is sometimes pleased to magnify his own glory in awakening those who are dead in trespasses and sins was pleased of his free grace to open my blind eyes and soften my stony heart i saw myself a sinner and prayed to be delivered from the wrath of god in comparison of which the poverty and disgrace i now suffered appeared as nothing to a soul convinced of sin the news of a redeemer was a joyful found instead of reproaching providence or blaming my parents or abusing my husband i now learnt to condemn myself to adore that god who had not cut me off in my ignorance to pray for pardon for the past and grace for the time to come i now desired to submit to penury and hunger in this world so that i might but live in the fear of god here and enjoy his favor in the world to come i now learnt to compare my present light sufferings the consequence of my own sin with those bitter sufferings of my savior which he endured for my sake and i was ashamed of murmuring but selfignorance conceit and vanity were so rooted in me that my progress was very gradual and i had the sorrow to feel how much the power of long bad habits keeps down the growth of religion in the heart even after it has begun to take root i was so ignorant of divine things that i hardly knew words to frame a prayer but when i got acquainted with the psalms i there learnt how to pour out the fullness of my heart while in the gospel i rejoiced to see what great things god had done for my soul  i now took down once more from the shelf doctridges rise and progress and oh with what new eyes did i read it i now saw clearly that not only the thief and the drunkard the murderer and the adulterer are sinners for that i knew before but i found that the unbeliever the selfish the proud the worldlyminded all in short who live without god in the world are sinners i did not now apply the reproofs i met with to my husband or my father or other people as i used to do but brought them home to myself in this book i traced with strong emotions and close selfapplication the sinner through all his course his first awakening his convictions repentance joys sorrows backsliding and recovery despondency and delight to a triumphant deathbed and god was pleased to make it a chief instrument in bringing me to himself here it is continued mrs incle untying her little bundle and taking out a book accept it my dear father and i will pray that god may bless it to you as he has done to me  when i was able to come down i passed my time with these good old people and soon won their affection i was surprised to find they had very good sense which i never had thought poor people could have but indeed worldly persons do not know how much religion while it mends the heart enlightens the understanding also i now regretted the evenings i had wasted in my solitary garret when i might have passed them in reading the bible with these good folks this was their refreshing cordial after a weary day which sweetened the pains of want and age i one day expressed my surprise that my unfortunate husband the son of such pious parents should have turned out so ill the poor old man said with tears i fear we have been guilty of the sin of eli our love was of the wrong sort alas like him we honored our son more than god and god has smitten us for it we showed him what was right but through a false indulgence we did not correct him for what was wrong we were blind to his faults he was a handsome boy with sprightly parts we took too much delight in those outward things he soon got above our management and became vain idle and extravagant and when we sought to restrain him it was then too late we humbled ourselves before god but he was pleased to make our sin become its own punishment timothy grew worse and worse till he was forced to abscond for a misdemeanor after which we never saw him but have heard of him changing from one idle way of life to another unstable as water he has been a footman a soldier a shopman and a strolling after with deep sorrow we trace back his vices to our ungoverned fondness that lively and sharp wit by which he has been able to carry on such a variety of wild schemes might if we had used him to reproof in his youth have enabled him to have done great service for god and his country but our flattery made him wise in his own conceit and there is more hope of a fool than of him we indulged our own vanity and have destroyed his soul  here mr worthy stopped mrs incle saying that whenever he heard it lamented that the children of pious parents often turned out so ill he could not help thinking that there must be frequently something of this sort of error in the bringing them up he knew indeed some instances to the contrary in which the best means had failed but he believed that from eli the priest to incle the labourer more than half the failures of this sort might be traced to some mistake take or vanity or bad judgment or sinful indulgence in the parents  i now looked about continued mrs incle in order to see in what way i could assist my poor mother regretting more heartily than she did that i knew no one thing that was of any use i was so desirous of humbling myself before god and her that i offered even to try to wash  you wash exclaimed bragwell starting up with great emotion heaven forbid that with such a fortune and education miss bragwell should be seen at a washingtub this vain father who could bear to hear of her distresses and her sins could not bear to hear of her washing mr worthy stopped him saying as to her fortune you know you refused to give her any and as to her education you see it had not taught her how to do any thing better i am sorry you do not see in tins instance the beauty of christian humility for my own part i set a greater value on such an active proof of it than on a whole volume of professions mr bragwell did not quite understand this and mrs incle went on what to do to get a penny i knew not making of fillagree or fringe or cardpurses or cutting out paper or dancing and singing was of no use in our village the shopkeeper indeed would have taken me if i had known any thing of accounts and the clergyman could have got me a nurserymaids place if i could have done good plainwork i made some awkward attempts to learn to spin and knit when my mothers wheel or knitting lay by but i spoilt both through my ignorance at last i luckily thought upon the fine netting i used to make for my trimmings and it struck me that i might turn this to some little account i procured some twine and worked early and late to make nets for fishermen and cabbagenets i was so pleased that i had at last found an opportunity to show my good will by this mean work that i regretted my little george was not big enough to contribute his share to our support by traveling about to sell my nets  cabbagenets exclaimed bragwell there is no bearing this  cabbagenets my grandson hawk cabbagenets how could you think of such a scandalous thing  sir said mrs incle mildly i am now convinced that nothing is scandalous which is not wicked besides we were in want and necessity as well as piety would have reconciled me to this mean trade mr bragwell groaned and bade her go on  in the mean time my little george grew a fine boy and i adored the goodness of god who in the sweetness of maternal love had given me a reward for many sufferings instead of indulging a gloomy distrust about the fate of this child i now resigned him to the will of god instead of lamenting because he was not likely to be rich i was resolved to bring him up with such notions as might make him contented to be poor i thought if i could subdue all vanity and selfishness in him i should make him a happier man than if i had thousands to bestow on him and i trusted that i should be rewarded for every painful act of present selfdenial by the future virtue and happiness of my child can you believe it my dear father my days now past not unhappily i worked hard all day and that alone is a source of happiness beyond what the idle can guess after my child was asleep at night i read a chapter in the bible to my parents whose eyes now began to fail them we then thanked god over our frugal supper of potatoes and talked over the holy men of old the faints and the martyrs who would have thought our homely fare a luxury we compared our peace and liberty and safety with their bonds and imprisonment and tortures and should have been ashamed of a murmur we then joined in prayer in which my absent parents and my husband were never forgotten and went to rest in charity with the whole world and at peace in our own souls  oh my forgiving child interrupted mr bragwell sobbing and did thou really pray for thy unnatural father and lie down in rest and peace then let me tell thee thou wast better off than thy mother and i were  but no more of this go on  whether my fatherinlaw had worked beyond his strength in order to support me and my child i know not but he was taken dangerously ill while he lay in this state we received an account that my husband was dead in the west indies of the yellow fever which has carried off such numbers of our countrymen we all wept together and prayed that his awful death might quicken us in preparing for our own this shock joined to the fatigue of nursing her sick husband soon brought my poor mother to deaths door i nursed them both and felt a satisfaction in giving them all i had to bestow my attendance my tears and my prayers i who was once so nice and so proud so disdainful in the midst of plenty and so impatient under the smallest inconvenience was now enabled to glorify god by my activity and my submission though the sorrows of my heart were enlarged i cast my burden on him who cares for the weary and heavy laden after having watched by these poor people the whole night i sat down to breakfast on my dry crust and coarse dish of tea without a murmur my greatest grief was left i should bring away the infection to my dear boy i prayed to know what it was my duty to do between my dying parents and my helpless child to take care of the sick and aged seemed to be my duty so i offered up my child to him who is the father of the fatherless and he spared him to me  the cheerful piety with which these good people breathed their last proved to me that the temper of mind with which the pious poor commonly meet death is the grand compensation made them by providence for all the hardships of their inferior condition if they have had few joys and comforts in life already and have still fewer hopes in store is not all fully made up to them by their being enabled to leave this world with stronger desires of heaven and without those bitter regrets after the good things of this life which add to the dying tortures of the worldly rich to the forlorn and destitute death is not terrible as it is to him who sits at ease in his possessions and who fears that this night his soul shall be required of him  mr bragwell felt this remark more deeply than his daughter meant he should he wept and bade her proceed  i followed my departed parents to the same grave and wept over them but not as one who had no hope they had neither houses nor lands to leave me but they left me their bible their blessing and their example of which i humbly trust i shall feel the benefits when all the riches of this world shall have an end their few effects consisting of some poor household goods and some workingtools hardly sufficed to pay their funeral expenses i was soon attacked with the same fever and saw myself as i thought dying the second time my danger was the same but my views were changed i now saw eternity in a more awful light than i had done before when i wickedly thought death might be gloomily called upon as a refuge from every common trouble though i had still reason to be humbled on account of my sin yet through the grace of god i saw death shipped of his sting and robbed of his terrors through him who loved me and had given himself for me and in the extremity of pain my soul rejoiced in god my savior  i recovered however and was chiefly supported by the kind clergymans charity when i felt myself nourished and cheered by a little tea or broth which he daily sent me from his own slender provision my heart smote me to think how i had daily sat down at home to a plentiful dinner without any sense of thankfulness for my own abundance or without enquiring whether my poor sick neighbors were starving and i sorrowfully remembered that what my poor sister and i used to waste through daintiness would now have comfortably fed myself and child believe me my dear mother a laboring man who has been brought low by a fever might often be restored to his work some weeks sooner if on his recovery he was nourished and strengthened by a good bit from a farmers table less than is often thrown to a favorite spaniel would suffice so that the expense would be almost nothing to the giver while to the receiver it would bring health and strength and comfort  by the time i was tolerably recovered i was forced to leave the house i had no human prospect of subsistence i humbly asked of god to direct my steps and to give me entire obedience to his will i then cast my eyes mournfully on my child and though prayer had relieved my heart of a load which without it would have been intolerable my tears flowed fast while i cried out in the bitterness of my soul how many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger this text appeared a kind of answer to my prayer and gave me courage to make one more attempt to soften you in my favor i resolved to set out directly to find you to confess my disobedience and to beg a scanty pittance with which i and my child might be meanly supported in some distant country where we should not disgrace our more happy relations we set out and traveled as fast as my weak health and poor georges little feet and ragged shoes would permit i brought a little bundle of such work and necessaries as i had left by selling which we subsisted on the road  i hope interrupted bragwell there were no cabbagenets in it  at least said her mother i hope you did not sell them near home  no i had none left said mrs incle or i should have done it i got many a list in a wagon for my child and my bundle which was a great relief to me and here i cannot help saying i wish drivers would not be too hard in their demands if they help a poor sick traveller on a mile or two it proves a great relief to weary bodies and naked feet and such little cheap chanties may be considered as the cup of cold water which if given on right grounds shall not lose its reward here bragwell sighed to think that when mounted on his fine bay mare or driving his neat chaise it had never once crossed his mind that the poor wayworn foot traveller was not equally at his ease or that shoes were a necessary accommodation those who want nothing are apt to forget how many there are who want every thing  mrs incle went on i got to this village about seven this evening and while i sat on the churchyard wall to rest and meditate how i should make myself known at home i saw a funeral i enquired whose it was and learnt it was my sisters this was too much for me i sunk down in a fit and knew nothing that happened to me from that moment till i found myself in the workhouse with my father and mr worthy  here mrs incle stopped grief shame pride and remorse had quite overcome mr bragwell he wept like a child and said he hoped his daughter would pray for him for that he was not in a condition to pray for himself though he found nothing else could give him any comfort his deep dejection brought on a fit of sickness o said he i now begin to feel an expression in the sacrament which i used to repeat without thinking it had any meaning the remembrance of my sins is grievous the burden of them is intolerable o it is awful to think what a sinner a man may be and yet retain a decent character how many thousands are in my condition taking to themselves all the credit of their prosperity instead of giving god the glory heaping up riches to their hurt instead of dealing their bread to the hungry o let those who hear of the bragwell family never say that vanity is a little sin in me it has been the fruitful parent of a thousand sins selfishness hardness of heart forgetfulness of god in one of my sons vanity was the cause of rapine injustice extravagance ruin selfmurder both my daughters were undone by vanity though it only wore the more harmless shape of dress idleness and dissipation the husband of my daughter incle it destroyed by leading him to live above his station and to despise labor vanity ensnared the souls even of his pious parents for while it led them to wish to see their son in a better condition it led them to allow him such indulgences as were unfit for his own o you who hear of us humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god resist high thoughts let every imagination be brought into obedience to the son of god if you set a value on finery look into that grave behold the mouldering body of my betsy who now says to corruption thou art my father and to the worm thou art my mother and my sister look at the bloody and brainless head of her husband o mr worthy how does providence mock at human foresight i have been greedy of gain that the son of mr squeeze might be a great man he is dead while the child of timothy incle whom i had doomed to beggary will be my heir mr worthy to you i commit this boys education teach him to value his immortal soul more and the good things of this life less than i have done bring him up in the fear of god and in the government of his passions teach him that unbelief and pride are at the root of all sin i have found this to my cost i trusted in my riches i said tomorrow shall be as this day and more abundant i did not remember that for all these things god would bring me to judgment i am not sure that i believed in a judgment  bragwell at length grew better but he never recovered his spirits the conduit of mrs incle through life was that of an humble christian she sold all her sisters finery which her father had given her and gave the money to the poor saying it did not become one who professd penitence to return to the gaieties of life mr bragwell did not oppose this not that he had fully acquired a just notion of the selfdenying spirit of religion but having a head not very clear at making distinctions he was never able after the sight of squeezes mangled body to think of gaiety and grandeur without thinking at the same time of a pistol and bloody brains for as his first introduction into gay life had presented him with all these objects at one view he never afterward could separate them in his mind he even kept his fine beauset of plate aways shut because it brought to his mind the grand unpaidfor sideboard that he had seen laid out for mr squeezes supper to the remembrance of which he could not help tacking debts prisons executions and selfmurder  mr bragwells heart had been so buried in the love of the world and evil habits were become so rooted in him that the progress he made in religion was very slow yet he earnestly prayed and struggled against vanity and when his unfeeling wife declared she could not love the boy unless he was called by their name instead of incle mr bragwell would never consent saying he stood in need of every help against pride he also got the letter which squeeze wrote just before he shot himself framed and glazed this he hung up in his chamber and made it a rule to go and read it as often as he found his heart disposed to vanity
