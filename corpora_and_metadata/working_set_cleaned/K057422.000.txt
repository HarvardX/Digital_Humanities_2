soft the sublime and the graceful combined to young who can each different passion impart who pleases the judgment but conquers the heart and guided by nature is followed by art prologue to fashionable levities written by mr chalmers spoken by mr wroughton in shakespeares days we only played the fool and men of fashion gave  not took  the rule then lords were grave and ladies graver still and only we and clowns had wit at will his mind rejected former classic lore and drew from natures neverending store but authors now  we often prove the fact must fashion court to teach us how to act expose the follies which our statutes spare and unprotected virtue make their care all nature now is custom  custom law and here we bring  not what we think  but saw it is hard to vary your dramatic mirth when every folly gives it likeness birth which though in life your laugh they may command will rather pall than please at second hand it is harder still to suit the general mind and all our audience in our interest bind honest john bull vexed with the cares of life with heavy taxes and a scolding wife wishes some hours in hearing us to waste and galloping dreary dun is quite his

 damme there is nothing in a play like smut the politicians allcommanding pate would have us dramatize the affairs of state make whigs and tories fight here face to face and teach the patriots unity

lady frigid  i see you have said she pointing to you and my lord  then as she puckered up her mouth in an affected smile down fell a few flakes of paint and her skin appeared under the fractures like old brick work peeping through the new invented composition   cheat her countenance was once tolerable but a long run of ill luck has stamped that irrisible discordancy of hill and dale which marks her visage and prevents the smiles of fortune joy or good humor from unbending her to a laugh or the smallest semblage of the amiable  hums a tune there is a small matter between us for which i have a very pressing occasion   lady flip aside i expected this ha ha ha i cannot but laugh at your description of lady frigid   cheat for heavens sake say no more of her  but let me have the money bows

dice your most intimate connections jockies grooms gamecocks and racehorses i am surprised you could look up to her   cheat my fortune and family entitle me to look up to any woman   lady flip then it must be merely to look up you are no doubt one of fortunes favorites and her favors follow you  you have large estates in expectancy and considerable rents in bath wells scarborough southampton and margate nay more you have as many agents as the first landed gentleman in the country   cheat i dont understand this treatment   la flip your connexions manners and conversation would be perfectly agreeable to constances turn of mind  her respect for religion her morality philosophy and knowledge of the belles lettres would exactly coincide with your studies in the arts and sciences of play   cheat arts and sciences of play    la flip i insinuate nothing injurious to your profession the respect which professors of play receive in preference to all other professors proves it a profession the most lberal as well as most profitable ironically   cheat she will never forgive the insult of preferring another woman to herself aside your tradesmens bills madam are unpaid your ladyships mercer and milliner  and people of that class are so importunate and rude  i do not solicit you to take an active part in my favor only promise not to be an enemy and the debt of honor is cancelled   lady flip you say the debt of honor shall be cancelled are you aware that constance has bestowed her favors on young de courcy of york   cheat yes and that his passion for play was cooled at the last york races which obliged him to take a trip to france for the recovery of his finances   lady flip and his losses she imputes to a conspiracy between you and those friends of yours who were the ostensible winners and to whom you introduced him  i sear you have no chance   cheat chance  leave me to that  i have often won with the odds against me then she is a beggar but my passion is disinterested   lady flip and pray now how much of the uncles debt of honor is to be paid by this parental kindness to the niece  i see into the scheme  and here comes the unfortunate sacrifice   enter constance con i understand your ladyship desired to speak with me   lady flip to inform you my dear of some engagements but particular business calls me away for a few minutes so i leave you to entertain mr cheaterly exit lady flippant   cheat aside her modest blush puts even my impudence out of countenance  your solicitude madam to avoid me so strongly indicates apathy to my addresses i almost dread the possibility of convincing you i am sincere  do not turn from me in scorn i may have some claim upon your gratitude though no interest in your heart   con gratitude oh your absence sir i must insist on i will not in future be persecuted by your presumption   cheat i acknowledge my weakness in pursuing the impulse of my passion reason checks me but such is the imperious violence of my affection that even your scorn increases my desires by making you lovely in the midst of anger and the blessing i sigh for appears still more valuable more worthy pursuit from the distant prospect you give me of the possession   con prospect sir   cheat yes madam prospect   con you will be pleased sir to withdraw  walks disconcerted you are insolent   cheat insolent a hard word madam to a man who prefers you to every other woman  i may be bold madam but    con i repeat it you are insolent   walks from him cheat i am calm madam i know the impediment to my happiness young lady and have spirit to remove it  insolent ha you prefer a clandestine correspondence with a bankrupt in fame and fortune to the generous addresses of a man honored with your uncles approbation and independent of the world   con the engagements of my heart  but i will not weep  wiping her eyes  sir  you have with a base and mean cowardice dared to traduce a generous unsuspecting youth whose fortune you have assisted to ruin but whose honor you can never taint  a youth who if present you would not dare to look on withouttrembling going   enter sir buzzard savage sir buz what is the matter now   con enquire of that gentleman sir   sir buz what a life i lead my mind kept in a continual fever you and your aunt are a perpetual ague to me  her hot fits of levity and your cool fits of prudery operate alternately and i am tortured by you from morning till night   con i must tell you sir that since your house cannot afford me protection i shall leave it and though destitute of fortune i know where to apply for an asylum ex constance   sir buz i know where to apply for an asylum  she cannot have a knowledge of our secret or i would suppose she meant the chancery a man must now pay as much attention to his ward as if she was his child   cheat true and what adds to the grievance if a young fellow marries an heiress he is obliged to settle her fortune on herself though perhaps her person was a secondary object  i shall never succeed here sir buzzard   sir buz pish why not succeed a hundred to one but all she has said is pretense  you know nothing of womens subtilty they smile they frown they laugh they weep they move but to deceive us and lay a snare in every article of their dress   cheat de courcy is the object of her choice   sir buz why afraid of de courcy his friends at york races plucked the poor devil of a pigeon so bare they scarcely left him feathers to fly into france   cheat i was present  may i depend on your assistance   sir buz is not our bargain concluded  on the day of your marriage with my niece you return me my mortgages the bill of sale upon my horses and an acquittance of all demands   cheat depend upon it  i have pledged my honor  assist me and i will pursue my game though she keeps me at bay every step   sir buz cheaterly i must look about me i came down here for the recovery of my health and am suffering under a precipitate consumption of my purse do you think the young clergyman plays fair   cheat you mean parson spruce could you suspect a divine   sir buz why yes i do suspect your divines in their own hair and boots many of them i believe have thrown off morality with their wigs and kicked away religion with their shoes   cheat but dr spruce has three hundred a year in the church  he won a cool fifty from me   sir buz a fifty i lost more to him than would purchase four years of his income   cheat do you want cash i can lend you a hundred here gives him a note with friends money should be a common commodity   sir buz why i lost this note to parson spruce last night  he gave me a fifty and took it   cheat aye oh i had it from him he gave it to me for a bill on london   sir buz here comes colonel staff and old ordeal yoked together very naturally as two asses should be  i despise them both the colonel never served abroad yet he prates as bold as if he had experienced half a dozen foreign campaigns   cheat and is poor and proud   sir buz yes but hopes to mend his fortune by marrying my sister i wish him success that they may mutually torment each other   cheat mark ordeal he is not a less extraordinary character than the colonel the fellow was a foundling and never knew his parents but having acquired a fortune by trade impudently insults his betters by preaching what he calls generosity   sir buz o confound his generosity he is always setting a bad example with his charities relieving widows providing for orphans and portioning off young maidens though ignorant as a hottentot he has got himself ranked among the literati and sets up for a philosopher  the fellow has come into life through as many shapes as an orkney barnacle he was first a block then a worm and is now a goose   enter colonel staff and mr ordeal col ha ha ha i have been accusing ordeal of avarice and he denies the charge   ord i do avarice though too often an attendant on age is a vice foreign to my nature no man can accuse me of accumulating money by unjust means or of hoarding it when in my possession whereas avarice is a dropsy of the mind  a disease that irritates and increases by the means used to assuage its thirst   col have you not refused to lend me a mere trifle and being rich is not that a proof of avarice   ord hear me  i consider myself an agent bound to answer for the distribution of that wealth with which heaven has blessed my industry  the charge of avarice is more applicable to the spendthrift than the prudent the spendthrift grasps at every mans property yet no man is accounted avaricious who conforms to the custom of dissipation though the spendthrift raises his rents and starves his tenantry  borrows money and ruins his friend or runs in debt and makes bankrupts of his tradesmen if he drives a carriage  keeps a train of servants plays drinks and plunges into vice the world will call him a damned generous fellow  i speak my mind  that is my way   sir buz well colonel how goes on your affair with my fantastical sister she is a jilt colonel  i hate a jilt   col she will soon surrender i have got possession of the counterscarp and shall shortly set up the standard of matrimony upon the crown of the    sir buz horn work  eh   cheat the widow has a considerable share of the toujours gai in her composition   sir buz too much to promise constancy but then you old bachelors have such winning ways  but colonel keep a sentinel on my sister  time and possession are two dangerous pioneers the first moulders the cement by degrees and the other saps the foundation   cheat then the widow is so frank degage and good natured she may grant favors from charity and sensibility which other women would refuse from principle or the prejudice of education   ord what mr cheaterly has advanced contains profound gravity of judgment but my clary shall have no modern education i have engaged a master to teach her the classics to manure the soil by cultivating the seeds of virtue  yes i will have clary cultivated for she is innocence itself free from the bias of example she is guided only by the impulse of pure nature   cheat a young lady could not have a more dangerous preceptor the impulse of pure nature will produce every evil that can arise from the politest education   ord i am convinced she is delicate as the ermine which would die to preserve the snowy whiteness of its fur   col well said my old friend amorous as may though gray as december   ord gray nay let me tell you colonel though snow has fallen upon the mountain there is sunshine in the valley  clara is an aurora borealis a blaze in the regions of frigidity   sir buz ordeal seriously now are you going to marry this ward of yours for love   ord seriously i love the girl as i love my life but if i did not having no relations nor friends to whom i owe any obligation i am determined to make her my heir   sir buz and no doubt she will bring you an heir in return and then bury you   ord bury me  granted when i sleep peaceable under the green turf let her marry some honest young fellow and their children shall bear my name   cheat a good way this to raise a family without trouble   ord family i understand your sneer i was a foundling it is true and cannot boast ancestry yet i have a heart susceptible of the tender feelings and sweet solicitudes of humanity though i cannot claim relations of particular descriptions i know adam and eve were our primitive parents therefore consider the world one common family and hold myself bound to all mankind by ties of fraternal love   sir buz and your family kindness is not confined to your brothers but extends to your sisters too   ord claras father was my friend we served our apprenticeship together set up in the same branch of trade he failed and died poor but i prospered  he was a worthy soul and i never speak of him without tears weeps   cheat ah very good sir buzzard because the father was his juvenile friend he would marry the daughter in his old age   sir buz a pretty excuse for a vicious appetite   col hear hear   ord claras father when on his deathbed bequeathed her to me as a legacy it was a bequest of confidence and i esteem it more than if it had been a million he bequeathed her to me an infant without a mother without relations without friends without fortune  now though rich in the liberal gifts of nature who has endowed her with an exuberant hand yet being poor in worldly substance she has but few attractions for a husband the knight errants of these days are argonauts  this is the golden age and every thing is bought and sold   sir buz spoke in the true spirit of commerce my old merchant   ord let me tell you sir knight the spirit of commerce is the best spirit in the nation we merchants live by barter and sale it is true but take this with you sir probity is our principle and our character nice as a ladys   sir buz here comes my moiety of mortality  here comes the origin of two thirds of my complaints with my widowed sister the colonels tormentor that is to be  see they smile at some mischief in embryo  ah candied ginger sugar on the outside fire within sweet on the palate biting on the tongue ordeal keep a strict eye upon pure nature the aloe is most bitter when green going   cheat nay stay sir buzzard   sir buz stay and my wife coming excuse me i avoid her as i would an epidemic complaint

her mrs ordeal  you rear her quite a domestic animal she is never seen abroad   lady flip nor at home sister not even at the windows   cheat he fears the sun would spoil her complexion   ord she has indeed a lovely complexion glowing and bright as the tyrian dye not a modern local blush that hides shame instead of discovering it but ruddy health moving in varied tints  the lily and the rose vying for preeminence on her cheek  o she is pure nature   wid but when introduced to life those roses will blow those lilies will fade   ord she shall never get into any life but where they may blow and fade naturally  her real face shall never be concealed under a counterfeit some ladies coin complexions and should be punished for high treason in defacing beauty   cheat bravo old ordeal bravo   ord i reprobate imposition of charms a reverend bishop declared to me he was married two years before he saw his wifes face and that was by accident   lady flip i am astonished a gentleman of your age can be so scandalous so malicious but it is the nature of wasps to retain their buz after they have lost their sting   wid our gaiety provokes their spleen these ancient gentlemen rail at women for speaking scandal yet resort in groupes to every place of public entertainment oglng with their telescope eyes to discover blemishes on beautiful objects  now here is a piece of antiquity   turning

a bird of omen yes a cuckoo is a very ominous bird  pray colonel is the widow skilled in augury   col damn your cuckoo but your speaking of augury reminds me of a circumstance at the siege of prague
