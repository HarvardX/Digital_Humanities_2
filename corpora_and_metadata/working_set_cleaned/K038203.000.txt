and malepractice of physic in great britain were at first intended to appear in another dress and by way of appeal to our neighboring nations where that noble and necessary art is said to be exercised in a more regular and beneficial manner for bystanders who are not heated by animosities and personal reflections who are not interested in a debate and have no partyquarrel to maintain are the fittest persons to examine and determine the reasonableness of the cause and as their passions are calmer and more moderate so their decisions are likely to be more just and equal and agreeable to truth than the sentiments of those people who are more nearly concerned but when i considered that all national grievances and certainly the abuse of this excellent faculty is a very great one ought rather to be corrected at home than exposed abroad that the mismanagement and dishonesty of many should not procure the condemnation of all and offenders only should suffer and that they too could not be legally restrained and punished but by the legislative powers i had thoughts of addressing them to a worthy patriot who might in parliament have procured a redress of as many of them at least as the wisdom of the nation might think worth their cognizance yet considering how far that august assembly is embarrassd and engaged in the more arduous and difficult affairs of the nation and likewise the temper and taste of my intended patron the one so exquisite and distinguishing that scarce a word could drop from the pen without the terror of reprehension and the other so moderated that had i attempted to make way for a favorable reception by the common method in dedications reciting but few of his real accomplishments it would scarce have been looked upon as a just encomium i resolved at length therefore to adventure into a censorious world these rude papers containing little else but matters of fact as naked truths without any vmbrage or defense and think these difficulties presenting the giving my reasons for making no dedication is dedication enough for in all disquisitions about truth it is not the greatness the authority and weight of the advocate but of his arguments and proofs that is the point to be minded and the more plain and unadorned his discourse is the greater air of veracity it has for which reason i shall no more be at the pains to make any apology for the loose composition and careless diction of this pamphlet than i shall think my self obliged to answer the unreasonable cavils and loud clamours that may be raised by selfinterested and dishonest men against it reasons of this work  st thinking that i shall have sufficiently discharged my conscience in detecting their dishonesty and that it is not in their power to say much in their own vindication without exposing more of their own disingenuity and baseness to the judicious especially and discerning part of mankind neither shall i think it any reflection that others have offered the same things in a better manner but rather as a confirmation of what i say that makes what i here deliver appear with the greater force of evidence  though it must be acknowledged that matters go not so well with the world as that most voices should be on the best side and such persons as are slaves to their lusts indolent ignorant and credulous take up with the opinions and ways in fashion without much examination and thus are easily led on to their own disadvantage and sometimes destruction by men of corrupt minds whose sole advantage lies in cheat and imposition and who of consequence have also a burning hatred to plain open and fair dealing and to the truth and from whom her strictest followers must expect to meet with the severest usage the truths even of the holy gospel have generally been on the suffering side and when i see those promulged for the salvation of souls have met with such bad treatment how can i expect that these of less importance calculated only for the safety of the body should find a more gracious reception  but if i am guilty of any breach of good manners in meddling with other mens morals means of living and interests i am sorry for it and if in my enquiries i have been any way imposed upon and led into mistakes or have been too impertinent and tedious too clamorous and severe i humbly beg pardon and submit to the correction of my legal superiors assuring them that i speak no falsehoods to the best of my understanding and knowledge and as i had no pleasure in finding out so i have no profit in publishing the following disorders which indeed have  d of long time been no secrets to multitudes of suffering people who have hitherto complained in vain and groan under unsufferable oppressions that they would gladly get rid of if they knew where or how they could be relieved and which have been discovered by many worthy physicians  d but then they have touched these sores too tenderly either fearing too much the resentment of those people who would not have them healed or finding it a difficulty to set men right who go wrong out of choice and interest surmounting all their endeavors and that i have no ends in giving myself and others this trouble but what are just and honest and designed sincerely for the common good and welfare of mankind  and as true honesty that is  th integrity of heart and life is the first the chief and fundamental point of true wisdom so it is likewise when applied to our occupations and professions trade and commerce the only sure basis thereof the most preferable thing and to be regarded above gain on the contrary as all unaccountable ways of livelihood all extortion and unreasonable profit are certainly dishonest so more especially when the life and health as well as the estate of our neighbor is endangered thereby they become obnoxious and ought to be condemned and rejected as intolerable and as says a grave and learned et si ad honestatem nati sumus ea aut sola expetenda est aut certe omni pondere gravior est habenda tull author there are just reasons why men that are notorious for any vice or crime should be exposed and represented as they deserve not only to prevent others from falling into their hands and suffering by their wickedness but that they may undergo that shame and reproach which ever must be the portion of ill men  to pretend to put a stop to male practice in physic is a bold undertaking and notwithstanding it may for these reasons appear very necessary and commendable to some yet as it may be thought by a prevailing majority to proceed rather from spite or disgust than discretion it may chance to ruin him that will he so hardy as to attempt it  but since i am induced to lay open the faults and frauds of it  th for the sake of justice and charity itself let the event be what it will i resolve to persevere in this honest disquisition though i gain nothing thereby but that peace of mind that proceeds necessarily from the reflection that i have done my duty  the most innocent as well as the most serviceable and best parts of a mans life are frequently misunderstood and highly censured yet because i know my intentions are founded upon a good bottom i may still hope that they will discover themselves and be justified by all in the conclusion being satisfied that what i shall deliver has truth on its side so far as i am able to come at the knowledge thereof which is the best patron and under that protection i leave it  the ill state of physic in great britain sect i objections answered having gone thus far by way of preface i still find that i am obliged to remove an objection or two that lie against myself before i proceed far in those that i shall offer against the men that abuse this noble science and likewise to premise something of the difficulty to attain a competent knowledge in it there are some inquisitive people who will needs know how i came by these dismal illnatured accounts of the maladministration of physic to whom i reply dearbought experience the most faithful informer has for the most part though i must acknowledge some things are taken upon trust and narrative but then of such persons whose insight and veracity i esteemed altogether equal to my own knowledge has i say led me into these sad secrets for being a piece of a physician myself who have had a liberal education in one of our own celebrated universities and performed though perfunctorily i must confess with compunction all the exercises there required to be done for the last degree that a student can be honored with in that academy who have spent some years in the wholesale apothecaries shops in london where i had an opportunity of examining into their adulterate and deadly compositions of seeing too many of their unfaithful dispensations and have been a practitioner of above twenty years standing for some time in the country but for the major part in this grand metropolis and consequently could not well avoid being not only ear but more frequently an eyewitness of those horrid practices as one ingenuous and faithful apothecary who could hardly ever be prevailed upon to leave his proper business in his shop to intrude into the sick chambers was used to call them that introduce such vast swarms of impudent empiricks into credit with the unthinking multitude and unwary people and discourage and disgrace the true physicians as well as deprive them of their just rights and lawful emoluments  and here i need not descend to particulars this whole discourse being intende against these ignorant pretenders to this learned art in general some of their disqualifications will necessarily occur in every paragraph but for show of some method i chus to speak to the formalist in the first place the formalist condemned and it is easy to demonstrate that he who is merely such and that takes all for granted that he finds recommended to him by authors nemo ex libris evasit artifex and practices by their schemes and can use no other than their prescriptions will never make any thing on it never be a good and honest physician to what errors do men expose themselves through prejudice and to how many more through a blind submission to a reputed authority does not every days experience convince us that the same remedy applied to the same disease may be successful in some constitutions and fatal in others illud ignorari non opertet quod non minibus aegris eadem auxilia convenient non omnibus etiam in similibus casibus optulantur cells  this deserves to be insisted on more at large in our present subject which as i i doubt it will not prove very entertaining i shall endeavor to contract into as narrow a compass as may be  such practicers then it is to be suspected are more frequently obliged to bring the symptoms of diseases to their receipts than accommodate their receipts to the diseases such a medicinemonger qui medicinam ab usu tantum and experimentis novit and tractat non ex causis naturalibus who fetches his skill therein not from natural causes but from his own injudicious use of it and bold experiments is justly called by the learned celsus an empiric those who are not really masters of this science but practice barely upon receipts and those that have obtained only notions from books or imagination instead of a true and accurate information of the laws of the animal economy will ever be perplexed in the mists of fancy and be much more likely to do hurt than good by putting nature out of her way by the force of ignorance such men have little regard to the caution medici est cio tuto and jocunde curare given by asclepiades that it is the duty of a physician not only to cure as soon as may be but to take care that his medicines are safe as well as palatable nor to the admonition of hippocrates that the physician be perpetually upon his guard exert his utmost skill and endeavors to do good and take care that by his wrong administration nothing of harm befall his patient it is better to wait to observe and give nothing where there is cause to doubt than venture to give what may prove wrong and it were to be wished there was not by the great numbers of medicines flung in at random perhaps to please or to amuse not to mention some less honorable ends more destruction made than by distempers themselves  honesty ought to be the only basis and rule of the art of physic and if any faculty is so far imperfect in or so much corrupted by those that practice it that a man must be forced to play little tricks and to make wonderful pretenses to those things that are not and to what he is utterly ignorant of to support his credit in his calling and must cheat other people not only of their money but sometimes of their lives too that he may get himself a livelihood certainly that art and the followers of it ought to be banished from amongst men to be suppressed as a cheat and imposture for the good of mankind and honest gain is the only bottom as i have before observed upon which every trade and science is set on foot and he who cannot live honestly that is give a just and satisfactory account how he lives should not be suffered to live prevertunt homines ea quae sunt fundamenta natureae cum utilitatem ab honestate sejungunt pretio aut mercede ducuntur  quae sordidissima quidem est ratio and iis qui ca tenentur and illis qui ad eam confugere conantur tul when men dissever profit from honesty they subvert the foundations of the laws of nature and break all the bands of society and public credit tully calls this a most sordid and corrupt way of living etc when our profession recedes from this rule and open fair maxims when it must be carried on by frauds and gross ignorance must be varnished over with pretenses to rare secrets nostrums philosophical preparations etc then we ought presently to suspect and avoid those that would cheat us of the most dear thing to us in this life our health without being able to give any other account of their process than what is wrapped up in such unintelligible cant and jargon twas long ago the complaint of hippocrates that because such pass with those that distinguish no better for physicians on account of their want of real accomplishments the art that is of all others most excellent is brought into disesteem and neglect but yet such we see commonly are the most tenacious and secure in their own ways and as the great celsus says of such verba supecresse desse medendi scientiam how defective soever they may be as to their real knowledge they are usually the most talkative and ostentatious and take all occasions to decry others of more knowledge and sincerity being as unwilling to introduce reason into physic as some are to admit it into religion  it is difficult for an honest physician live it is a needless as well as a too tedious task to recite all that has been offered on this head by conscientions physicians in im their own vindication and in order to detect such impudent impostors and it is a lamentable observation that a physician now adays who has been regularly educated in one of our famous universities and has given reasonable and legal tests of his qualification has after all his way to make through a vast crowd and superior numbers who have no other support but superficial pretenses backed by consummate assurance and all the insinuating arts of imposition received greedily by an unthinking people the honest and truly instructed sons of aesculapius need not have recourse to such subterfuges they can it is to be hoped give a rationale of their practice  but the more i consider these things the more i admire how an apothecary can commence physician from the doctors bills that hang upon his file yet this prating monster is produced every day not only in the country towns but the greatest cities and places of wealth and concourse and with impunity and most impudently jostles out of place the modest physician assuming this ostentatious motto opiferque per orbem dicor for which presumption he deserves the fate of python from the hand of apollo as if a slight knowledge as a learned gentleman observes gathered from a few modern systems or by consulting dispensatories and perusing their musty files or spending some time in hospitals would sufficiently qualify a man to sit upon life and death whereas no mans own experience is sufficient to make him a master of the art of physic he must take in also the experience of former ages as well as his own i dont see says the above quoted author how any honest man can satisfy himself with a little superficial inspection into our present modes of practice and neglect the ancient and best writers in our profession  it is difficult to attain to the art of healing to be a good physician though it is one of the greatest difficulties to find out proper and certain methods of cure and this difficulty that attends the attainment of a competent knowledge in the art of healing is surely sufficient to deter any considering and just man from invading the offices of it without regular and cautious instructions therein with what abundant application with what conscientious circumspection and preparation of mind should we set about the duties of this sacred art when we hear what the great and judicious celsus pronounces of the uncertainty of its rules and trecepts medicina vix ulla perpetua praecepta recipit etc  no  must pass amongst physicians there is no infallibility in our science it is sufficient for us to know properties not textures to know the peculiar attributes and not the essence of things god reserves these secrets to himself and leaves us room to admire it is enough for us to know the properties of bodies without knowing the causes of those properties though we may search into the causes without offense yet we rarely do it to our satisfaction  do we satisfy our selves when we pretend to reason upon many phenomenon occuring in natural philosophy which agrees that qualities or properties whether universal particular or occult may be discovered though their way of operating cannot be explained by us and there are certain textures in bodies we are absolutely ignorant of whose qualities however we are well acquainted with to instance those of the loadstone mercury opium and that unparalled specific  and the discovery of it was sent from heaven remedy as it is deservedly called the peruvian bark etc who can account for the attractive virtue of the magnet for the flux or tides of the sea who can tell the use and nature of the stars any more than he can tell the number of them who can explain how the accretion and auction of plants and animals are performed who can find all the tubes and liquors moving in them that compose an human body and who can tell how the animal and rational soul are united it must be confessed we know no farther of the union between soul and body than that if there be an harmonious proportion between the fluids and solids our senses are vigorous but are disturbed where they fall short of or exceed the natural constitution as most if not all the former of these things are beyond the knowledge of the physcian so the union of the soul and body is a secret the wisest and most devout divine does not pretend to penetrate nor to explain the difficulties that attend it but that the body has an influence upon the soul and the notices and conceptions of the understanding have a tincture from the matter of which the body is formed is manifest i must declare says a very great man that i do not find it possible for any person to give such an exact and satisfactory account as might be wished for either of the make or constitution of our bodies or of the disposition and relation of the inward parts or of the instruments of nature for the preservation of the individual or species or of the diseases they are subject to or of the most proper methods of cure the more a man searches into the mechanical attempts of this kind the more unsatisfied he will find himself about them and will find reason to conclude that we may know enough for our general direction what to do but that the secret causes are so hidden from us as we have reason to admire the supreme artificer in what we know and to adore him in what we do not know in short we know many times that such a thing will have such an effect or perhaps that such an effect is produced by such a cause but the manner how we know not or but grossly and if such an hypothesis be true it is impossible for us to come at the true principles of things or to see into the economy of the finest parts of nature and workings of the first springs the internal constitution of most things the subtilest parts of matter are hid from us and our philosophy dwells only in the surface of nature and here i must say as st augustine once did of purgatory ego certe usquead hoc tempus cum inde sategerem ad eorum indaginem pervenire non potui i could never notwithstanding great study attain to the perfect knowledge of these things hence we may rightly infer how dubious our art is  and i wish we could cure with a few and those simple medicines only a cup of cold water rightly applied and i should esteem myself worth some notice if i could establs but a few certainties in my profession for the good of mankind though i became poor for my pains in the discovery and this ought to be the aim of every conscientious physician who rightly considers the modern methods of practice and that one of the greates uncertainties and difficulties that he mee with is how to be secure that what he orders for the sick shall be truly prepared for though he prescribe never so delicate and pertinent a medicine yet he will find it is in the apothecaries power to use one thing for another vid sect    and they are very dextrous at finding out succedaneums and he never the wiser till he has purchased his knowledge and experience with the loss of his patient or certainly of his own reputation  sect ii the qualifications of a physician having given these hints of the difficulties that attend the study of physic and that disqualify many who presume to intrude themselves into the practice of it it may not be altogether impertinent to delineate a true physician to show what amongst all these uncertainties is absolutely necessary for him certainly to know and what must be his real qualifications and accomplishments and though i have insinuated how dark and uncertain all physical knowledge is that the professors thereof oftentimes lose themselves and wander they know not where they seek the depth of natural causes the change of the elements the impressions of the air the motions of the celestial bodies of the planets and their proportions and influences they search the mines in the bowels of the earth and dive into the bottom of the sea they dissect the body of man look into the womb and enquire into the manner and causes of his procreation and nutriment preservation and decay follow the food from the mouth to the stomach and the chyle from thence to the lacteal vessels and their infertion into the veins they search the glands and trace the arteries and nerves that they may know the vessels and the liquids and fluids moving in them of which the human fabric is composed that we call blood and animal spirits and so they go on till they lose themselves their senses all ocular demonstrations and can find nothing but the unsearchable works of an omnipotent creator yet i say it is in the first place necessary that the student in physic make himself very well versed in natural philosophy for it is generally remarked ubi definit philosophus incipit medicus and he that will undertake the art of healing must understand not only the general but also the particular subjects thereof not only the sound frame of an human body but the diseases thereof and those remedies that are indicated from the causes and symptoms of them hence we infer that he must understand anatomy which shows him the figure position and use of every part of our bodies as they are in their natural state of health secondly pathology and aetiology which treat of the difference causes and symptoms of all diseases thirdly physiology or the knowledge of simple medicines that are supplied to us by nature and this also shows the strength and virtue of each medicament he must understand pharmacy both galenical and chemical he must know herbs and drugs and all the spagyrical preparations of them that by knowing how to mix simples in a just and right proportion he may prepare compound medicines to supply the defects of the simple thus an expert physician should not only very well know the containing but the contained parts also of an human body and be well versed in the causes pertiner ad rem omnium proprietates noscere non credunt posse eum scire quomodo morbos curare conveniat qui unde hi sint ignoret celsus and symptoms of all distempers he must know the virtues and strength of all medicines simple and compound and how to apply them seasonably and in due proportion hic labor hoc opus an hard task truly and enough to discourage the young student who may have reason upon this short view of his tedious undertaking to apply the  etc vita brevis ars longa occasio celer experimentum periculosum judicium difficile etc words of the great father of the faculty who complained that the whole life of man was too short a time for his accomplishment in this art and hence too we may very justly conclude with the learned celsus that of all men living a physician has need of the highest wisdom and consideration that every thoughtless animal is by no means capable of the practice of this noble art that is entrusted with the superintendence over the health and life of man the empiricks says he contend that the search into the procedure of nature and the dark causes of things was needless since it was not of use to know what might bring on a disease but what would take it off but the learned and more rational practitioners were firmly persuaded that it was not possible for any one to know in what manner to set about the cure of distempers who was altogether unacquainted whence they proceed and eum vero recte curaturum quem prima origo causae non sefellerit that he alone could do that with success who had thoroughly informed himself of the causes of them in the ancient days these were thought the qualifications generally necessary to the faculty but methinks a christian physician requires something more in his composition and that he ought not only to be master of all these arts and sciences but deserve also this commendation wheresoever he appears the accomplishments of a good physician viz  vir eruditus sobrius urbanus clemens moribus integris assiduus foelix deo fretus non audax non avarus  these ten excellent endowments being requisite to denominate a good physician it cannot be justly supposed that he can so well attain the same by any other means as by a liberal and pious education and without going through a regular careful and welldirected course of studies  sect iii discouragements to study physic in oxford and this leads me in the next place to take notice of some discouragements to young gentlemen to enter upon this faculty in oxford especially in that they are obliged to take the degrees of bachelor and master of arts before they can there be admitted upon the physic line and must then take the degree of bachelor of physic and that after ten years residence before they can be qualified regularly to hear the public professor which too they must do for full four years longer and be also full fourteen years standing before they can commence doctors this tedious continuance in the university as well as the exercises for those four degrees cannot but be attended with abundance of charge and trouble but whilst they see in the mean time their brethren at cambridge take their degree of bachelor of physic at seven years standing and after that not be obliged to residence and at ten years standing put on their doctors gown though their time spent in the university is no longer than that required for the degree of a bachelor of physic in oxford and their tests of probation no more expensive nor difficult than his the degree of bachelor of physic in oxford tantamount to that of doctor in cambridge the preference indeed is rather his due upon these accounts when it is considered that he takes three degrees performs the exercises required thereto and is consequently at a far greater expense of money and the same of time as they are at for their completion or taking their doctors degree to which if the oxford gentlemen proceed as they take more degrees so are they in proportion at far greater charges and what is far more aggravating when they see people that are bred in private academies and thence removed to padua leyden or utrecht to edinburgh or glascow where in less than four or five years space they shall be dubbed doctors intrude themselves into places of resort and practice and by the unthinking major part of mankind be caressed and preferred before our homebred physicians merely for their pretenses to more skill acquired by a foreign regular and homebred physicians postponed though a much cheaper and shorter way of education they cannot i say help being affected with some uneasiness and disgust to see themselves thus injustly obviated in their pretenses and postponed  and as theuniversities of other nations are to be blamed for crowding in upon us such clusters of mere novices or rather our laws for suffering them so to do so are our own for not better regulating their methods of study and not making the degrees of physic less expensive it might be more advantageous for the oxford students in this art if for the two first years they applied themselves to the study of logic moral philosophy politics aliisque humanioribus literis etc and for five more they should not only hear the public lectures but the professor should direct the course of their studies and by taking them with him into the sick chambers should inform them how to apply the theory in their practice and not suffer the young men to go on in their own injudicious methods before they commence batchelors of physic which should be at seven years standing and after that time so strict a residence should not be insisted on and at ten years standing they might assume the scarlet having first performed all the exercises for the several previous degrees as by the statutes are now required as well as for that and being strictly examined as to their proficience and knowledge in all the several aforementioned necessary qualifications  but our public professors whether through negligence or want of sufficient salaries to encourage them seem very indifferent how the public exercises are performed and give themselves no trouble in directing the students either in a regular and expeditious method of study or in the usual way of application of medicines and the rules of practice or if this were too much for our professors to undertake a catalogue of authors they might readily exhibit and out of conscience scrutiny and examine more narrowly into the abilities of those they present to their degrees in this faculty or surely there seems great need of some other able men who should be appointed to try and judge who are fit to prescribe and administer physic before they are rashly admitted to practice  sect iv men should follow nothing but what they are bred up to for certainly the law of nature and well ordered commonwealths do require that every ignorant man who thinks himself skilful should not play the physician vid          lest he kill men formerly in england any man might use what trade and as many trades as he could but in time the public being damnified and trade in general injured by this liberty such persons and those that followed occupations to which they were not bred were first restrained stat    ed   and again by stat   eliz under a penalty this law that a person should not employ himself in any other business than what he was bred to was made to encourage skilfulness and that youth might be regularly brought up in some lawful trade how an unqualified practicer of physic should be punished and the same reason holds good with respect to the exercising the faculties in the liberal sciences and we have academical statutes made accordingly which say that those that are not qualified as there directed sicut perturbator pacis puniatur  should be punished as rioters and breakers of the peace but they are not much regarded out of the university especially to the great injury of physicians and thus or worse all quacks certainly deserve to be treated vid sect    vid    for if they can practice and get the bread of learned physicians who have spent many hundred pounds and so many years labor and study nay many of them the most vigorous and active parts of their lives to obtain these privileges to what purpose is it to study physic in our universities this does but prejudice them they spend their whole fortunes to obtain a degree and a diploma liberam tibi tenore praesentium concedimus potestatem and facultatem practicandi in medicina and ea omnia faciendi quae ad eam spectant faculatem ubivis per universum angliae regnum in perpetuum duraturam etc vid     or power and authority to exercise their faculty all over the kingdom etc and then have the mortification to see an apothecary a surgeon a poor vicar an idle schoolmaster a strolling stage player a toothdrawer a pickpocket for reasons best known to themselves sometimes leaving their proper stations and mounting a jointstool as others a spotted horse cum multis aliis assume his title and dignity of degree invade his province and take his gain or praemium  i wish i have not in this remark upon the irregular methods taken in the study of physic in the universities discovered a vicious ferment in the stomach that makes the mothers sweet milk turn sour and unfit for digestion and in my advice for the rectifying the same shown my inability to propound any thing that may may tend to the advantage of the faculty and can only hope that my willingness to do them service may not be rejected with indignation and contempt indeed i know but little but that little that mite i am ready to communicate it is a vulgar proverb every fool can find a fault but many wise men cannot mend one yet he is a weak physician indeed that can discover a malady but cannot apply the smallest remedy it is the duty of every honest man to put a stop to growing evils and what the great celsus says in respect to healing the body i may too in order to the relief of the sick politic state of our faculty satius est anceps experiri auxilium quam nullum it is better to try a doubtful remedy than none at all when any particular fault or crime creeps into the public into any order profession or society of men every honest man ought to think himself obliged to exhibit in his way some salutary medicine to prevent its growing epidemical and infecting the community for if it once get the sanction of a majority custom will make it a law therefore as i proceed to detect what is unjust dishonest and of mischievous consequence with relation to any the most inferior branches of the art of physic i shall likewise intimate the best means that i can think of to put a stop to our mismanagements and prevent our growing dangers and if i fail of success i hope my fruitless and weak efforts may animate some more experienced and able hand to produce better  it is true there are persons able and some willing to reprehend these delinquents that are found amongst us and that combine against us but since all endeavors to reclaim the most formidable enemies of the faculty have proved ineffectual and they have not been so attacked yet but that they have kept themselves out of reach it may be of some use to expose the vile arts that are found to be exercised amongst them but before i entered into their dirty laboratories i thought it might not be amiss to recollect some very indifferent treatment that the members of this learned faculty offer to one another and the bad reception that many of our regular academical physicians have met with at the college of physicians in london vid    0    had i not been pretty well assured that the base practices of the apothecaries were the principal cause of the misunderstanding that is so manifest amongst these gentlemen who ought to love as brethren and this in some sort obliges me if i would not act so preposterously as to postpone causes to their effects to speak of their disingenuity in the first place  sect v the disingenuity of the apothecaries and the ill consequences thereof and it is notorious that the men of this art are not altogether so just and ingenuous as most of them profess and ought to be they do not always prepare their medicines according to the dispensatory of the royal college of physicians but more frequently follow new methods of their own much more adapted to their own unreasonable advantage making use of one drug for another and frequently of corrupt drugs although they hereby endanger nay quite effect the destruction of the medicine to all intents and purposes for which it was at the first invented and composed there are very few medicines that they dont adulterate and fewer that they make up faithfully and no conscientious and honest man who sees these faults can avoid complaints to instance in a few particulars  of simple waters i need not mention their methods to make simple waters more insipid than they naturally are not only because they are apt to make two or three supply the place of all the rest but because many of them have but very little efficacy of which they seem to be very sensible when in diluting and emulsive juleps instead of using the specific waters therein prescribed they commonly mix up spring or more frequently thames water which the excellency of thames water notwithstanding it is so excellent in itself that i have tasted some of it that has been carried to the east indies and back again uncorrupted is a notorious cheat put upon the patient who pays an extravagant rate for the same an apothecary in bishopsgatestreet upon a time correcting his boy for turning away a customer that enquired for plantane water said sirrah though you could find no aqua plantaginis in the shop if you had stepped into the backyard you might have found aqua pumpaginis enough and that would have served as well but whether he or marggrave the professor of chemistry at leyden is most to be credited i shall not debate this learned artist said plantane water and the preparations of it was the greatest febrifugium that he knew of either chemical or galenical i have heard another apothecary boast that the took  00 l per ann for dr coles aqua saxonica i e spring water indeed little dependence is to be made upon simple waters they serving only to convey into the stomach some other medicine of more virtue that being nakedly administered would be very nauseous and the more free from any physical taste such vehicle is the better it is of consequence but then if fountain water is made use of for this purpose that god sends gratis why should the sordid apothecary take money for it  of infusions teas or infusions of many of the herbs that the common simple waters are distilled from may be made ex tempore and as such are more efficacious than the distilled waters so they are not more ungrateful to the patients weak stomachs who may readily prepare them themselves by the physicians direction and save the charges that the apothecaries would otherwise put them to mr smith in his complete body of distilling says that the surfeit water made by infusion in the best brandy is superior to any other that is distilled and seems much to favor this way of preparing compound waters indeed there are so many of them adulterated in distilling that it would be too tedious to remark and how many of the ingredients herbs roots seeds etc that ought to be put into them are omitted  of compound waters spirits etc how desirable is it to have our compound peony water wormwood treacle plague cinnamon and bryony waters etc drawn off with the best french brandy only according to the last london dispensatory of      wherein many useless medicines that were crept into former dispensatories are rejected and the necessary ones made up after a better manner but instead of french brandy our apothecaries make use of english malt spirits and esteem and boast these medicinal waters very extraordinary good indeed if they use molossus spirits in the preparing of them yet they charge as much for them when retaled out by the ounce or in cordial juleps etc as if they were made with the best nantz though were these wholesale dealers content with the profits that mr smith calculates to arise from most of their goods of this sort they are incredibly great even extravagant but says he apothecaries will sell nothing at a moderate rate  sect vi the impositions of the chemists and wholesale apothecaries spirits of saffron castor lavender compound etc have no better fate with many others and tinctures also too many to enumerate but these last are generally prepared by the chemists and sold by them to the apothecaries as also most salts oils resins etc and though most of these may be discovered generally by their color smell or taste yet the mixture and adulteration of chemical medicines is so gross and frequent that it is hard to say whether the chemical or galenical operators have justly suffered most in their reputation which is of small account if compared with the disappointments the honest physicians meet with upon this score and the loss of their patients lives to boot and what but wretched avarice is the cause of all this mischief for which they might have some poor pretense did they sell their adulterate medicines cheaper in proportion but on the contrary they keep up their prices of these adulterate medicines as high as if they were genuine especially in the retale utterance of them to the deluded patient and many of the country apothecaries and of the druggists too know not when they are imposed upon by these wholesale dealers or if they do are no farther concerned about it than to have their base medicines at a price accordingly seeing they take them off their hands without any scrutiny and their detection is so easy of chemical cils i shall mention the trials of but two or three chemical medicines for brevity sake the chemical oils extracted from herbs and seeds etc are proved by mixing them with rectified spirits of wine in a vial and shaking them together the spirit will immediately be separated and remain clear as before it was mixed if the oil is true but if the oil is adulterated it will become muddy and milky  of resin of jalap rectified spirit of wine will also in a small time dissolve true resin of jalap but if it is factitious and mixed with common rosin the spirit will not dissolve it  of salt of salt of amber salt of amber is a medicine though not cheap yet frequently prescribed and as often adulterated if it is true rectified spirit of wine will readily dissolve it but if false and any way mixed it will not dissolve  of liquid laudanum there are three sorts of liquid laudanum commonly used in practice the liquid laudanum cydoniatum of late not in so great request is ascribed to helmont the liquid laudanum that is most frequently in use is that of dr sydenham the last sort prepared with tartar is i think a medicine of the learned dr willis but let who will be the authors of these several tinctures of opium and let the authority of our learned college of physicians be exerted as much as it can in the direction of apothecaries in the dispensation of medicines one of them had a more concise method of making these three sorts of liquid laudanum than any of their society ever thought of what does it signify says he to be at the charge and trouble that the dispensatory directs meaning i suppose shiptons additamentum etc i have out of the same glass as good of every one of the sorts as any is in england i shall not determine how far this shortest way may answer the intentions of all the three seeing the last edition of the london dispensatory gives us but two of them as necessary but i relate this to show the integrity of the man and now my hand is in i cannot but give an account of the ways another of these wholesale operators took to counterfeit some other medicines for which a great demand is daily made at the wholesale shops being of universal use in the retale or practicing apothecaries shops throughout the nation this man had a great trade and sent out many boxes of medicines in a week and the following goodly ones amongst the rest to hisbest customers both in town and country viz  his resin of jalap resin of jalap counterfeited take common black rosin four ounces gambodge finely powdered one ounce dissolve and mix them  his locatellus balsam and locatellus balsam take hogs lard  0 lbvenice turpentine one pound red sanders as much as is sufficient to give it a due color  his balsam of tolu balsam of tolu counterfeited take the purest white resin twelve pounds liquid storax eight ounces gumbenjmin four ounces dissolve and mix them  his syrup of the same and syrup of the same is made by boiling two ounces of the abovesaid baisam as he calls it in two pints and an half of spring water to two pints strain it and add as much loaf sugar as will boil it up to a due consistence according to art  for the honest preparation of this medicine and genuineness of the rest see the college dispensatory and compare them with this mans and you cannot but be astonished and this informs us viz  that resin of jalap is extracted by spirit of wine etc from the black heavy roots of jalap but his has not a grain of jalap in it and indeed most that is sold is mixed with common resin  that locatellus balsam is made of the best yellow wax canary oil olive venice turpentine washed in rose water and lastly  little red sanders compare his with this and then judge  the balsam of tolu that he here pretenc to imitate is a true natural balm that com from the west indies and from a tree said t be like the low pine the bark being cut o flows this noble medicine  instead of oils in his emplasters etc th man frequently used stinking fat and ranci butter  of plasters how merry is it to see a roll of plaster entitled oxycroceum sine croco i e the plaster that takes its name from the saffron etc that ought to be in it made up without a grain of that flower  of syrups and conserves i need say little of the apothecaries nasty ways of boiling up their syrups and making their conserves with the worst of sugars because not many of them are necessary but it is vexatious to see them imitate cur excellent native cathartic syrup of buckthorn syrup of buckthorn which one would imagine was parable and cheap enough by mixing gamboge with a weak sort of it or with some other syrup of the like color and consistence and thereby make it too rugged and boisterous that neither the country buyer nor the physician knows how to proportion it in purging potions  of venic treacle etc the capital and grand medicines as the apothecaries call them as mithridate treacle of andromachus physician to that monstrous roman emperor nero confectio fracastorii etc were not made up formerly without having all the ingredients first viewed separately by the censors of the college of physicians with some of the court of assistants or wardens of the company of the apothecaries but now they are daily made up clandestinely notwithstanding they are subject to the scrutiny and search of the college of physicians by law and the defective dispensation of this grand medicine is become so far suspected that few rich people care to buy that which they think is compounded at home preferring the foreign preparations of it but considering that our english saffron is the best in the world and our vipers as good as the venetian and all the ingredients are to be had here in london as good and cheap as in any place in europe why should our apothecaries be thus suffered to bring an odium and make the integrity of our nation suspected and taint and poison us with that medicine that they call our principal alexipharmic as well as impose upon us and the poor in particular who use what is called venice treacle in every indisposition  of the compound powder of crabs claws the next medicine in vogue with the ladies especially and what enhances the apothecaries bills most plausibly is the gascoigns powder at the insignificancy as well as extravagant price of which i cannot but wonder especially when i see some people who should be better informed use it to no purpose for if it is such a wonderful fine chalk free from loam may answer all ends of this powder absorbent and alterative in the first passages etc it ought to be thrown in by whole drams and that frequently and not by scrupledoses and others sell it at one penny a grain or at least   s scruple because the bezoar is intolerable dear which they pretend to put into it i say pretend because they rarely put one grain into it but more frequently make it up with oyster shells reduced to a fine powder the juice of some herb and a cheap aromatic that may imitate the cast and flavor of the bezoar stone which is one of those things which are farfetched and dearbought but as faith tacitus and also  magis illa juvant quae pluris emuntur a poet quae e longinquo magis placent foreign productions please best and the dearer they are bought the greater stress is put upon them and just so it fares too often with modest physicians who will prescribe excellent well for a moderate fee yet shall be slightly set by therefore whilst an audacious and sometimes impertinent gentleman shall be caressed by the apothecary because he deals much in this to them profitable commodity and takes a guinea or two guineafee of the deluded patient and because he is a dear doctor is esteemed a good one in proportion as this powder has little appparent virtue in it so i am satisfied this oriental ingredient may very well be omitted without much detriment to those that admire it whose foible is discerned and gratified by the crafty apothecary in like manner as was that of william rufus who was angry at his chamberlain for bringing him a pair of hose that cost   s and yet was pleased with a pair that were far worse that he told him cost a mark but if this powder must still be retained in use a succedaneum might be found out to supply the want of this stone which indeed as it is a disease to the creature out of whose stomach it is taken i cannot think it any great cordial to man and these admirers of dear land foreign medicines might be more innocently deceived if we would be at the pains to study the virtues of some that are better and cheaper and the product of our own native soils our saffron verginian serpentary root the male peony root the valerians root aron aristolochiae rotundae our noble whiteflowerd chamomile red field poppy flowers seeds of rue cardamoms etc as occasion and symptoms require may be added to the testaceous powders instead of bezoar and then no plea could be admitted for so base and extravagant an imposition as is put upon the purchasers of this officious impertinent medicine  sect vii of ungarbled drugs were i to proceed to every particular abuse that is put upon the physicians and the people of this nation by these selfinterested covetous medicinemakers i must swell this dissertation into the full bulk of the college dispensatory but i shall satisfy my self at present with one or two more which seem to be the fundamental causes of the increase of bad medicines viz the neglect to garble all drugs and the wholesale apothecaries trucking with the druggists and both of them furnish the practicing and the country apothecaries  what need is there of some proper persons being authorized by law to examine every bale and chest of drugs and to destroy all that are found damaged corrupt and unfit for use and that the censors of the college of physicians should examine the druggists shops as well as those of the apothecaries and chemists and that the regularly educated and approved physicians throughout the kingdom country physicians should have power to inspect apothecaries shops etc should have the same powers inspect the shops and warehouses of country apothecaries and medicinesellers of all denominations and to destroy whatever they find unfit for use and to fine also such as uponlegal proof are found guilty of there and such like horrid cheats adulterations and unmerciful exactions when we see the wholesale apothecaries buy ungarbled and damaged drugs of the druggists and contract with them to pay for the same half in money and the other half in as bad medicines the impositions of the druggists with the wholesale apothecaries and both furnish country apothecaries    which it is demonstrable they can vent again no way but to little dabling medicasters and to country chaps and when those great apothecaries who have contracted to serve our armies and fleets with medicines have had them returned back upon their hands as altogether useless and corrupt to the incredible damage and danger of the lives of the best sailors and soldiers in the world but what care these men so they get money by these means though very destructive ones to the people they both the druggists and wholesale apothecaries and chemists likewise may be added disembogue their shops of effaete and corrupt drugs and of false and adulterate medicines and all at dear rates considering their bad qualities thus they combine to cheat us of our health and wealth without control or inspection  i would not be so excessively uncharitable as to accuse all apothecaries etc of these base murdering practices for as the proverb has it it is not every one can pickle well   it is to be hoped all of them are not such pickled rogues as to be able to disguise medicines at this monstrous rate but those who are conscientious in the dispensation of their medicines are so few that the greatest most conscientious and the most learned physicians have by all imaginable methods and at no small expense attempted their reformation and have endeavored by the charitable contrivance of a dispensatory at their own college not only to prevent the adulteration of medicines when all other ways have proved ineffectual but likewise that the exorbitant prices that the apothecaries demand not only of the rich but also of the poor may be abated  sect viii all apothecaries the practicing and retale apothecaries especially take insufferable prices for the vilest medicines and this is the principal cause of the manifest disagreement between the honest physicians and the unjust apothecaries and also between physicians themselves of which i shall speak more hereafter having not yet dismissed the the ungrateful subject the unmerciful apothecaries have led me into not a family is without the practisiing and retale apothecaries bills by them see    0       and their exactions may be easily discovered by comparing the wholesale apothecaries and druggists bills or charges to them with theirs and the wholesale man charges liquid laudanum at   d per ounce to the retaler who sells it out again made up into draughts etc at   s for  0 drops i have known it calculated that they sell london laudanum made up into a bolus with a little conserve at an  00 per cent profit they buy it at   s per ounce nay to come as near as may be to the point they buy it at half a farthing a grain and sell it out at     half farthings a grain  mr smith in his art of distilling tells us they will make  0 gallons of plague water at   l   s   d prime cost and they sell it out again wholesale at   l that is at   s per gallon nay at    s per gallon and retale at   d an ounce or    s and   d per gallon and this is the honestest and most reasonable of their gains in things of this nature in many articles to descend to particulars were endless their profit runs incredibly higher and their pretense for keeping up the price of medicines to this exorbitant pitch is because some are perishable  but the college dispensatory of      utterly deprives them of this plea ordering all medicines to be so wisely prepared that few if any are perishable in any reasonable time and of those that are any way liable to decay they keep but small quantities by them or make them extempore as they have present occasion  their whole trade as now managed an intolerable grievance etc thus their art is degenerated into a most abominable grievance that ever was suffered to be openly and continually carried on in any the most abject and corrupted nation under heaven the grocers out of whose company the london apothecaries were at first drawn and then incorporated even those of them that are retalers and many other honest tradesmen declare themselves satisfied if they can get one penny in a shilling and are too frequently obliged to take up and to be content with much less profit in commodities of far greater value and more exposed to damage than any the apothecaries deal in and why they should be indulged in such insufferable and oppressive demands and monstrous profit in things which if they were good of very little worth for those things that cost them little or nothing is a thing utterly beyond my capacity to account for  all the efforts of some honest and compassionate physicians to stop the current of these abuses apothecaries incorrigible have for ought i can find tended to no other end than to exasperate the covetous and unjust mortardrubbers against them though they have imitated the company of physicians at athens called  because they would take no money of their patients they have received no other reward for their charitable intentions and practices than to be disparaged and illspoken of and to be obviated in their pretensions and to be thrust out of every family that would give any credit to the malicious and self interested insinuations of these cunning men  this male treatment no doubt on it at first animated the doctors to erect their dispensatories that the sickpoor having their advice gratis might be also supplied with remedies at a very low rate and that the rich too might be secure of pure and effectual medicines at a moderate price and the lives of their patients and their own reputation in some measure insured to boot  sect ix dispensatories and infirmaries recommended and here i hope it may not be thought an unpardonable digression to insinuate the national advantage of infirmaries and works of this nature vid    which were they encouraged and carried on according to the first intention of them would prove no doubt noble benefits to persons of all conditions the college dispensatory i say is an undertaking worthy of imitation by those physicians that reside in poor and populous countries and are any way able to beat the charge and willing to be at the trouble of erecting a dispensatory or keeping a closet of choice medicines in their own houses and it would be a great encouragement to the faculty if in or near every market town there were a physician appointed at a certain salary to be raised by a parish rate or levy etc to attend the poor that shall be sick who should be brought and placed in infirmaries provided in every parish or   or   parishes might join their stocks for that end and purpose this would be no more i dare adventure to affirm much less charge to the several parishes than they are now at in paying ignorant pretenders to physic for their attendance upon them and their bad medicines and in maintenance of the widows and children of those unfortunate poor men that have fallen into bad hands and whose lives might have been preserved had an honest and skilful physician been applied to moreover as one remarks the sooner diseases are taken notice of those that are epidemical especially and these begin generally and make their first advances amongst the poorest sort of people by accurate and expert physicians the less footing they will have the cure of them will be the easier and their advice will be rendered the more effectual which being usurped by these injudicious pretenders the distempers being mistaken or maltreated become malignant contagious and fatal and the sooner a poor man is restored to his health he will be the sooner able to provide for his family and it will be a more especial advantage to the parish if it shall prevent his death by which else a numerous family may be left helpless upon their hands and it will be a great advantage to the neighborhood when any of them want a physician by his being so near to them and he may afford to attend them for much smaller than the present accustomed and extravagant fees and the more visits he makes to the sickpoor the greater will be his experience the more certain his observations and the more capable will he be to advise the nobility and gentry etc but to return to the matter in hand  apothecaries formerly servants to physicians but now aspire to be above their masters since this flagrant perfidy of the apothecaries has been detected and they have been frequently reproved what reformation has appeared amongst them they have been so far from honoring and giving place to the physician  ecclus    that they aspire to be equal to him to supersede and shoulder him out of place telling every simple woman they sure must know something they have all the doctors bills that the doctors are beholden to them for making up their prescriptions which they know not how to prepare themselves etc but if they would consider that it is but a few generations past that they were originally only servants to physicians to help them to do the drudgery and laborious part of their dispensations in their own houses and that others of them were culled out of the most trifling and peddling part of the grocers that scarce one in an hundred of them at this day can read the latin testament the test that they frequently try boys by when offered to be their apprentices and that those of them that can hammer out a physicians bill frequently have not ingredients or commonly not the fidelity to make it up truly they could not be so audacious that there were physicians now styled doctors apothecaries and surgeons in   distinct classes or orders even as high as the days of moses some have seemed to prove from that learned jew josephus but not to enter into these needless enquiries these men are so far from paying any due deference to the physicians their instructors and masters that they assume a superiority rather and maintain it scandalously while we see a learned poor physician crouching to them gloseing over all their vile impostures to be introduced and kept by them in the good graces of a good family their flagrant impudence and ignorance admonition renders them perverse nor conscience seems to have any check upon them they persevere in their insolence and deceit with the greater obstinacy for being reprehended and what is to be wondered at have prevailed to have an act of parliament pass to exempt them from parish and ward offices etc that they may forsooth the better attend the sick or rather invade the province and property the office fees and livelihood of the regular physicians educated in our universities and to whom alone these rewards of our honorable and useful profession do legally appertain though it is daily and sufficiently proved how unqualified they are to prescribe physic from undeniable matters of fact and the many fatal miscarriages which their forward ignorance leads them into they must needs be empiricks who pretend to cure by guess and neglecting the reason of things content themselves with bare experience as has already been hinted and it is but too manifest they do so and for the most part either for want of learning or by the very method of their education in their shops can better vouch practice for their warrant than warrant for their practice while they justify their proceedings by no other authority than this or that doctors bills upon their files but how come they to be such competent judges that the distemper the symptoms and constitution of the patient for whom these recipes were originally prescribed and their new patients disorders etc are the same i have seen this quere answered in the negative by a merry poet says he  no their pretended skills a dangerous cheat to bubble those that want both health and wit  do we not see many young fellows amongst them administer physic to those that are as ignorant as themselves before they know how to prepare it and sometimes kill men without being called to an account for it  sect x the apothecaries abuse the college of physicians etc they have carried matters with such an high hand as to put the members of the college that subscribed to the dispensatory to defiance vid        and have and do recommend persons assuming the dignity of doctors without ever watering their horses at our universities and that were not members of the college of physicians to practice physic in london contrary to the laws and privileges of that learned society who have together with all regularly educated physicians an undeniable authority by law not only to prescribe but also to administer medicines and the apothecaries have persevered in these unjustifiable proceedings so long as sufficiently to discourage our physicians that come from oxford or cambridge from entering into the college of physicians at london lest they should be thus suppressed and discouraged before they are known till in process of time the old members of the college dying off honest physicians discouraged and the society becoming thin and poor there was a necessity to fill up the vacancies and then those who had rather favored the apothecaries than the dispensatory being a majority introduced exotics gentlemen that had their education or taken a degree in foreign universities as edinburgh leyden utretcht or padua as they chanced in their travels to ride through it and it is to be feared too many of these foreign gentlemen so i must call them to gain business some physicians recommended for complying with the apothecarias fall in too easily with these unworthy methods of the apothecaries and prescribe at large to gain their recommendation and can find no fault with their bad medicines nor with their exorbitant prices for the same and if they are called in after an apothecary has by pernicious applications perhaps diverted a favorable crisis and well nigh killed the patient dare not but applaud his proceedings and then to recover what the other had lost and enhanse his bill at the same time to make amends inter scribendum for the favor done in calling him into the family fling in more juleps apozems draughts boluss pills powders and god knows what till the poor patient dies of the doctor at last whereas had he had patience indeed and taken no physic from his intimate acquaintance the apothecary before he had applied himself to some honest physician or had placed less confidence in one whom his apothecary recommended nature and a little prudent nursing might in all probability with the assistance of a very few simple and proper medicines nay perhaps after another manner without any artificial assistance have freed him from his distemper  sect xi physicians that strike hands with the apothecarys the only men of vogue and here the physicians of an exotic education are not indeed the only persons to be condemned in this sort too too many of our own growth either through avarice and because they will not be out of play and more out of mere necessity are obliged to crouch thus for a piece of bread  but be that as it will this clan of physicians that strike hands thus with the apothecaries are the only men of vogue and run of business and know how too to make their marker and take as exorbitant fees as the apothecaries can prices a firstrate man has a guinea for a chamber or coffeehouse fee and two for a visit one of the second class a guinea for a priming fee and half a one for every visit and thus between the fees of the one and the bills of the other it is well if a considerable tradesman is not well nigh undone though they suffer him to escape with his life out of a tedious fit of sickness with what indignation must an honest man hear his neighbor complain to his physician of the unreasonableness of the apothecaries bill and the other answer with an air of arrogance sir i dont use to garble apothecaries bills and another sharper advise an extorting apothecary to keep up the price of medicines or says he we shall do nothing and what a mortification must it be to a modest young physician that cannot in honor and conscience write so profusely and will not divide his prescriptions into abundance of forms and impertinent varieties and little doses to augment the apothecaries profit rather than to indulge the patients palate to be tacitly reprehended by the apothecaries flinging in a bottle of cordial drops or a composing draught and afterward be told boldly o sir you are under a mistake you must sometimes hold a candle to the d  l if you expect to make much on it in this town you must not reflect upon tradesmen  thus the honest and the fair practicing physicians are decryd and brought into neglect by all the artifices that can be thought on according as the temper and politic interest or passions of the people that their undermining antagonists are tampering with affords them occasion say they this mans rash and gives the nastiest medicines that is an old nurse the other minds nothing but his bottle one is a scoundrel whig another a virulent tory when perhaps the honest man they are thus circumventing and defaming is neither or has declared neither for high nor low nor any party but because he has subscribed to the dispensatory or cannot readily come into the mercenary and base measures of a set of selfinterested and naughty men  the artifices of cunning knaves indeed the generality of the world is in something or other thus imposed upon cunning men for private lucre bandy themselves and make parties and then invent discriminating appellations and whosoever has the misfortune to fall under the lash of their petulant tongues and to be ranged in the class of obnoxious persons that is of those that do not or cannot favor their unworthy designs and unwarrantable practices must of necessity be in danger of ruin from them and being placed between the two opposite and impetuous aggressors he cannot avoid blows from both certainly it is most inhuman to affix any character upon a man that may render him odious and that is distasteful to others and thereby strip him of his understanding and honor religion and conscience his profession and livelihood  let a mans private sentiments be what they will and personal infirmities very visible he may be for all them a good physician and ought to enjoy as free as air the common privileges of his faculty  sect xii our regular physicians not very well treated at the college of physicians etc but some too many of our graduate physicians from cambridge and oxford find it otherwise to their great detriment and discouragement for as soon as one of them emerges in london and that before he has acquired an acquaintance or writ something sufficient to recommend him to common fame and whilst he is in suspense whether it is for his advantage to adhere to the apothecaries or for his credit and quiet of conscience to come into the dispensatory he shall be summoned by the president of the college to give an account of his practice and to enter into the society very much to his prejudice the premises considered and whilst the college too suffer multitudes of unqualified and unlicensed persons to proceed in practice without any notice taken and make others that have had no regular education licentiates and abundance that have been bred in foreign universities fellows and confer as many real privileges upon them as our homebred gentlemen can have by becoming members of that society and notwithstanding the worthy gentlemen thus prosecuted have a diploma from our universities abuses of the college of physicians etc vid   to practice all over the kingdom in every place and to do every thing that appertains to physic etc  physicians disagree and abuse their own faculty as the matter seems to stand at present a degree in one of our universities is only a disadvantage as said a gentleman who had just reason to expostulate with the college as it makes a man that has it the mark of the college whom they could not or perhaps would not take notice of if he had not his degrees as this case between the charter of the college of physicians in london and the universities has been stated and set forth and also as it renders him obnoxious to the apothecaries if he will keep his integrity and discountenance their exorbitant proceedings  hence it is that so many of our regular physicians have refused to come into the college for is it not intolerable that gentlemen educated according to the laws of the land in our own universities and having expended therein  000 l or  00 l at least vid      in proceeding through the course of their studies to their requisite degrees etc when afterward they come out thence to offer their service to the world and by their honest gains in their profession to have these charges refunded and to maintain themselves must pay as dear for their incorporation with the college of london physicians and to obtain the privileges to practice unmolested as foreigners do and have one of them who has not been at above a third part of their expense computing both his titular and purchased degree taken abroad and the charge of his admittance into the college together preferred before him and to see now and then wealthy apothecary or surgeon get to be an archbishops doctor and god knows who admitted amongst them upon the same level  what can be the reason of this either the power of the college is defective or not rightly exerted or there is a great neglect of the statutes that are as wise and moral as any extant in any society it is certain there appears among the members a great division arising manifestly from their adhering to the methods pleasing the apothecaries vid      0    or to the dispensatory and this produces parties and partiality a narrowness and selfinterest and a want of concern for the honor and benefit of the community and of the profession in general instead of this there are combinations with private views to promote particular advantages some are applauded and others supplanted according as they reject or come into particular measures in short amongst our physicians a disregard of the true end of their institution viz the good and health of the people seems but too apparent as well as great want of candor one toward another physic is a precarious profession to whom i would only add this one consideration that as the laws have not provided for the support of the professors of physic as they have for those of other professions by donations and lucrative preferments and their emoluments are precarious they are not upon a national establishment they are to subsist wholly by their skill their industry and their reputation and good will of the people it highly behooves them not only to encourage the improvement of knowledge but likewise to be tender and cautious of bringing their faculty into contempt and i must assure them that it is very apparent that whilst they pursue every one his private gain and as practice is now carried on the poor are utterly neglected and the rich intolerably abused the poor are neglected and the rich abused and neither find any true remedy but from the charitable and candid though much discouraged treatment at the dispensatory and if the gentlemen that are for and against it proceed much longer in their intestine debates and animosities it will be an addition to the worlds wonders if physic should flourish again in this nation under the pressure of all these enormous abuses for if the college can maintain the power they claim over the faculty in this manner and i may say too if the privileges thereof are thus invaded in every corner of the nation our universities are rendered useless with regard to the art of physic if they cannot effectually authorize their graduate physicians  had the great and learned traveller dr thomas linacer who upon his return is said to be the restorer of learning in our nation and founded two public lectures in oxford and one in cambridge for the advantage of the students in physic foreseen these disorders he never would have founded also the college of physicians in london that the students of that faculty of both universities the end for which the college of physicians was founded obviated might meet the more conveniently together to consult the advantage and not the disgrace and destruction of the profession  all this is but the consequence of artful faction kept up by avarice and ambition and crafty apothecaries amongst our physicians greedily prosecuting as i just now said particular advantages and selfinterest neglecting the public good and the reputation of the faculty and indeed the health of mankind yielding upon these scores to the apothecaries who at the same time do not stick to supplant them and are become their competitors these debates are wittily handled by dr garth in his poem and the apothecaries cheats exposed by mr thomas browns farce called the dispensatory where he introduces trueman with this generous resolution  i never to flattery was or will be slave he that loves truth is generous and brave and scorns the wealthy and the thriving knave and many honest physician are forced to withdraw themselves these indeed are worthy expressions in the mouth of the man that is got above the world but should another who has no means of living but by it and in it take up with these sentiments and stick by them he may chance to starve for his honest obstinacy his necessities will be ever and anon insinuating that truth and plaindealing are very disobliging things that honesty is an usual bar to honor and preferment that the strongest wing of merit cannot mount if a stronger weight of malice that should be removed depress it that there is nothing to be got by being good in bad times much less by daring to appear so that things are gone so far that if a man intends to gain any practice in this town or any where else indeed he must connive at greater abuses than these if any such can be found in his profession and he must in prudence be silent whilst the emperick and prating apothecary run on maliciously against the honest physician administer medicines ignorantly and the more ignorant people by long custom and for want of better information are brought to love to have it so and to be deluded out of their lives and what too many of them love better than their lives their good money nothing can prevail upon the generality of them to see in this important case their own advantage though in most other matters of far less moment they pursue it most dexterously they refuse to be convinced in this point though their lives lie at stake though the most eminent hand would heal them gratis yet they will have recourse to rely upon and applaud these audacious quacksalvers and presently conclude him a partial selfended man that unfolds these mysteries of iniquity he sees very plainly that if he cannot help speaking and acting conscientiously for the common good his skill and good character shall be traduced on all hands thus many excellent modest physicians finding there is no way for them to become useful serviceable to themselves and others and celebrated in their profession but by these vile artifices think it better to sit down neglected and that it is advisable for them to be silent rather than to exclaim against what they cannot remedy and to be content to want a great name and great business rather than attempt the attainment of it at the expense of other peoples fame and their own quiet and if their conscience too must go to rack for the purchase non juvat bonum nomen reclamante conscientia  that profit and advantage that respect and reputation that must be obtained in the world with the loss of honesty and a good conscience is not worth the having  sect xiii the ill consequences of the bishops granting licenses etc but say some people the old maxim ars nullos habet inimicos praeter ignorantes allows no men of good sense and literature to be your adversaries indeed if this could be made good it would very much contribute toward a remedy against these growing evils have not our bishops and their officials a power though the legality of it since the reformation from popery is questioned by some of their lordships and do they not grant licenses to such great numbers of gentlemen that are bred abroad and settle so frequently in our greatest cities and towns that there is scarce room for a regular physician from one of our own universities to thrust in amongst them and to abundance of mere formalists and what is yet worse to many illiterate and ignorant persons besides and that without due examination and necessary trial before competent judges who ought very well to approve every one that offers himself to them for a qualification to exercise the faculty of physic even in the most servile and minutest part thereof and it is notorious that the officers of their courts for the sake of perquisites are ready solicitors for this tribe of candidates and our regular physicians themselves are too easily importuned to sign certificates to many of these humble petitioners imagining they cannot hurt them that they live remote and their business will be amongst the poor that they oblige some good patient of their own that entreats this favor of them for a poor parson that otherwise has not wherewithal to support his family or that another simple fellow may do good in a few cases or in other make work for them and upon some such like slight considerations help the lame dog over the style that presently turns again and bites them supplants their character as well as supplies their place and by degrees gets into favor upon an accidental cure or two made upon some poor person that nature perhaps would have relieved without their preposterous help of the best gentlemen in the country  sect xiv and this necessarily leads me in the next place the bad state of physic in the country to take a short view of the bad state of physic there also where quacks and mere formalists that can but copy out a bill and impudent illiterate fellows not only practice physic but meet with incredible encouragement  but the majority of the people of the common sort especially commonly take the worst side as i have before observed and give countenance to knaves and pretenders and neglect men of integrity and knowledge without any reason for it except that one which is very plain and natural viz that they are wiser and better than themselves for we are apt to have great inclinations to every thing which resembles us and an aversion to what is above us  i need not here again recite that the right and judicious understanding of the animal economy a long and regular course of study and application together with abundance of judicious instructions and expense of money as well as time and after all experience too to apply all the acquired faculties and science of physic aright is necessary to the accomplishment of a physician that the indications curative are to be taken from the aetiology of diseases and the explanation of the causes of distempers so far as it may be said to be demonstrative from anatomy but whatever reason art and the laws of our country can advance to the discouragement of those persons that pretend to rely upon other foundations especially upon the indications of what is to be done in diseases from the urine only yet these pisspot doctors clarissimus bellini divinatores ex sola urinarum inspectione dicit urinantes inanes are strangely sought to and incredibly famous piss pot doctors notwithstanding the folly as well as uncertainty of their conclusions is sufficiently apparent bottles of urine are brought  0 or  0 miles to one of these watercasters and he without seeing the patient says with dr byfield praesens vel absens idem est tells the old women all their infirmities and aches and the young ones all their obstructions and sickness and for the price of a splendid shilling sends them his orvietan and infallible remedy his pills that cure all ills past present and to come another will do as much for a sixpenny fee a third will give a large hodgepodge for   d for which they all deserve the pillory as in      quacks formerly punished   and    0 when such counterfeit physicians were if our chronicles may be depended upon set on horseback with their faces to the horsetail the tail in their hands as a bridle and a whetstone on their breast and so led through the city of london with ringing of basins and banished hence the proverb of old not so easy to turn a crooked body straight as to turn a mustard quern nor one leap out of a docket n a manual or little collection of receipts makes a doctor yet such have all their silly crowds of admirers abettors and followers who run after one or other of them for three or four marketdays successively if the distressed patient lives so long and if he is not recovered in that time they do as dr fuller relates of the people in cheshire make him a posset and tie an handkerchief on his head and if that will not mend him then god be merciful to him  here too suspended parsons idle schoolmasters barbersurgeons seasurgeons discarded broken london apothecaries decrepit mountebanks and any one that is unknown and has no other means of maintenance set up for prodigious doctors and every sect and party have one peculiarly qualified for themselves here comes one recommended by profligate immoralities another by poverty and a great heap of children a third sets up upon a stock of little or no learning and much selfconceit a fourth upon abundance of ignorance and want of business in the greatest place of business in the whole world some upon pretended cures in the unknown parts of it and others again boast their travels far at home and pass for unborn doctors celebrated corncutters and washers of fat brains  but to leave this tribe of unaccountables in their provoking practices till the hand of providence and justice brings them to their due deserts since the mischiefs they do are so flagrant the author is naturally induced by the course of his arguments to appeal to the legislative powers tho that was not his first design see beginning and end of this tract that our lawgivers cannot but be sensible of them and will sure ere long revive and reinforce that excellent statute of the  th of eliz and extend it to our faculty the intent of which was as is before intimated that no persons should take upon them any art mystery or trade but such wherein they had skill and knowledge according to that rule quod quisque norit in hoc se exerceat and i am sure it is not usual for skilful and modest men to pretend to understanding in any art or science before they have attained to it by an assiduous and regular course of study and a practical habit there are some diseases in which an old nurse cannot kill and in such some of these sort of doctors as they are called and our daring rural apothecaries gain amongst the mobile immortal praises there are other distempers which the best physician cannot cure cases that no physician was it not the duty of his calling would desire to have any thing to do with viz as where any of these pretenders have been dabbling and tampering before he was called in and have put the patient out of all hopes or in the confluent smallpox purples spotted and malignant fevers diseases not far behind the plague and although he does all that he ought as a man of knowledge and honesty yet commonly if through their former male practices or the ungovernableness of the patient or the prevailing humor of those about him he does not cure it shall be imputed to him as mistake or ignorance rashness or want of requisite courage inadvertency or neglect he shall be spoken against because he cant do miracles retrieve what others have lost or stay the omnipotent hand of god himself but he shall certainly be defamed country apothecaries disingenuous decry all physicians who will not serve their base turns and caress any ignorant formalist that will if in all his proceedings he has not favored the apothecaries has not augemented their bills nor skreened their rashness and daring errors well say they this man was called in to mend but by this by that and the other has marred all and says mr mortarscraper if he does cure notwithstanding he labors under all these difficulties i could have done as much my self or i never saw in all my life a man recovered by such a simple method whereas the simpleness as well as knavery is in the wretch himself who whilst he regards his own advantage only he does not consider at all that the most simple and unmixed medicines are the best specificks of simple medicines specificks and will do wonders when administerd by a judicious hand but are frequently rendered useless if not noxious by being confounded in an heterogeneous hotchpotch a mixture contrived rather to give him an opportunity to enhanse his bill than for the benefit of the patient i cant avoid the impertinence of repetition frequently upon this provoking occasion nay and rather than not force a trade he will omit the most pertinent ingredient in the physicians bill and substitute another according to his own fancy or interest apothecaries make up bills unfaithfully vid   or malice serving him as one did the oracle when he asked whether the bird that he held in his hand under his cloak was alive or not being resolved beforehand to produce it dead had the god pronounced it alive and the cunning shaver goes on to recommend such a doctor as will serve his turn o thats a fine man he writes well that is plentifully divides apozems or juleps into little draughts electuaries into boluss etc writes well for the apothecary but ill for the poor patient who must pay for all and it is ten to one if this fine writer is not like the gunner that is said often to shoot well tho quite beside the mark  hence it comes to pass that the tribe of accurate formalists are caressed by the apothecaries because they cant well avoid concurring with them in all their vile practices and horrid impositions upon the patient they prescribe plentifully and cant well do otherwise if they follow the variety of forms their authors direct them to as if the multiplicity rather than the matter of the medicine made it effectual neither can they complain of the adulteration or badness of their medicines having no true knowledge of them indeed it is difficult to discover medicines when mixed thoroughly but by their missing in their usual effects nor dare they correct their extravagant bills given in to their patients for then they must lose their credit with them and shall be outed as fast as they were introduced into any family for it so falls out generally upon any indisposition that the apothecaries are first applyd to and if it proceeds so far that they cannot remedy it but rather render it dangerous then they are consulted what physician shall be made use of and to be sure an honest one who dares decry and discountenance these their abuses shall be postponed to these intruding gentlemen or i am ashamed to speak it to another regular physician that will act so unworthily as to disparage the faculty by these base compliances who and all the other tribe are but as mere stalkinghorses to their friends the sordid apothecaries galloping from one extremity of a county to another to skreen their abusive practices and that in extreme cases only or if they cant supplant him the conscientious physician by lies and crafty insinuations as has been more than once remarked they will effect it let him watch them as narrowly as he can by making up his prescriptions false by some succedaneum or corrupt drug or other rendering them ineffectual  sect xv country apothecaries keep but few and those very often had medicines indeed it is difficult for many country apothecaries to make up a bill faithfully having but very few medicines in their shops and few of them know how to make medicines and those that they have are frequently sophisticated to their hands by the wholesale london apothecaries who sell them to the druggists and the country apothecaries have them at secondhand from them too commonly as has been showed vid       or if they make them up themselves as many boast they do yet they make them up as false as the londoners can do and if an honest physician suspecting their veracity and make extravagant bills vid   and knowing their cheating craft contracts his prescription into a narrow compass abhorring to load his patient with things impertinent they will for that very reason demand the more extravagant rates for their vile compositions insinuating that the doctor was curious in the drugs and that they were dear etc what man of sense and honesty would not be enraged to see a country apothecarys bill run up to   l in a few days when it can be demonstrated that all the medicines taken by the patient were not worth thrice so many shillings and to see another take   s   d for a febrile julep as he called it made up with nothing more than spring water and sugar and a few drops of spirits of vitriol the whole with glass cork and all not worth three farthings  had pliny lived in these days and amongst us his observation n millia gentium fine medicis vivunt nee tamen ne medicina would have been inverted and instead of saying that thousands of nations lived without physicians but none without medicines he would have wondered how it should come to pass that in a kingdom a learned and ingenious people where physicians did so abound there should be no safe true and salutary medicines and remedies to be found amongst them but that all was corrupted and dear and cheat both medicines and medicinemakers omnia pessum eunt he would certainly have cried out and pronounced of the state of physic in england as bernard once did of the church of rome honest physicians are rare or rarely prosper through the artifices of the apothecaries viz mali ibi proficiunt boni deficiunt bad physicians hugely prosper but good ones are rarely to be found and if a good one should attempt a redress of these evils by erecting a dispensatory in his own house or by keeping a closet of choice medicines not to be had genuine and incorrupt if at all in some apothecaries shops in order to the better securing of the lives of his patients in difficult cases that might otherwise be endangered by the use of adulterated and ineffectual preparations and to keep up that little reputation that he may have acquired and although he gives away his advice and remedies both to the poor yet he shall be treated by country apothecaries worse than the physicians in london can be who subscribe to the dispensatory they will combine against him in such sort that nothing but the virulence of their own tongues can defeat their intended mischief and it is not to be imagined what an impression their artifices have upon many unthingking people not to mention the arguments of their friends and relations in their behalf stoutly persisted in stipulating for their credit tho it is thought on the contrary no crime but commendable in them to set up for doctors country apothecaries set up for physicians to invade the province profits and credit of a physician in all the places that they can intrude themselves into as is before observed or to supplant him by introducing any forward formalist that knows no better or if he does will act no better than to comply with their unjustifiable practices  in some of the eastern parts of england and in some counties even near to london i know physicians that keep dispensatories in their own houses very advantageously both to themselves and to the vicinity but in other parts a few discerning persons may commend a physician who thus lays himself out for the public advantage but encourage his enterprise little farther they are not easily led out of their old track they will say he is honest and at the same time censure his politics and question his understanding the rich that give him his praemium will grudgingly pay him little more than prime cost for his medicines and the middle sort of people esteem him no otherwise than as an apothecary thinking he has gain enough from his medicines tho sold for no more than they cost without giving him any fee and handycraftsmen cannot afford to give fees such as are now become customary it is well if they can pay for a medicine and the poor expect both advice and medicines gratis and too many parishofficers neglect them to barbarity and rather let some perish than pay much for their cure again the ignorance and credulity of country people very few country people will be persuaded to go through a requisite course of physic they run to the doctor when they think they shall be dead the disease abating they wait for nature to relieve them till nature is spent and if an honest physician would interpose and visit them as frequently as the necessity of their case requires they are apt to think him impertinent or if paid accordingly for attendance a dear extorting man and ignorant too if after all he chance not to be successful and the apothecary and pisspot doctor to be preferred before him tho the mismanagement lies wholly at their own door and the whole clan of pretenders to physic and the apothecaries especially will traduce him and acquaint all their customers with this instance of his ignorance or he killed such a one as sure as gods in gloucester and will never leave off to vilify and oppose him till they have ruind his character if it lies in their power with the vulgar especially who are the major part of the people  and as the gentry commonly employ one or other of these sort of men when they hear them so unanimously speak against him they too are very apt to suspect his judgment and to be shy of coming under his hands for no other reason but because tom such a one has been their apothecary for many years and can surely judge a little of a physician and he dont affect him or because their friend esquire such a one did not approve his methods or because he is of this or that damnd party and that blemish generally affects a man for people of different parties judge and condemn one another rather by their own tenets the prevalence of party interest than by the truth and when they have by any of these trite methods lessened his credit they presently assume a superiority over him in all cases and set up for censors of the performances of the best physicians that may appear amongst them  sect xvi barbersurgeons aspire to be eminent doctors and not only these assuming apothecaries but barbersurgeons are made use of as physicians by many persons even of the best sort in their wiser and advanced years and that in all cases some of which whether they understand or not they are seen to treat in a very rude manner and yet their patients applaud and endure imagining surely that these mercurial medicasters who perhaps relieved their juvenile disasters are the best judges of all their other diseases and of their phlegmatic constitutions broken by old age and luxury  thus it comes to pass that these pretenders are buoyed up and the far greatest numbers of the sick not only in the country but also in london are committed to the care of ignorant audacious disqualified and unlawful intruders into the practice of physic and thus it becomes scarce possible for an honest regular physician to do any good to his patients or to himself and to retrieve the honor of the profession tho he endeavor it by all the engaging methods that can be thought on how shall a conscientious modest undesigning man who cannot comply with these unfair dealings these wicked and dangerous practices and who has nothing to depend upon after he has expended his portion in his education in one of our universities but his profession      and the candor i might rather say the perverseness of this retrograde and degenerate generation live amongst them one asked sometime how it was that in athens so goodly and so great a city there were no physicians to whom this answer was made because there are no rewards appointed for them that practice physic we read see the story i athenaeus that one cleon too only a songster had a statue at thebes kept as sacred when pindar himself had none the like reason may be given for the poverty and neglect of abundance of our modern worthy professors of that art for though they are entitled to respect and rewards yet the present prevailing ill customs of the age have deprived them even of the precarious ways of receiving the same and the only relief they meet with is this common retort si populus vult  if people will be imposed upon let them  all which is owing to a general insensibility whilst not a man looks upon it his duty to consider and know what he is about and how important and valuable a thing health is and the care they ought to take in the conservation of it but all love to go on in the stupid way of their forefathers or the company they are in without reflection and choose to join in the delusion with others rather than believe their senses and their own experience and judge for themselves whilst they resolve to be ignorant of what they fear at the same time and of the dangers they expose themselves to and suffer those very persons to go on with impunity that most grossly impose upon them and who dares correct them their impudence exceeds and is got beyond all reasonable restraint and where argument and persuasion the laws ought to restrain these abuses         founded upon truths and fact cannot reduce offenders and the deluded the law ought to take place and compel   in vitium libertas excidit and vim dignam lege regi  for my own part i give up the cause doubting there is no remedy i give up the cause no redress of our grievances to be obtained and i have not looked into these irregularities and mismanagements to expose the faculty invitus ea tanquam vulnera attingo sed nisi tacta tractataque sanari non possunt i touch upon them unwillingly and as raw sores which nevertheless cannot be healed except they are handled and probed to the bottom though after all i need not mince the matter it is not unbecoming but praiseworthy to reprehend persons that will not amend what they are conscious is a crime though they are unwilling to acknowledge it or to hear of it i ought rather to conclude with a father of the church upon another occasion  quid me loqui pudeat quod illos non pudeat facere si pudeat audire quod impudenter egerant non pudeat emendare quod libenter non audiant why should i be ashamed to speak of those things that they are not ashamed to do if they are ashamed to hear of their bad actions let them not be ashamed to reform what is so grievous to them to hear of and let them not rail when they are reproved lest more of their roguery should be discovered  surely there is not an instance in any nation of such barefaced abuses such violence and dishonor done to the faculty as there is in this there is no nation under the sun that is civilized and not utterly overrun with ignorance and delusion permits so many circumforaneous mountebanks empirickapothecaries surgeonbarbers pisspot doctors or casters of waters as they are called nurses and silly old women to administer medicines and to destroy people without being called to an account for it as england does  sect xvii a remedy against these epidemical evils proposed vid   and no remedy against all these recited evils seems so feazible and promising as the giving due encouragement to our physicians that are bred up in our own academies and the making a law to punish and effectually to restrain and suppress all unqualified intruders into the faculty plato banished the famous homer from his imaginary commonwealth and if this divine philosopher would not suffer the most celebrated and excellent poets because they might corrupt the morals of the people with their lewd fictions etc certainly those that poison and destroy them whilst they pretend to heal and preserve them deserve to be banished also but an honest physician placed in every market town or in a division or hundred of a county and a dispensatory where medicines may be had at little more than prime cost kept in his own house and infirmaries erected must needs be hugely serviceable to all sorts of people  physicians fees should be regulated and the princes of bills for medicines taxed but then his fees should be moderated and reduced from that extravagant pitch to which some now advance them and also be ascertained with allowances for riding long journeys and nightwork and the reasonableness of this proposal is evident as also for that of restraining the apothecaries etc from going out of their shops and practicing since all means of making them just and faithful and of moderating the prices of their bad medicines have hitherto proved ineffectual what success can be expected if a pertinent bill or prescript of an honest physician is not truly made up and how this can be done by many country apothecaries especially the premises considered rightly i leave any judicious and impartial person to determine  to the popular objection objections answered and other persons that now practice physic and sell medicines were to be suppressed and the price of their commodities lowered to the degrees of profit arising from other goods they must either starve or take upon them some other ways of maintenance and thus an useful order and community of men must sink and be lost to the commonwealth etc it is answered it is but just and reasonable they should thus suffer rather than go on in their mischievous ways of enriching themselves at the expense and destruction of the estates and lives of the rest tully tells us illud quidem natura non patitur ut aliorum spoliis nostras facultates copias opes augeamus and to the same purpose speak the rules of the jure naturae aequum est neminem cum alterius detrimento and injuria fieri locupletiorem nemo ex suo delicto meliorem suam conditionem facere porest civil law it is as unnatural and unlawful to support and enrich our selves by the spoils and open oppression of our neighbors as by our own private crimes and secret villainies and in all well regulated governments incorrigible delinquents and all combined societies that are found dangerous and detrimental to the good and safety of the whole have been always cut off and suppressed according to that of the poet   immedicabile vulnus ense recidendum est ne pars sincera trabatur neither can their reduction to their wonted stations amongst the grocers and chandlers be such a mighty detriment and disgrace to them as they would fain insinuate since such great numbers of them in the country towns especially vend greater quantities of goods in the grocery chandlers and distillers or rather in the way of ginshops as is the modern term for the places where they sell drams of base spirits than they do in the way of pharmacy and so they become in some measure serviceable and promote the trade of the nation though when they go out of their way and move in a sphere above their capacity they are so far from doing good that they do incredible damage they not only defraud but kill men  i think there is no man of right understanding but must hold this maxim salus populi suprema lex the good the health and safety of the people the supreme law and the end of entering into corporations or societies that the supreme law of all is the safety of the people and that all government was ordained by the institution of god for the good and security the health and happiness of mankind and that men have voluntarily resolved themselves into societies for the mutual preservation and assistance of one another selfpreservation being the primary aim of every individual and since that cannot be effected without mutual assistance it is natural for a man to promise to others those aids and helps that he would expect from them on the like occasions hence arise all the obligations a man lays himself under when he enters into a civil society upon this foot all corporations and societies of tradesmen and indeed for the encouragement of liberal sciences are founded and every man those that obviate and subvert these ends ought to be extirpated or society of men that apparently subverts the very ends of those compacts ought not only to be debarred the common privileges of but also to be expelled the said society of which he is become such an unworthy member so as instead of using his utmost endeavors for the preservation of the life and health of his fellowcitizens he becomes instrumental in their destruction as no man can give another power to kill him because the consent is unnatural and in itself null and void so no community or people can give any persons power to destroy them either directly or by consequence because their becoming a community or a nation governed by laws was for their preservation and it is preposterous that the means should be destructive of the end but how little different from this is our present case when the very order of men who are instituted to be conservators of our health consequentially at least and the means they pretend to use in order thereto are so egregiously corrupted as too frequently to become our destroyers a man may give me power to give him physic but not poison  the abused art of the apothecary not so necessary as is the science of the physician and if the faculty of physic is by so many illiterate bold and dishonest intruders into that otherwise sacred art so far corrupted that there is a necessity of examining into the abuses thereof and to rectify the same in order to the preservation of the health and lives of the people and consequently that the branches of it that are found not only useless but pernicious should be dismembered i need not ask every one must readily agree that it is safest and most for the advantage of the nation for an illiterate inferior the nation has not need of and we can do without apothecaries but we cannot do without physicians base and abusive set of mechanics to be laid aside or made to turn their hands to other occupations to which they are better adapted than for a learned noble necessary liberal science to be neglected discouraged and rendered useless in this trading potent and flourishing kingdom and as we affect to be accounted this wise and learned nation in short after all that has been said i need not go about to prove it is selfevident that the abused art of the apothecaries is not necessary that we can do much better without them and they much better not so much mischief by laying aside that and pursuing some other ways of livelihood but that the science of the physicians is absolutely necessary we cannot do without them nor well without their faculty is better regulated and more encouraged  our world is turned upside down truth fails there is no judgment isa lix    etc but the case stands now quite otherways we see the reverse of all this amongst us perverse custom prevails and turns all things topsyturvy truth fails and he that departs from evil makes himself a prey as said the prophet there was no judgment we dont judge of men and things according to the measures that nature and right reason dictate to us but suffer ourselves to be imposed upon in every thing and our passions and interest prevail in all our deportment we dont esteem ourselves for those accomplishments which superior beings think valuable virtue integrity and knowledge are of small account as few men square their actions by these rules so they dont use to cast them into their balance but every one is apt to measure his understanding by the extent of his acres and his goodness by the length of his purse or the party he espouseth to think no man happy that is not rich and he that is let him acquire his wealth how he will the only man to be regarded and that none are wise who do not think and say and do at this rate  reformers are generally the subject of hatred reflection and ridicle and persecuted and if a man emerges once in an age who has the conscience and courage to detect and decry these fatal though fashionable errors and the guilty begin with demetrius to fear that their wicked craft shall be brought to naught it is natural for them to hate him and persecute him to the utmost of their power and to prepossess mens minds with groundless suggestions against him and to secure their affections to themselves that they may be sure to begin to hate him before they know him and his worthy proposals for fear that by knowing them they should be constrained to fall in with them or at least they should not be able to find how to condemn him  but let me not digress it is to be feared arguments will prevail but little on this occasion nothing but the legislative authority can redress this great and prevailing evil and it repents me that i had not addressed some worthy member of it who might have introduced these affecting complaints into the august assembly in which that is lodged in such sort as might have entitled them to a favorable audience but as i had laid no scheme had nothing in view but to lay open the truth and matters of fact which i thought would support themselves so consequently i did not know or at least did not at the beginning of my discourse rightly consider whither it might tend nor what consequences and conclusions might be inferred from it but not to trouble my reader with apologetic impertinence the legislative authority addressed for relief against these great evils as the last refuge and resort though that was not at first the intent of the author vid           if the author of these sheets and his methods to remedy these dangerous mischiefs are thought frivolous and insufficient it is high time for the wisdom of the nation to concert better and it is to be hoped that the parliament of great britain will ere long do our universities justice since there is no nation besides as a worthy gentleman has remarked where the professors of its universities have not the liberty of exercising their profession in any part thereof without such interruption and unheard of violence offered to their persons and characters and surely stupidity and ignorance and a disregard to all literature and religious education is not so predominant nor the concern for the health and safety of the people so cold and indifferent that the representative body of our own nation will think our peoples lives of less value than those of other regions or our own universities the least considerable in europe  and when the people are undeceived by this interposing authority it is to be hoped these disorders will be at an end these irregular intruders and unqualified invaders of this noble learned and necessary science will be suppressed and all due encouragement afforded to our regular physicians who justly and that for the good and advantage of the nation in general as well as for their own just dues and private emolument and subsistence claim a redress of these grievances since all orders of men expect to have justice done their characters rights and interests from the end and design of their institution and from a general account of their conduct and not from the ill management of a few or the introduction of some irregular customs which they could not foresee and cannot yet prevent  finis
