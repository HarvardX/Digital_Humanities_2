alonzo  a tragedy in five acts as it is performed at the theater royal drury lane  et mentem strinxit patriae pietatis imago virgil london printed for t becket in the strand mdcclxxiii  prince one shilling and sixpence  advertisement the author of the following tragedy has in his former attempts of the same kind avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication or preface his chief reason for declining this common mode of appearing before the public was the necessity which it would lay him under of speaking concerning himself and his works the success of alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan and to break that silence which might now be reckoned arrogant and even ungrateful to those from whom he in a great measure derives his success  he embraces with pleasure this occasion to acknowledge his obligations to the managers of the theater whose friendly anxious and active zeal he has so often experienced to the performers who have so strenuously contended with each other in their very generous endeavors to embellish the representation of the piece to mrs barry  but the public voice has exalted her above his praise yet he claims the merit of having before others observed her now allowed and unrivalled excellency from the color of the dawn he foretold the brightness of the day  for mrs barry he wrote the part of ormisinda and the most flattering circumstance to him in the success of his play is the universal opinion vouched not only by the loudest applause that ever shook the stage but by the greatest effusion of tears that the actress so much exalted the character that she exceeded all imagination and reached the summit of perfection  prologue spoken by mr palmer whilst ardent zeal for indias reformation has fired the spirit of a generous nation whilst patriots of presented lacks complain and courtiers bribery to excess arraign the maxims of bengal still rule the stage the poets are your slaves from age to age like eastern princes in this house you sit the soubahs and nabobs of suppliant wit each bard his present brings when he draws near with prologue first he sooths your gracious ear we hope your clemency will shine to day for though despotic gentle in your sway these conscious walls if they could speak would tell how seldom by your doom a poet fell your mercy often suspends the critics laws your hearts are partial to an authors cause pleased with such lords content with our condition against your charter we will never petition if certain folks should send us a committee like that which lately visited the city who without special leave of our directors at the stage door should enter as inspectors although their hearts were armed with triple brass through our resisting scenes they could not pass lions and dragons too keep watch and ward witches and ghosts the awful entrance guard heroes who mock the pointed sword are here and desperate heroines who know no fear if as rinaldo stout each man should prove to brave

with alonzo the story of my son my injured child bred in a desert though the heir of spain to thee my faithful friend my loved teresa this precious record i commit oh keep it from sight of human eye till better times for still i hope that better times may come though not to me to this afflicted land my hand has signed it and my act to day shall give it faith and credence with mankind this will explain the mystery of my fate and tell the world why ormisinda died  gives the writing teresa do not too soon despair   ormisinda i wait the last decisive moment but to guard my soul against the sallies of a rash despair against the weakness which attends surprise i have forecast whatever may befall and framed to the event my firm resolve this is the day appointed for the combat between a moorish and a christian knight to end the wars of spain and fix the fate of the contending nations  teresa ancient times if tales of ancient times may be believed have known such combats in her infant state against her rival alba rome was pledged as now asturia is but later times afford no parallel  ormisinda there never was nor will there ever while the world endures be found a parallel to my distress  i am the victors prize  whoever prevails he gains the princess and the crown of spain such is the solemn treaty sworn confirmed by every rite which either nation owns mean while i am alonzos wedded wife  i am a mother  by the false alonzo who from his hate to me abandons spain which he alone can save no other arm can match mirmallons force proud of his strength already in the lists the moor exults secure of victory the setting sun concludes the dreadful period of suspense and death alone from infamy can save me  teresa he yet may come far in the nubian wilds that guard the secret sources of the nile velasco found the chief the wind of spring the constant east this year forgot its season and only since this moon her light renewed began to blow upon the western shore on that i build a hope  ormisinda i have no hope review the story of my life teresa and by the past conjecture of the future first my lamented brother blindly led by proud ramirez quarreled with alonzo then by alonzos sword ramirez fell for that offense to banishment condemned alonzo won me to accept his hand before he left this kingdom since that time what i have suffered heaven and you can tell it was the fifth a memorable day after our marriage when he failed to come at the appointed place to meet his bride then midst my fear anxiety and sorrow for only death i thought or dangerous harm could keep him from my arms amazed i heard that he was gone for asia to this hour even to this present hour no cause assigned but these distracted lines long after sent thou never shall behold alonzo more the foul foul cause thy guilty conscience knows my conscience knows no cause so help me heaven now in my utmost need this dreadful day when i must struggle with despair and death to keep myself a chaste a blameless wife and to my silent grave the secret bear that my dear son and his may live to wield the scepter of his fathers  teresa to this hour thy husband knows not that he is a father  ormisinda his ears his eyes are shut often have i sent letters that would have piered an heart of stone pleading for pity begging but to know wherein i had unwittingly offended but every letter with unbroken seal to me returned he will not read one word from my detested hand  teresa it is very strange and much unlike the way of other men for though they are inconstant in their love there is a course and process in the change ardent at first their ardor lasts not long with easy full secure possession cloyed their passion palls and cold indifference comes as chilly autumn steals on summers prime making the green leaf yellow then it is that some new beauty takes their roving eyes and fires their fancy with untasted charms but in a moment from excess of love to the extreme of hate alonzo passed without a cause nor did another come between thee and the current of his love it is moonstruck madness or the dire effect of incantation charm compulsive spell by magie fastened on his wretched soul it can be nothing else  ormisinda whatever it is he shuns all womankind his life is spent in war and in devotion when the field is won the warrior lays aside his spear takes up the pilgrims staff and all alone obscured in homely weeds he bends his course to some remote religious holy place where he exceeds the strictest penitent in penances severe and sad austerity sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapped he loathes the sight of man and to the cliffs of hoary caucasus or atlas flies where all the dreary winterhe remains and desolate delights in desolation my faithful fervant juan saw him once upon the ledge of atlas on a rock beside the empty channel of a brook he stood and gazed intent a cataract which as it tumbled from a cliff the blast had caught midway and froze before it fell juan drew near and called he turned about looked at him for a space then waved him back and mounting swiftly sunk behind the hill wan was his face and like a statue pale his eye was wild and haggard oh teresa amidst my woes my miseries my wrongs my bosom bleeds for him  teresa something there is mysterious and unfathomable here which passes human wisdom to divine the hand of fate is on the curtain now within my breast a firm persuasion dwells that in the lists alonzo will appear behold in haste the king your father comes and seems the messenger of welcome tidings  enter the king king i come in this alarming hour my child to pour a ray of comfort on thy heart a valiant moor once captive of my sword and ever since my firm but secret friend acquaints me that a champion is at hand shunning those honors which the moors would pay dark and reserved he travels through their towns without a name i judge it is alonzo for the description best accords with him scorning his foes offended with his friends shrouded in anger and in deep disdain like some prime planet in eclipse he moves gazed at and feared  ormisinda it is it is alonzo welcome most welcome in whatever shape the hero comes to save his native land to save the honor of the christian name and over the fading crescent of the moor exalt the holy cross  king and even as thine is the consenting voice of all the land the hope of spain on brave alonzo rests in this i see the ruling hand of heaven which to its own eternal purpose leads by winding paths the steps of erring man painful it were to speak of those events sad and disastrous which have laid us low unjustly was alonzo banished hence and happily the hero now returns for since my son your valiant brother fell with an impartial mind i have inquired and traced the story of alonzos birth he is the offspring of our ancient kings the rightful heir of riccaredos line called the catholic who reigned in spain before the first invasion of the moors lost in the general wreck buried and hid beneath the ruins of a fallen state obscure unknown the royal infant lay when i indignant of a foreign yoke in wild asturia rose against the moors the righteous cause prevailed the baffled foe retired and left us and our mountains free the grateful people chose their leader king i knew not then nor did my people know ought of alonzo  ormisinda i have heard him own the justice of thy title to command and rule the state thy valor had restored enough he said remained for him to conquer the fertile provinces of ample spain which still the moor usurps  king of all mankind he is the champion whom my soul desires this day to fight for spain and for my aughter not only for his great renown in arms but for his birth his lineage and his blood if his unconquered arm in fight prevails the ancient monarchy shall rise again in all its splendour and extent of empire the streams of royal blood divided now shall roll a tide united through the land  ormisinda thy heart dilates with pleasing hopes my father and fond anticipates its own desire but who can tell the purpose of alonzo his strange approach no friendly aspect bears he comes the foe determined of the moors but not to us a friend  king of that no fear i know him proud impetuous and fierce haughty of heart and high of hand too prompt on all occasions to appeal to arms but he was ever gentle to my daughter the proud alonzo bowed the knee to thee at his departure i observed thy grief and in my mind   a trumpet sounds ormisinda what means that shout of war   king the trumpet sounds to arms   enter a messenger messenger thy presence sir is at the camp required both nations arm and rush to battle loud the moors complain of violated faith a spanish knight they say has broke the treaty and attacked their bands of peace secure  king it is basely done command my guards to meet me at the gate farewell  exit the king teresa who can this headlong warrior be too well alonzo knows the laws of war too much reveres the treaty feald and sworn to make a rash attempt upon the moors  ormisinda if it is he it is no deliberate act no treacherous intention to assail the moors unguarded yet it may be he my mind misgives me that it is alonzo ill would his swelling spirit brook the sight of moorish tents and arms on yonder plain if as he passed one slighting word was dropped with tenfold scorn to that he would reply nor hesitate alone to draw his sword amidst an host of moors  teresa the clamor sinks whatever it was the tumult is appeased and now what does my ormisinda think of my predictions  ormisinda oh my dear teresa thy fond desire to cheer my hopeless heart makes thee forever to my mind present the fairest side of things  teresa ha do thou doubt still of his coming  ormisinda no i think it is he but hope and fear alternate sway my mind like light and shade upon a waving field coursing each other when the flying clouds now hide and now reveal the sun of heaven i tremble for the issue of the combat and if my lord should as i hope prevail i tremble for myself afraid to see though sick with strong impatience to behold him and learn why he forsook his ormisinda he says i know the cause oh most unjust was it because i loved him to excess although his title shook my fathers throne was it because i joined my fate to his and fondly chose to wed a banished man for such are my demerits  teresa it is but vain thus to torment thyself and rack thy mind with sad conjectures at a time like this when the reality will soon be known  ormisinda i know one thing that is real it is a fault an imperfection which i cannot cure sixteen long years are past since i beheld him and grief and care those tenants that deface the sad and weary mansion they inhabit have dwelt with me am i not altered much the ghost and shadow of what once i was  teresa no ormisinda i perceive no change that in the least impairs thy lovely form the beam that gilds the early morn of youth yields to the splendour of a riper hour the rose that was so fair in bud is blown and grief and care though they have dwelt with thee have left no traces of their visitation but an impression sweet of melancholy which captivates the soul unskilful they who dress the queen of love in wanton smiles brightest she shines amidst a shower of tears the graces that adorn her beauty most are sostness sensibility and pity  ormisinda oh how ingenious thou art teresa how subtle to elude my simple fears still they advance and gather round my heart if nothing can recall alonzos love let him but own his son and i will renounce the title of his wife and of a queen then in a convent hide me and my sorrows the saddest sister of the holy train whose watchful zeal prevents the midnight bell shall find me kneeling on the marble floor oh it will be the luxury of grief to weep incessant in the vaulted cell to lift my hands and send my vows to heaven invoking every power that dwells above to guard and bless my husband and my son perhaps some friend most likely my teresa when i am quite forsaken and forgot by all the world will still remember me will come and tell me of alonzos wars tell how my boy in his first battle fought at once the rival of his fathers fame  end of the first act act ii scene i enter the king and a moorish officer with moors and spaniards king hamet impartial justice shall be done and thou i know as justly wilt report it thou art the friend of peace  hamet therefore i sought this office for in yonder camp o king some counselors there are who urged the caliph to take advantage of this fair occasion and hold the treaty void  king that i believe but with your aid i hope to disappoint them my guards are gone to bring the offender hither  hamet yonder they come and through their files i see a prisoner  enter guards with a young man armed king ha by heaven he is but a youth a beardless boy and like a woman fair he moves my pity much unhappy youth to the prisoner art thou the chief of that unruly band who broke the treaty and assailed the moors  youth no chief no leader of a band am i the leader of a band insulted me and those he led basely assailed my life with bad success indeed if selfdefence be criminal o king i have offended  king  to hamet with what a noble confidence he speaks see what a spirit through his blushes breaks observe him hamet  hamet i am fixed upon him   king did thou alone engage a band of moors and make such havoc sure it cannot be recall thyscattered thoughts nothing advance which proof may overthrow  youth what i have said no proof can overthrow where is the man who speaking from himself not from reports and rumors idle will stand forth and say i was not single when the moors attacked me  hamet i will not be that man though i confess that i came hither to accuse thee youth and to demand thy punishment  i brought the tale our soldiers told  youth the tale was false   hamet i thought it true but thou have shook my faith the seal of truth is on thy gallant form for none but cowards lie  king thy story tell with every circumstance which may explain the seeming wonder how a single man in such a strife could stand  youth twill cease to be a wonder when thou hearst the story told this morning on my road to oviedo a while i halted near a moorish post of the commander i inquired my way and told my purpose that i came to see the famous combat with a scornful smile with taunting words and gestures he replied mocking my youth advised me to return back to my fathers house and in the ring to dance with boys and girls he added too that i should see no combat that no knight of spain durst meet the champion of the moors incensed i did indeed retort his scorn the quarrel grew apace and i defied him to a green hill which rose amidst the plain an arrows flight or farther from his post alone we sped at once we drew we fought the moorish captain fell enraged his men flew to revenge his death secure they came each with his utmost speed those who came first single i met and slew more wary grown the rest together joined and all at once assailed me then i had no hopes of life but suddenly a troop of spaniards came and charged my foes who did not long sustain the shock but fled and carried to their camp that false report which thou o king have heard  king now by my scepter and my sword i swear thou art a noble youth an angels voice could not command a more implicit faith than thou from me have gained what think thou hamet is he not greatly wronged  hamet by allah yes the voice of truth and innocence is bold and never yet could guilt that tone assume i take my leave impatient to return and satisfy my friends that this brave youth was not the aggressor  king i expect no less from generous hamet   exit hamet and moors king tell me wondrous youth for much i long to know what is thy name who are thy parents since the moor prevailed thecottage and the cave have often concealed from hostile hate the noblest blood of spain thy spirit speaks for thee thou art a shoot of some illustrious stock some noble house whose fortunes with their falling country fell  youth alberto is my name i draw my birth from catalonia in the mountains there my father dwells and for his own domains pays tribute to the moor he was a soldier often i have heard him of your battles speak of cavadongas and olalles field but ever since i can remember ought his chief employment and delight have been to train me to the use and love of arms in martial exercise we past the day morning and evening still the theme was war he bred me to endure the summers heat and brave the winters cold to swim across the headlong torrent when the shoals of ice drove down the stream to rule the fiercest steed that on our mountains run no savage beast the forest yields that i have not encountered meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game i longed in arms to meet the foes of spain often i implored my father to permit me before the truce was made to join the host he said it must not be i was too young for the rude fervice of these trying times  king did he permit you now   alberto a strange adventure forced me from home not many days ago when hunting in the woods i heard a voice a womans voice calling aloud for help i rushed into the thicket there i saw a moorish lord for brutal license famed who shamefully abused a rural maid of spanish race i freed her from his arms the moor spoke not a word but mad with rage snatched up his lance which stood against a tree and at me flew i turned his point aside and with a slender javelin pierced his heart i hastened home but did not find my father nor was it sase to wait for his return i took the fairest armor in the hall and hither bent my course the rest thou know  king thou art a prodigy and fillft my mind with thoughts profound and expectation high when in a nation humbled by the will of providence beneath an haughty foe a person rises up by nature reared sublime above the level of mankind like that bright bow the hand of the most high bends in the watery cloud he is the sign of prosperous change and interposing heaven and thou if right i read   enter messenger messenger the champion sir who comes to fight for spain is near at hand one of our scouts has seen him and his trian but brings a strange report which damps the heart of every spaniard it is not alonzo  king what say thou god of heaven not alonzo who is he then  messenger that is not fully known clad in the flowing vesture of the east a persian turban on his head he wears yet he is a christian knight to mark his falth holy and adverse to mohammeds law before his steps a silken banner borne streams in the wind and shows a golden cross  king send out another scout   messenger there is not time to go and to return  king begone begone and let me be obeyed alas my hopes are vanished like a dream  alberto i grieve to see the king afflicted  king ah thou do not know how deep these tidings strike  alberto is not the king free to accept or to refuse the aid this stranger offers  king if i am what then   alberto be not offended sir at my presumption for from my heart i speak a loyal heart true to my sovereign and my native land if this is not alonzo why should he or any stranger fight the cause of spain are there not warriors born of spanish race who court the combat  king to my words attend the moorish champion is of great renown in stature like the giant race of old like anaks true or titans fabled sons against the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts but in his might secure a mace he wields whose sway resistless breaks both shield and arm and crushes head and helmet thus he fights whose fatal prowess turned the doubtful scale of three successive battles he is deemed invincible but by alonzos arm therefore our warriors though they know no fear no fear of ought that can themselves befall anxious for spain to great alonzo yield and on his valor rest  alberto often have i heard my father speak of brave alonzos deeds what can withold him when his country calls perhaps the last of combats he has fought and in the silent tomb the hero rests but since he is absent from whatever cause o let no stranger knight his place assume to bring dishonor on the spanish name if this gigantic champion of the moors clad in the glory of his battles won dazzles the warriors and confounds their valor let me though young in arms the combat claim on me his fame has no impression made i will meet the giant with a fearless heart it beats for battle now often have i killed the wolf the boar and the wild mountain bull for sport and pastime shall this moorish dog resist me fighting in my countrys cause  king by heaven and earth thou movst me much thy words have stirred the embers of my youthful fire thou make me wish i could recall those days when of an age like thine and not unlike to thee in face and form i raised the spear against the moor in cavas bloody field then by my hand the great alchammon fell the strength and pillar of the caliphs host then i was sit to meet mirmallons arm but now my hairs are gray my steps are slow my sword descending breaks the shield no more our foes have known it long  alberto o king thou art thy countrys great delivrer and the sole restorer of the state pelagios fame shall never die but let thy counsel now as often thy valor save this land from shame let not a foreign warrior take the field and snatch the glory from the lance of spain  king my voice alone cannot determine that the council sit assembled near the lists to them i will present thee if this knight unknown who from that distant egion comes where the bright sun lights up his golden lamp bears not some high preeminence about him which marks him out our surest safest choice my voice is for a spaniard and for thee  alberto upon my knees that never were bowed before to mortal man i thank thee  king rise alberto to me no thanks are due a greater king the king of kings i deem has chosen thee to be the champion of his law divine against the insidel  if not for this for some great purpose sure thou art ordained bred in the desert and by heaven endued with force and valor marvellously great conducted by a hand unseen thyself not knowing whither and this day produced before the nations  alberto ah my souls on fire should such a glorious destiny be mine may i entreat to go without delay i fear some gallant warrior may step forth and claim the fight before me  king stay sebastian and to my daughter tell what has befallen  exeunt king and alberto manet sebastian how many changes mark this awful day what must the princess suffer well i know that she above all others wished alonzo  enter ormisinda and teresa teresa it is a false report in times like these the minds of men are credulous and weak to rumors shifting blast they bow and bend like corn of slender reed to every wind thou know that from the east alonzo comes might not the hasty messenger mistake for him some turband warrior of his train  ormisinda o good sebastian can thou tell me ought is it alonzo  sebastian if report speaks truth and so the king believes it is not alonzo  ormisinda then i am lost teresa   teresa have thou heard if not alonzo who this stranger is  sebastian his garb bespeaks him native of the east but from whatever clime the warrior comes i hope my princess that he comes in vain another warrior and of spanish race now claims the combat for his native land  ormisinda of spanish race who is this knight of spain   sebastian a wonder never was his equal seen for daring valor and address in arms he has not yet attained the prime of youth his look partakes more of the boy than man but he has vanquished men this day the moors have felt his hand  ormisinda ha is it he sebastian who was the author of the late alarm  sebastian the same   ormisinda and whence does this young hero come   sebastian from catalonia in the deserts there his sire obscure though once a warrior dwells  ormisinda from catalonia in the desert bred teresa all that is possible i fear what if this youth   teresa  to ormisinda o think how many youths of spanish race in catalonia dwell be recollected whilst i ask sebastian a question that at once all doubt resolves to sebastian has this youth no name have thou not heard how he is called  sebastian he calls himself alberto   ormisinda mother of god   teresa  to her beware  the princess grieves to sebastian that spain deprived of great alonzos aid should rest her safety on a striplings arm  ormisinda no judge of warriors or of combats i but sure this youth though never so brave and bold of tender years who has not reached his prime is most unfit to cope with strong mirmallon  sebastian heroes must not be judged by common rules irregular like comets in their course who can compute the period when they shine lady if thou had seen this gallant youth if thou had heard him when obliged to speak in selfdefence he told his wondrous deed as if he though them nothing thy faint heart would from his fire have caught the flame of hope thou wouldt even as thy royal father did believe he was created and ordained by heaven supreme the champion of his country  teresa sebastian go and find this gallant youth tell him the princess partial to the brave desires his presence  sebastian gladly i obey    exit sebastian ormisinda he is gone now i may speak my son my son my hope my comfort in despair and death the only star in my dark sky that shone must thy unhappy mother live to see thy light extinguished i will not permit this most unequal combat i will proclaim my fatal story and declare his birth  teresa think what must follow absolute perdition   ormisinda is not his death perdition can be meet the moor and live how should his tender youth resist the giant who has overthrown squadrons entire and trampled on the necks of firmest warriors  teresa it is not yet decreed that he shall fight the moor the stranger knight who was at first mistaken for alonzo comes not so far without a name in arms to gain the suffrage of the peers of spain when once that name is known  ormisinda teresa no my fate has still one even tenor held from bad to worse when i had framed my mind to one disaster then a greater came i had made death familiar to my thoughts i could embrace the spectre like a friend but still i kept a corner of my heart safe and untouched my dearest child was there amidst the ruins of the wife and queen the mother stood secure o thou alonzo if yet thine eyes behold the light of day what sorrow and remorse must be thy portion when thou shall hear  now promise me teresa that when my son and i are laid in dust for each event accelerates our doom thou will seek out and find this cruel man tell him how spain the kingdom of his fathers by him deserted was for ever lost how his forsaken wife in honor died  but that is not much  for me he will not mourn then tell him of is son to wring his heart truly describe the boy how brave he was how beautiful how from the cloud obscure in which his careful mother had involved him he burst the champion of his native land then tell him how the springing hero fell  a stronger arm fighting for spain and for his mother fighting with the foe his father should have fought and could have vanquished  teresa sebastian comes   enter sebastian sebastian all is reversed again the stranger knight is for abdallah know the persian prince alonzos chosen friend his only equal in the strife of arms to him the combat is decided  ormisinda i know his story well he is the sophys son the eldest born and persias rightful heir but by his mothers zeal a christian bred true to his faith he lost his fathers throne what says he of alonzo  sebastian sent by him the brave abdallah comes to fight for spain they marched together from the falls of nile to damietta there a wound received in asias wars broke out and forced alonzo full of regret in egypt to remain his friend for him appears the king they father with all his peers in honor of the prince go forth to meet him  ormisinda have thou seen alberto   sebastian i have and told him what i had in charge then hastened hither to report these tidings at which alberto droops  teresa return i pray to my apartment guide the young alberto the princess will be there  exit sebastian did not i say alonzo never would abandon spain abdallah comes to conquer in his name now i can read the characters of fate and spell the will of heaven this boy of yours will win your husband back when he beholds the image of his valor so express his heart will melt the husband and the father will rush upon him with a flood of joy  ormisinda is he not like him mark his coming forth behold alonzo in his daring son full of the spirit of his warlike sire his birth unknown he felt his princely mind advanced undaunted on the edge of war and claimed the post of danger for his own  teresa a mothers tongue cannot exceed the truth in praising him there never was a prince since old iberia first excelled in arms broke out with so much luster on mankind but in this interview with prudence check the transport of affection from thy son cautions conceal the secret of his birth safest he is while to himself unknown  ormisinda how could his faithful guardian let him go perhaps that faithful guardian lives no more  teresa alberto will inform thee   ormisinda not alberto alonzo is his name i go to meet him  exeunt end of the second act act iii scene i a view of the country near the city enter abdallah o city once the seat of all i loved o hills and dales haunts ofmy youthful days o scenes well known unaltered you remain but i approach you with an altered mind hate what i loved and loath what i desired intolerable state my soul is void a chaos without form why nature why art thou so watchful over the brutal tribes and yet so careless of the human race by certain instinct beasts and birds discern their proper food for them the fairest fruit untouched if poisonous withers on the bough but man by a fair outside still deceived and by his boasted reason more betrayed gives the affection of his soul to beauty devours the deadly bane enter velasco my lord thy people where thou commandedst halt and wait thy coming  abdallah it is well i wished to speak with thee alone velasco though to thee but little known i did in part reveal my secret soul told thee the feigned abdallah was alonzo further than that thou have not sought to know though many a lonely hour we two have worn on sea and shore that some men would have thought most opportune  velasco my lord there are some men who having once been trusted with a little avail themselves of that some more to learn and penetrate the bosom of a friend even with the wedge his uneasiness had furnished  such men should not be trusted  abdallah true velasco but thou art not like them i have observed thee warm in affection but in temper cool a steady judgment guides thee through the world thy generous mind pursues the path of honor unbiased and unmoved  velasco from early youth the chosen consident of my companions i never yet from persidy betrayed from babbling vanity divulged a secret  abdallah i have a tale to tell that will amaze confound and strike thee dumb the deserts vast of asia and of africa have heard it the rocky cliffs of caucasus and atlas have echoed my complaints but never yet the human ear received them thou have heard already more than ever mortal did thou know the princess  velasco ormisinda   abdallah her   velasco not many of the court have been more honored with opportunities to know her worth and there is none who more her worth reveres  abdallah her worth thou may as well revere a fiend the blackest fiend that dwells in burning hell is not more opposite to all that is good than ormisinda  velasco what a strain is this   abdallah it is true by every high and holy name that binds a soldiers and a princes vow i swear velasco she is the vilest woman that ever disgraced her sex the most abandoned the hardiest most determined in her vice that ever wronged a fond believing heart  velasco great god   abdallah you start and shudder like a man struck with a heavy blow  velasco and so i am   abdallah and now you lift your eyelids up and stare with looks full of conjcture and suspicion as if you doubted of my sober mind i am not mad velasco though sometimes i have been near yes very near to madness by that bad woman crazed  velasco o would to heaven that this afflicting moment of my life were a delirious dream unreal all that is heard and spoken now but how my lord art thou so much affected by her crimes  abdallah i am her husband   velasco heaven for that be praised   abdallah how dare thou thus profane the name of heaven and mock my misery thou art mad i think the frenzy which thou wishedst has come upon thee beware for if this ecstasy endures my sword secures thy silence  velasco o forgive me noble alonzo royal i should say doubly my master now there is not a man whose veins contain one drop of spanish blood who does not wish thee wedded to the princess and for her virtue thou have long been absent reserved retired and sad i will stake my soul some villain has belied thy faithful wife and snared thy easy faith  abdallah take heed take heed i am the villain who accuse the princess and thou shall be her judge  velasco eternal power what should i think of this  abdallah listen to me i have perplexed thee and have marred the story by my abruptness it is a serious story not to be told in parcels and by starts as i from impotence of mind began but i will bear my swelling passion down and utter all my shame thou do remember how i was banished from my native land  velasco for killing young ramirez   abdallah at that time i doated on the princess she conjured me with earnest prayers with deluges of tears not to resist her father nor advance my better title to the crown of spain as i had once resolved my rage she soothed pride anger interest yielded all to love with her i made a merit of obedience and pleaded so effectually my cause that she consented to a private marriage before i left the kingdon we were married and met together four successive nights in the sequestered cottage of the wood behind the palace garden o i thought myself the happiest and the most beloved of all mankind she mocked me all the while meant me the cover of her loose amors a cloak to hide her shame o god o god did i deserve no better  velasco good my lord what circumstance to warrant such conclusion what evidence  abdallah the evidence of sight  mine eyes beheld i saw myself dishonored  velasco your eyes beheld   abdallah by heaven and hell  they did the night preceding the appointed day of my departure from the realm of spain i slew impatient to the place of meeting before the hour was come to wear away the tedious time for every minute seemed an age to me i struck into the wood and wandered there still steering to the gate by which she was to enter though the trees the moon full orbd in all her glory shone my amorous mind a sportful purpose formed unseen to watch the coming of my bride and wantonly surprise her near the gate there stood an aged tree it was a beech which far and wide stretched forth its level arms low near the ground and formed a gloomy shade behind its trunk i took my secret stand the gate was full in view and the green path on which it opened there i stood awhile and soon i heard the turning of the key my heart beat thick with joy  and forth she came  not as i wished she had a minion with her a handsome youth was tripping by her side girt with a sword and dressed in gay attire he seemed to court her as they passed along coy but not angry for i heard her laugh she flung away he followed soon oerttok her embraced her   velasco ah the princess ormisinda   abdallah i drew my sword that i remember well and then an interval like death ensued when consciousness returned i found myself stretched at my length upon the naked ground under the tree my sword lay by my side the sudden shock the transport of my rage and grief had stopped the current of my blood and made a pause of life  velasco alas my lord twas piteous indeed what did thou do when life and sense returned  abdallah with life and sense my rage returned stumbling with haste i ran to sacrifice them to my just revenge but whether they had heard my heavy fall or that my deathlike swoon had lasted long i know not but i never saw them more i searched till morning then away i went resolved to scorn the strumpet and forget her but i have not been able to forget nor to despise her though i hate her more than ever i loved her still her image haunts me wherever i go i think of nothing else when i am awake and never shut my eyes but she is the certain vision of my dream sometimes in all her loveliness she comes without her crimes in ecstasy i wake and wish the vision had endured for ever for these deceitful moments o my friend are the sole pleasant moments which alonzo for eighteen years has known  velasco within that time what regions barbarous have thou explored what strange vicissitudes of life endured in action and repose  abdallah extremes of both i courted to relieve my tortured mind but the tormenter still my steps attends behind me mounts when through the ranks of war i drive my fiery steed and when i seek the hermits cell the fiend pursues me there time which they say the wounds of passion cures in other hearts inflames and festers mine there is but one remedy  velasco would i could name one   abdallah her life the unction for the serpents bite is the fell serpents blood i will have her life the adulteress with infamy shall die by public justice doomed with this intent disguised i come if in my proper shape i had appeared alarmed she would have sled and bafiled my revenge  velasco my lord pemit me one thing to mention which these eyes beheld although it squares not just with thy opinion  abdallah opinion   velasco good my lord with patience hear when first i was to this employment named which since i have so happily discharged the princess sent and called me to her presence the treaty with the moor engrossed her thoughts that sad and pensive air she always wears was settled to a thicker gloom of grief her voice was low and languid few her words and the short periods ended with a sigh but when i gave her hopes of thy return a sudden gleam of joy spread over her face like morning breaking in a cloudy sky with earnest voice still rising as she spoke she urged dispatch exhorted me to zeal and perseverance never to desist till i had found thee for her fate she said the fate of spain depended on alonzo her passion then burst in a flood of tears that choked her utterance  abdallah and thou did believe that every word she spoke was most sincere how to interpret her let me instruct thee whatever she utters with unusual warmth as the effusion genuine of her heart receive and construe in another sense reverse and opposite for that is the truth the words she spoke her sights the tears she shed were all from apprehension of my coming not as they seemed for fear i should not come  velasco it is dreadful that   abdallah it is horrible it is monstrous when i for her had wayd my right to reign the right undoubted of the gothic line and stooped enamored to that base decree from spain which banished the true heir of spain that she should pitch on me to be her fool and pour such infinite contempt upon me but four days married fond to madness fond and on the very eve of my departure she would not for a single day refrain but ruthd to prostitution  velasco i have heard stories and tales enough of female falsehood some that were true and others that were feigned by spiteful wits maliciously devised but this surpasses all  abdallah all wicked women compared with her are saints she is a foil to set them off and make their foulness fair in her incontinence she stands unrivaled burning in fires peculiar to herself phoenix in lewdness  velasco may i ask my lord how he intends  but see the king draws near  abdallah he is much impaired   velasco when fore affliction comes in the decline of life it is like a storm which in the rear of autumn shakes the tree that frost had touched before and strips it bare of all its leaves  enter the king with attendants as he advances speaks to velasco king we thank thy care velasco   to abdallah illustrious prince whom love of glory brings from regions so remote to fight for spain accept the thanks a grateful nation pays to her defender  abdallah monarchof asturia the nations of the east have heard thy praise had not the hand of time unstrung thine arm spain never would have sought for foreign aid to quell her foes  king it is better far for spain that i am old for in my warlike days when in the prime of flowring youth i fought i equaled not thy friend above his own above the strength of every mortal arm alonzo thine exalts  abdallah three times we fought with equal fortune on the wolgas banks he for the monguls i against them stood but at our last encounter on my helm his faithless blade broke short and in his hand the useless hilt remained my sword i dropped and in my arms the valiant chief embraced our friendship thus commened and since that time we have been brothers sworn and leagued in arms alonzo fighting in my cause received that wound which now detains him from the field urged by affection and by honor bound for him i come against the soes of spain but of myself more than enough is said it is time to act the moorish knight i hear is in the lists already  king prince of persia the terms to thee are known  abdallah the first of men with pride such honors might from spain receive but never can these honors grace abdallah long since my heart and hand were given away and though the custom of the east permits unnumberd consorts me my faith restrains but if victorious in the strife of death i have an earnest and a just request to thee o king which at a proper time i shall be bold to make  king whatever it is i pledge my honor and my faith to grant it  enter sebastian and alberto alberto goes on to the king king advance alberto to the prince himself deliver thou thy message and the present  alberto great sir the princess ormisinda greets the generous champion of her countrys cause wishes that victory may sit to day and every day of battle on his sword this costly bracelet from her arm she sends to prince abdallah to alonzos friend  abdallah looking steadfastly on alberto the princess is most bountiful as thou who have the honor to attend her know her gracious present humbly i accept and thank her for her goodness to alonzo who will be proud to be by her remembered the combat ended i propose to pay my homage to her beauty at this time my mind is in the lists  the moorish knight will think me tardy  to the king king let our trumpets sound a sprightly charge the warriors heart beats time to that brave music onward from this place a path direct to thy pavilion leads  the king turns and gives orders abdallah to velasco another minion view him well velasco how insolent see what a crest he rears elated with her favor o vile woman insatiate and inconstant  velasco ah my lord truce with such thoughts sure this is not a time the combat claims a cool and present mind  abdallah fear not the combat   velasco thou art waited for the king himself intends with thee to walk   exeunt abdallah looking back at alberto manent alberto sebastian alberto that prince of persia is composed of pride he did not deign to look upon the present but stretched his sunburned hand straight out before him like a blind man and would have stood so still had i not made his fingers feel the pearls and all the while he stard me in the face as if he meant toppress me with his eye and fright me with his fierce and uncouth looks i blushed at first but anger came at last and bore me up  sebastian those princes of the east used to the servile manners of their country where every prostrate slave adores his lord without intention shock the sons of europe  alberto o how unlike to him the king of spain and that most gentle princess ormisinda her look her voice benign and mild dispel the awe her rank inspires and reassure the modest mind would thou believe sebastian she talked to me i cannot tell how long before thou came and questioned me minutely how i had lived how past my youthful days i fear i was too copious in my answers what signifies my rural life to her and yet she seemed to listen with delight as if she had an interest in my fate and once or twice when i of danger spoke from which i hardly had escaped with life methought i saw her tremble much she blamed my rashness yet she praised my courage too with all her tenderness of heart i see that she admires true valor  sebastian so she does the bravest knight that ever was clad in steel alonzo was the lover of her youth and since he left this land she never rejoiced but of these matters i will tell thee more at a convenient season let us follow and join the train before they reach the lists  alberto i would not lose one moment of this sight for half the lands of spain though i abhor the persian yet i pray devoutly for him  exeunt end of the third act act iv scene i the city enter ormisinda and teresa ormisinda this city looks as if a pestilence had swept the whole inhabitants away the solitary streets the empty squares appall me more than the deserted palace let us go back again  teresa it is time we should you trembled at the howling of a dog that broke the silence and increased the horror if we stay here we shall be fancystruck mistake some statue for a palefaced ghost and think it beckons with its marble arm  ormisinda why should this desolation frighten me why should i fear to see a graveclad ghost who may so soon be numbered with the dead and be myself a ghost what noise is that did thou not hear teresa  teresa yes i did i heard an uncouth sound  ormisinda uncouth indeed an universal groan hark there again  teresa it is not the same this has another tone a shout of triumph and a burst of joy  ormisinda the combats over and my fates determined now death or life  the trumpets sound teresa long may the princess live and every hour be fortunate as this the spanish trumpets sound the sign i know thy champion has prevailed  ormisinda o gracious heaven the lists are near and we shall quickly learn  teresa look yonder flying swifter than the wind a horseman comes now at the gate he lights and hastes across the square it is sebastian his look his gesture speak his tidings good   enter sebastian sebastian joy to the princess victory and peace the moor is slain by brave abdallahs hand  ormisinda blessed be thy tongue sebastian thou shall find some better recompense than barren thanks for these glad tidings but the generous prince who fought for spain   sebastian safe and without a wound fresh for another foe abdallah stands short was the combat soon the boaster fell who durst defy the christian world to arms  ormisinda the god of battles whom abdallah serves has overthrown the infidel whose trust was in his own right arm  sebastian if i should live ten thousand years i never could forget the solemn prelude and the fierce encounter thou know the place appointed for the combat an amphitheatre by nature formed  ormisinda i know it well   sebastian the hills of various slope and shape which circle round the spacious plain were covered with a multitude immense of either sex of every age and rank christian and moor whose faces and attire strangely diversified the living scene within the lists a gallery was raised in which thy father and the moorish prince sat with their peers the judges of the field to them the knights with slow and stately pace approached and bound by sacred oaths declared that they no charm nor incantation used but trusted in their valor and their arms with low obeisance then they both fell back and first the moor for he the challenge gave marched to the middle of the listed field there seized his ponderous mace beneath whose weight the brawny bearer bowed and round his head like a light foil he flourished it in air on him with different thoughts the nations gazed but suddenly a flash of light and flame struck every eye from brave abdallahs shield covered till then twas made of polished steel which shone like adamant and to a point rose in the center stanting on each side this shield the persian prince advancing bore on his left arm outstretchd and in his right thrown back a little gleamd a pointed sword erect and high the bold mirmallon stood and sternly eyed his nearapproaching oe then forward sprung and on the flaming shield discharged a mighty blow enough to crush a wall or split a rock the spaniards gave a general groan  ormisinda that was the dreadful sound we heard teresa  sebastian glancing from the shield aside the mace descended then enraged once more the moor his thundering weapon reared in stepped the prince and raising high his shield midway he met the blow and with the strength and vigor of his arm obliquely down the ponderous mace he drove then quick as thought his better hand and foot at once advancing plunged in mirmallons throat his thirsty blade the giant staggered for a little space then falling shook the earth the christians raised a shout that rent the air away i came happy to be the bearer of such tidings  trumpet ormisinda behold they come in triumph from the field o glorious man and yet forgive me heaven i grudge the conquest to alonzos friend and wish alonzo in abdallahs place  enter the king abdallah velasco alberto etc abdallah  to velasco see where she stands o heavens   velasco my lord alonzo compose thy thoughts  abdallah behold her how she looks as if she knew no ill that hardened heart against remorse and fear and shame is armed but i shall wring it now  king daughter draw near this godlike prince all recompense disclaims save thanks from spain the pleasing task be thine to greet the savior of thy native land and speak our gratitude  ormisinda no words can speak the gratitude i feel believe it great as my deliverance vast as my distress like sad andromeda chained to the rock i stood a living prey when this brave prince came like another perseus from the sky and saved me from destruction i forget wrapped in myself the charge my father gave to thank the savior of my native land another voice shall give thee thanks for spain alonzos voice shall thank thee for his country his friends his people  saved  abdallah ah if i hear aside this siren longer she will charm my rage but i remember where i heard her last princess of spain i merit not thy praise sent by alonzo to this land i came what has been done for him i have performed now of his promise i remind the king to grant me one request  king speak it is granted   ormisinda if i conjecture right even that request will prove one favor more on spain conferred  abdallah perhaps it may   king proceed illustrious prince and make me happy to fulfill thy wish  abdallah not for myself i speak but for my friend and in his name whose person i sustain i ask for justice on a great offender  king thou shall have ample and immediate justice nor favor nor affinity shall skreen the guilty person prince why ar thou troubled thou shankst from head to foot thy quivering lip is pale with passion on thy forehead stand big drops almighty god what dreadsul birth do these strong pangs portend  abdallah the guilty person whom with a capital offense i charge stands by thy side  king my daughter   abdallah yes thy daughter it is her i mean the princess ormisinda here in the presence of the peers of spain i charge her with a crime whose doom the laws of spain have wrote in blood adultery i read astonishment in every face who would suspect that one so highly born with every outward mark of virtue graced had given her honor to a worthless wretch and driven a noble husband to despair  king am i awake is this the light of day art thou o prince with sudden frenzy seized or is the madness mine renowned abdallah what answer can be made to such a charge this strange demand of justice on my daughter for an offense that she could not commit my daughter never was married  abdallah ask her that hear if she will deny she has a husband  king my child thou art amazed   ormisinda no not so much as thou will be my father when thou hearst thy daughters tongue confess she has a husband  king have thou a husband god of heaven and earth since thou have thus dissembled with thy father perhaps thou have deceived thy husband too who is thy husband speak  ormisinda the prince alonzo   king and have thou been so long in secret wedded it is eighteen years since he departed hence  ormisinda o i have reason to remember that there is no calendar so just and true as the sad memory of a wife forsaken the years the months the weeks the very days are reckoned registered recorded there and of that period i could cite such times so dolorous distressful melancholy that the bare mention of them would excite amazement how i live to tell the tale but i forget the present in the past no wonder for this moment is the first that opes the sluices of a heart oerchargd and bursting with a flood of grief concealed but i must turn me to another theme the earnest eyes of all are bent on me watching my looks and prying to discern symptoms of innocence or signs of guilt hear then the frank confession of my soul i have transgressed  king stain of a noble race do thou avow thy crime  ormisinda mistake me not i have transgressed my duty to my father without his knowledge and against his will moved by a tender lovers parting tears i joined myself in wedlock to alonzo my king my father pardon the offense which against thee i own i have committed but may i never of god or man be pardoned nor friend nor father ever pity me if i have swerved one step from virtues path or broke the smallest parcel of that vow which binds a faithful wife o prince of persia thou art the est of friends and benefactors thou come to end my most distracting woes and to dispel the impenetrable cloud that darkened all my days now i shall know why i have been abandoned and forsaken why i have been detested and despised as never woman was proceed my lord and whilst thou keenly do assail my life and dearer far my honor and my fame secure in innocence i will calmly hear from thee i hope the end of all my cares  abdallah even thus alonzo told me she would speak and thus proclaim her innocence  ormisinda did he o would to heaven alonzo heard me now fearless defend his honor and my own my voice which once was music to his ear like davids harp which soothed the gloomy king would charm his malady would drive away the evil spirit and call back again the better genius of his early days o thou that were so good so great admired of all mankind my loved my lost alonzo for thee in this humiliating hour more than myself i mourn  abdallah half aside eternal power to whom the secrets of all hearts are known hear hear this woman and between us judge it is not my business to contend with words these are the conquering arms of womankind a nobler course of trial lies before me in a wronged husbands name i charge this lady with infidelity and crave the doom of law upon her head if any knight spaniard or stranger dares assert her cause let him stand forth and take my gauntlet up which on the ground i throw my gage to prove that she is false to honor and alnzo  ormisinda before the gage of death is lifted up hear me one moment by alonzo sent thou come instructed in alonzos wrongs let me conjure thee then by all that is dear by all that is sacred to the great and brave thy mothers memory thy consorts fame not on a general charge obscure and vague to which there is no answer but denial to found the claim of combat single out what circumstance thou will of special note of such a kind as may be tried and known for true or false tell us at least his name with whom alonzos wife her honor stained and let us be confronted   young alberto steps forth alberto heaven forbid that thou should be consronted with a villain princess of spain be sure some wretch there is some renegado false to god and man suborned and ready with a lying tongue to second this brave prince who wrongs thy fame and wounds thy modest ear too much by far already thou have heard pretended prince for there is nothing royal in thy soul thou base defamer of a ladys name i take thy gauntlet up and hold it high in scorn and fierce desiance to thy face my gage to prove thy accusation false and thee the author of a tale invented to rob a noble lady of her fame  ormisinda where am i now what shall i do teresa   aside teresa the god of heaven direct thee   abdallah boy to thee i answer nothing i suspect the cause of thy presumption and could wish that spain had gin a worthier victim to my sword  walks aside ormisinda o valiant youth much am i bound to thee but i have reasons that import the state which shall whatever is my fate be known and owned hereafter to be great and weighty why i decline the assistance of thy sword if this appeal to combat is the law and i can find no champion but alberto without the chance of combat let me fall for i will not accept   alberto recall these words too generous princess i can read thy thoughts thou think my youth unequal to the foe thou fear the weakness of albertos arm my strength exceeds the promise of my years often have i bent the bow and drawn the sword nor fly my shafts nor falls my sword in vain this day against a troop alone i fought but never did i fight in such a cause nor was i ever so certain to prevail a fire divine invades my zealous breast i feel the force of legions in mine arm thy innocence has made thy champion strong the god of battles is our righteous judge and let the cause be tried  a warrior armed with his helmet on steps forth warrior but not by thee thy fathers voice forbids too daring youth stand back and let thy master in the art of war now claim the combat for his own my liege  king that voice i know thy figure too resembles much a chief lamented long as slain in battle  warrior i am he costollo it is true o king that on the field i fell fighting for spain how i was saved from death and where for many years i have remained this is no time to tell this hour demands a soldiers speech brief prologue to his deeds on me proud persion turn thy gloomy eyes hear me and let thy ready sword reply with hellborn malice levelled at her life thou have defamed a princess honored loved by all who virtue or fair honor love the fell hyaena native of thy land has not a voice or heart more false than thine thou counterfeit of truth whom i defy to mortal combat and the proof of arms thy fullblown fame thy unexhausted strength deceitful confidence i laugh to scorn the conquering cause is mine  alberto my lord the king and ye his counselors for wisdom famed you will not sure permit this good old man by fond affection for his son impelled to meet so stern a foe his hoary head his withered veins are symptoms of decay lean not upon a reed which time has bruised nor trust the life and honor of the princess to the weak arm of age  abdallah i will fight you both father and son at once together come tonguevaliant men and try abdallahs arm i will have it so for both of you have dared ignoble as you are to match yourselves against a prince who moves not in your sphere and utter words for which such blood as yours is poor atonement  costollo every word thou speak is insolent and false son of a slave for eastern monarchs buy with gold their brides the blood by thee despised flows from a sourc purer than thine and nobler  albeto nay my father that is said too far fierce and disdainful prince vain is the offer which thy passion makes perhaps the conqueror of the moor may find one spaniard is enough  costollo a fathers right unmoved i claim and with determined voice forbid the combat  king hence let us retire to the pavilion there our peers shall judge of your pretensions  exeunt king and spaniards abdallah come with me velasco    exeunt abdallah and velasco  manent ormisinda and teresa ormisinda my thoughts are of my son mine own estate is desperate the husband whom i loved on whom i doated and from whom i suffered what never woman with such patience bore conspires against my honor and my life long cherished hope farewell  teresa to guard thy son defend thyself and to prevent the combat in thy demand persist call the accuser to circumstance of proof that is the thread to lead us through this labyrinth perplexed nor has the persian thy demand refused  ormisinda he had not time to speak albertos voice broke in like thunder in his mothers cause amidst the anguish of my tortured heart my soul exults teresa in my son when in the pride of valor forth he came and for my sake defied the bold abdallah his look he seemed a cherub in my eyes his voice at every word my bosom yearnd transported me so much that i forgot his state and mine and had well nigh sprung forth to clasp my blooming hero in my arms  teresa no wonder that his mothers soul was moved his brave demeanor the spectators charmed valor which sheds a glory round the head of age and ruggedness how bright its beams when in the lovely front of youth they shine  ormisinda i have heard of strange and perilous essays to try the pureness of suspected virtue i will undergo whatever can be devised by ordeal trial let my faith be proved blindfold barefooted on the smoking soil with red hot ploughshares spread i will walk my way plunge in the boiling oil my naked arm but will not risk my young alonzos life the moorish host hangs over our heads no more the heir of spain shall for himself be known alonzos son  teresa he will not be allowed alonzos son nor yet the heir of spain whilst slanders breath sullies his mothers fame  ormisinda now thou have touched a string to whose deep sound a mothers heart replies my son my son i weigh thy virtues down hang on thy life attaint thy blood thy birth thy right to reign the birds of prey that dwell among the rocks the savage beasts that through the deserts roam the monsters of the deep their offspring love and to preserve their lives devote their own athwart the gloom i see a flash of light that opens the horizon i descry a hand that points a high and lofty path which i will boldly tread now to my father upon my knees his aid i will first implore  exeunt end f the fourth act act v scene i abdallah and velasco velasco before this day she never beheld the boy far from this place in catalonia bred he came to see the famous combat fought twas he my lord who slew the moorish chief and in his own defense such wonders wrought that action to the princess made him known the rest in honor of his valor followed  abdallah how do thou know   velasco with admiration struck when he stood forth and braved a foe like thee of diverse persons curious i inquired who and from whence he was  abdallah pity it were to hurt the stripling it is a noble boy i love the outbreak of his spanish fire against the moors  velasco ay and against abdallah whom ancient fame and recent glory raised above all mortal men spare this young plant who makes so fair a shoot  abdallah how can i spare him should their election send him to my sword how good velasco  velasco when the peers return the king the princess with their champion chosen then to the wondering audience in the face of her that is guilty let my lord relate the truthmarkd story he to me has told detected thus confounded and surprised pierced with a thousand eyes that gaze upon her and dart conviction can she still deny and by denial make her guilt ambiguous but if her sexs genius is so strong that she the port of innocence maintains and from the fullness and excess of vice derives a boldness that may look like virtue then let the sword decide  abdallah what you propose is worth the trial i am loath to spill the young albertos or costollos blood for they deserve no harm even you my friend before my hand unclaspd the book of shame her champion would have been  velasco against the world   abdallah i will adopt the counsel of velasco and probe more deeply still her festerd mind i see it is better that she should confess her guilt than with her vanquished champion fall by doom of law protesting to the last her innocence  velasco better a thousand times her dying voice would shake the hearts of men and echo through the world  abdallah behold the king and young alberto marching by his side as if he trod on air  velasco see ormisinda with folded hands implores her listening sire  enter the king ormisinda teresa alberto costollo etc king the peers of spain have judged stand forth alberto behold the champion of my daughters fame  alberto before the trumpets voice unsheaths the sword which one of us shall never sheath again permit me prince of persia to entreat a moments audience not from fear i speak the cause i fight for and the mind i bear exalt me far above the thoughts of dnger but from a conscious sense of what is due to thee renowned abdallah in the heat of our contention if my tongue has uttered one word offensive to thy noble ear which might have been omitted and the tone of firm defiance equally preserved for that i ask forgiveness  abdallah less i marked the manner than the matter of thy speeck if thou do need forgiveness freely take it  king twas generously asked and nobly granted such courtesy with valor ever dwells let me too crave for a few words thine ear throughout the trying business of this day thou art my witness that my mind upright has never been by powerful nature bent nor swayed to favor and opinion formed by long habitual and accustomed love but i with equal hand the balance held between thee and my child  abdallah thou have indeed it is but justice that i should declare it  king then to thy candor let me now appeal and beg of thee to grant me one request which i do not but might perhaps command  abdallah what is it   king i have searched my hapless child even to the pith and marrow of her soul have touched her to the quick she never shrinks nor wavers in the least perhaps my lord some fool officious or some wretch that is worse if there is ought comes between man and wife that is more pernicious than a meddling fool some false designing friend has wronged her fame and poured his poison in alonzos ear if thou will give some scope to her defense and bring the charge from darkness into light then she shall forthwith answer on the spot where now she stands before us  ormisinda if i fail to clear my fame even in abdallahs sight if but one dark suspicious speck remains to make mine honor dim let me be held guilty of all beforehand i renounce the right of combat and submit to die  abdallah thy wish is fatal but if shall be granted this instant too  ormisinda blessings upon thy head ten thousand blessings o thou do not know how happy thou have made me on my breast a mountain lay thy hand has heaved it off and now i breathe again  abdallah o woman woman a little way from hence my people wait with them remains a necessary witness thither i go and quickly will return to ring thy knell  exit abdallah ormisinda the knell of all my woes my heart knocks at my side as if twould burst itself a passage outward yet a while poor sussring heart and thou shall beat no more shortly for what i am i shall be known then let my doom be squared to my desert without indulgence  king i can trust thee now thine eye secure beams innocence and honor thou art my daughter still  alberto i fear o king some practice vile some infamous imposture supported by false witness still i wish the fair decision of the honest sword  enter abdallah in a spanish drss as alonzo king god of

than thyself   alonzo i have no other and none else require   king unfeeling man to trifle with our sorrows and like a pageant play a mimic scene this is thy hatred of pelagios house thy passion to
