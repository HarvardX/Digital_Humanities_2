i the lure of private advantage resumed the captive the next evening in the words of himilco which had been held up to the byrsans to draw them into the war had fired them with such an universal phrenzy that their army might almost have been said to contain the whole nation people of both sexes of every age and rank crowded as to a festival in all the pomp and parade of affluence and luxury to gratify curiosity and share in the spoil for so confident were they of success that they even carried chains to bind their enemies whom they already considered as captives  it was impossible to make the impatience of such a multitude submit to the necessary delays of discipline or observe military order in their march against a foe whom they despised they broke like a deluge into the country of the coptes who having lived in the security of innocence and peace were unprepared to resist such an attack and ravaged it with all the wanton insolence and cruelties of conquest  but though the coptes were unable to face such numbers in the field they lost not that courage with which honest indignation always fires a virtuous breast they removed their families into places of present safety among the inaccessible fastnesses of the mountains and then dividing themselves into separate bodies kept out of the sight of their enemies till they should find an opportunity for attacking them with that advantage which their manner of proceeding promised  this conduct which should have put the byrsans on their guard only made them more confident and secure they attributed it to fear and spreading themselves over the country as if they had no enemy to apprehend soon gave the coptes that opportunity for which they watched who falling upon them from every quarter at the same time with the irresistible fury of men animated by the justice of their cause and fighting for all they held dear overthrew them with such a slaughter that scarcely enough escaped to bear home the melancholy tidings of their defeat  it is impossible to describe the effects of this misfortune upon the minds of the byrsans their dejection now exceeded their late confidence and showed in the strongest light the difference between true fortitude inspired by virtue and the vain presumption of arrogance as their fate soon after did that between power founded on the solid basis of internal strength and the false semblance of it which is reflected by wealth and present prosperity  fostered in the lap of luxury the wordy warriors whose valor had been so loud in the council whose boasting had inflamed the multitude to madness now shuddered at the apprehension of having those evils which they had wantonly caused to be inflicted on their unoffending neighbors retorted on themselves and basely fled behind their sovereign for shelter leaving him to struggle with the storm which they had raised against his principles and opinion  true nobleness of soul always shines brightest in adversity the voice of danger awoke the virtues of amilcar who then sat upon the throne of narbal and proved the blood of his illustrious race he summoned the poor remains of his people and without descending to fruitless accusations ordered to arms every one able to take the field proposing to lead them directly against the enemy if happily he might surprise them in the security of their late victory and by one brave effort wipe off the dishonor they had suffered  section ii passion when broken loose from the rule of reason is ever in extremes fear had now taken such absolute possession of the byrsans that they trembled at the very thought of a war with those whom they so lately had despised and shutting their ears to the name of honor by their infatuated cowardice disabled their sovereign from attempting to deliver them from the distress into which they had been plunged by their own rashness deaf to his exhortations and in despite of his authority they sent an embassy to beg for peace in the most abject terms but they were now made to feel in their turn the insolence of power  the leaders of the coptick nation no longer thinking themselves under the necessity of preserving any measures with them in order to confirm the confidence and sharpen the animosity of their own people gave audience to the ambassadors in the presence of the whole army and having received their humiliations with contempt replied to their supplications for peace by aggravating every insult and oppression which they had ever received from them and enumerating for they admitted not of aggravation all the cruelties and outrages which they had committed in their late invasion concluding with declaring their resolution to pursue to the last extremity a people whose pride and injustice had made them the general enemies of humankind  instead of their being rouzed by this menace to that manly desperation which often produces safety it only sunk them deeper in the most despicable weakness of fear each looked to the other for that counsel which he himself had neither presence of mind to give nor spirit to pursue  they were utterly at a loss their own people were dispersed at too great a distance in their colonies to be collected in time for affording them relief and consciousness of their former conduct toward those whom necessity had obliged to live in alliance with them would not permit their placing any confidence in their assistance  however as they had lost every other hope they sent to all the neighboring nations to implore aid in their distress but in vain  they were answered with demands of redress for injuries offered in the day of their prosperity and which would never have been mentioned had the power which committed remained to support them and saw the very people to whom they had applied for assistance prepare to join their enemies in hope of sharing in the spoil of that wealth which they had unhappily mistaken for strength but now found to be only a lure to tempt ruin  this aggravated their fears to distraction and made them still an easier conquest to their enemies who had now advanced into the bosom of their country where they returned all the outrages which had been exercised upon themselves before  the wretched byrsans unconnected by the ties of social virtue uninspired with the sacred love of their country and unsupported by the principles of religion thought only of shifting every one for himself and flying with his darling wealth though he knew not whither to direct his flight nor had time to provide the proper means for it regardless of the commands the entreaties of their sovereign who glowing with the virtues of his race conjured them by every motive justly dear to man to imitate his example and die with honor if they could not live with happiness  animated by this divine principle he put himself at the head of his own household and disdaining to be attacked in a city which he had not force to defend met the enemy in the field where he sealed his love to his country with his blood as became the descendant of narbal  here let me drop the veil nor put humanity to pain by striving to represent scenes in which the unavoidable horrors of war were rendered still more horrible by personal animosity and revenge  suffice it to say that such of the wretched people as fell in the way of the conquerors in the first heat of their fury were put to the sword without respect to age or sex the city razed to the ground and the name of byrsa no longer numbered among nations  at these words grief choked his utterance he covered his face for a few moments and having paid the tribute of a pious tear to the memory of his country thus continued his narrative  section iii it was my peculiar fate to be spared the pain of beholding these scenes of devastation and cruelty  as i was riding one day at some distance from the byrsan army soon after our entering the country of the coptes i saw a town delightfully situated at the entrance of a beautiful valley wrapped in flames  too many sights of the same kind making me at no loss for the cause of such a calamity i hasted directly to the place to put a stop to the outrages of the soldiers and administer what relief i could to the unhappy sufferers who were only such as age and infirmity had prevented from retiring with the rest and would have bespoken compassion for from every heart not hardened against the feelings of humanity  i flew from place to place wherever the cries of distress called for my assistance i commanded i entreated and where every other method failed had recourse to force to make the ravagers remember they were men  as i was laboring thus i met a party of the byrsans dragging by his gray hairs an aged priest while others goaded him on with their spears toward a magnificent temple which they had set on fire and designed to throw him into the flames  struck with horror at the sight i rushed among the worse than brutal wretches and smiting with my sword one of them who refused to obey my command rescued the trembling victim from their cruelty  as soon as he had recovered a little from the stupefaction of affright he threw himself at my feet and regarding me with a look of ineffable expression the emotions of his heart depriving him of utterance raised his hands and eyes to heaven to implore its blessings on his deliverer  melting in sympathy to his distress i raised him from the ground and was going to speak words of comfort to his grief when a sudden shout drew my attention to other objects  i turned hastily and saw the byrsans flying on every side before a body of the coptes who had poured from the neighboring mountain with the impetuosity of a torrent and bore down every thing they met i flew to oppose them and strove by my voice and actions to animate the byrsans to a resistance which alone could procure their safety  but all my efforts were in vain incumbered with spoil and enfeebled by their own excesses they fell just and easy victims to the vengeance of their foes who were exasperated to such rage by their inhuman ravages and cruelty of which every object around presented them with the most horrid instances that they slew every byrsan they met many of them in the very act of imploring that mercy which they had so lately refused to others  those who had immediately followed me were too few to oppose such numbers with success for in the false security into which the retreat of the coptes had betrayed us i had wandered that morning to take a view of the country attended only by some of my own domestics  attached by personal regard no danger could make them desert me but valor wastes itself it vain against unequal force they all fell fighting faithfully around me leaving me alone and covered with wounds in the midst of an host of enemies enraged to madness and breathing nothing but death  but still the natural impulse of selfpreservation prompted me to avert the stroke of fate as long as i could and i was animated by the desire of dying with honor after i had lost every hope of safety  with this view i collected all my strength and advanced to smite one of the foremost of the coptes who pressed upon me as i stood with my back to a pillar to prevent my being surrounded but weakened by the loss of blood which streamed from every part of my body my sword flew out of my hand and i fell at my length upon the ground destitute of every power of further resistance or defense  this thought doubled the horrors of a situation from which there appeared no possibility of escape i saw the sword lifted to strike when in the moment which divides life from death the coptic priest whom i had just before saved from the cruelty of the byrsans burst through the crowd and fearless of the swords which hung over my head threw himself upon me and covered my body with his own  respect to his sacred character and virtues instantly restrained their rage and procured me a safety of which i was long insensible having swooned away quite exhausted by my loss of blood just as the good man had enfolded me in his arms  section iv at the return of reason i found myself in a place to which i was a stranger my wounds and weakness soon recalled to my memory the situation in which i had lately been but how i had escaped or where i now was i could not form any conception  while i was striving to recollect my scattered thoughts the good priest entered the chamber and approaching softly to the bed where i lay leaned over me for a few moments when perceiving that i breathed he kneeled at my side and prayed to heaven in the fervency of true piety for my recovery  at the first sight of him i remembered the manner in which he had stepped between me and death as his actions now sufficiently explained my my situation my soul was struck with reverential awe at such sublime virtue and joined in his prayers without presuming to interrupt him  when he had ended i made an effort to speak which drew all his attention but my weakness made my words unintelligible a flash of joyful surprise enlightened all his face he raised his eyes to heaven with a rapturous ejaculation of gratitude and praise then leaning over me again exhorted me tenderly to compose my self to rest and not hazard a recovery of which heaven had thus given unexpected hope by endeavoring to exert a strength above my condition  i felt the justice of what he said and testified by my looks an assent which i was not able to utter  i continued in this weak estate for many days every hour of which was distinguished by some new instance of the tenderness of my friend the name by which he always called me who never entrusted me for a moment to the care of any other person except one in whom he knew he could confide  nor was his care confined to the recovery of my health he poured the balm of comfort into my soul and fortified it against the evils incident to humanity by inculcating the duty and benefit of submission to the will of heaven whose ways he proved to be always right however contrary to the wishes and inscrutable to the wisdom of man  in the course of these delightful conferences which he lengthened as my strength increased i sometimes distantly hinted a desire to be informed of the progress of the war but he always eluded my curiosity changing his discourse directly to some of the most important and affecting points of moral virtue and religion which he discussed in a manner that took off my attention from every other subject  painful remembrance made me attribute this reserve which i soon perceived to a delicacy of distressing me with a recital of the ravages of the byrsans for infatuated confidence in their numbers prevented every apprehension of disaster to them i therefore desisted from my enquiries and resolved to wait with patience for a discovery which i dreaded though for a reason most contrary to the truth  full of this thought the employment of my mind in every moment of his absence was to find out some method of healing the unhappy breach between the two nations to which i flattered myself with an hope that the humanity and tenderness which i had experienced would in a great measure prepare the way  the first glimpse of this hope was too pleasing to be resisted i communicated it immediately in the fullness of my heart to the good priest urging it as a reason for desiring that the ransom of my liberty should be fixed and permission given me to send to my own country where i owned that my rank was not inconsiderable  this made it impossible to conceal the fate of my country from me any longer nor indeed was it necessary as my recovery was now completed and my mind restored to its native strength  the good man however opened the black detail gradually and with all the delicacy which the nature of it would admit keeping hope alive to the last moment  i shall not attempt to describe what i felt on finding all my forebodings so unhappily fulfilled a just sense of the duty of resignation alone could have saved me from despair as the duty i owed my country determined me to try whether it might not still be possible for me to retrieve its affairs and restore it once more to a state of rational prosperity i owed the attempt at least to the blood of narbal which flowed in my veins and whose example i had before my eyes  i departed therefore secretly from the house of my kind preserver disguised in the habit of a faquir and went with an heavy heart to learn the truth of what i scarce dared to doubt  section v the appearance of ingratitude which my departing in this manner bore was most painful to me but it was not to be avoided  from some expressions dropped at different times by my benevolent host i had reason to think that an assurance of acquiescing in the present state of my country would be expected from me before i should be set at liberty which would obviate my dearest hopes besides that a regular valediction would have been attended with circumstances of tenderness of a particular nature which i doubted my own ability to support  the scenes which every where presented themselves to me on my entering the country of byrsa exceeded my worst apprehensions desolation is too soft a name for a country which but a few moons before had flourished in all the riches of nature all the embellishments of art while the few wretched natives who had escaped the slaughter were driven into the most inhospitable parts of the coptic mountains where they were condemned to every servile labor and interdicted even the sight of their own country on pain of instant death  grief gave place to indignation my soul disdained to think of aught but vengeance nor was i at a loss by what means to seek it i turned my face directly to our colonies where i doubted not but a just description of the fate of their mother country would arouse an effectual resentment as i knew their force was amply sufficient to overpower every resistance which the enemy could oppose to them  but what was my astonishment how was the object of my indignation changed when i found all my entreaties rejected all my remonstrances treated with contempt they told me that they owned no country but that which gave them bread they enumerated the hardships which had driven them from their native home they blazoned the luxury the insolence and oppression of the byrsans in the strongest colors and then asked me whether i thought such a people deserved that they should hazard their own happiness to endeavor to recover for them a country which they had been so basely afraid to defend as they said they well knew that should their endeavors prove successful the byrsans would instantly crowd home from the places whither they had ignominiously fled with their wealth and resume their former tyranny  i acknowledged the hand of heaven in the fate of the byrsans and submitting to its sacred will looked among the nations round for a place of refuge where i might fulfill the number of my days unknown for i resolved never more to mix with the world or concern myself in its ways  after thinking of many places without being able to determine my choice it at length occurred to me that my friend and fellowsufferer in the shipwreck might probably be able to direct me as he had traveled over the greatest part of the earth in his profession of a merchant i disposed therefore of all the property which belonged to me among those unnatural people and bidding an eternal adieu to every thing which had any way been connected with byrsa repaired to cairo  section vi on my arrival at the house of my friend i found him just preparing to go in search of me the fate of my country of which he had received the melancholy tidings having alarmed his regard for my safety  it is impossible to express his joy when he saw me he hung upon my neck for some minutes unable to speak while we mingled the tears of melancholy remembrance and affection  as soon as i had explained to him the immediate occasion of my coming my friend said he it is true that i know many such places as you seek but i would by no means advise you to bury yourself thus alive  your heart is at present soured by the misfortunes of your country and sickens at the thought of every thing which may remind you of them but believe me it is not in retirement that you must expect relief the sameness of the scene will soon pall upon you destitute of other objects your mind will continually look back to your misfortunes so that instead of flying from melancholy you will only give yourself up an helpless prey to it  continue therefore here with me for a season the multitudes which crowd to this city from all parts of the world will afford you ample matter for rational speculation and divert your thoughts from dwelling on the objects which at present give you so much pain the retreat which you want is from yourself and that can be had only in the bustle of the world  i was struck with the justice of what he said though it unhinged the dearest purpose of my heart i knew not what to determine  while i fluctuated in this state of uncertainty i dreamed a dream one night in my bed and thought i saw the spirit of my father standing before me after regarding me for some minutes with a look of reprehension is it thus methought he said that the descendant of narbal should be employed while his fellowcitizens are groaning under the yoke of slavery if his country is lost are there not others to be found a brave man can make his home any where the sun not finding a place of rest returns to that from which he begun his course  on communicating my dream to my friend he was no less struck with it than myself you see said he that heaven interdicts your retiring from the world idleness is the vice of a weak mind man was designed for action and you are expressly directed what you are to do all that remains is to concert measures properly heaven has given us reason to direct us and we are made answerable in the success of our undertakings for the use we make of it  we then entered into consultation upon the manner in which i should proceed the explication of my dream was obvious i resolved to repair immediately to byrsa and collect as many of my wretched countrymen as i could find willing to share my fortunes  but the difficulty was how to procure an establishment for them in the place to which i was directed my friend informed me from his own sd experience that the very ruins of carthage that once proud queen of africa were scarcely to be traced  nor was the face of the country he said more changed than the manners of the inhabitants who ignorant of every civil art every social and moral virtue lived in a state of war with humanity itself plundering indscriminately all who had the misfortune to fall into their hands and treating them with the most savage cruelty only because in their power  discouraging as this representation was i was not to be deterred by it from that which i held my duty i resolved to make the attempt and submit the event to heaven which could never want means to effect its own designs  my friend who had no other view but my advantage did not oppose a resolution the motive of which he could not controvert i have fulfilled one part of the duty of a friend said he by showing the difficulty of what you are about to undertake i will now fulfill the other by assisting you in your undertaking the wealth which i saved by your means i will devote to your service though advanced in age i feel none of its infirmities my spirit is good and my health vigorous  while you therefore go to collect your people i will make the necessary preparations for conveying them in an happy hour to the place of their destination direct them to come hither separately to avoid giving any alarm and leave the rest to my care  section vii i once more assumed the habit of a faquir under the disguise of which i eluded the jealous vigilance of the coptes while i traversed the country of byrsa and all the neighboring mountains whither the wretched natives had been banished by them  but what was my astonishment how did my heart swell with indignant grief when i found all my endeavors to awake them to a sense of virtue and pious confidence in heaven of no effect their spirit was utterly broken they sunk under their misfortunes and preferred an indolent life in the most abject state of slavery to any prospect the attainment of which was to be attended with difficulty and danger  such a degeneracy weaned my soul from them i left them to the fate they deserved and directing the few survivors of my own domestics and dependants in whom the example of my father had preserved some remains of virtue to meet me at the habitation of my friend in cairo i yielded to the impulse of a tenderness but badly suited to my situation while i went to pay the debt of gratitude to the coptic priest who had in so generous a manner preserved my life  i have said that he had never entrusted the care of my recovery to any but himself and one person more o my son that person was his only daughter the most beautiful of her sex but beauty was her lowest praise she it was who watched over me in the absence of her father and sweetened the tenderest offices of humanity by the manner in which she performed them  it was impossible not to have a sense of gratitude for such obligation and gratitude between the sexes always leads to love  nor did i attempt to check the advances of this tender passion i was in every respect disengaged and my rank in my own country i thought would make my alliance an advantage to any of the coptes for alas i knew not then that i had no country  as this pleasing hope accelerated my recovery it may naturally be judged what i felt on finding the foundation of it overturned by the ruin of the byrsan state i strove to repress it but in vain it had taken too deep root in my heart to be ever expelled  i had before concealed my passion from motives of delicacy and i now continued my reserve from pride i had flattered myself that after the establishment of peace the proposal would be received with pleasure but as that event was become impossible i thought it would only look like adding to a debt which i was unable to pay and this was the chief reason of my departing secretly from the house of her father i could not trust my heart in such a conflict  when i arrived near the mansion of my benefactor i waited in a grove whither i knew he repaired every morning to perform his devotions  i must not attempt to describe our meeting after some moments of extatic silence i answered the enquiries of his regard with a candid account of every thing which had befallen me since my departure from him nor did i conceal the reasons of my having departed in so secret a manner  he listened to me with the most anxious attention and as soon as i had ended my son said he i approve of your conduct in every instance and admire a virtue which acquires additional luster from every addition of distress  the will of heaven must be obeyed you must lead back your few faithful followers to the seat of their ancestors nor shall you lead them only i will accompany your pious steps and my daughter also will be easily prevailed upon to go with us she wishes not a fate separate from yours and my soul so deeply detests the atrocious manner in which this infatuated people have abused their success that i will remain no longer among them  he then led me to his habitation where he the same evening raised me secretly to the summit of human happiness by giving me his daughter in marriage who blushingly owned that love had had an equal share with the duties of humanity in all the tender offices which she had performed for me  i should have held it a crime to have suffered any indulgence to myself however virtuous to delay my obedience to the divine command by which i thought myself directed in my intended expedition nor was the zeal of my father less ardent we left his habitation in the disguise which had so often proved favorable to me and committing ourselves to the guidance of heaven arrived at cairo in safety  section viii the hopes which my success thus far had raised were considerably lowered by the accounts which i received from my friend on our arrival who had learned that the inhabitants of the ancient territories of carthage were engaged in the most furious civil wars which they waged with such animosity that no person dared to approach their coasts an absolute stranger being the common prey of all and a connection with any one people exposing to the outrages of all the rest  while we were deliberating what course to pursue amid such difficulties my father one day asked the merchant if the inhabitants in the interior parts of the country were equally barbarous with those on the seacoasts and if not whether it might not be possible for us to travel thither by land so as to avoid the dangers which prevented our going directly to carthage and fulfill the intent of my vision at the same time by settling in some convenient part of the carthaginian territories as no particular place had been expressly pointed out in it  the merchant was struck at this remark and pausing for some time answered that he had formerly been acquainted with many who had traversed those immense regions in the caravans which went in pilgrimage to mecca one of whom had informed him that he had seen the ruins of several magnificent cities in different parts of them particularly near the confines of biledulgerid a country which wanted nothing but cultivation to make it equal to any other under heaven there not being the least trace of human habitation within the distance of many days journey adding that he had been so struck by the description that he had enquired particularly where those ruins lay and was confident he could find his way to them though the journey was long and would be attended both with difficulty and danger  but these obstacles were of no force the description of the country and its situation evidently within the territories of carthage determined us to direct our steps thither hoping that if it was not immediately the place appointed for us we might wait there in safety till we could find some more happy time for proceeding to carthage  in consequence of this resolution we set out from cairo in number about three hundred persons carrying every thing necessary for the establishment of a colony which the care of my friend had provided in the most ample measure  i shall not describe a journey distinguished only by the inconveniences naturally incident to the countries through which we passed and in which i bore no farther share than what regarded myself and the wife of my bosom the conduct of every thing being resigned to my friend whose experience was our best guide and safeguard through those inhospitable regions  after a pilgrimage of more than twenty moons in which we suffered every hardship which humanity could surmount we arrived at this place the appearance confessedly was far from encouraging but it was in the country we wished to come to it was a place where we could hope for rest  our first care was to guard against the attacks of violence from any of the rovers of those deserts who might happen to discover our retreat which the nature of the place enabled us soon to effect  this building being amply capable of containing our whole number we repaired the injuries it had suffered from time or force and then proceeded to work with spirit abroad as we were certain that we slept in safety at home  but alas this gleam of happiness was too bright to last my faithful friend the merchant had so far overstrained his strength in our journey that nature failed and he died soon after our arrival our tears bore the truest testimony of honor to his merits but his death was only a presage of greater misfortunes  we had scarcely begun to taste the first fruits of our husbandry when a pestilential wind struck the laborers in the field who bringing the contagion into our common habitation it soon ran through our whole colony with such malignancy that in the space of little more than a moon there remained alive only my father my wife and myself  what we must have felt in such a situation need not be told the wisdom of my father and the consolations of my wife were scarcely sufficient to keep my heart from rebelling against heaven by repining at its will as i looked upon myself to be the cause of their misfortunes  the lenient hand of time had but just begun to heal my soul when our father sunk gently into the sweet sleep of timely death leaving his disconsolate daughter and her more unhappy husband to mourn a loss deplorable in itself but ten thousand fold more to be deplored from the peculiar circumstances of our situation  heaven always proportions our strength to the trials which it lays before us resigned to its good pleasure my wife and i found inexhausted comfort in each other for near two hundred moons when the bite of an adder as we walked one unhappy day on the bank of yonder river deprived me of the better half of my heart  this was a stroke which i could never have supported had not an infant daughter the sole pledge of our loves called forth every virtue to our mutual aid i remembered the reciprocal duties of nature and submitted to suffer the misery of life for her sake nor have i ever known another care since but for her happiness without once daring to look forward to the dreadful hour of our separation  from that time my life has been a perfect blank i have not even dared to indulge hope because i have had no rational expectation upon which i can found it i walk blindfold in the guidance of heaven without presuming to consider whither it may lead me  whether the disappointment of the design which led me to this place arose from my showing a diffidence in the power of heaven by letting any human obstacle divert me from going directly to carthage or whether my vision was not merely an illusion of my own imagination i pretend not to say i acted for the best and i submit with reverence to the will of heaven  this o my son is the story of my misfortunes from which you may at least receive this melancholy consolation that you are not the most unhappy of mankind  section ix when the venerable himilco had thus concluded his narrative he left me for some time as if to regulate his little economy with his daughter though i believe his first purpose was to give vent to the griefs which naturally attended the remembrance of his misfortunes  my mind in the mean while was too strongly impressed with events of such singularity to attend to any thing else i ran over the various occurrences of his life and from a comparison of it with my own drew this consolation that i must certainly have been directed by heaven to his habitation for our mutual happiness  i waited some days however before i would mention this thought to himilco in order to contemplate more closely the disposition of his daughter before i attached my fate to here is if i should not rather say that i was prevented by fear of a refusal as my heart became every hour more and more enamoured of her  himilco at length relieved me from this embarrassment by asking me one day as we walked among the ruins in what manner i meant to proceed in order to accomplish the purpose of heaven which had been so strikingly communicated to me  it was impossible for me to avoid explaining myself any longer i therefore opened all my heart to him as well as the confusion inevitable on such an occasion would permit and waited with the strongest anxiety for his answer as the decision of my fate  regarding me for some moments with a look of inexpressible tenderness i am no stranger said he o my son to your sentiments in respect to my daughter i have beheld them laboring in your heart from the first day of your arrival here nor was the discovery displeasing on the contrary i will own that i have found pleasure in drawing the same conclusion with you from the wonderful manner in which you have been led as it were by the hand to this place where i had never hoped to see the face of man  but o my son you have much to do before you can think of fixing your rest in any place the decrees of heaven must be fulfilled and you must seek the fate it has appointed for you which certainly cannot be here at least as yet  the clouds which have obscured the morning of your life have evidently arisen from your violation of filial duty in leaving your father without his consent or benediction you must therefore return to him and receive his forgiveness before you can expect to be happy  if after that your sentiments shall remain the same as at present and meet his approbation you will find no opposition to your wishes either from my daughter or from me and heaven will preserve you for each other if it approves your union  nor is the journey so difficult as you may apprehend the season approaches when the caravan passes through these regions in pilgrimage to mecca to the track of that i will direct you and with them you will travel in safety  severely as i felt this delay of my hopes it was not in my power to make any reply to the reasons which he gave for it from that day i lived with him and his daughter in a state of happiness resembling that which the just enjoy as they draw near to heaven  when the day of my departure arrived his daughter presented me with a scrip filled with dried fruits of various kinds as a provision for my journey till i should meet the caravan the way of which himilco pointed out to me by such certain signs which he had learned from his friend that there could be but little danger of my missing it  i shall not attempt to describe my parting with his daughter in compassion to us both himilco hurried me away from this distressful scene and leading me to the extremity of the ruins dismissed me with a kiss of peace  he had before provided me with a faquirs habit the disguise which had so often been favorable to himself in which he concealed some gold and jewels of great price as also a sabre and a shield for my defense should it be my misfortune to be met by any of the men or beasts of prey which ranged those boundless deserts  section x my mind was so oppressed by the recollection of what i had already undergone so terrified by the prospect before me that i forgot to attend to the signs by which himilco had directed me to find the track of the caravan insomuch that after traveling for several days longer than he had prescribed for my gaining it i found to my inexpressible unhappiness that i had been only involving myself deeper in those inexplicable wilds  this discovery struck me with the deepest dismay my heart died in me for some moments recollecting myself however and asking forgiveness of heaven for this involuntary distrust of its protection i ascended the nearest high tree to try if i could see any of the signs by which himilco had marked my way  having made the best observations i could i resolved as the evening began to close apace to remain where i was for that night in hope of continuing my journey in an happier hour the next morning  as i was soothing my melancholy in contemplating the struggles between light and darkness for the possession of the sky and comparing them with the vicissitudes of human life my ear was suddenly struck by the sound of several voices which appeared not to be far distant from me when turning my eye to the side from whence they came i was surprised to see a number of children as i thought running about in sport near the tree which i had climbed  my first surprise though soon gave place to a greater when i considered the appearance of the creatures i beheld their bodies which were totally uncovered were white as marble without any suffusion of that redness by which the blood distinguishes animal life their height did not exceed two cubits at the most at the same time that their agility was utterly irreconcilable with the strength of children of that age  while i was gazing in astonishment at beings whom i immediately concluded to be some of those inhabitants of the air of whom ancient tradition relates so many wonders one of them happening to approach my station his sense of smelling gave him the alarm which he instantly communicated to the rest who crouding around the tree soon discovered me among the branches when giving a yell of affright they all ran into a cavern at the foot of a hill close to where i was  this appearance of fear was so inconsistent with the notion i had formed of them that i was utterly at a loss to what motive i should attribute it i thought it could not be a stratagem to decoy me down as beings who were lords of the elements such as i supposed them to be could enforce their commands by means impossible for me to resist i therefore concluded that my better angel must have interposed though imperceptibly to me and resolved to continue where i was under his protection till the return of the sun whose light suspends the power of those inferior spirits should enable me to proceed without fear of molestation from them  but a few moments solved the difficulty in a more natural manner i had scarce formed this resolution when i saw an animal of the most hideous aspect which had ever struck my sight advance toward the place where they had been  his stature was higher than that of the tallest man but in every proportion unnaturally slender for his height his tawny skin was thinly shaded with hair of the same color his ears hung down like those of the animal abominated by all nations while his flat visage came so near the human as to strike me with shame and horror at the resemblance  though i had never seen a creature of his kind before i directly knew him from description to be one of those animals which make the middle link between the brute and human natures in the chain of life such herds of which himilco had informed me inhabited several parts of those deserts as would long since have overrun the whole were it not for the numbers daily destroyed in their furious broils with each other happening to raise his eyes as he drew near the tree he espied me when chattering his teeth and grinning a smile of horrible delight he instantly prepared to ascend to me  as i knew what kind of enemy i had to deal with i was not under the same apprehension as before but determined to stand upon my defense i therefore unsheathed my sabre and placing myself where the boughs could not impede my arm the moment he came within my reach dealt him such a blow as felled him to the ground where he lay roaring and struggling in vain to rise  this instantly showed me the necessity of changing my resolution and descending from the tree to slay him outright lest his cries should draw more of his fellows about me than i might be able to resist accordingly i sprung down and with one stroke severed his ghastly head from his body  section xi while i was considering whether i had better reascend the tree or proceed to seek some place of greater safety for the night i was surprised to find myself surrounded on a sudden by the swarm of little beings who had just before fled away as affrighted at the sight of me  though i thought them impassive to human force i naturally put myself in a posture of defense calling to them at the same time in a menacing tone to keep at a distance from me  but i soon found that my apprehensions were groundless and that they were really as much afraid of me as i could possibly be of them  on hearing my voice they started back and huddling close together stood evidently fluctuating between fear and joy their eyes sparkling with exultation when they looked at the dead savage but sinking again with diffidence and affright when turned toward me  this instantly suggested it to me that the creature i had slain was their enemy and that their fear of me proceeded from my resemblance of him to remove this fear therefore i went to the dead body and giving it a stroke or two with my sabre spurned the head from me with a look and gesture of the strongest detestation  such a proof of my enmity to their foe was received as an express treaty of friendship and alliance with them they directly shook off all fear and running with shouts of joy and triumph to the dead body treated it with every insult of hatred and revenge till their rage was glutted when seeming to recollect to whom they were indebted for his death they turned their attention to me and one of them whose features on his nearer approach i could perceive bore the marks of old age advanced alone to me and put himself without apprehension into my power while the rest giving a shout of joy made signs to me to go with them into their cavern  though by this time i was convinced that far from being what i had at first supposed they were in reality only one of those varieties in which nature delights to disport herself a diminutive species of the human kind from whose force i had as little reason to apprehend danger as from their present intentions yet such was the power of prepossession so difficult to divest the mind of the apprehensions of ignorance that i felt a kind of horror in complying with that invitation which stronger curiosity would not permit me to refuse  this momentary hesitation however escaped their notice and they showed the highest pleasure at my compliance they shouted they danced and frisked around me all the way to the cavern where the same one who had advanced to me before and whom i saw the rest treated with respect beckoned to me to stop while they removed a number of gins and sharpened stones with which the entrance was beset in such a manner as made their retreat inaccessible to any creature bigger than themselves and which was not acquainted also with the several windings between them  when the passage was thus cleared my guide again made signs to me to follow him stooping though unnecessarily for himself as he entered to show me that i must stoop  it is impossible for words to express my astonishment when i entered this subterraneous city for such i immediately perceived it to be the inside of the hill being entirely scooped out whether by nature or art i could not distinguish so as to make a cavity capable of containing many times the number of the little community which then inhabited it and divided into regular compartments proper for the few purposes of their simple life  as the shades of night had by this time covered the earth i expected to have found the cavern either involved in darkness or artificially illuminated by fire but no sooner had i entered than i imagined i saw another sky which emitted a light pallid indeed and feeble but sufficient to discover every present object to the eye  in the first impulse of surprise i raised my hand to what i thought the sky when i found that the light was only reflected from a viscid substance which distilled through the roof and sides of the cavern and retained so much of the rays of the sun admitted through different crevices in the day as reflected thus served to supply his place during his absence  having replaced their defenses and settled all things in a state of safety the whole people to the number of about forty of both sexes and every age gathered around me as i sat upon the ground after the example of my leader where having satisfied their curiosity by looking at me for some time the greater part withdrew to their domestic concerns  in a little time some of them returned laden with fruits and the flesh of various birds and other little animals some of which appeared to have been dried or rather sodden in the sun but the greater part was raw and setting them before me my host as i may call him eat himself to encourage me to eat  as i had taken no food from the rising of the sun i followed his example and eat of the fruits sufficiently for the support of nature but i loathed to taste the flesh though he strove to tempt me by eating with a voracity which showed that he thought it most delicious  having finished our repast he took me to a spring which issued from the side of the cave where i slacked my thirst and washed my feet in a pool filled with the overflowing of the water after which observing that i was overpowered with sleep he led me through various windings to a kind of niche large enough to serve me for an apartment where he made signs to me to lay me down to rest  resolved to comply with every thing which should be proposed to me for that night i directly obeyed him letting him see me however lay my sword under my head in such a manner that it could not be removed without awaking me a care of which i afterward found i had no occasion  section xii my mind had been so overlaboured in the observation of these strange events that i soon sunk into a profound sleep in which all my cares were buried till the next morning was far advanced as i could judge by the light transmitted through a crevice in the roof of the cave near the place where i lay  having looked around me and found every thing in the same state as when i went to sleep i lay still for some time in expectation of my hosts coming to me till my patience being quite exhausted i arose intending to depart without farther delay in hope of disentangling myself from that part of the wilderness before the night should come on  but i soon found my intention defeated the cavern was cut into such an inexplicable labyrinth that i wandered through it for a considerable time without being able to find the entrance or even to return to the place where i had slept never to my utter astonishment seeing or even hearing one of the inhabitants  losing at length all hope of extricating myself without their assistance i called aloud several times upon which i immediately heard the buzzing of their voices all around me  after some minutes my host as i have called him came toward me but with an appearance of distrust and apprehension to remove an impression therefore which i saw might be disadvantageous to me i sat down upon the ground and reaching out my hand with a smile the honest creature suspecting no deceit as he designed none resumed his former confidence and sat down near me with evident pleasure whereupon the whole community who had waited the event of his approach instantly came round me with the same freedom as before  the light which now entered through various apertures in the roof of the cavern enabled me to see every thing distinctly i have already described their size and the peculiar color of their bodies in other respects they differed not from the ordinary race of men a singularity in one feature excepted which at first view was not so pleasing this was a prominence in their eyes from whence probably proceeded their seeing so much better in a feeble than a strong light and may have been the cause of their choosing such a gloomy habitation  our amity being thus restored on my making signs of a desire to go out of the cavern my host instantly led me to the entrance where he stopped being unable to bear the light of the sun but gave me to understand that he would wait my return by seating himself upon the ground  our desire for any thing is always in proportion to the difficulty which attends the attainment of it though i was so anxious to continue my journey but a few minutes before i now no sooner found myself so perfectly at my liberty than that anxiety ceased and i resolved to indulge my curiosity by staying a few days among this extraordinary people to observe their customs and manners and if possible acquire some knowledge of their language  accordingly as soon as i had looked around me for a few minutes to mark the way i came i went back to the mouth of the cave where i found my host who expressed the strongest satisfaction at my return  the little community who now regarded me as one of themselves pursued their usual occupations as if i was not present by which means i soon had an opportunity of making all the observations i desired  i have taken notice before that their bodies were entirely naked nor was that custom however strange to me in the least to be wondered at when their situation was properly considered  natural necessity for clothing they had none as their place of habitation defended them from every inclemency of weather and to the artificial necessity of shame they were strangers both from their seclusion from the rest of the world and that it had never entered into their thoughts that nature had made any parts of their bodies objects of shame and for the same reason they performed all the natural functions wherever she suggested the performance of them  their desires were as limited as their powers of gratification they eat fruits with which the happiness of the climate supplied them at every season and the flesh of birds and those smaller animals which we denominate vermin taken in gins in the construction of which all the powers of their ingenuity seemed to terminate  implements of domestic economy they knew not the use of they eat their food without any preparation they stooped to the fountain to drink and when their appetites were satisfied they laid themselves down to sleep without farther care for the whole day the strong light of the sun suspending their occupations as much as darkness does those of other men  i found no great difficulty in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of their language which was far from being copious their situation and simplicity of life suggesting but very few ideas they had names for the things they knew and expressions for the uses they made of them and that was nearly its whole extent for they never combined their ideas nor employed the faculties of the mind on its own operations  of all the passions which agitate the heart and equally constitute the happiness and misery of man they seemed to have a sense only of fear and love if i should not add hatred and joy though no more than consequences of the former in the only instance i ever could discover of them their behavior when i slew the savage nor were the effects even of these powerful or lasting  when the entrance of their cavern was defended in the manner i have described they appeared to have no farther fear and of love i could never perceive the least resemblance except in parental affection for their offspring such as nature has imprinted on every animal for the purpose of preserving the species the attachments of friendship or seclusive connections between the sexes appearing to be utterly unknown to them  i have observed that they seemed to pay respect to the one who first approached and afterward attended particularly to me but i could never perceive that he had any authority or influence over them  they had given place to his superior intrepidity and followed his example in that instance and that was all for of an established authority or government there did not appear the faintest shadow among them any more than of religion of the very first principles of which supposed to be universally written in the human heart they were utterly ignorant nor when i was able in some manner to converse with them could i ever make them form the least conception of either  till their offspring were able to procure their own food they followed their parents who fed them but with this necessity the attachment on both sides ended so absolutely that i could never trace even the remembrance of it every one did just what they pleased without respect being paid to or offense taken by any other  i have said that they took me at first for one of those savages with which they live in a continual state of war but when they were undeceived by my killing their enemy and they had entered into amity with me they expressed no curiosity to know who i was or whence i came my words seeming to make impression upon them no longer than upon the air through which the sound of them passed to their ears  nor must it be supposed that this inattention proceeded from pride their ignorance of themselves was equally great when i asked if they were originally of that country they could not comprehend what i meant nor did they know whether there was any more of their own species in the world  my curiosity soon took in the whole of such a narrow sphere i left them at the end of seven days convinced of the contemptible ignorance of those torpid visionaries who affect to place happiness in the absence of passion and being content merely with the support of nature  a comparison of such a people with myself gave me a consequence in my own eyes which restored the vigor of my mind and supported me through my journey i soon recovered the waymarks pointed out to me by himilco from which i had not strayed so far as the dejection of my spirits had made me apprehend and on the sixth day from my leaving the little people joined the caravan  end of the first book the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the second section i as the express intent of their journey continued the captive was to perform a religious duty i expected to have met with nothing but acts of virtue and sentiments of piety among the pilgrims but a very little time showed me that the professed intention does not always govern the actions of man even in those sacred matters  i had not been long with the caravan when my attention was struck by one of the pilgrims whose demeanor showed a degree of sanctity superior to all the rest  not content with performing all the rites ordained by his religion he doubled them in every instance nature seemed unequal to the rigor of his abstinence the hours allotted to rest he spent in prayer and his exhortations were numbered by the steps of his journey  such a sight was balm to my heart i thought the merits of this one man overbalanced the failings of all the rest virtue cannot be a shadow i reasoned with myself i have now met the substance upon which i may safely form my judgment  but a moments reflection damped the pleasure of this thought i have been deceived before i continued and how can i be certain that i am not so now that i do not see this man also in a mirror i will observe him better before i presume to judge  for this purpose i attached myself more closely to him than i had done before when the event was far from confirming the opinion i had conceived in his favor i soon thought i saw pride supply the place of piety in his most exemplary acts of devotion and virtue made use of as a veil to cover vice  this discovery almost drove me to despair to what purpose i exclaimed in the anguish of my soul do i see life when i am not able to judge of what i see this mans actions are all good why then should i presume to deduce them from a bad motive they surely are the best index of the heart i have formed a wrong judgment of him in one instance or the other and at any rate the former error was the more pardonable where there is any uncertainty a good heart will always judge favorably let me therefore hope that i have deceived myself by a false sagacity and that my first opinion of him was right but this hope was of short duration  the santone for by that venerable appellation was he distinguished from the other pilgrims in the caravan was encouraged by the admiration he had raised to form still higher hopes  addressing himself to me one evening after prayer i have observed said he my son with what piety you perform the rites of religion and how attentively you listen to the exhortation of my words come to my tent at the third hour of the night when my private devotions will be finished that we may confer together upon the ways of heaven  such an invitation was far from being unpleasing to me as it must give me an opportunity of clearing up the doubts with which my mind was perplexed i therefore punctually attended the appointment of the santone whom i found expecting my arrival  placing me beside him on his carpet i have observed said he o my son the regularity of your deportment and rejoice to have found in so young a man one who is worthy of my friendship i read your heart in your looks and will open myself to you without fear or reserve a confidence which will not only show you things in their proper colors but also convince you of the advantage of attaching yourself to me and entering into all my views  it is impossible for me to express how much i was surprised at this address the manner was as unexpected as the matter was incomprehensible such a familiar style of discourse being totally different from the abstracted broken sentences in which he was accustomed to deliver his sentiments however i was sufficiently master of myself to conceal my astonishment and the santone taking my habitual silence for assent continued his discourse in these words  section ii you are doubtlessly surprised at the austerities which you daily see me practice upon myself and think that enthusiasm alone can support me through them but that opinion is superficially drawn i act from the universal principle of human nature which proposes the gratification of the ruling passion in every act however repugnant that act may be to it in appearance  the object of my wishes the end of all my labors is power and that in the most extensive sense let warriors ravage nations and lead the wretched inhabitants in chains my empire is of a more exalted nature i scorn to hold the body in subjection while the mind is free of this empire you are yourself a witness and a subject how i have established it and to what further purposes i mean to improve its influence are the things which i intend to reveal in confidence to you  i could contain myself no longer gracious heaven i exclaimed is it possible that the religious exercises which strike the world with such reverence can proceed from any other motive than true piety  moderate your zeal my son he returned with a contemptuous smile and all these matters shall be explained to you true piety never strikes the world with reverence because it is never seen by the world it is an immediate intercourse between the soul and heaven carried on in acts merely spiritual and which cannot be represented to sense whenever you see a man perform religious exercises in public and especially if he affects to exceed in them you may safely conclude either that his reason is disordered or that he acts from motives most different from those which he professes  what service can the deity receive from the works of man is it not derogating from the idea we have of his wisdom to think that he can approve acts of folly or madness is it not offering an affront to his goodness to suppose that he can take pleasure in the sufferings of his creatures and yet to such absurd such impious opinions do all those austerities those religious exercises which impose upon the greater part of the world owe their credit  the wiser few indeed turn this folly to their own advantage and upon this apparent selfdenial these voluntary sufferings found the firmest power of enjoying all the real pleasures of which life is capable  the love of pleasure and the fear of pain are the ruling principles of the human heart in which they maintain an uninterrupted struggle for superiority  now the whole art of governing mankind consists in the management of these two principles which by some means has become the peculiar province of priesthood and is the scepter with which they rule the world for as the ignorance of mankind has been brought to believe the pleasures of nature to be crimes against its author and that the same authority which has arbitrarily made them such has given power to a particular set of people to prescribe means of avoiding the punishment of them hereafter by sufferings here for the imposition would have refuted itself if the punishment had not been postponed to another state from which we can have no intelligence though at the same time to counterbalance that delay of commencement there has been given to it an eternity of duration nothing is easier than for those who are supposed to be entrusted with this power to turn the commutation of that punishment to their own advantage in what manner they please  in order to exert this power most effectually it is necessary to strike the senses of its objects with an appearance of superior sanctity which may be considered in the double light of a consequence of the sacred character and a confirmation of its efficacy and this cannot be done any way so well as by abstaining in the extreme degree from those pleasures which are represented to be crimes because it appears to be a conviction that they really are such and that indulgence in them is as dangerous as it is represented  nor is this the only advantage derived from this abstinence it is thought to be so meritorious from the supposed difficulty of it as to give such an interest with the power in obedience to whom it is pretended to be practiced that nothing can be refused to the intercession of him who practices it and this is the completion of his work  as to the difficulty of this abstinence it is all imaginary in respect to food the simplest is that which supports nature best and the less which is taken even of that the better she performs her functions were the pleasure of temperance both in the quantity and quality of aliment known luxury and excess would soon be banished from the world and as to other appetites their force is derived merely from their indulgence every day they are restrained the restraint becomes less troublesome till in the end it ceases to be a trouble  of the progress which i have already made in the execution of my design you are yourself a witness the greater part of the difficulty and all doubt of success are conquered nothing remains now but to pursue the path which lies plain and easy before me and it will soon lead me to the summit of my wishes  in the mean time i have need of an assistant in my labors an associate in my power who will consult his own interest by his fidelity to me and for this purpose i have selected you from among the numbers who would be proud of such an honor  my intention is to persist in my present manner till i shall have performed this pilgrimage to mecca on the additional credit of which i propose at my return to my native country of biledulgerid to promulgate a new religion which i have already planned on the principles most likely to strike those people and as soon as it shall have taken possession of their minds i will then unite the civil to the religious power and establish a sovereignty which no force can subvert as it will be founded in the minds of my subjects  i have thus my son opened my whole purpose to you and have no doubt of your assistance in bringing it to perfection as you will share the benefit while i live and enjoy the whole after my decease  the first instance in which i shall require your cooperation is this  tomorrow after the evening prayer i will feign to fall into a trance which i can do without danger of detection by means of a composition which has the power of suspending every animal function for a length of time proportioned to the quantity in which it is taken so as to effect an appearance of death not possible to be distinguished from the reality  while i lie in all appearance inanimate you must on a sudden fix your eyes upon the air just over me and then falling on your knees pray aloud with fervency  the crowd will naturally gather around you to know the meaning of this conduct when you must point toward the place where i lie and ask them with looks and exclamations of astonishment if they do not see a celestial spirit hanging upon the wing over me  this will fix their attention and fire their already heated imaginations to such a degree that many of them will think they really see what you describe while all the rest will assent to it to avoid the imputation of infidelity and for fear of the consequences of contradicting the spirit of enthusiastic superstition  when this spirit is thus raised i know how to direct it to the best advantage i will feign a revelation of those things which i would have them believe to the truth of which i will thus make themselves bear witness  when this first step is happily taken we will consult how we are to proceed farther  section iii it is impossible to express the horror with which i was struck by this proposal i thought myself contaminated by the bare communication of it and held his confidence as the greatest dishonor which had ever befallen me concluding that he must have seen an appearance of guilt in my looks to make him select me for his accomplice  at first i determined to open the mystery of his iniquity but when i considered the consequence of contradicting enthusiastic superstition as he had said i did not think myself justifiable in throwing away my own life where i had no prospect of defeating his impious designs  but happily an opportunity soon offered of extricating me from this difficulty  along with the caravan in which i traveled there journied a company of merchants who were going to bagdat and bassora to barter the commodities of africa for those of the asiatic regions  we had passed the isthmus of suez the very day before the santone had opened his intentions to me as i returned from his tent to my own my way led me by the quarter of those merchants whom i found preparing to separate from the caravan the next morning  it instantly struck me that i might escape the danger of refusing to enter into his iniquitous schemes by departing along with these merchants i accordingly went directly to my tent and taking my scrip upon my back and my staff in my hand joined them just before they began their march  it was some time before my soul could free itself from the horror with which the profligacy of the santone had struck me at length after weighing deliberately every thing which he had said i found consolation in reflecting that the abuse of the best things produces the worst effects and that the excellence of true piety was only proved more signally by its being able to stand the test of such prostitution  we pursued our journey to bagdat without meeting any occurrence worth relating  high as my curiosity had been raised by the accounts which i had heard of this imperial city my impatience to embrace the knees of my father was so strong that i should not have delayed an hour in it had it been in my power to proceed but all the neighboring nations were involved in such furious wars that it was necessary for me to wait for a favorable opportunity before i could expect to perform my journey in safety  the scene i was now in was so utterly new to me that i could only gaze in silent admiration without being able to form any judgment of what i saw the infinite variety of the objects which attracted my attention prevented my attending to any of them i had not time to observe one when another presented itself to my observation so that i literally was lost in the wilderness of my own thoughts  while i was in this state of perplexity i happened one day as i performed my devotions in the principal mosque to kneel close to an aged man who instantly fixed his eyes upon me in the most earnest manner  as i could not recollect that i had ever seen him before i concluded he must have mistaken me for some other person and soon as the prayers were ended departed without taking any further notice of him but i had not gone far before i was accosted abruptly by a slave who bade me with an air of authority to follow him  though i was naturally surprised at such an address i judged from the manner in which he spoke that it would be in vain for me to refuse and therefore to make a merit of my compliance obeyed without asking him any questions or even observing whither he led me till i found myself in one of the courts of the khaliffs palace  i had not waited long when i was introduced into the presence of the grand vizier whom i directly knew to be the person who had regarded me so attentively some minutes before at the mosque  as soon as i approached him i would know said he o young man who thou art and what thine occupation is in this city  the manner in which he spoke was far from giving me any alarm as i was conscious of no crime i was free from fear and resolved while i adhered strictly to truth not to enter into the particulars of my life farther than was necessary to satisfy his curiosity  may the substitute of him whose power rules the world i answered live for ever your slave comes from the remotest parts of arabia the happy my motive for leaving my native country was to see the manners of different people and prove the precepts of education by experience  have thou not been among the bedouins he interrupted me sternly and have thou not even led those troops of ravagers in their attacks upon the caravans of the true believers  unexpected as this question was it did not disconcert me i answered him in the boldness of innocence and truth and in few words gave him an account of the manner in which i had been taken captive by the bedouins and the reason of their dismissing me from among them  the force of truth is irresistible he heard me with attention and as soon as i had ended thy virtue has been proved by many trials said he rising from the sopha upon which he sat and embracing me tenderly i have been myself a grateful witness of it i was in the number of the captives whom you so generously saved from the cruelty of those barbarians and dismissed in peace nor did my unexpected deliverance on that day fill my heart with sincerer joy than i feel now at this happy opportunity of showing my sense of it  i need not attempt to describe the effect which these words had on me i returned his embrace with equal warmth and forgot that i had ever been unhappy  my friend for he would never permit me to address him by any other appellation was not satisfied with heaping all the benefits in his own power upon me he introduced me to the khaliff to whom he represented me in such an advantageous light that he soon distinguished me by many marks of his favor  my first advances to this envied station drew upon me the frowns and malevolence of all who had already gained or aspired to it but an event soon happened which totally changed their conduct  section iv my friend the vizier who had descended far into the vale of years fixed his eye upon me as a proper successor in those cares to the weight of which he began to feel himself unequal he recommended me therefore in such strong terms to the khaliff that he made no difficulty of permitting him to resign the reins of government and entrusting them to me  the clouds which had attended every step of my ascent to this height of power vanished the moment i had attained it and in their place i met nothing but smiles of congratulation and professions of attachment and respect  unpractised in the ways of men i readily gave credit to appearances which i was not conscious of having given any reason to doubt and formed the most pleasing schemes for turning the influential power i now enjoyed to the general advantage the splendour of the present scene dazzling my eyes and making me overlook the essential resemblance between it and the former in which i had met so mortifying a disappointment in my designs of the same kind among the bedouins  in this delusion i eagerly resumed my favorite scheme of reformation confiding in the obvious rectitude and advantage of it and the integrity of my own heart to secure my interest with the khaliff and in his power to protect me from the attempts of any who should be so lost to every sense of virtue and public spirit as to oppose me in the execution  nor was i deceived in this confidence the discernment and justice of the khaliff viewed my intentions in a just light and they confirmed me still more strongly in his esteem  but there were many obstacles in the way to my wishes which i foresaw not at the first or rather looked upon in the opposite light  the greatest of these arose from the power of appointing to places of profit or honor under the government which was apparently vested in the office i bore and not only overwhelmed me with vexation but also counteracted my designs though i had built upon it as one of the surest means of their success  empty as the honor and poor the profits of many of those places were the number and importunity of the candidates for them embarrassed me beyond expression  some pleaded their own merits others those of their ancestors this one his youth and ability to do service that his age and the services he had done though he was now incapable of repeating them one urged his poverty and the necessity he had for relief another his riches and the influence they gave him over his fellows in a word every circumstance and distinction which varies the motley view of life was alleged to enforce their pretensions  nor was this solicitation only for such places as were actually vacant they vied with equal eagerness for those which were already filled blackening the characters of the possessors as well as of each other with every calumny which envy or ambition could suggest  in the mean time though it was evident that i could not gratify such numbers as applied even if i was so inclined yet each affected to take offense and the refusal of impossible requests made me irreconcilable enemies the competitors dropping their mutual animosities to join in combinations against me for a disappointment of expectations contradictory in themselves and destructive of each other and representing every word and action of my life in such malignant colors as made me an object of general detestation to the misguided multitude whose dearest interests and happiness i was at the very time laboring to promote  severely as i felt the sting of this ingratitude i bore it while it affected myself only but when their virulence presumed to rise from me to the khaliff i could support it no longer but to prevent that worst misfortune which can befall a sovereign the loss of his subjects love threw myself at his feet and implored his permission to leave a court where my best intentions had unhappily produced so bad an effect  strong as the reasons were with which i enforced this request the khaliff thought his honor as well as his regard concerned not to grant it he raised me from the ground and bidding me fear nothing while he approved my conduct prepared to make those who had thus presumed to oppose his pleasure feel the weight of his resentment  but the consequences which i foresaw might attend this firmness however favorable to myself and noble in its motive struck me with horror i repeated my suit therefore in terms so pressing that i in a manner extorted his compliance against his inclination and leaving my enemies to triumph in their success joined a body of troops which the khaliff was sending to the assistance of aladdin king of diarbee who then waged a most unequal war with the sultan of khouaresm  though the motives of the opposition to which i had thus fallen a sacrifice and the means by which it had been carried on were equally unjust candor obliges me to confess in this cool moment of deliberate reflection that my own indiscretion assisted it in too many instances  secure of the support of the khaliffs favor i slighted public opinion and thought it beneath me to pay regard to appearances as my intentions were right eager for the accomplishment of which i never studied a proper season but obtruding them abruptly without attention to circumstances provoked opposition by injudicious precipitancy where modest delicacy and caution would have obviated every objection and ensured success  i wish i could say that the khaliff himself had not also given something too like reason for the clamours raised upon this occasion  while he devoted all his thoughts to the cultivation of the finer arts and moral reformation of his people the most important affairs of the state either languished in neglect or miscarried in the attempt of conducting them by the rules of private virtue from too lively a sense of the evils of war he sacrificed the interests of his people and the honor of his crown to preserve peace and mercy indiscriminately dispensed robbed the laws of respect and encouraged crimes by taking away the fear of punishment  one advantage it is true i received from this second disappointment which was that of being convinced by the unerring proof of experience that as power in the first instance does not always procure happiness in the second it is always unhappy for if the pillow of a prince is sometimes uneasy that of a favorite is ever filled with thorns all the troubles of the former being aggravated to the latter by anxiety at the uncertainty of his situation  section v the pain i felt at leaving a court where i had thought myself so happily established was in some degree alleviated by resentment and hope of acquiring such glory in the war as should dazzle my enemies at my return and raise me above danger of suffering the like disgrace again especially as i resolved never more to give offense by attempting to serve people against their inclinations  the khaliff dismissed me with the warmest assurances of regard he had offered me the command of his troops but a sense of my inexperience in the art of war made me decline so difficult a charge till i should be more equal to it  and yet interrupted temugin equal inexperience in the arts of government had not made you decline that charge presumptuous folly to think it easier to govern a whole people in idleness and in a manner free from restraint and conduct the complicated affairs of peace than to command a small part of them who are prepared to obey and direct them to a particular end however difficult to attain on which they are themselves all intent  i acknowledge mighty lord the justice of your reprehension returned the captive but such is the confidence of man in his own abilities where it is not restrained by the obvious necessity of observing some particular method of which practice only can make him master  no one attempts the simplest works of mechanism who has not practiced the manner but all think themselves born with abilities to govern  proceed replied temugin i reprehend not thee the fault is in human nature  as soon as i had joined the army of aladdin resumed the captive i applied myself with the greatest assiduity to learn the military art which i had an opportunity of seeing in all its various extent the war in which he was engaged calling forth all the resources of his genius and courage to balance the superiority of the sultans forces  the manner in which i had parted from the khaliff had made me flatter myself that his regard for me was unalterably fixed but i soon had reason to change my opinion  he had ordered me to send him constant accounts of all the events of the war but to these i never received the least return and to remove all doubt of the reason of such a slight i saw one of my most malignant enemies appointed to the command of the troops in which i served though on the death of the former general i had solicited that trust my abilities for which could not now be doubted  this was an indignity i could not bear in the anguish of my soul therefore i threw myself at the feet of aladdin and informing him of my situation implored his protection and leave to serve in his own troops  that vigilant and discerning prince who was not a stranger to the character of any soldier in his armies readily granted my suit and as in such a scene of continued action i could not long want an opportunity of proving my abilities i soon arose to the highest rank in his forces  i had justified the good opinion which raised me to the command of a separate army by several signal successes when a tempest and hurricane burst upon me one day as i was on a march and overwhelmed the greater part of my troops  as this was an accident which no human precaution could prevent i did not apprehend that it could possibly be imputed to me as a fault and therefore sent directly to inform aladdin of my misfortune and desire a reinforcement  but he viewed the matter in a different light and sending another general to take the command from me let me know that it was a maxim with him never to employ again an officer who had once been unfortunate  impious absurdity exclaimed temugin to set his own will in opposition to that of heaven and pretend to make man accountable for its actions how could he expect that his soldiers should serve him with the attachment and confidence necessary to success when they were liable thus to lose the merit of their best endeavors without being guilty of any fault  and yet mighty lord returned the captive it is in order to keep up that confidence that he practices such severity such is the force of superstitious opinion i have heard him say that the soldier who serves under a commander who has once been unfortunate always fears misfortune whereas under one who has ever been successful he rushes on his enemy with an assurance of the same success which is the most certain means of obtaining it  as to the particular injustice of such a conduct that never enters into his consideration where the mind is wholly taken up with one object it measures the propriety of any means only by their aptitude to procure it  aladdin not only gives the strictest attention to the general welfare and interests of his subjects but also relieves the distresses and promotes the happiness of every individual with paternal tenderness and care  but this is where this distress or happiness does not interfere with the operations of the war the immediate and great object of all his thoughts where they do the tenderness and justice of the king and father of his people are drowned in the political views and severity of the soldier and statesman  thus while his subjects at home live in happiness and safety under the protection of his care his soldiers are obliged to divest themselves of every natural principle of action and execute his orders like mere machines without regard to circumstances or any sense but that of obedience to his will a state of subjection which nothing but the hope of accelerating by victory their return to the blessings of peace so profusely enjoyed under him can make supportable to beings whom reason invariably directs to act with a regard to their own happiness  cease your reflections replied temugin and proceed with your story aladdin is a wise prince  section vi when i had recovered from my first astonishment continued the captive i humbled my heart before heaven and seeking in myself for the cause of so many misfortunes was not at a loss to attribute them to my having delayed to return to my father and immediately resolved to turn my face homewards nor stop till i should throw myself at his feet and obtain his forgiveness  this resolution banished every repining and resentful thought and restored serenity to my mind i directly set out on my journey accompanied only by one attendant whose affectionate attachment i could not elude so as to depart alone as i would have done and through innumerable difficulties and dangers at length reached the habitation of my father  my joy arose so high as i approached this seat of innocence and content that i could scarce support its emotions it may be judged then what i felt on finding his house deserted and learning from his neighbors that he had disappeared in a few days after my departure nor had ever been heard of since  i sunk into a swoon from which i recovered only to suffer the tortures of a violent fever into which the workings of my soul had inflamed my whole frame  the care of my faithful attendant saved my life but i languished many moons in more than infantine weakness nor was it even in the power of his friendship to heal the anguish of my heart  at length when youth had triumphed over the effects of my disease a ray of delusive hope dawned upon me that i might yet find my father i recollected that when i was learning my military exercises he had shown a most anxious alarm at my expressing a desire to seek experience in the art of war and used every argument to check the military ardour with which i seemed to be fired  this instantly suggested a thought that he might have concluded i had gone to some of the armies engaged in war and accordingly pursued me  as i had already seen the armies of bagdat and diarbee i thought it in vain to seek him among them and therefore resolved to repair directly to the camp of the sultan of khouraesm never reflecting on the improbability of finding an obscure old man among the innumerable multitudes collected in such a place or of his having continued there so long even if he had gone thither at the first  i accordingly measured back the weary steps of my late journey accompanied by my faithful friend and proceeded through persian irac into the country of transoxana where i joined the army of mohammed whose evil genius had led him thither to oppose his force to yours  but a fruitless search at length showed me the folly of such a vain undertaking though i still knew not how to give it up as it was the last resource of my hope of ever seeing my father more  as i was wandering one day through the camp buried in these painful reflections the leader of a band of soldiers happening to take notice of me enquired who i was and turning the honest answer which i gave him into brutal ridicule ordered me to be enrolled directly among the troops under his command  it was in vain to expostulate i was dragged away amid the cruelties and insults of those unfeeling wretches who fallen beneath humanity themselves take a malignant pleasure in aggravating the miseries of others and thrown into a dungeon to prevent my attempting to escape till they should go upon action  every new misfortune seems heavier than the past i thought of nothing now but the horrors of my present situation among the severest of which i reckoned the loss of my faithful companion who had happened to be absent from me when i was seized nor had i any possibility of letting him know where i was  when i had lain some days in a confinement the loathsomeness and severity of which were sufficient to break the strongest health and spirits i went with the forces into the field where hope of ending my sufferings by an honorable death prompted me to behave in a manner that attracted the notice of the commander and removed all suspicion of my desiring to quit the service  on my return to the camp i sought my companion with the most anxious care but with no better success than had attended my search for my father  my spirit sunk under such accumulated disappointments i resolved to return to himilco and seclude myself from a world whose ways i despaired of ever being able to reconcile to those principles by which i had been taught to believe it governed  while i was considering how to accomplish my escape the day arrived which was to determine the sovereign of the world  detestation of every thing which had the remotest appearance of cowardice would not permit me to leave the army at such a time i therefore engaged in a cause in which even my wishes were not interested and having been entrusted with a subordinate command for i had carefully concealed my having served in the armies of aladdin i lost my liberty in the execution of my duty and now expect my fate from the sovereign of mankind  section vii the circumstances of this story made so deep an impression on the mind of temugin that he remained wrapped in thought for some time after the captive had concluded  recollecting himself at length though thy days have been but few said he the vicissitudes of thy life have been sufficient to give thee the experience of many years if thou art willing to follow me i will charge myself with thy fortunes if not depart in peace and may thy paths be prosperous thou art at liberty from this hour compulsion and fidelity are incompatible  such condescending goodness overpowered the grateful heart of selim he prostrated himself at the feet of the emperor and embracing his knees assured him of his most faithful attachment  though temugins late victory had so totally broken the spirit of sultan mohammed that he never after dared to face him in the field his son gelaleddin made such noble efforts to retrieve his affairs as seemed for some time to keep the event doubtful  while the emperor therefore was taking he necessary measures for reducn an enemy whose activity and enterprise rendered him still more formidable than the number of his forces he received information of the revolt of one of his newly conquered kingdoms in which a considerable body of his own troops had joined  such an event demanded instant attention the example might be followed by others and the reduction attended with more difficulty than the first conquest as despair always strengthens the hand of rebellion  the account had arrived just as selim had finished the story of his life in a moment the whole camp was in motion and the rising sun found temugin in full march at the head of a body of forces equal to the occasion which he held not of importance sufficient to require his whole army  in such general commotions private individuals are easily overlooked selim had received no orders to attend the emperor but he deemed it his duty and resolved to keep as near to his person as possible in hope of some happy opportunity of proving in his sight that he was not unworthy of the favor which had been shown him  the army of temugin had scarce entered the country of the rebels when they daringly advanced to meet him the battle was obstinate and bloody as temugin was hasting to support one of the wings of his army which was beginning to give way he found himself unexpectedly surrounded by a band of the rebels who knowing his person had made a desperate effort to take him prisoner but though he saw all his attendants cut to pieces he disdained to submit to such indignity he stood resolutely on his defense and like a lion fallen into a pit sacrificed to his revenge every one who dared to come within his reach till he was just sinking under fatigue and loss of blood when in the important moment which separates life from death a single soldier broke through the crowd and throwing himself before him with a loud shout exerted efforts of such uncommon valor in his defense as kept the enemy off till a body of troops whom he had apprized of the emperors danger and who had followed him as close as they could came to his relief  this was the last struggle which the rebels made for victory as soon as the battle was ended the first care of temugin was to find his deliverer whom he had known amidst all the tumults of such a scene  on the soldiers advancing through the crowd of princes and commanders who had gathered round the emperor to express their joy at his safety and congratulate him on the victory which had crowned his arms take this said he reaching him his own sword son of abudah as a pledge of my esteem and ask any boon which your heart wishes in reward of your fidelity and valor  conqueror of the world replied selim throwing himself at the emperors feet my hearts first wish is to lay down with glory in your service that life which you have blessed with liberty the bare performance of duty merits not reward  the emperor then turning to one of his chieftains go said he put all the captives to the sword let loose the rage of war upon the country nor leave a soul alive to preserve the name of such a people upon the face of the earth the world shall see the consequence of rebelling against my power  section viii the chief was just departing to put these orders in execution when selim stepped forward and prostrating himself again at the emperors feet revoke the dreadful sentence said he o substitute of heaven and imitate his mercy who has given you his power  all present were struck with astonishment and affright at a presumption never attempted before the word of the emperor being held as sacred as the will of heaven  temugin started and looking furiously on selim as he lay trembling with eagerness and anxiety at his feet how said he dare thou to doubt the justice of my commands to interpose thyself between rebellion and my vengeance beware rash youth such a crime even in thought cancels all merit  never shall a thought of his slave returned selim give offense to my lord i revere thy irresistible power and shrink to nothing before thy wrath but o hearken to the words of thy slave let the guilty but the guilty only suffer infants are incapable of rebellion and weakness sinks the woman and old age equally beneath vengeance let the innocent live to witness the punishment of the guilty the dead obey no more nor does a desolated country yield laurels to adorn the victors brow  the words of selim sunk into the emperors heart he stood some moments buried in thought then softening the rage which glowed in his looks arise said he i will show you that my word is irrevocable i bade you ask a boon you have asked and shall obtain it go take under your command the troops of casbin and execute my vengeance according to the rules of that justice in favor of which you have ventured to plead so strongly  such a charge exceeded even the hopes of selim he bowed his head to the ground in testimony of obedience and rising departed instantly to execute a command which gratified the dearest passions of his heart  putting himself therefore at the head of the forces assigned to him he flew directly to stop the carnage always committed in the first heat of victory and gathering all the captives into one body he surrounded them with a guard not more to prevent their escape than to protect them from farther injury having done which he directed his march to the capital taking them along with him  as the reason of the emperors conferring this command upon selim was as yet known but to few it was thought he had thus saved the lives of the captives for the present only to strike the greater terror by putting them to death in the sight of their families and friends for mercy to rebels was a thing unheard of  but he suffered them not to remain long in an opinion so injurious to his intentions as soon as he arrived before the capital he ordered all the prisoners to be led forth and advancing toward them as they stood trembling with suspense and horror the first orders of the emperors just wrath said he were to exterminate a people who had dared to rebel against him but his mercy has interposed and his justice now ordains that the guilty only shall suffer  let these therefore be pointed out who were the first inciters to this rebellion what pretext was feigned what end proposed to encourage it he is unworthy to lead in any cause who will not stand between his followers and destruction  he had scarce spoken these words when a confused noise announced the arrival of the king of this unhappy people he appeared to have past the middle stage of mans life but to have suffered more from misfortune than from time a ray of native majesty shot through the gloom of grief which overcast his looks he was arrayed in the garb of mourning and the ensigns of royalty were borne reversed before him  at his approach all was still as death on being informed of what selim had said a gleam of joy flashed over his face he stepped forward and with an air of dignity and resolution behold o worthy substitute of the conqueror of the world he said the man whom you seek i was the king of this unhappy people and on my head must fall the punishment of their misdoings  he was not the author of the revolt he led not the people to battle exclaimed a youth breaking through the crowd of captives who strove in vain to restrain him that crime since heaven has declared it such by the event was mine and i alone deserve to die for it  away rash boy returned the venerable monarch nor add thy disobedience to the number of my griefs would thou usurp the rights of thy king for who but their king can be answerable for his people  then addressing himself to selim if i was not the immediate author of the revolt he continued i strove not to suppress it if he led the people to battle it was in the authority of my name and with my assent what was a crime therefore in me was only a duty in him nor would it be consistent with the justice you propose to let the son suffer for doing that which his sovereign and his father did not forbid him to do  section ix selim listened with equal pleasure and surprise to a contest which did honor to the human name but it was far from being so pleasing to all present  the troops at the head of which the emperor had placed him were commanded under him by cafor the chieftain against whom the rebellion had first been raised  as selim was proceeding to interpose between the father and the son he was interrupted by cafor who just then joined him let the instant deaths of both said he sternly put an end to their audacious contest it were treason to show mercy to traitors  and can thou doom us to death returned the youth trembling with indignant rage for that which thy injustice alone compelled us to do for seeking redress of wrongs too great for human nature to submit to  what can this mean interrupted selim what wrongs do thou complain of and whose injustice was the cause of thy rebellion speak in the boldness of truth and expect justice  our wrongs o gracious chieftain replied the prince melting into tears at the tenderness which shone in the looks of selim are too many to be recited in a moment and the perpetrator too mighty for me to contend with you see before you two of the most miserable of men made so by him who stands in the security of power at your right hand the injustice of cafor was the cause of our crime against that only not against the sovereignty of temugin did we revolt and if thou will but sweeten death with an hope that our wrongs shall be avenged upon his head this moment will i meet it with joy in any form which his own cruelty can prescribe  shall the power of temugin be thus insulted exclaimed cafor and his vengeance delayed by the vain words of a slave give them to death the hoary traitor and his rebellious son give them instantly to the death which their acknowledged guilt deserves nor let the honor of our sovereign be longer trifled with in this manner  son of ashur returned selim the power of our mighty lord shall not be insulted nor his vengeance delayed longer than is necessary for putting it under the direction of justice by which alone the honor of a sovereign is supported  then turning to the captive prince thy accusation he continued falls upon a respected head and must be supported by the clearest proof or it will recoil with tenfold force upon thyself but let not this discourage thee to speak the words of truth justice knows no distinction of persons  emboldened by this assurance the prince paused for a few moments then raising his eyes slowly from the ground and fixing them with the modest confidence of innocence upon selim o shadow of him who rules the world he said i obey thy command and will unfold our griefs as far as nature is able to give them utterance depending upon thy compassion to pardon the incoherencies of distraction and despair  this unhappy land now doomed to suffer all the miseries of war has flourished for a long succession of ages under the government of my ancestors who all placed their glory in the happiness of their people  from the first hour of his reign my father trod invariably in their sacred steps and in order to train me in the same admitted me into his councils and made room for me on his throne as soon as reason had gained sufficient strength to imitate the example he set me  how far i answered his hopes is not for me to say he seemed to be pleased and i was happy  in this manner my age had numbered two hundred moons when the power of temugin began to shake the world  in the ardour of inexperienced youth i would have opposed his victorious arms and defended the throne of my ancestors but the wisdom of my father restrained my rashness  would thou stop the flowing of the sea he said can the breath of thy mouth repel the storm it is a duty to yield where resistance is without hope  my people may be as happy under another sovereign nor will i expose them to destruction to preserve upon my head a crown which i have always considered to have been given to me as much for their advantage as my own  i will resign myself therefore to the will of heaven without repining i will submit to the conqueror ambition is often accompanied by generosity perhaps he may require no more than an acknowledgment of his superior power and leave me to govern my people in peace under him if not i shall at least have this consolation that they will have no reason to repent of their attachment to me  section x the will of my father had ever been the rule of my actions i obeyed without reply the consequence was that which he had foreseen temugin not only confirmed him on his throne but also honored him with his particular confidence and friendship  impelled by gratitude i offered him my service in his wars at the head of a body of our chosen youth my offer was accepted and our service approved on many occasions  but this happiness was of short duration the kings of the neighboring nations who uninfluenced by the same principles of wisdom and virtue as my father had attempted to resist the conqueror found not the same favor from him when he turned his arms to distant conquests therefore he committed the government of their kingdoms to one of his commanders leaving him an army to enforce that obedience which he was sensible depended upon force alone  though my fathers kingdom could not have been included in this charge as the emperor had from the first reinstated him in all the powers of royalty and i was in his armies as a pledge for his faith the avarice of this commander levelled all distinction  no sooner had the tide of the emperors conquests led him afar off than he entered our country in an hostile manner and under the pretext of disarming the inhabitants who made no resistance plundered them with the most insatiable rapacity of the acquisitions of ages of industry and peace  surprised at such an outrage my father attempted to expostulate with the invader but instead of paying regard to his words he affected to treat his very expostulation as rebellion and marching directly to the capital of his kingdom entered as in conquest gates which were opened to him in the confidence of peace and deprived him of every shadow of power  nor did he stop there the wealth of which he had spoiled the country instead of satisfying had only heightened his avarice he thought the prince must be personally rich in proportion to the riches of his people he therefore seized the treasures of the crown and not finding them to answer his expectations concluded that they had been secreted from his search for my father looking upon his subjects as his most faithful stewards had ever scorned the preposterous policy of amassing wealth which he did not immediately want and knew would increase in their possession against he should have occasion for it  enraged at this disappointment he strove to intimidate my father by threats to a discovery which was not in his power to make but finding them ineffectual he  that man  whom to my dishonor i behold alive  that cafor  accursed be his name  dared to carry his threats into execution and loading him with many stripes shed his sacred blood by the ignominious hand of the executioner  obedience to my father had made his people submit to their own sufferings but his they could not bear they arose like one man they delivered him from the hands of the tyrant who basely saved himself by flight  the army in which i served was not far distant i soon heard the dreadful tidings and flew to my father followed by my faithful friends i would have avenged his wrongs but i was not able i could not even die in the just attempt  thus mighty commander have i shown thee the cause of our revolt i confess my guilt i have fought against my sovereign to save my father let me alone suffer for my crime but before i do suffer i claim thy promise of justice upon the author of that crime  prove the truth of my charge by every torture which he can invent but let his punishment follow the proof and i shall die happy  section xi it was not without difficulty that selim could prevent cafor from frequently interrupting the captive prince in the course of his narrative as soon as it was ended he turned to the accused with a cool but determined look and demanded what defense he could make against so black a charge  this shall defend me answered cafor in a rage brandishing his sabre over his head i disdain to submit to any other decision  o let the sword decide it exclaimed the prince eagerly strong though his arm the justice of heaven is still stronger let the sword decide it this moment  we need not refer to heaven returned selim for the decision of that which human reason can decide when appeals to the sword are admitted obedience to the laws is at an end every man is then the sovereign arbiter of his own cause  then turning to cafor son of ashur he continued since thou can not refute the atrocious charge brought against thee take the just punishment of thy guilt  saying which he made a signal to his soldiers who instantly smote off the head of cafor and laid it at his feet  the tumult occasioned by this unexpected event had no sooner subsided than selim addressing himself to the king who had stood all this time in the stupefaction of grief before him to thee o injured monarch said he the justice of temugin has rendered this redress and now reinstates thee in all the rights of that sovereignty of which thou have been so unworthily deprived restore tranquillity and order among your people punish past crimes to prevent the repetition of them and complete your own glory by completing the happiness of your subjects it is the intention of temugin that all who live under his power should be happy   then raising the prince who lay at his feet panting in an ecstasy of gratitude and joy as for your fate he continued it must be determined by the word of our sovereign he commanded me to punish the authors of this revolt how far you may be included in that command is for himself to say be not however dismayed he will weigh the cause against the crime and pay just regard to the first of human duties  this signal instance of justice restored peace to the country satisfied at seeing the wrongs of their sovereign redressed the people forgot their own and readily returned to their duty while their happiness secured their continuance in it  on selims return he threw himself at the feet of temugin to render an account of his charge the fate of cafor had reached the camp before him and the emperor had not disclosed his sentiments upon it all therefore waited with anxiety for the event  the emperor having heard him with unmoved attention as soon as he had ended the heart of man said he looking around him with an air of majesty which struck every beholder with awe can be read only by the eye of heaven i knew the valor of cafor and doubted not his virtue but he has paid the just penalty of his crime and my honor is vindicated  then directing himself to the prince who lay prostrate before him arise he continued and resume your command in my armies i war not against nature  and you turning to selim to whose more powerful genius the fortune of togrul was obliged to yield assume the name and stand near me in the place of that brave and faithful warrior whose wisdom in the council was equal to his valor in the field  end of the second book the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the third section i the exalted station to which togrul for by that name was he now known was thus raised gave for some time such employment to his mind that he scarce thought of his former misfortunes  but this respite was not long no sooner had the first tumults of youthful joy and ambition subsided than all his grief returned with aggravated weight and he upbraided himself for having suffered it to be suspended even for a moment by the smiles of a prosperity which he considered as acquired at the loss of his father and not to be enjoyed without the farther crime of violating his faith to the daughter of himilco now the sole object of his hopes and wishes to whom he accordingly resolved to return  but a principle of gratitude would not permit him to carry this purpose into execution before he should by some new services repay the debt he owed to temugin and prove himself not unworthy of the rank to which he was raised  in the mean time temugin who was no stranger to the leading passions of his heart generously resolved to employ him in a service which should afford him the amplest opportunity of indulging them  calling for him therefore one morning togrul said he i know not in what light i am to hold the khaliff of bagdat whether as an enemy or a friend the oppressions which he suffered from the lawless ambition and pride of mohammed should have filled his heart with gratitude to his deliverer but never has he thought proper to take the least notice of his obligation nor made any advances toward my friendship  take therefore the troops under your command and proceed directly to bagdat if you find him deserving of my favor receive him to it on proper terms if not the sword is in your hand to vindicate my rights  no charge in the power of temugin to give could have affected togrul in so interesting a manner the favors the slights he had received from the khaliff the malignancy of his enemies and the opportunity of revenge now in his power flashed instantly upon him and set every passion of his heart in conflict  prostrating himself at the feet of the emperor i acknowledge said he mighty lord the honor conferred upon me by this important trust and will endeavor to acquit myself of it to your satisfaction but o remember the trial to which your slave is exposed   i see interrupted the emperor the workings of your soul but i doubt not your ability to surmount still greater trials it is by such alone that virtue can be proved  the armies of temugin were always in readiness to carry his orders into instant execution togrul decamped at the first hour of the evening animated with an ardour from which his forces drew the happiest presages of success  as he pursued his march through the country of farsistan his attention was one day struck by a pile of ruins the magnificence of which tempted him to take a nearer view of them while his troops halted for refreshment  the reflections naturally suggested by such scenes were interrupted by the sight of an aged man sitting in a melancholy posture with his eyes intently fixed upon some fragments which lay in an heap before him while a flood of tears rolled in silence down his furrowed cheeks  such a sight was equally affecting to curiosity and compassion advancing therefore toward him pardon said togrul o venerable father the intrusion of a stranger who wishes to know the cause of your distress in hope it may be in his power to offer you relief  the mourner raised his eyes and looking eagerly around is the voice of benevolence heard again in this place he exclaimed sweet is the sound though its purpose is impossible  then fixing his eyes most attentively upon togrul for some moments your words o illustrious young man he continued speak a feeling heart and i see that you have already tasted of adversity i will therefore satisfy your enquiry though hopeless of its motive for alas my woes admit not of relief  having said this he turned his face to the east and prostrating himself before the heap of fragments o life of the universe he said thou glorious sun protect these sacred relics from pollution nor give the ashes of zelis to the winds before mine shall be mingled with them  when he had offered up this prayer he arose and turning to togrul i have promised to unfold to you the cause of my unhappiness he continued but this place is improper the voice of prayer and adoration only should be heard here we will withdraw into the shade of yonder arch and there i will relate the melancholy tale  as soon as togrul and he were seated these ruins said the mourner with a sigh which seemed to burst his heart are all which remains of the sacred temple of the sun and in that spot now covered with those fragments once stood the altar on which my ancestors for ages without number fed the everliving fire the hallowed emblem of his purity and power till the divine wrath kindled against the sins of mankind gave up the world to the ravages of the arabians who not content with temporal dominion dared to attack the sovereignty of heaven  they polluted our temples they overturned our altars and impiously attempted to extinguish the sacred fire emblem of him whose light had illuminated the world from its first creation an impiety never presumed before by any who had obtained dominion over us  but heaven had not so far abandoned the human race forewarned in a dream one of our lineage had built an altar in the mountains of irac agem and secretly removed thither a spark of the true fire before the sacrilegious ravagers reached this temple  the horrors of that day are not to be described in vain did the priests hold up their hands never defiled with blood never profaned with any instrument of destruction to avert the rage of war from these holy walls the tears of the mother and the cries of her infants pleaded in vain the barbarians were equally deaf to innocence and virtue  then did the piety of our race shine forth in all its glory they gathered themselves around the altar and covering it with their bodies saved the sacred fire from profanation by extinguishing it with their blood which was shed without respect to age or sex and the temple reduced to this heap of ruins  it is impossible to express the consternation of the people at this fatal outrage thinking the sacred fire utterly extinguished they abandoned themselves to despair and every where courted the swords of their destroyers  at length the spark which had been preserved in irac agem being discovered the poor remains of the true persees repaired to it and preferring those inhospitable mountains to the fertile plains of farsistan without this object of their worship built themselves a little city where their posterity has lived in peace to this day  of all our lineage there had escaped the general massacre only the one who attended the altar he had built in irac agem and an infant daughter borne to him by his sister at the loss of her own life soon after her arrival there  the danger of losing a race so long endeared to their love so necessary to their religion filled the persees with the strongest fear but heaven heard their prayers and from these two sprung a progeny which has subsisted ever since for never was our blood contaminated by mixture with any other all our alliances being among ourselves and in the nearest relations of nature a custom by which we double the happiness of life in the union of all its endearments  but though driven thus by irresistible necessity from our native land once in our lives we never fail to visit these revered ruins to implore from the sun a restoration of their glory and sprinkle upon the remains of his altar the ashes of our deceased kindred which we religiously preserve for that purpose and this was the melancholy cause of my coming hither at this time  a flood of tears here choked his utterance he hung down his head and sobbed aloud for some moments while togrul humanely wept in silence with him  section ii as soon as he had recovered the power of speech were i not convinced of the benevolence of your heart he resumed o virtuous youth i should make an excuse for paying a tribute to nature which affected heroism has dishonored with the name of weakness but i see you are superior to such false refinement  this melancholy duty having fallen upon me this year i yielded in an unhappy hour to the solicitations of my wife to let her accompany me hither  on the third day of our journey we were met by a troop of tartars who had separated from the armies of temugin and ranged the country in search of plunder  the innocence of our lives and our known poverty in those things which are called the riches of the world had ever preserved us in peace with all the nations round i advanced therefore without fear to the leader of the troop and informing him who we were expected to have been permitted to pursue our journey without interruption  but alas i flattered myself with vain expectation he had looked at the beauty of my wife with eyes of desire and resolved to tear her from my bosom  unwilling however to have recourse to open violence for fear of opposition from his followers who he knew held our people in the highest reverence he pressed us to take shelter in his tent from the heat of noon a courtesy feigned that he might have time to form some scheme for accomplishing his base design  there are some offers which however unacceptable cannot be refused  the persees have ever been famed for hospitality above all the nations upon earth we could not refuse entering his tent without an appearance of unsocial ingratitude though our laws would not permit us to taste a drop of water with him  we had not been long there when he withdrew under a pretense of giving some orders to his men nor returned till it was too late for us to reach the caravansera in which we had proposed to rest that night for it would have been reckoned an infringement upon the laws of hospitality in us to have departed without waiting for him  our uneasiness in such a situation may be well conceived but he gave reasons of such plausibility for his absence and offered so courteously to remain where he was for that night for our convenience that we could not avoid complying to stay with him  his joy at seeing us run so readily as he thought into his snares put him off his guard  i caught a glance of his eye as he gazed at my wife in which i read the nefarious purpose of his heart i arose therefore instantly and claiming the sacred privilege of hospitality proceeded that moment on my journey along with my wife  the shades of night falling upon us as we traveled by the side of a wood my wife was so terrified by the roaring of the wild beasts issuing from their dens in quest of prey that i was obliged to give way to her fears and assist her to climb a lofty tree where i placed her in safety among the boughs seating myself beside her  the fears of my wife seemed to have been impressed by heaven to save us from dangers still more terrible than those she was afraid of  we were scarcely settled in the tree when we heard the tread of horses and in a little time could distinguish the voice of the tartar exultingly anticipating to his followers the pleasure he promised himself in the possession of my wife as he passed by our place of refuge  the appearance of the morning at length giving us hope that our danger was over we descended from the tree and having offered up our adorations to the rising sun were preparing to proceed in our journey when we perceived our enemy approaching toward us on his return  it is impossible to express the horrors with which this sight struck us my wife in the vain impulse of despair ran toward the wood whither the tartar pursued her while his companions seized me  her flight was soon stopped the ravisher overtook her and mad with desire attempted to gratify his brutal appetites upon the spot what were the sensations of my soul in that dreadful moment but heaven saw my distress and heard the cries of her innocence  section iii just as he had overpowered her resistance a lion rouzed by her shrieks issued from a brake near to which heaven had directed her flight and rushing upon the ruffian tore him piecemeal in an instant  soon as my wife found herself freed from his violence she started from the ground and ran with outstretched arms toward me for protection incapable of considering my inability to afford it nor even sensible of the means of her deliverance  but the power which had so signally saved her continued his care of us both the tartars who had seized me struck with so evident an interposition of heaven no sooner saw their leader slain than fearing a like fate for themselves as accomplices in his guilt they loosed their hold and springing upon their horses fled out of sight in a moment  these events had succeeded each other so rapidly that reason was unable to keep pace with them i stood stupefied with astonishment nor had power to advance to meet my wife till she fell motionless at my feet  this sight restored me to myself i raised her head and laying it in my bosom attempted to soothe her distress with words of comfort which i wanted little less myself  the generous lion in the mean time stood over the victim of his justice growling with savage delight and lashing his sides with his tail without advancing a single step toward us though so near him till satisfied with his triumph he returned slowly back to his den  it was a considerable time before i could bring my wife to her senses the conflict had been too violent for her tender frame her spirits and strength equally sunk under it sunk alas never to recover several times she opened her eyes and fixed them wildly on me then starting in the impression of her fright gave a feeble shriek and swooned away again  at length she became more composed but still she was unable to walk and every moment we delayed there increased my fears of the return of the tartars to revenge their leaders death  in this distress i happened to cast my eye upon the horse of the ravisher which his followers had in their affright left behind them tied to a tree and placing her with difficulty upon him walked by her side to encourage and support her till we arrived at the caravansera  this was the last effort of her strength the delicacy of her soul was wounded by the base attempt of violation and the affright had overshadowed her reason  for three days she pined in my bosom then drooping her head like a lily torn from the root expired without a struggle  my situation can be conceived only by a feeling heart o my zelis thou were the delight of my eyes the hope and comfort of my life she was the first fruits of my love by my own mother whom according to our holy laws i had wedded in my early youth on the immature death of my father  i would gladly have accompanied her to the mansions of the blessed but piety and my very love for her equally restrained me  reason had had time to resume her rule during the approaches of her death the laws of our religion forbid us to shed human blood even in selfdefence how then could i dare to stain my hands with my own beside who should perform the last rites to her dear remains and sprinkle her ashes on this altar who should perform the same pious office for me that i may be reunited to her and to the rest of our holy race  i was convinced of my duty and prepared to fulfill it i washed her pure body with my tears i wrapped it in precious spices which i received in exchange for the horse of the tartar from certain merchants in the caravansera and building a lofty pile of aromatic woods reduced it to ashes which i have this day spread upon yonder sacred ruins of our altar  this o courteous stranger is the sermon of my woes which you see will admit of no relief i now turn my face to our place of refuge in the mountains there to devote the residue of my unhappy days to the contemplation of that being by whose power and in whose presence only i can be restored to happiness  section iv though the heart of togrul sympathized with the unhappy sufferer there were some circumstances in his story which affected him in a very different manner  as his reason was convinced of the incomprehensible essence of the deity he considered every assimilation of him to objects of sense as the most impious absurdity and the very thought of paying to his creatures the adoration due only to himself struck him with sacred horror  nor were his moral sentiments less hurt by customs which he held to be contrary to the most inviolable laws of nature  well aware as he was of the inefficacy of argument in matters of religious prejudice he would have thought silence a crime on such an occasion as implying an assent which his soul disclaimed  as soon therefore as the persee had ended his melancholy narrative i condole with you for your loss said he o man of affliction but i dare not offer consolation before you have reconciled yourself to heaven by a renunciation of those errors should i not rather say crimes which have drawn its wrath upon your head  you blindly mistake the creature for the creator and rob him of that worship which is his sole and incommunicable right and your marriages break down the fences which nature has established to guard moral chastity forcing her back upon herself in connections against which she revolts with horror  heavy as this charge was the persee was not abashed fixing his eyes upon togrul with a modest firmness most unworthy of consolation should i certainly be he replied o severe judge if i were guilty of the crimes which you impute to me but i exult in the assurance that on a moments reflection you will yourself acquit me of them  if our marriages are contrary to nature how could mankind have been propagated from one stock and where did the sons of the first pair find wives if they wedded not their sisters the prejudice instilled against them in infancy by other nations from motives unnecessary to us whose virtue requires not such a guard to prevent the intercourse of consanguinity from being abused to gratify impure desire is mistaken for the voice of nature whom we force not back upon herself but free from restraints submitted to by man alone of all her various race  more groundless still is the accusation of our worshipping any other object than the deity himself the author and life of the universe and all it contains  we worship not his creatures we worship him in them we worship him in the sun as the most glorious of his works the fountain of that heat by which he animates all nature we worship him in fire as the substitute of the sun the vehicle in which heat is entrusted to our own management for the uses of life and we keep that fire always alive in testimony of our gratitude for his supporting our lives by it and as a memorial to him to continue that support  never has man fallen into so gross error as to direct his worship ultimately to the works of his own hands though the presumption of ignorance has often accused him of it  adieu o young man learn to judge less precipitately and may the deity whom all the world unites in adoring though under different symbols guide your steps in safety  it was some time before togrul recovered from the surprise with which this defense of the persee struck him he examined it with candid attention and though he was far from thinking it satisfactory it determined him never more to condemn any man for differing in opinion with him  section v the sensations of his heart as he approached bagdat are not to be described on his arrival he was met by an ambassador from the khaliff to enquire the cause of his coming in that hostile manner  though age together with the change of his name prevented togrul from being known he directly knew the ambassador to have been one of his most malignant enemies and could not avoid feeling some natural emotions of resentment but he suppressed them instantly having covenanted with his heart to keep the characters of selim and togrul perfectly distinct nor to show the least recollection of the former till he should have executed his present commission  he replied therefore that as hitherto no act of his had shown any intention of hostility so should his future conduct be directed by that of the khaliff to whom alone he would communicate the motive of his coming  this reply was by no means satisfactory to the ambassador he would fain have himself entered into treaty with togrul alleging that the khaliffs health was unequal to such an interview at present though were it even otherwise it would be inconsistent with the character of a sovereign to enter into the necessary altercations of business with a subject  but these evasions had no weight with togrul he answered peremptorily that his commission was to the khaliff himself in person to whom if he had not admission the next morning he should look upon the denial as a denunciation of war and take his measures accordingly without farther delay adding with a smile of contempt that attention to the interests of his people could never be beneath the character of a prince with whomsoever it might bring him into intercourse and that when the sovereign could be present the intervention of a servant was merely nugatory saying which he left the ambassador without waiting for a reply  though it was evident that a war with temugin must in the end prove fatal to the khaliff his vizier who after the departure of selim had wrested the whole power out of his hands leaving him only the empty name of sovereign resolved to bury himself under the ruins of his country rather than admit an interview the first consequence of which he was conscious would be his own deposal  for this purpose he formed the desperate resolution of making an assault upon the camp of togrul that very night flattering himself with hope of surprising him in the false security of peace to confirm which he sent another embassy to inform him that the khaliff would see him the next morning  but togrul was too well experienced in the art of war to relax his care for a moment on any appearances he answered the ambassadors that he should be ready to attend the khaliff at the time appointed and as soon as they were gone proceeded to station his guards and put his camp in a proper state of defense  when the shades of night had covered the earth togrul retired to his tent and falling upon his face poured out his soul in grateful praise and adoration to him who had protected him through the past day and implored a continuance of the same protection for that night  just as he had performed this sacred duty he was alarmed at a sudden noise when starting up he saw a strange man with a poniard in his hand fallen on the floor of his tent  such a sight required no explanation togrul instantly seized him before he could rise to execute his intent and wresting his poniard out of his hand demanded who he was and by what injury he had been provoked to attempt so nefarious a crime  the assassin in the natural impulse of selfpreservation lifting up his hands and eyes begged for mercy which he did not even expect offering to purchase his pardon by a discovery of the most immediate importance  togrul whose resentment never lasted longer than the cause bade the trembling wretch merit the mercy he implored by a candid confession of the motives to his guilt  these words giving him a ray of hope the assassin without hesitation owned that he had been prompted to assassinate him by promises of large reward made to him by the vizier and for that purpose had lingered behind the ambassadors in whose train he came till he found an opportunity of hiding himself in his tent where seeing him enter soon after and prostrate himself to pay his devotions he had stepped forth from the place where he was concealed and was advancing to perpetrate the deed when his foot entangling in the fringe of the carpet he fell at his length upon the floor and then as a farther plea for pardon discovered the visiers design of assaulting the camp that very night  this account was too strongly confirmed by the circumstances in which the relator stood to admit of doubt having offered a mental tribute of thanksgiving to heaven for so signal a preservation togrul called to his attendants and ordering them to guard the assassin prepared instantly to avail himself of the information he had received  for this purpose he summoned the several leaders of his troops and unfolding the discovery which had been made to him directed one of them to take a body of forces and marching silently out of the camp on the side farthest from the city to fetch a circuit so as to fall upon the enemy in the rear as soon as they should begin their attack upon the camp where he should be ready to give them a proper reception  the soldiers of temugin who were always accustomed to the strictest discipline obeyed his orders without noise or confusion and the camp continuing as silent as if buried in the profoundest sleep the enemy advanced to the attack with that security in which they had expected to have surprised him  the event was soon determined the assailants repulsed with vigor and themselves assailed at the same time gave up the unequal contest and endeavored to save themselves by a retreat into the city but in vain the greatest part of them was cut off and the victors entering with the few who escaped made themselves masters of the place without resistance  section vi the fears of the inhabitants in such a situation are not to be expressed they expected nothing less than to be given up to all the outrages of war but they were saved by the military skill as much as by the mercy of their conqueror who knowing their numbers would not drive them to despair having stopped the fury of his soldiers he possessed himself of the gates and all the places of strength in the city and placing guards to prevent any new attempts restored all things to a state of order and tranquillity  as soon as the morning sun arose togrul advanced with a body of his troops to the palace of the khaliff a recollection of former scenes swelled his heart for a moment but he soon shook off such softness calling for the commander of the guard he ordered him to go to the khaliff and demand an interview if he would avoid the consequences of an immediate assault  the grand vizier returned along with the officer and after attempting to palliate the treachery he had been guilty of the night before by laying the attack of the camp to the charge of the ungovernable populace desired that togrul would accompany him to the khaliff who he said expected him in the divan but togrul instead of making him any reply gave a signal to his guards who instantly seized him before he could attempt to escape  an act of such seeming violence naturally threw all the citizens into the greatest consternation but togrul soon eased them of their fears waving his hand to demand silence he declared aloud that none but the guilty should suffer nor even they before the fullest proof of their guilt and by the authority of their sovereign ordering the vizier to be strictly guarded till he could be brought before him  the tumult being thus appeased togrul sent once more to request the interview with the khaliff who immediately came to the gate of the palace to meet him  the first sight of his altered state affected togrul in so tender a manner that it required all his presence of mind to conceal it broken in spirit and stooping under infirmities he scarcely seemed the shadow of himself  as soon as he approached togrul advancing in a respectful manner informed him of the motive of his coming  the khaliff heard him with attention and as soon as he had ended thou speak of peace he answered but actest all the outrages of war have thou not taken our city by surprise while we depended on the faith of thy words and have thou not now seized our vizier who came to conduct thee to us according to thy desire wherefore should thou continue the illusion farther or why mention a choice of peace or war to one who is already thy prisoner and obliged to obey thy will  this pathetic expostulation opened to togrul the state of the khaliff whom he knew to be incapable of dissimulation he saw that he had been the slave of his vizier who gave the sanction of his sovereigns name to his own iniquities  instead therefore of retorting the charge of violated faith he informed the khaliff in terms of respect of the conduct of his vizier producing the assassin to prove his guilt and referring the judgment to him  the discovery struck all present with horror holy prophet exclaimed the khaliff raising his hands and eyes to heaven to what misfortunes is the monarch subject who sees not with his own eyes who trusts the reins of government out of his own hands for a moment  then turning to the vizier who stood trembling in the silence of selfconviction thy conqueror he continued has left thy fate to my disposal receive that which i doubt not but thou have often merited before for man sinks not to such consummate guilt at once  saying which he made a signal to his guards who instantly smote off the miscreants head  togrul in the natural impulse of resentment could not help feeling a momentary inclination to have made himself known to his enemy before his death but he instantly suppressed it blushing at a thought so unworthy of him  this sacrifice being offered to justice the khaliff addressing himself again to togrul i have thus perhaps for the last time he resumed performed the duty of a sovereign in punishing guilt it is now thine to dispose of me according to the commands of thy master i here resign my scepter into thine hands for him and submit to the will of heaven without repining  togrul received the scepter with an air of dignity suited to the character he represented and holding it in his hand for a few moments while the hearts of all present were bursting with suspense know o supreme of all the followers of mahomet he said that the justice of temugin is equal to his power he desires to conquer only for the benefit of mankind nor does he ever dethrone the sovereign whom he finds worthy to rule the errors which incurred his displeasure proceeded from him to whom thou had incautiously entrusted thy power and are atoned by his death receive therefore thy scepter again from his hands and hold it more steadily in thine own for the future thou art from this hour the friend of temugin  it is impossible to express the effect of this sublime moderation upon all who were present the name of temugin was borne to heaven in acclamations of gratitude and joy nor was that of his substitute forgotten  the feelings of the khaliff were too big for utterance he sunk under the weight of his own gratitude prostrating himself upon his face he adored the sovereign ruler of the universe for this instance of his divine favor and then arising paid to togrul the thanks due to that benevolent grace by which he had even endeared the generosity of his lord  the terms of their accord were soon adjusted temugin had required no advantages for himself togrul therefore only stipulated that all under the power of the khaliff should be suffered to enjoy unmolested the common rights of humanity that they should worship the deity in the manner seeming best to themselves and be safe from punishment and injury while they should be free from guilt and that the traveller and the stranger who sojourned in the land should meet equal justice and protection with the natives  section vii the treaty being ratified with the proper solemnities togrul held it not necessary to maintain longer a reserve which nature had the greatest difficulty to support  advancing to the khaliff and regarding him with a tender aspect can it be possible said he that any change of character should so soon have effaced from the mind of nasser the memory of his most faithful   holy prophet exclaimed the khaliff starting at the wellknown voice now uttered in its native sweetness whom do i hear  then fixing his eyes eagerly upon him it is he he continued rushing into his arms it is selim himself my longlamented faithful selim  all who heard not the words of the khaliff were struck with surprise at such a conduct but when the cause of it was explained when the citizens of bagdat heard that in their generous conqueror togrul they beheld their beloved vizier selim their gratitude and joy know no bounds they flocked around him in raptures impossible to be repressed blessing the happy day which had restored him once more to their sight  as soon as the first transports of their joy had subsided togrul departed for a few moments to lead his troops back to their camp whither the khaliff sent them all manner of accommodations in such plenty as made them entirely forget the fatigues of their march and mix with his subjects as one people  having settled every thing in proper order togrul returned to the khaliff who expected him with the most ardent impatience  the tenderness of their meeting now freed from the restraint of observation may be well conceived togrul gratified the curiosity of the khaliff by a recital of the incidents of his life since his departure from bagdat on his explaining the reason of his having entered into the service of aladdin the khaliff could not suppress his resentment holy prophet he exclaimed to what impositions are princes subject  from the day you left me never did a letter from you come to my sight never did i even hear that you were living till i was informed of your having quitted my service for that of aladdin from motives of personal disregard to me but the traitors shall meet their due reward the principal is already punished though for another crime but the rest shall have their deaths embittered by your triumph over them  o vicar of mahomet returned togrul let not loose your rage against those who are so far beneath it however base their intentions the event was directed by the hand of heaven had i not been driven from your service by that appearance of your disregard i could not have been the fortunate instrument of this days happiness let them no more have influence in your councils but let that and the consciousness of their guilt be their only punishment for this crime for me i never will triumph over a fallen foe  togrul devoted the remainder of that day to the reestablishment of the khaliffs government in such a manner as should promise a continuance of his present happiness he was delivered from the most severe of all tyrannies that of his own servants all who had abused his power were given up to justice and their wealth divided among those who had suffered under their iniquitous oppression  section viii the spirits of the khaliff being unequal to such longcontinued exertion togrul left him to his rest and was returning to his camp when he was surprised to find himself stopped by a faquir who falling at his feet embraced his knees in an agony of joy which deprived him of the power of utterance  but togrul was not long at a loss to account for his emotions at the first cast of his eye his heart acknowledged his faithful attendant achmet whose loss when he was seized in the camp of mohammed had given him so much grief  no change of condition can alter the sentiments of a generous heart togrul raising him from the ground and embracing him tenderly bade him dry his tears and come to his camp where all his troubles should find an end  lord of my souls attachment answered achmet my troubles ended when i heard your name but think not of me one much more worthy of your care requires your instant attendance a friend once justly dear to your heart lives but in hope of embracing you again to conclude in that happiness a life worn out in all the miseries of oppression if the name of obeidah still lives in your memory if he yet holds a place in your esteem o haste to calm the emotions with which his heart is bursting till he enfolds you in his arms  starting at the name and does he live my mostrespected bestloved friend and benefactor returned togrul i will go to him this instant nor should have waited to be called but that i thought his virtues had long since received their reward that he was numbered with the happy in the life which never ends lead me to his palace this instant  alas my lord replied achmet the palace of obeidah has long been exchanged for a prison you must summon all your fortitude to support the sight of his present fallen estate but let us hasten to him he numbers every moment of our delay by a pang of misery  it is impossible to express what togrul felt at this representation he bade achmet proceed and following him in silence mourned in his soul for the sufferings of his friend  apprehension which usually doubles every evil of life here fell short of the reality on entering the prison he started back in horror to see his friend and benefactor the good vizier who had first made him known to the khaliff lying on the bare floor loaded with chains  achmet had cautioned him not to make himself too suddenly known to obeidah for fear of the effects of surprise upon an heart already stretched to bursting but nature could not be restrained the moment he saw him he rushed forward and throwing himself on the floor beside him raised up his aged head and laying it in his bosom exclaimed o my friend o obeidah my friend my friend   obeidah did not require to be told by whose arms he was embraced o selim he replied o son of abudah though my eyes can no longer be blessed with thy sight my heart tells me it is my friend  achmet in the mean time summoned the keeper of the prison to take off obeidahs chains but the loyal old man would not permit him these chains said he were put on me in the name of nasser and by his orders only will i suffer them to be taken off never yet have i violated his authority nor will i begin now  togrul would not contradict a loyalty which he revered and whose observance could add but a few minutes to the sufferings of his friend he therefore instantly sent one of his attendants to the khaliff to acquaint him with all these circumstances and request his order for the discharge of obeidah  while they waited for the return of the messenger togrul could not forbear expressing his astonishment at the khaliffs treating his most faithful servant in so cruel a manner adding with a tone of severity that if he had known he was capable of such a gross abuse of his power he should not have been so hasty in reinstating him in it  the loyal heart of obeidah could not bear to hear his sovereign loaded with so injurious a charge take care o my son said he nor let thy tongue take liberty with the chosen of the lord though my sufferings were inflicted in his name they proceeded not from him too well i know that he suffered himself under the tyranny by which i was oppressed  on togruls expressing astonishment almost to doubt at what he heard obeidah informed him that immediately after his departure from bagdat to join the armies of aladdin his enemies presuming upon the easy temper of nasser who neglecting the cares of government had given himself up entirely to the cultivation of those amusements of an idle mind which the vanity of their professors have dignified with the pompous title of the finer arts had by insensible degrees wrested the royal power out of his hands and covered their own nefarious crimes under the sanction of his name in which they at length proceeded to such an height that on his own constantly opposing them in the divan and laboring to open the khaliffs eyes they threw him into this prison where without respect to his age his innocence or the exalted office which he had so long filled with honor they had detained him ever since loaded with chains in the manner he then was  before togrul had time to reply a noise at the door of the prison announced the arrival of the khaliff who running wildly up to the place where obeidah lay in the bosom of togrul holy prophet he exclaimed is it possible that such iniquity could be perpetrated by man o obeidah my faithful obeidah think not that thy sovereign ever knew of thy sufferings ever could make so ungrateful a return for the services of thy life but thy wrongs and mine are avenged our better angel our selim has set us both free and we will live together henceforward to bless his name  this condescension this goodness of his sovereign was too much for the full heart of obeidah to support he seized the hand of the khaliff and pressing it to his breast expired without a struggle in the excess of his honest joy  the scene was too moving for humanity to bear togrul raising the khaliff from the dead body upon which he had fallen led him to the door of the prison where they parted unable either to speak a word  section ix the agitation of togruls mind was too violent to admit of sleep having paid the pious tribute of a flood of tears to the memory of his friend he called for achmet and desired to be informed by what strange fortune he had been led to bagdat  the fortune of the poor replied achmet is seldom distinguished by any incidents worthy of recital my distress at your separating yourself from me in the camp of mohammed need not be described i sought you for several days with the most anxious diligence till i could no longer hope to find you there  it then occurred to me that yielding to the melancholy with which your soul was so heavily oppressed for the loss of your father you had taken this method of avoiding my too officious zeal of which you often complained and retired to give yourself up to the uninterrupted indulgence of your grief  but my attachment could not bear the thoughts of deserting you in such a situation i resolved to find you out if possible and save you from yourself from a despair unworthy of you where to seek you was the difficulty  at length i recollected the pleasure with which i had often heard you mention the friendship of obeidah and thought you might possibly have returned to him at least it was the only place where i could see any hope of succeeding in my search  i directly therefore left the camp and came to this city where on my enquiring for obeidah gracious heaven what was my astonishment my grief to find the good old man just sinking into his grave under all the miseries of imprisonment and want without even the allegation of a crime  on my mentioning your name he seemed to forget himself for a few moments to enquire after you rejoicing in your success and weeping for your misfortunes  my soul could not forsake virtue in such distress i devoted myself entirely to attending on one so dear to you since i could not have the happiness of finding yourself  assuming therefore this habit of a faquir i shared with him the sustenance which i daily received from the hand of charity and enabled him to struggle with his fate till he sunk under the happiness too suddenly accumulated upon him by your arrival  as soon as the first blush of morning had began to gild the firmament togrul returned to the khaliff and recommending to him once more to hold with steadiness the scepter which he had restored to his hand began his march to rejoin temugin covered with the unfading laurels of a victory which had made the vanquished happy  on his arrival at the camp he presented himself before the emperor and gave him an account of his success when instead of the approbation with the hope of which he had pleased himself temugin demanded sternly why he had given peace to the khaliff on such easy terms when he had had it in his power to have made him accede to whatever he thought proper  much as togrul was affected at so unexpected a reproof he was not absent from himself falling at the emperors feet i gave him a good peace he answered o sovereign of the world because i wished to have it long and faithfully preserved they who push their advantages to extremity deceive themselves a bad peace never lasts longer than the necessity which made it be accepted  temugin paused some moments without making any reply then softening his look and accent go said he and take order for the refreshment of your troops i will consider these matters at some other time  section x the conduct of togrul on this delicate occasion fixed him so firmly in the esteem and confidence of temugin that he admitted him into his most secret councils and delighted to do him honor  such favor was not beheld without envy but the humility with which he bore his greatness and the disinterested benevolence that ruled his conduct soon disarmed its rage and if it was not possible for the favorite of a prince to have a true friend he had the happiness at least of having no enemies  but this happiness soon palled upon him and he sickened in that sunshine for which all around him sighed if i must not hope to find my father would he often say to achmet in the overflowing of his heart must i desert my friends must i violate my faith to himilco who by this time expects my promised return must i leave his daughter a prey to the terrors which hourly anticipate the misery of that forlorn estate in which the death of her father must leave her  forbid it heaven but may he not be already dead may not she be this moment looking out with anxious impatience for my return and justly accusing me of the cruelest neglect i cannot bear the dreadful thought if it is not in my power to avoid being unhappy i will not aggravate my unhappiness by conscious baseness i will have the approbation of my own mind at least to support me  he would have thrown himself at the feet of temugin and besought his permission to depart but the circumstances of the time made the very thought a dishonor honor gelaleddin having collected all his force for one last struggle with his fate he resolved therefore to exert every effort in order to accelerate an event which alone delayed the accomplishment of his only hope  section xi while he was paying this painful tribute to honor he happened one day to fall in with a body of gelaleddins troops who were conducting that princes household to a place of safety farther from the seat of the war  flushed with continued victory and following a leader whom they loved his soldiers soon overcame a servile and disheartened band who unattached to the charge they were to guard thought only of securing their own safety by flight  as the wars of temugin were conducted on the principles of humanity and honor togrul gave orders immediately after the victory for sending back the wives of gelaleddin without his even seeing them when a rumor that that prince was concealed among them obliged him to deviate from his intended delicacy  the alarm of the women on his entering the tent in which they were may well be conceived but he soon pacified their fears by assurances of respect and safety and then informing them of the cause of his coming requested that they would submit to a search so indispensible by lifting up their veils  their compliance having shown that the rumor was without foundation togrul was about to withdraw when his eye was caught by a female slave whose surpassing beauty neither the meanness of her habit nor the grief with which she appeared to be overwhelmed beyond all the rest could hide he gazed at her for some minutes in rapturous astonishment till achmet perceiving his situation reminded him to retire which he did in such confusion that he forgot to give any orders for their departure  achmet beheld with joy the impression which the beauty of the slave had made upon togrul and resolved to heighten it by every means in his power he was truly attached to him but as his own soul was fired with the strongest ambition he considered his design of retiring to himilco as a weakness unworthy of him which this incident if rightly improved might happily enable him to prevent  as soon as togrul had disposed his men properly for the night he retired to his tent where he gave himself up to the contemplation of the beauteous slave  while he was thus indulging himself in a pleasure of the tendency of which he was not aware achmet entered and after some occasional discourse asked him slightly if he had observed a beautiful slave who attended upon the wives of gelaleddin  the question even from one with whom he lived in the most unreserved familiarity threw togrul into evident confusion he hesitated some moments before he could speak and then blushing though unconscious for what cause answered that it was impossible for any one who was not blind to have passed such beauty unobserved  the manner in which he said this confirming achmets conjecture he directly proceeded to feed the flame which he saw kindled in the breast of togrul with the warmest descriptions of her beauty and allusions to the pleasure which the possession of it must bestow  togrul for the first time listened to such conversation without dislike his virtue was forced to yield to an attack in which nature herself took so strong a part against it and he sunk insensibly into a soft intoxication which drowned all remembrance of himself and every purpose of his heart  when achmet had thus prepared him for his design he asked whether he had given orders for the departure of the wives of gelaleddin all the pleasing hopes with which togrul had been so fondly feeding his passion faded at these words he turned pale and fixing his eyes for some time upon the ground at length with an heavy sigh desired achmet to take upon him a care which he found himself unable to execute  achmet who knew that the success of his design depended on its being conducted with address resolved to seem rather to follow than lead him to the point he desired affecting therefore not to understand what he meant he asked with a look of anxiety if he had received any wound in the late battle to which he had neglected applying proper remedies  deeply as togrul was distressed he could scarcely forbear smiling at such a mistake no my friend he answered i have received no wound but that which the beauteous slave has inflicted on my heart to which i fear it never will be in my power to apply any remedy  and wherefore should you fear that replied achmet the wounds of love are of all others the most easy to be healed where the object is in our possession  but how is she in my possession returned togrul does she not belong to the household of gelaleddin and must i not restore her to him i dare not i cannot violate the orders of temugin orders founded on the most sacred principles of virtue and which my own soul holds in the highest honor  how industrious said achmet with a smile are we to torture to deceive ourselves the orders of temugin respect only the sacred property of the marriage bed slaves are by the universal laws of war the captors prize the reward of valor which temugin never meant to deprive him of dismiss the wives of gelaleddin with due respect and he will never think your detaining a slave an invasion of his right  though a proposal so favorable to his wishes readily satisfied the scruples of togrul he had a respect to the appearance of virtue a modesty in his nature which would not permit him to carry it openly into execution  but achmet was not at a loss to surmount this difficulty he counseled togrul to send away the women directly with every mark of honor under the conduct of a person in whom he could confide and said he would himself follow at the first dawn of the morning as if he was going on some secret occasion of the war and bring the fair slave without any alarm or its being even known for whom to a neighboring fortress where togrul might meet her in the evening and indulge himself in her company for some days as if he was only attending to the motions of the enemy a purpose for which it was a proper place  had not togrul been blinded by his passion he would have rejected with disdain a proposal founded on a neglect of his duty though but for a moment but such was his infatuation that he equally forgot what he owed to his own honor and to the confidence of temugin  section xii the conflict in his mind when achmet departed is not to be described though his passion had silenced the voice of reason it had another antagonist to struggle with which was not so easily to be subdued in spite of all his efforts to elude it the remembrance of himilco and his daughter would ever and anon force itself upon him and damp his highest ardours every moment produced a new resolution which the next overturned leaving him in the same fluctuation  attachments of mere desire lose their force when the object is no longer present every time he thought of the daughter of himilco his passion for the fair slave grew weaker till in the end it entirely subsided leaving no more trace behind than ruffles the bosom of a stream into which some fragment of the rock has newly fallen from the impending cliff  he awoke as from a troubled dream and wondering at his own weakness resolved to wipe off the stain of it by sending back the fair slave the moment he should arrive at the place where he had appointed to meet achmet nor would he even have gone thither had he not thought that countermanding without any visible reason the orders he had so lately given to his troops would betray an unsteadiness that must lower him in their eyes  exulting in this victory he arrived at the fortress where he no sooner saw achmet than he commanded him to send back the slave that very night declaring that he would not even see her  achmet who read in his looks the struggle in his heart was more surprised than discouraged at this change of his resolution which he did not doubt but the sight of the fair slave would soon alter could he prevail upon him to see her  without seeming therefore to hesitate at paying obedience to his orders he asked him with a discontented look what reason he should give her for such a disappointment of those hopes with which he had taken so much pains to inspire her  togrul whose conquest over his passion was far from being so complete as he thought could not forbear enquiring gerly what hopes he meant to which achmet answered in a tone of indifference the hopes of his love which he had so confidently assured her of that he was utterly ashamed to inform her of a change in his sentiments as unaccountable as it was sudden  incapable of artifice himself togrul suspected none in achmet he told him with a sigh the reason of his sending her back acknowledging at the same time the pain which that resolution had cost him  achmet who wanted not virtue though his sense of it was neither so extensive nor so sublime as that of togrul looked upon this as no more than a false refinement to which it was his duty to open the eyes of his friend  but as he was sensible that it would be in vain to attempt reasoning on such a subject he affected to approve the resolution togrul had taken and only desired that he would himself acquaint the fair slave with the motive of it a mark of attention which he said would change her resentment into respect of his constancy the virtue dearest to the sex adding when togrul seemed to hesitate that surely he could not doubt his own resolution so far as to apprehend danger from so short an interview or aggravate the pain of her disappointment by such an ungenerous instance of contempt as to send her away without condescending even to see her  this was an attack which togrul could not resist his heart harbored not a sentiment that was not truly generous nor would he admit the appearance of a weakness of which he was not conscious he consented therefore to see her as soon as he should have taken order for the disposal of his troops directing achmet to prepare in the mean time for her departure  section xiii every step as he approached her tent increased the emotions which the thought of this interview raised in his breast he entered trembling and irresolute where he found her sitting on the ground dissolved in tears and wailing herself in sobs of woe  the power of beauty when aided by compassion is irresistible he stopped short and gazing at her for some moments turned to achmet to learn the cause of her tears  achmet who saw that the success of his design depended on the improvement of the present moment and scrupled not any means to accomplish an end which he thought just breathed a soft whisper in his ear that all her grief arose from his having informed her of togruls late resolution to send her back and therefore advised him not to mention any thing of it till she should be a little more composed  togruls resolution which had begun to waver the minute he saw her was totally overturned by these words every motive of honor and virtue which had so lately swayed him now gave place to his passion he rushed forward and throwing himself at her feet attempted to sooth her grief with professions of love and vows of constancy  but what was his disappointment to find that instead of appeasing this only increased her distress he paused for some minutes utterly at a loss what to conclude then fixing his eyes passionately upon her conjured her in the tenderest terms to declare the cause of her affliction and depend upon every relief in his power to procure  moved by the manner in which he spoke she raised her head and looking earnestly at him asked how he who had so lately torn her away from an husband whom she dearly loved could affect to be a stranger to the cause of her affliction  equally shocked and surprised at what she said togrul enquired hastily who was her husband and upon her answering gelaleddin demanded again how she came then to be clad in the habit of a slave whereupon she informed him that the wives of that prince not expecting such generous treatment as they had experienced she his most beloved had assumed that disguise in order to save the honor of his name at least should any violence be offered to her  togrul stood aghast he saw the precipice over the verge of which he hung he saw also the only way of escaping it was painful but it was indispensible  the occasion called forth all his virtue he hesitated not a moment but explaining the error into which he had been led by her own precaution removed all her apprehensions and dried her tears by assuring her that she should be directly sent back to her husband safe and unsolicited farther by an unhappy passion which was not now more disagreeable to her than disapproved by himself and giving in her presence the necessary orders to achmet who terrified at the danger into which his too sanguine zeal had unwillingly betrayed his friend prepared to carry them into instant execution hurried away from a scene more distressful than he could support  not that his distress was lighter when he retired to his tent and reflected on his late conduct he looked back with horror to the manifold ruin which he had so narrowly escaped nor did remorse make the prospect before him much less painful  though error might seem to extenuate the crime of his attempt upon the wife of gelaleddin his intended infidelity to the daughter of himilco his intended neglect of duty to temugin admitted of no extenuation he judged himself with severity but he sunk not under that judgment  superior to that weakness which instead of nobly endeavoring to repair a fault gives itself up to fruitless wailing and selfreproach he resolved to retrieve the day he had lost to temugin by some eminent service and then to expiate his crime against the daughter of himilco by a sacrifice of every other hope to his love  section xiv this resolution restored to his mind that virtuous serenity which had been so dangerously interrupted by his late passion if the remembrance of which would sometimes return its only effect was to stimulate his efforts to make atonement for it  nor were these efforts unsuccessful among the chieftains of temugin famed as they justly were in war togrul soon distinguished himself by abilities which proved him to be the proper antagonist of gelaleddin equals in activity and enterprise they exhausted against each other every resource of the military art while experience viewed their emulation with wonder and delight  but the superior power of temugin at length decided a contest which virtue would have supported and gelaleddin found himself pent in between armies which it was in vain for him to attempt resisting and the mighty river of indus  he instantly saw all the severity of his fate that nothing remained for him but to yield himself captive or die in the defense of his liberty the choice with him admitted not a moments pause animating his faithful followers by his example he bravely continued the fight marking every step of his retreat with the dead bodies of his boldest foes till he was forced to the very brink of the river where looking round him for a moment and seeing almost all his people slain he formed the noble resolution of attempting to save himself for an happier day when heaven might be more propitious to him and instantly plunged into the river which rolled in such a torrent that the greatness of the danger prevented his being pursued  while he was gloriously struggling thus with fate togrul whose efforts had principally driven him to this extremity was rushing forward to plunge in after him when he was stopped by temugin who honored such virtue even in a foe remember said he the day in which you escaped from the rovers in the deserts of africa and imitate that generosity which you have yourself experienced leave this gallant prince to his fortune this is a son worthy of his father happy is he who has such children  togrul was affected in the strongest manner by these words though in the headlong fury of the battle he would have pursued gelaleddin to have defeated so noble an effort for the preservation of his liberty when he could resist no longer would have stung his generous heart with incurable remorse the very thought overwhelmed him with shame as his being so happily prevented filled him with joy  the total defeat of gelaleddin having put an end to the war togrul thought himself now at liberty to fulfill his resolution by retiring to himilco in the desert  for this purpose he threw himself at the feet of temugin the next morning and pouring out the gratitude of his heart for all the favors he had received from him humbly besought his permission to depart and accomplish the fate ordained for him by heaven  temugin to whom the virtues of togrul had endeared him no less than his valor heard with concern a request with which his regard would not permit him to comply though he thought the subject of too tender a nature for him to interfere with directly he was not at a loss to discover his motive for desiring to depart nor whither he intended to bend his way as he remembered the love which he had expressed for the daughter of himilco and his promise that he would return to her a promise which he meant not obliging him to violate but only to defer its performance to a fitter season  expostulating with him therefore in terms of esteem on his want of attachment which alone he alleged could prompt him to seek elsewhere a fortune that in his service prevented his pursuit he told him that he could not consent to his departure till he should have accomplished certain matters which he had in contemplation after which if he persisted in his present purpose he would not only give him his consent but also the assistance necessary for executing it with happy effect  this promise by which togrul saw that the emperor was no stranger to his intention overpaid the delay on which it was founded by hopes he had never ventured to indulge before he embraced the knees of his generous benefactor in a transport of grateful joy which the fullness of his heart left him not the power of uttering  end of the third book the history of arsaces prince of betlis book the fourth section i temugin having thus completed the conquest of khouaresm issued a mandate to all the princes who governed the several kingdoms of his boundless empire to meet him with all their households in the plains of karakathai where he intended to relax from the fatigues of war and devote one whole year to the pleasures of the chase while he married his sons and regulated the various forms of government in his dominions before he proceeded to farther conquests which he had in contemplation  the preparations which he ordered to be made for this solemnity at which the greater part of human kind were to assist were suited to the magnificence of his spirit and the greatness of his power nothing which nature could supply or art devise was wanting to make the entertainment equal to the occasion  the morning before temugin proposed repairing to the plains of karakathai he sent for togrul into his tent and regarding him with a look of favor togrul said he i am now going to give you a mark of my confidence which will put your abilities to the strictest proof  there is a country in the mountains of curdistan called betlis the people of which boast of having repelled all attempts made to subdue them and do at this day live in defiance of every foreign power it is necessary to my honor to put an end to this boast while i march toward karakathai take you the troops under your command reduce this people to obedience and bring their king to receive his fate from my word no sovereign shall rule but by my permission  i know your valor but that though the first is not the only virtue required in the leader of an army activity vigilance and circumspection will be no less necessary to you on this occasion  astyages who reigns in betlis is an experienced warrior and his people are an hardy race who strangers to the wants of luxury as having no commerce with other nations are satisfied with the scanty subsistence which their labor extorts from a sterile soil and will fight with advantage in a country full of fastnesses known only to themselves  though togrul was far from approving the motive of this war his heart was not insensible to the glory which it opened him an opportunity of acquiring bowing himself therefore in grateful assent he proceeded directly to execute a charge which did him so much honor  as soon as he drew near to the country which he was sent to conquer he called together the several leaders of his troops and laid them under the strictest injunctions to restrain the soldiers from every act of rapine cruelty and oppression which in the nature of their duty could possibly be avoided though they are our enemies he said let us not forget that they are men as well as we let us spare the country which is to belong to our sovereign  this restraint at the same time that it saved the country from devastation saved also the forces under his command from all those dangers which await an army broken loose from discipline and scattered over an enemys country in search of plunder  he penetrated into the heart of the land without meeting any misfortune though the king watched his steps with a powerful army ready to take any opportunity of attacking him to advantage as he was unwilling to risque the fate of his country on a battle upon equal terms  finding however all his schemes defeated by the vigilance and circumspection of togrul and apprehensive that his own soldiers might be dispirited at seeing him so cautious astyages at length resolved to trust all to the valor of his people and the justice of his cause and drawing all his forces together waited for the enemy in a place which defended the approach to his capital  this was directly the point to which togrul had all along wished to lead him he instantly disposed his troops in order of battle and led them to the charge in person  the conflict was such as might be expected from men animated by the strongest motives the soldiers of temugin were so accustomed to conquer that they looked upon themselves as invincible while the men of betlis who knew that they fought for the dearest blessings of life exerted themselves every one as if the event depended upon his single arm  section ii while the battle raged thus with equal fury the adverse leaders who flew from place to place to enforce the execution of their orders by their own example chanced to meet  knowing each other by the number of their attendants and animated by an equal passion for glory they advanced as by consent to decide the contest making a signal to their men to draw back who readily obeyed willing to commit the fortune of the day to their respective valor  nor was their confidence deceived on this important occasion every effort which art and courage could suggest to strength was exerted so equally by each combatant that it was impossible to form any judgment of the event  while every heart panted thus in anxious expectation and suspense the king of betlis provoked at a resistance which he had never met before smote togrul such a blow as cleft his helmet in twain which falling to the ground left his head unarmed at the same time that his own sword unequal to the force broke short in his hand  togrul recovering from the stroke which had stunned him for a moment was preparing to return it on his defenseless enemy when his ear was struck by the voice of a man who throwing himself between the combatants exclaimed hold o selim nor stain thy soul with the blood of thy father  starting at the wellknown voice togrul dropped his sword which hung over the head of his adversary and looking eagerly at the person who spoke instantly knew the face of abudah who by this time had thrown off his helmet and fallen on his knees before him  the piety of togrul could not bear such a sight he ran and raising him from the ground threw himself at his feet and embraced his knees in transports of pious joy  tenderly as the heart of abudah felt this endearment the time was too important for him to indulge it turning hastily from togrul there pay thy duty said he pointing to the king who stood lost in wonder at what he saw that o selim is thy father  o king of betlis behold thy son  the king no sooner heard these words than yielding to the impulse of nature he rushed forward and throwing himself upon the neck of togrul bedewed his bosom with tears sobbing o my son have i at length found thee o arsaces my son my son  though togrul felt the tenderness of this embrace he was unable to return it with equal warmth he knew no father but abudah at the same time he knew that abudah was incapable of asserting any thing but truth he was utterly at a loss  in the mean while the chieftains of both armies struck with astonishment gathered promiscuously around them to learn the cause of this affecting scene  abudah saw the importance of the moment o soldiers of temugin said he mounting upon a rock which happened to be near and spreading abroad his arms and you men of betlis behold and revere the mysterious ways of that power which rules the world the leader of the armies of temugin is son to the king of betlis heaven which permitted them to prove their valor in your sight this day has discovered them to each other in time to prevent the crime of parricide and put an end to this groundless war let us not therefore presume to oppose its sacred will  the manner in which he uttered these words ensured their effect his eyes his voice his gestures seemed to speak immediate inspiration all heard him with reverential awe and waited but the word of their leaders to pay obedience to what they thought a divine command  the king and togrul had by this time recovered themselves sufficiently to attend to their situation advancing therefore to their respective armies they unfolded this extraordinary event and declared their intentions of obeying the will of heaven so plainly signified and extending to their people that peace which nature had established between themselves  nor was this difficult to be effected the manner in which the war had been conducted had prevented any personal animosity by preventing private injuries it had rather been a contest for glory than a war  section iii as soon as they had drawn off their forces and taken proper care to prevent any accidental disagreement between them they repaired to a tent which abudah had caused to be pitched in the midst between the two armies equally anxious to concert such measures for confirming the peace thus happily commenced as should meet the approbation of temugin without derogating from the honor of astyages or injuring the interests of his people  as such an interview must necessarily open all the tenderness of nature it was ordered that no person should be present beside abudah who waited to receive togrul and before the arrival of his father relieve his heart from the suspense with which it must be tortured by an event equally interesting and strange  as soon as togrul entered the tent he ran to abudah and clasping him in his arms o father of my heart said he unfold the mystery of my fate nor keep me longer in a suspense which my soul is unable to support who am i  how can i be other than thy son  and yet i blush to own that my heart feels a divided love a respect which it never felt before  son of my soul answered abudah as he kissed away the tear which rolled down the cheek of togrul restrain thine impatience to a more proper moment thou owe thy being to astyages he is thy father how the precious charge of thine education came to be entrusted to me must be reserved to an hour of more leisure as well as a recital of the occurrences through which heaven has led thee to this happy period at present other matters demand our attention  astyages entering as he spoke these words togrul yielding to the impulse of nature ran to him and crying o my father my father threw himself at his feet and embraced his knees unable to say more while astyages wept upon his head in ecstasy too big for utterance  when they had indulged nature thus for a few blissful minutes abudah who was more present to himself though his feelings were scarcely less lively reminded them of the more immediate cause of their meeting  when togrul had repeated the charge given to him by temugin astyages mused for some moments then with a look serenely resolute my son said he i trace the hand of heaven in all these events and will not presume to set myself in opposition to it  the emperor has commanded thee to reduce this country to obedience and bring me to receive my fate from his word his command shall be fulfilled you shall appoint abudah to govern our country in his name while i will go with you to him and trust my fate to heaven  i had flattered myself with the hope of expelling the invaders of my country by force or dying honorably in its defense but these hopes are now changed  as such a proposal could admit of no difficulty peace was directly announced to both armies who embraced it with equal pleasure having made too strong a proof of each others valor to desire a continuance of the war  when togrul had adjusted every thing for beginning his march the next morning to karakathai where he was to join temugin he returned to the tent where he found his father expecting him in company with abudah  after some time given up to mutual endearments i will leave you for a few moments my son said astyages while i go to make some preparations for my journey the father of so large a family has many things to settle before he can leave it abudah will in the mean time inform you of matters which you must naturally be desirous to know  section iv the anxiety evident in the looks of togrul made it not necessary for him to claim the performance of this promise  o son of my affection thou beloved of my soul said abudah as soon as astyages withdrew i am now to resign an honor of which i am unworthy and exchange the name of father for that of friend a secret my having concealed which from you so long has cost my heart many a painful hour  you must remember my having often told you that the birth of a son deprived me of a wife whom i had wedded in a foreign land that you were that son it was natural for you to suppose from the care which i bestowed upon your education but alas i lost both wife and son together  the reason why i never informed you in what country i had met with this misfortune was my fear of your conceiving a desire to see it before the time appointed by your father should be fulfilled  my wife was the sister of astyages whose friendship prompted him to bestow her upon me as it afterward did upon her death to entrust me with the precious charge of you his only son then an infant  how various are the griefs he said to me once when he came to console me in the days of my affliction which prey upon the wretched heart of man thou mournest the death of a son while my anxiety for the fate of one who is yet alive makes me equally unhappy  hitherto has this people defended their liberty against the ravagers of the earth and while i live i trust that heaven will enable me to preserve the inestimable blessing to them but i tremble to look forward the very peace which we now enjoy which i have earned by so many difficulties and dangers alarms my fears  trained in the school of adversity i am prepared to struggle with it whenever i may be assailed but will my son have the same ability without having the same opportunity of acquiring it will not ease and idleness debilitate his body will not flattery corrupt his mind  i strove to remove his fears by urging that it was in his own power to obviate those evils by taking care that his son received a proper education  it is not possible he replied for me to attend to that care the cares of sovereignty are a sufficient weight without the addition of another scarcely less weighty though even if i could devote myself to his education i cannot hope for the success you mention he would be told that he was born to reign and that would defeat all my endeavors  in a word there is but one way to remove my fears and that depends upon you i will not injure your friendship by a parade of asking that which i know you will perform you must take my son with you to your native country and educate him there as if he were your own thus will he become worthy to wear the crown of his ancestors and be able to fulfill my hopes of defending the liberties of his people  when you shall think him qualified to share the weight of a crown with me bring him home till then let him remain with you and even unto death should he not prove worthy of me i will supply you with wealth sufficient to make provision for his support  how i executed this important charge you want not to be told to conceal your lineage more effectually i even changed your own illustrious name of arsaces for that which had been borne by my father happy thrice happy am i to restore it to you now to restore to your father a son worthy of him worthy of the sacred race of cyrus from whom you derive your descent a race who through all the wars which have shaken the earth from the day whereon ascander overturned the throne of darius have to this hour preserved their royalty undiminished in these mountains whither arsinoe sister to that illfated monarch fled with her infant son hystaspes whose virtues humanized the fierce inhabitants and influenced them to choose him for their king  section v i upbraid you not with a desertion to which i plainly see you were directed by heaven as soon as i awoke that morning my heart misgave me when you answered not to my call i arose to seek you but in vain the disappearance of your horse and your sword too well convinced me that you were gone beyond my reach  i must not attempt to describe to you what i felt at that thought though hopeless of your return i waited for one miserable moon if possibly your mind might change and a sense of filial duty and affection lead you back to me  at the expiration of that time i put my sandals on my feet girt my loins and with my staff in my hand set out to bring the melancholy tidings to your father i would have attempted to seek for you but you had turned the secresy which i had so often inculcated to you against myself you had never dropped a syllable which could direct my search  your father felt the loss as a man but supported it with the fortitude worthy of him he even condescended to offer me consolation and acquitted me of all blame by referring your conduct to the guidance of heaven  this awoke an hope of that happiness which your return has thus fulfilled all my cares all my griefs are now over paid and i am ready to die contented whenever the angel of death shall call upon me  but o my son through what surprising scenes must heaven have led your steps my heart pants  and behold your father comes bursting with equal impatience to hear the interesting tale  astyages entering as he spoke these words i restore to thee o king continued abudah leading arsaces to him thy son no longer togrul nor selim but arsaces a genuine scyon of the sacred stock of cyrus o arsaces behold a father worthy of thee  o my son my father they exclaimed with one voice as they ran into each others arms while abudah unable to speak gave vent to his joy in a flood of tears  when they had paid this tender tribute to nature astyages hinted to his son a desire to hear the incidents of his life since his departure from abudah arsaces instantly obeyed and placing himself between them related in brief the wondrous tale  as soon as he had concluded could a particular instance be wanting in proof of that which all the works of nature prove said abudah thy life o arsaces affords the strongest conviction that the ways of heaven are always conducted with wisdom goodness and justice however inscrutable to the feeble powers of human reason let us therefore adore that being who orders every thing for the best nor perplex ourselves with doubts which only involve us in deeper darkness  section vi arsaces began his march the next morning accompanied by his father on his arrival at the camp of temugin he hasted to his presence that he might himself deliver the first tidings of these wonderful events  prostrating himself before his throne may the king of men said he live for ever thy commands have been executed in their fullest extent the country of betlis pays obedience to temugin and its king is come to receive his fate from thy word but in the king of betlis o behold the father of togrul the father of him who in thy service has unknowingly lifted his sword against the author of his life  temugin who thought the enterprise upon which he had sent togrul too difficult to have been accomplished in so short a space was utterly at a loss to conceive the meaning of what he heard he demanded therefore an explanation of circumstances which appeared so extraordinary to him  as soon as arsaces had recited the whole the emperor pausing a few moments as lost in thought i adore the ways of heaven said he and war not with its will king of betlis he continued on what terms art thou willing to receive the restitution of thy crown this day from my hands  conqueror of the world answered astyages it ill befitteth me to make terms with him into whose power i have willingly surrendered myself if thou will permit me to study the happiness of my people and preserve them in the enjoyment of those laws which their fathers have handed down to them we will render thee with fidelity all the services which can be expected from men who are free if thou requirest more my promise shall not deceive thee  for know o temugin that though i have the power to commit my own liberty to thy disposal i have none over that of the meanest subject whom i lately governed every one of whom while he pays obedience to the laws is safe under their protection and would with readiness sacrifice his life in their defense  we will put their virtue to the trial replied temugin my will shall be circumscribed by no laws in the mean time return thou in safety to their assistance i scorn to take advantage of thy confidence  o sovereign of the world exclaimed arsaces throwing himself again at the feet of temugin and embracing his knees what is to be the fate of the captive of thy power the slave of thy goodness can i fight against the author of my being can i fight against him whose beneficence has made that being a blessing to me o divide not duties which heaven has united nor set my soul at war against itself my father will teach his people to pay you the highest subjection which man can pay to man without derogating from the dignity of their common nature  o my father submit yourself to the power of him who rules the world he will not deprive your subjects of liberty who gave it to your son  the agony in which arsaces spoke these words affected all who were present the generous heart of temugin melted in compassion arise said he o son worthy of thy father and be happy and thou o astyages return to thy kingdom in peace and rule thy people according to the rectitude of thine heart happy art thou in being worthy to have such a son  every one was filled with joy by these words even envy and ambition forgot themselves for some moments and joined in the general acclamations which raised the name of temugin to heaven  astyages who had hitherto supported his royal character could not resist the tender impulse of his gratitude thou have conquered o temugin said he thou have conquered my soul  he would have thrown himself at the feet of the emperor but he was prevented temugin caught him in his arms and embracing him warmly i receive thee as my friend he said and in no other light will i admit thee to offer thyself to me happy is the sovereign who has such a friend  astyages would have departed the next morning but temugin insisted on his remaining some time during which he took delight to do him honor above all his princely guests  the magnificence of such a scene never equalled upon earth dazzled not the eyes of astyages nor could the offer of temugin to make him sovereign over many nations shake his steady virtue  think it not ingratitude he answered o first of human kind in virtue as in power that i decline favors your holding me worthy of which covers me with the highest honor my soul feels the warmest sense of your generous confidence and friendship but its ambition never soared so high i am content with the contracted sphere in which heaven has placed me and find the government of one small kingdom sufficient for my abilities rather would i reign in the hearts of a single village made happy by my care than rule over discontented millions with a rod of iron it not being the extent but the good government of a kingdom which in my humble sense constitutes the happiness and glory of a sovereign  temugin was struck with sentiments the justice of which his soul acknowledged though they had never occurred to him before he paused for some minutes then clasping astyages to his breast we must fulfill the destiny appointed for us said he were i not temugin it should be my wish to be astyages  after some days spent in the closest intercourse of mutual esteem astyages departed for his own country accompanied by his son who offered to remain but temugin waved such a sacrifice of every tender feeling after so long a separation said he your souls must require some time to seal the connection of nature by acquaintance when i want your service i will call for it till then be happy in each other  section vii the return of astyages restored to his people the only happiness which they had to wish for under him they enjoyed every blessing of life and the virtues of his son gave them an assured presage of its continuance  astyages in the overflowing of paternal affection would have shared his throne with his son but he declined it let it be my honor let it be my happiness he said to be the foremost of thy subjects in humble obedience as in love let me learn to reign in the execution of thy commands  but in the midst of all this general joy astyages observed that a sigh would sometimes steal unawares from his son that an absence of mind in spite of all his care to conceal it showed he cherished some secret grief alarmed at this discovery he communicated it to abudah and desired him to try to explore the cause  abudah in all his intercourse with arsaces had ever endeavored to sink the authority of a father in the intimacy of a friend an intimacy which now knew no bounds as the former character which notwithstanding all his endeavors had kept arsaces at a respectful distance was at an end  he found him walking pensive and alone by the side of a rivulet which ran through the gardens of astyages whence comes it o my son said he that you separate yourself thus from society what means that smothered sigh which this instant has escaped you has arsaces any grief which he is afraid to communicate to abudah has he a thought which he would hide from his friend  arsaces was abashed at being so surprised at meriting this tender rebuke he blushed and hung down his head for a few moments unable to make any answer  recovering himself at length o guide of my youth he replied the heart of arsaces harbors not a thought which he is afraid to entrust to you the state in which i left the virtuous himilco  my father may possibly disapprove   and the daughter of himilco interrupted abudah clasping him in his arms blush not my son to be insensible to love argues a defect in nature an incapacity for its most exquisite happiness nor need you fear your fathers disapprobation he will assist you to obtain your wishes the choice of reason cannot be unworthy of thee  this discovery gave the greatest joy to astyages who wished not for any thing so ardently as to see the virtues of his son continued in his offspring it was agreed that arsaces and abudah should set out directly for the habitation of himilco attended by a train sufficient to protect them on the way  the journey was long but nothing is too much for love they performed it without meeting any misfortune  the surprise of himilco on seeing such a numerous company approach his habitation may be well conceived but that surprise was soon turned to joy when he heard the wellknown voice of arsaces who advanced before the rest he descended instantly and falling upon his neck bedewed it with tears of joy  when they had recovered from the softness of this scene arsaces presenting abudah to himilco receive into thy friendship said he that abudah whose virtues thou have so often admired embrace o abudah the beneficent reliever of my distress  congenial virtues attract each other himilco and abudah embraced with the esteem of long acquaintance  arsaces having given order for the encampment of his train ascended with abudah into the habitation of himilco where he was soon blessed with the sight of arpasia who joyfully obeyed the first call of her father to receive him  after mutual congratulations on the happiness of their meeting arsaces gratified the anxiety of his hosts with a recital of the events of his life since he had departed from them the vicissitudes of which frequently drew the sympathetic tear from the gentle arpasia though delicacy prevented his disclosing the circumstance most interesting to her  but abudah was not under the same restraint arpasia withdrawing as soon as arsaces had concluded his narrative abudah made a signal to him to follow her and acquainted himilco with astyagess approbation of his sons passion  himilco who was superior to the affectation of making a difficulty of that which gave him pleasure acknowledged that his daughter returned the love of arsaces and consented to end his days with them in betlis  i acknowledge and adore said he the hand of heaven which has evidently led me through such wondrous ways to this happiness which i will not ungratefully embitter by repining that i was not thought worthy to effect the happiness of my country also i resign myself humbly to its will which is always right  nor did arpasia receive the declaration of arsacess love with less candor she referred him to her father for an answer saying with a blush in which modesty added new graces to beauty that her inclination would find no difficulty in accompanying her obedience to his commands  himilco could not leave the asylum of his distress without feeling the most tender emotions but the recollection of past misfortunes only brightened the happy prospect before him he paid the tribute of some pious tears to the dear memory of those whose remains he left behind him and then departed with a grateful heart  they arrived in safety at the court of astyages whose happiness was completed in theirs and in the assurance which their virtues continued in a numerous offspring gave him of the happiness of his people and arsaces acknowledged that true wisdom consists in humble obedience to the will of heaven without arrogantly presuming to scan its ways
