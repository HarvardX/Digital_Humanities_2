the waterman or the first of august a ballad opera in two as as it is performed at the theater royal haymarket  london printed for t becket the corner of the adelphi in the strand      price one shilling  dramatis personae men tug mr bannister bundle mr wilson robin mr weston women mrs bundle mrs thompson wilelmina mrs jewel to the public finding among the different pieces i have composed for ranelagh and the theater a number of ballads which i took great pains with and which have been but little heard i thought i could not better employ my leisure time than in furnishing upon some familiar plan the dialogue necessary to work up these materials into a ballad farce a species of entertainment which has always been well received and which as it has lain dormant for some time i thought would have so far the charms of novelty to recommend it  i had heard of a piece of this sort which has the characters of a waterman and a gardener in it and the scene of which is laid at battersea this i enquired after but was informed it was out of print i nevertheless liked the idea of those two characters so well that i determined to pursue the hint as for as it was necessary for my purpose i dare say it must be evident to every one that i have done no more i never read the piece in question nor do i for a certainty at this moment know the title of it  i mention this circumstance because i am resolved to acknowledge at all times from whence i collect any matter for the trifles i may have an opportunity of presenting to the public i must be an egregious egotist indeed and little entitled to the indulgence they have hitherto favored me with if i could be so unconscious of my own inability as to suppose i ever can present them with any thing worthy their notice without assistance of this sort beside in this i am serving myself for i must be well convinced the most effectual way to secure their indulgence is to deal as honestly by them as they deal generously by every man in my situation  with regard to the performers if i mentioned the merit of any one in particular i should do injustice to the rest i shall therefore say in general that their assiduity has been unwearied upon this as well as upon every other similar occasion  the piece is indeed incomparably performed and it is very apparent that the greatest part of its success is owing to this circumstance  the waterman or the first of august act i scene i a gardeners garden where several gardeners are at work some digging etc others together with several women tying up bundles of asparagus bundle and tug seated under a tree at breakfast upon cold roast beef a tankard of beer upon the table chorus labor lads ever youth be gone for see apace the day steels on labor is the poor mans wealth labor it is that gives him health labor makes us while we sing happier than the greatest king then labor lads ever youth be gone for see apace the day steals on  bun this now is my delight to sit at breakfast while the men work come honest tom let us make an end of our tankard before my wife gets up her raking so in london where between you and i she stays a devilish deal longer than while she sells the sparrowgrass keeps her abed woundy late of a morning   tug why master bundle i have oftentimes thought to myself that it was a wondersome kind of thing how it came to pass that you two agree so badly when out of all the four and twenty hours you are hardly ever above two of them together   bun ah thomas thomas it is very hard that a man like me cannot be allowed to get drunk once a day without being called to an account for it but between you and i she is the arrantest    mrs bun within what are you all about there where is your lazy idle master   bun you hear she has begun to ring her usual peal this is the way the moment she is up   tug and i believe she seldom leaves off till she goes to bed does she master bundle   bun no nor then neither every thing must be her way or there is no getting any peace as soon as the marketings over in town away she and her favorite robin trudge to the twoshilling gallery of one of the play houses where they have picked up such a pack of damned nonsense about sentiments and stuff that i am not only obliged to put up with her scolding me all the time i do see her but i am scolded in a language i dont understand   tug why i should like that best now for then you know one has no right to take it for scolding at all   bun oh when once she raises her voice you never can take it for any thing else   tug why then mayhap it is all concerning this same playhouse business that she is so stout against me and does all she can to serve master robin with miss wilhelminy   bun ay there was another of her freaks she was then as fond of romances as she is now of plays and though my father who was as plain a man as myself swore he would not leave us a farthing if we did not call the girl margery nothing would satisfy her forsooth but we must give her the name of wilelmina  it is such a damned confounded hard name that i was a matter of three years before i could pronounce it right   tug well stand to your oars for here she comes   scene ii mrs bun is it not a most mavelous thing mr bundle that i must be such an eternal slave to my family in this here manner while you and your cologuing companions are besotting and squandering away your time with your guzzling and every thing goes to rack and manger i that am such a quiet wellbred easy tame creature that never scolds nor riots nor dins your faults in your ears but am always as gentle and as patient as a lamb   bun you are a very good wife to be sure my dear only a little inclined to talking if you now had no tongue or i had no ears we should be the happiest couple in the world   mrs bun what a provocating creature  tongue but this comes of marrying such a scum of a fellow one that you may throw away all the tenderness in the world for before it makes any oppression upon him  but it serves me right for it is very well known what great offers i refused upon your account   bun i dont know how it should be otherwise than wellknown my love for i generally hear of it about six times a day but my dear dont you think it will be necessary to give orders about loading the cart against you go to london   mrs bun sir i shall not go to london tonight at all robin miss wilelmina and i are invited to go with a party to see the rowing match this afternoon and afterward there is to be a hop at mr wicks the tallowchandlers where i intend to settle the purliminaries about my daughters wedding and i desire you to take care that the pines are not all gone before next week for i intend to invite the whole party to a hop here   tug but madam bundle bent you some how or other afraid that what with one thing and what with another you will hop all the money out of your husbands pocket   mrs bun i dont direct my discourse to you sir but it is my husband that encourages you to behave in such a brutish and outrageous manner he has promised you i know that you shall have my daughter but i will make him know who is at home  i will  i will assure you indeed  such a fellow as you  a nasty idling scurvy rapscallion that leads a filthy drunken lazy life sotting in one alehouse and sotting in another and shall such a low brute dare to expire to the honor of marrying miss wilelmina bundle   tug i will tell you what maam bundle i should not care much for marrying your daughter if she was not of a little better temper than yourself   mrs bun oh the villain  why you vile wicked    bun my dear how can you put yourself in such a passion you you know who are such a tame creature  one that never scolds or riots    mrs bun i will riot you all to some tune i will  therefore mr bundle unless you would have me sue for a separate maintenance  mind what i say  next time i go to london i shall take robin with me to doctors commons and nothing but your consent to his marrying your daughter shall ever make me look upon you again  air my counsel take or else i will make the house too hot to hold you be ruled i pray i would something say did i ever rout or scold you but spite to wreak on one so meek who never raves or flies out on me who am like any lamb oh i could tear your eyes out  scene iii bundle and tug tug well and what do you say to all this   bun why i will tell you what honest thomas for me to contradict her would be much the same thing as for you to row against wind and tide   tug why then that would be bad enough master bundle   bun but i will try what i can do with my daughter for you and all i can say to put you in heart is that if i find her as headstrong and as perverse as her mother i shall advise you to have nothing to do with her and so save you from hanging yourself in a month   tug but master bundle if i marries miss i expect to be a little happier than you are   bun ah tom tom the wisest of us may be deceived  air i i just as eagerly as thee thought when i got a wife my joy of course so great would be it needs must last for life when she agreed to tie the knot i thought of nothing else then all was glee twixt her and me nor did i grudge the king his lot when dingdong went the bells ii but ah our joys were fleeting soon words that did sweetly fall ever we had passed the honeymoon to wormwood turned and gall whatever of furies they invent broke out of flaming cells you now may see in her and me we fight and scold and both repent that dingdong went the bells  scene iv tug i dont know but you are in the right of it a waterman would be a confounded fool that would put up a sail with the wind and tide both in his teeth  but here comes miss wilhelminy  if she marries me i will see if i cannot get her to change her name   scene v air miss wilelmina i two youths for my love are contending in vain for do all they can their sufferings i rally and laugh at their pain which which is the man that deserves me the most let me ask of my heart is it robin who smirks and who dresses so smart or tom honest tom who makes plainness his plan which which is the man ii indeed to be prudent and do what i ought i do what i can yet surely papa and mama are in fault to a different man they each have advised me to yield up my heart mama praises robin who dresses so smart papa honest tom who makes plainness his plan which which is the man iii be kind then my heart and but point out the youth i will do what i can his love to return and return it with truth which which is the man be kind to my wishes and point out my heart is it robin who smirks and who dresses so smart or tom honest tom who makes plainness his plan which which is the man  tug take my advice miss and let it be honest tom   will oh you brute did you hear me   tug why miss suppose if i did you ant afraid of speaking your mind be ye   will my mind why you have not the assurance to pretend that i said any thing in favor of you   tug why no i cannot say directly that you said as how you would have me but i am sure you cannot help saying yourself that it sounded a little that way   will and do you imagine then i could perfer you to robin sweet robin as the song says that is all over a nosegay and the very pink of good breeding   tug for my part i makes no comparisments as a body may say but i would be sorry miss if there was not others as agreeable and well behaved as he however   will what yourself i suppose  do you know you odious creature that he can spout romeo by heart and that he is for ever talking similies to me   tug i know he is for ever talking nonsense to you   will oh hold your filthy tongue did you but hear him compare my cheeks to carnations my hands to lilies my beautiful blue veins to violets my lips to cherries my teeth to snowdrops and my eyes to the sparkling dew that hangs upon the rose trees in the morning  what would you say then   tug ah but you know miss that is all in his way   will then he writes verses oh dear me the author of the opera book in the parlour window is a fool to him for writing oh he is a very ovids metamorphose   tug why for the matter of that miss there are other folks that can write as well as he what would you say now if i had wrote something about and concerning my falling in love with you   will i should then begin to have some hopes of you   tug should you  why then i have   will oh dear let us see it   tug it is a song miss i will sing it to you if you please  air i and did you not hear of a jolly young waterman who at blackfriars bridge used for to ply and he feathered his oars with such skill and dexterity winning each heart and delighting each eye he looked so neat and rowed so steadily the maidens all flocked in his boat so readily and he eyed the young rogues with so charming an air that this waterman never was in want of a fare ii what sights of fine folks he often rowed in his wherry twas cleaned out so nice and so painted with all he was always first oars when the fine city ladies in a party to ranelagh went or vauxhall and oftentimes would they be giggling and leering but twas all one to tom their gibing and jeering for loving or liking he little did care for this waterman never was in want of a fare iii and yet but to see how strangely things happen as he rowed along thinking of nothing at all he was plied by a damsel so lovely and charming that she smiled and so straitway in love he did fall and would this young damsel but banish his sorrow he would wed her tonight before tomorrow and how should this waterman ever know care when he is married and never in want of a fare well miss how do you like it   will like it why it is the very moral of yourself  if you had not passed half your time between wapping and the tower stairs you could never have wrote such a song   tug didnt i tell you as how it was the thing  well now i hope you will consent   will consent to what   tug why to marry me to be certain you will not find me like your mr robin an inconsiderative puppy that will say more in half an hour than he will stand to in half a year i am a little too much of an englishman i thank you miss for that my heart lies in the right place and as we say it is not always the best looking boat that goes the safest   will and so mr thomas you really think by all this fine talking to make me dying for love of you   tug why miss for the matter of that i dont see why i should not   will well then i will tell you what if you ever expect to have any thing to say to me you must kneel at my feet kiss my hand swear that i am an angel that the very sun moon and stars are not half so bright as my eyes that i am cupid venus and the three graces put together   tug why to be sure all this may be very fine but why should i talk to you in a lingo i dont understand   will this as my dear robin says is the only language of true lovers and if you dont understand it already you will learn it for my sake   tug i will tell you what miss if you dont marry me till i make such a fool of myself it is my mind you will never marry me at all i love you to be sartain there is nobody can say to the contrary of that but you will never catch me at your cupids and wenisses i am plain and downright i would do all that in my power lay to make you happy if you would have me and if you will not i have nothing to do but to cast away care and go on board a man of war for i could never bear to stay here if you was married to another   will what then you would leave england and all for the love of me   tug that is what i would miss   will well that would be charming oh how i should dote upon it if i was to hear them cry through batterseastreets the unfortunate sailors lamentation for the loss of his mistress   tug i will stick to my word i assure you if you will not have me i will go on board a man of war  air i then farewell my trimbuilt wherry oars and coat and badge farewell never more at chelsea ferry shall your thomas take a spell ii but to hope and peace a stranger in the battles heat i go where exposed to every danger some friendly ball shall may me low iii then mayhap when homeward steering with the news my messmates come even you the story hearing with a sigh may cry  poor tom  scene iii wilelmina and robin will well it is a most charming thing to plague these creatures  die for me  if i had not given myself some airs to him he never could have thought of such a thing but that is the way if one does not use them like dogs there is no getting any thing civil from them  but here comes robin i must plague him in another way   rob miss wilelmina may i have the unspeakable happiness to tell you how much words fall short of the great honor you would prefer upon me if you would grant me the request of favoring me with your hand this evening at the hop   will why mr robin what particular inclination can you have to dance with me   rob what inclination miss ask the plants why they love a shower ask the sunflower why it loves the sun ask the snowdrop why it is white ask the violet why it is blue ask the trees why they blossom the cabages why they grow it is all because they cannot help it no more can i help my love for you   will lord mr robin how gallant you are   rob oh my wilelmina thou art straiter than the straitest tree sweeter than the sweetest flower thy hand is as white as a lilly thy breath is sweet as honeysuckles and when you speak grace is in all your steps heaven in your eye in every gesture  oh dear   will lord mr robin you have said that so often    rob well you never heard me say this in your life  now mind my heart is for all the world just like a hotbed where the seed of affection sown by your matchless charms and warmed by that sun your eyes became a beautiful flower which is just now full blown and all i desires miss is that you will condescend to gather it and stick in your bosom   will and what pretensions have you to think i shall ever consent to such a thing   rob pretensions miss because my love is boundless as the sea and my heart is as full of cupids arrows as a sweet briar is full of thorns   will but i am afraid if i was foolish enough to believe you you would soon forget me   rob forget you miss it is impossible sooner shall asparagus forget to grow seed forget to rise leaves to fall sooner shall trees grow with their roots in the air and their branches buried in the earth than i forget my wilelmina   will well i do declare there is no resisting you   rob resisting me miss no i dont know how you should my heart is stocked with love as a flower garden is stocked with flowers the cupids that have fled from your eyes and taken shelter there are as much out of number as the leaves on a tree or the colors in a bed of tulips you are to me what the summer is to the garden and if you dont revive me with the sunshine of your favor i shall be overrun with the weeds of disappointment and choked up with the brambles of despair   will that would be a pity indeed   rob so twould indeed miss   will do you really love me then   rob love you  air i bid the blossoms never be blighted birds by scarecrows never be frighted from the firm earth the oak remove teach the jessamine how to blow teach the holyoak to grow trees bear cherries hedges berries but prithee teach not me to love ii grass shall grow than cedars higher pinks shall bloom upon the briar lilies be as black as jet roses smell no longer sweet melons ripen without heat plumbs and cherries taste like berries when wilelmina i forget  scene iv bundle and wilelmina will oh papa are you there   bun hush hush speak softly you have not seen your mother have you   will no   bun because i wanted to talk with you wilelmina my dear   will what upon the old subject i suppose   bun yes but i would not have her hear us   will oh she is safe enough scolding the men in the garden   bun oh that will take her some time well have you seen thomas   will yes i have seen him and a most deplorable figure he cuts i believe by this time he has entered himself on board a man of war that so as the history book says he may put an end to his existence and my cruelty together   bun why did he say he would   will dont i tell you i was cruel to him and how could he do any less   bun why the girls distracted but this comes of gadding about with your mother if you had listened to my advice i would no more have suffered you to put on such ridiculous conceited airs  why you and your mother are the laughing stock of the whole place i never pop my head into the black raven to get my pennyworth in a morning but all the folks are full of it   will why papa we are only a little genteeler than the rest of the people of battersea that is all   bun genteeler do you call it genteel then to take a pleasure in being pointed at but i will not bear it therefore hear what i have to say or    will why do you tell me of all this why dont you speak to my mama it is no wonder she does what she pleases with me when you know you dont dare to contradict her yourself   bun not dare to contradict her   will no papa you know she will have her own way and since she has desired me to have robin what can i do but be dutiful   bun what then you owe no duty to me i suppose   will indeed i do and if i could see that you owed a little to yourself i would oblige you willingly   bun but as it is you will not marry thomas   will i cannot indeed   bun and for no other reason but because your mama insists upon your marrying robin   will no other   bun very well i will settle the matter she shall do as i please and if she was to come across me now    scene v bundle wilelmina and mrs bundle mrs bun what then mr bundle   bun my dear   mrs bun what could have conduced you to raise your voice to such a pitch i hope you had not the assurance to be tampering and plotting and undermining my daughters infections and above all i hope you was not hatching up any vile scheme to impose my authority   will poor papa how he looks   bun why my dear i did intend to say something to you on that subject but as my tongue does not go quite so fast as a watermill i am afraid it would be but to little purpose   mrs bun scurvy creature   will if you dont speak papa i shall be obliged to marry robin   bun i cannot help it   will it is all your own fault now dont blame me  i must marry robin you have perfectly given me your consent   bun so thou could but unmarry me i would consent to your marrying whoever you pleased   mrs bun well my dear what has he been saying to you nothing i hope to discourage you in your infections to robin   will indeed he has and i cannot think of being undutiful   mrs bun undutiful indeed i say undutiful  which will reflect most upon you do you think to obey a mean poor spirited drone of a father who has nothing but low mechanical ideras or a mother who is acquainted with shakespeare goes to all the sentimental comedies can play at cards dance kittelions and allemands and knows every particle of purliteness and highbreeding   will very true maam but then mr thomas is such a sweet young man   mrs bun he   will so goodnatured   mrs bun the vandil   will so honest   mrs bun low creature   will such an immensity of love   mrs bun the hottentot i will tell you what wilelmina your father has put all this into your head i will go and give it to him heartily while my bloods up for daring to be beforehand with me and then i have but one word to say to you either comply and marry robin or else i will disinherit you from any share in the blood of my family the grograms and you may creep through life with the dirty pitiful mean paltry low illbred notions which you have gathered from his family the bundles  air wilelmina you see i am quite cool obey me it is all for your good or may i be counted a fool if i own you for my flesh and blood prefer such a lout miss for shame to robin so spruce and so trim but your father it is that is to blame and so i shall even talk him  scene vi wilelmina well in all i have read i never met with a girl of more spirit than myself  for i make two lovers and a father and mother as miserable as i can desire and yet am i to blame are not they the authors of all this bustle themselves if i oblige one i disoblige the other i shall therefore set all other considerations aside and consult only my own heart  air i too yielding a carriage has often before marriage to ruin and misery pointed the way youre shunned if complying but your lover once flying how eager he will follow and beg you to stay ii a coquette never proclaim me ye maids then nor blame me if i wish to be happy whenever i am a wife each lovers denial was only a trial which is he that is most likely to love me for life  the end of the first act act ii scene i bundle mrs bundle afterward wllelmina bundle what shall i do with this perverse girl i have but poor comfort for my friend thomas  however all things considered i dont know whether i should not have done him a more unfriendly office by marrying him than by keeping him single for my own part was i to choose whether i would keep my wife or have the plague on my conscience i should run the risque of the last but mercy on us here she comes  it is a strange thing that i never mention the word plague but she is at my elbow   mrs bun mr bundle  i shall be very cool sir   bun i hope so my dear   mrs bun what the devil is the reason that you have been making all this here piece of work   bun my dear   mrs bun i say sir how comes it to pass that in spite of all my conjunctions to the contrary you will behave so monstrously shameful as to oblige me to put myself in these here passions   bun why my dear are you ever in a passion   mrs bun dont provoke me  you think i suppose because you have got your daughter on your side to carry all before you but mr bundle though you have been coaxing and wheedling her to marry that low dirty  i will not bemean myself by repeating his filthy name though i say she has been undutiful and wicked enough to suffer such a low unpolite clown as you to persuade her to marry a fellow as vulgar and as mean as yourself yet if i have any authority you shall no more carry it off in the manner you think    bun my dear    mrs bun i will not hear a word   bun have a moments patience now and i will convince you   mrs bun i will not have patience nor i will not be convinced it is a shame and a scandalous thing and whoever tells me to be patient or wants to convince me it shall be the worse for them   bun go on my dear   mrs bun oh how i am used i could hang myself for vexation crying   bun my dear if you had about half as much reason as you have passion how very easily could all these matters be settled for you are wrong from the beginning to the end in this affair in the first place i dont think it would be very undutiful in a girl to do what her father desires her was it as you say in the next i desired her to give her consent to marry thomas it is true but she refused me   mrs bun why this is worse than the other  first use me ill and then result me  for the girl told me with her own mouth that she promised you to marry thomas   bun and she told me with her own mouth she had promised you to marry robin   mrs bun what am i to think of this   bun even what you please my dear you know i never dictate to you   mrs bun here she comes herself we shall know the truth of all this come here child speak ingenuosly now did not you tell me that you would not marry robin   will i did maam   mrs bun there mr bundle  and pray what reason did you give me for it   will because papa had persuaded me to marry thomas   mrs bun and have you the confidence to look me in the face after all this   bun pray hear me one word   mrs bun i will not hear a syllable   bun nay let me speak in my turn wilelmina come hear child speak ingenuously did not you tell me you would not marry thomas   will i did sir   bun there mrs bundle  and pray what reason did you give me for it   will because my mama had persuaded me to marry robin   bun and have you the confidence to look me in the face after this   mrs bun why you little dirty trollop have you been making a jest of us both   bun indeed my dear there is something    will hear me my dear papa and mama when first you proposed robin to me and you thomas i determined to have neither till one or the other had given me some proof beside telling me so that he would make me a faithful and affectionate husband the first that does shall have me and though i would not wish to have either of you think me undutiful on that alone shall depend my giving my consent to be a wife  air i in vain dear friends each art you try to neither lovers suit inclined on outward charms i will never rely but prize the graces of the mind the empty coxcomb whom you chose just like the flower of a day shook by each wind that folly blows seems born to flutter and decay ii your choice an honest aspect wears to give him pain i often have grieved but it proceeded from my fears than me much wiser are deceived i thank you both then for your love wait for my choice a little while and he who most shall worthy prove my hand i will offer with a smile  scene ii bundle mrs bundle bun well my dear what do you say to all this   mrs bun say why that i am perfectly in a quandary the confidence of the baggage goes beyond all  one would think she had never been edicated by me   bun oh i am afraid it is her having been edicated by you as you call it that has taught it her   mrs bun what do you stand muttering there about it is you she may thank for all these mean notions if she would but suffer me to teach her a little the bonetone she would despise the idera of consulting her heart about marrying such low mechanical stuff has been out of fashion a long time since among people that know how to bemean themselves   bun well but i suppose you intend to let her do what she pleases   mrs bun no sir do you think i am so tame as to be ruled by my daughter i believe you can witness for me that i seldom let any body rule but myself   bun you never let any body rule but yourself my dear and really you do it so well it is a pity to hinder you   mrs bun none of your sneers sir  but i see into the bottom of all this it is a scheme between you and your daughter to make a fool of me but i will after her and cure her of her ridiculous notions of love and a pack of stuff and she shall marry the man i have chose for her or  in short i have determined what to do and let me hear you or her say a single word against it if you dare  air how can she thus low minded be a girl of her merit what is become of her spirit would the baggage take pattern by me she would value the pleasure of no man but hold up her head and in all that she said claim the privilege due to a woman our wils ought to be without measure and the best thing that you male creatures can do is to buckle to our will and pleasure  scene iii bundle tug tug master bundle how fares it i wanted to speak to you but i never likes to interrupt people when they are in agreeable company   bun what you saw my wife with me she is the most agreeable company it must be confessed   tug why she did not seem to be cantancaras with you now   bun no her anger was levelled at her daughter but it is all the same i feel the good effects of it let her be cantancaras as you call it with who she will   tug but master bundle how comes it to pass that she should be angry with miss wilelmina she has not refused to marry robin has she   bun but she has though and refused to marry you too   tug ay ay why i never heard she had any other sweetheart   bun i dont know what the girl has got in her head not i  a parcel of absurd suff she has a mind to make fools of us all i believe but there was something well enough too in what she said if she is sincere but the lord help those that trusts too much to them say i   tug why what does she say   bun why that she does not know which she shall have yet but that she will marry the first that does any thing to deserve her   tug does she  why then it is my opinion she will marry me   bun why so   tug i know why well enough but could not a body speak to her now   bun i am going in and i will send her to you but i would not have you depend too much on her   tug i will run the risque master bundle   bun only see the difference between us you are all agog to get married and i would give the world to be rid of my shackles   tug why i believe if a man was to take up the trade of unmarrying folks he would get more money by it than you and i do by ours   bun more money  air i did but the law appoint us one tired couples to release again what shoals of all degrees would run to break their matrimonial chain the widow old herself and gold who to the healthy spendthrift gave and the rich churl who took a girl poor wretch with one foot in the grave ii prudes who at men would never look yet slily tasted hymens joy and wild coquets who husbands took when they could get no other toy millions would try the knot to untye toward the goal of liberty lord what a throng would crowd along and in the midst my wife and me  scene iv tug and wilelmina tug yes but i hope i shall not have such a crank and humoursome piece of stuff to deal with as you have i dont know not i but for my share i cannot see why married people may not be happy as well as others it is my mind miss here is trying which is the most loving of us two and if so i would not give my little robin threepence for his chance for i know as well as can be that he has no more notion of making a woman happy than nothing at all  but here she comes   will hey day why i thought you was gone on board a man of war before now   tug why no miss i ent yet gone i am in hopes there will be no occasion if there should i am always one of my word   will oh you unkind creature to disappoint me so i was in hopes by this time to have received a long letter from you upbraiding me with my cruelty and telling me that you were gone abroad with a broken heart at being disappointed of me   tug why miss as to breaking my heart to be sure i should go wellnigh to do that if i could not persuade you to have me but i have been thinking that it would be better to try if i cannot stay at home and do something to obtain your consent for to be sure the pleasure of having you is not what every body deserves   will oh till i hear you have been venturing your life for me i shall never relent   tug well now miss i for my part think you will   will indeed you have a great deal of confidence to think any such thing   tug i hope you will not be angry if i do my best to make you    will and what do you call doing your best   tug why it is not my way to brag and so i will not say any thing about it now but i have a favor to beg of you if you please   wiu what is it pray   tug why you know that the young watermen are to row for the coat and badge this afternoon and so i have made bold to bespeak a room at the swan for you and your friends to go and see the sight   will that is very gallant indeed mr thomas but you talk of trying to deserve me why did not you make one among the watermen and so win the coat and badge yourself   tug well never you mind any thing about that will you accept of my proffer of the room   will why i think i will   tug and do you think now if ever i was to do any thing with an intent to please you that you could bring yourself to look upon me with kindness   will why i dont know but i might   tug why then i assure you if ever you should be agreeable to marry me you should be as happy as ever love and an honest heart can make you  air i indeed miss such sweethearts as i am i fancy you will meet with but few to love you more true i defy them i always am thinking of you there ere maidenswould have me in plenty nell cicely priscilla and sue but instead of all these were there twenty i never should think but of you ii false hearts all your money may squander and only have pleasure in view never from you a moment i will wander unless to get money for you the tide when it is ebbing or flowing is not to the moon half so true nor my oars to their time when i am rowing as my heart my fond heart is to you  scene v wilelmina robin will there is great honesty about this poor fellow  here comes the other i see i must choose soon or there will be no peace for me so mr robin what news have you   rob news my angel news that will make your heart dance with joy and clear away the clouds and mists that hang on thy beautiful face just for all the world as the sun clears away the showers in the month of april   will indeed i should be glad to hear it   rob you cannot think how you will be overjoyed   will shall i why dont you tell it me then   rob well then miss i will keep you no longer in suspense your mother is determined that we shall be married tomorrow morning   will what whether i will or no   rob whether you will or no how can you help it dont i love you better than the ivy loves oak better than cucumbers love heat or birds love cherries i love you better    will hold hold mr robin it is necessary in this case i should love you a little   rob and dont you  hear this you blooming jonquils and lose your sweetness turn white you roses and you lilies red each flower lose its fragrance and it is hue and nature change for wilelminas false   will indeed mr robin you have such winning ways that pretty speech has half persuaded me to consent   rob has it   will it has upon my word   rob jonquils smell sweet again roses and lilies keep again your color and every flower look brighter than before for wilelminas true   will how dearly you do love me mr robin   rob why miss the passion which is planted in my heart has taken root as like as can be to a great elm which there is no grubbing up but it spreads farther and farther and you cannot for the life of you destroy it till you saw down the trunk and all   will that is as much as to say that you will love me as long as you live   rob the very thing  lord how sensible you are miss   will really mr robin you are so gay and agreeable    rob ent i miss so every body says  only think then how you will be envied  well then i will step to your mama and tell her what has past and then i shall have nothing to do but to go to town tomorrow for the ring and license  air i cherries and plumbs are never found but on the plumb and cherry tree parsnips are long turnips are round so wilelminas made for me ii the scythe to mow the grass is made shreds to keep close the straggling tree the knife to prune to dig the spade so wilelminas made for me  scene vi wilelmina robin mrs bundle mrs bun well robin have you reformed her what i ordered you  what i suppose you have been a fool now  there never was such a timersome fellow in the world  i tell you what wilelmina if i find you have been imposing upon this poor bashful creature you will put me in a passion and you know when i am once in a passion i am not easily pacified   will let me understand you maam   mrs bun why i sent this blockhead to let you know that i am disolved to see you married tomorrow morning and i know you have been giving yourself some confounded airs or other and so he has been afraid to tell you   will i wonder maam you should be uneasy on that account  he told me and in very plain terms   mrs bun well and i hope you had not the conference to say any thing against it   will so far from it maam i now plainly see the great absurdity of attempting to oppose your will   mrs bun and have you consented to have him then   rob she has maam   mrs bun then thou art my child again  mr wicks family will be in raptures at this run robin and tell them we shall call at their house in our way to the rowing match   will and will you forgive my former disobedience maam   mrs bun oh it was all your father my dear but i will now take the pains to instruct you how to behave yourself   will i am obliged to you maam but i dont think i shall ever be so accomplished as you   mrs bun why i dont think you will ever get my genteel air but as for other matters they are easily understood   will are they mama   mrs bun i will tell you  air to be modish genteel and the true thing my dear in short to be monstrous wellbred you must ogle and simper and giggle and leer and talk the first nonsense that comes in your head in grave fusty oldfashioned times ere ease and deportment went hence to be bold was the vilest of crimes and deceit was an heinous offense but the fashions are now of another guess kind our modes are by no means the same for blessed with good eyes we pretend to be blind and with strength to run miles appear lame  scene vii wilelmina indeed mama i beg your pardon but i shall not receive any instruction from you  let me see  i have promised her to marry her favorite robin to heighten the plot a little more i will even go and promise my papa to marry favorite thomas and then for the swan where i think there will be a tolerable confusion what a bustle this same love makes among us we all seem to be afraid of it and yet all wish to possess it  air i girls during courtship should at least no lover trust but doubt him but when they have sworn before the priest then find no fault about him ii who venture all upon a stake undone if they miscarry the risks they run from each mistake behooves them to be wary  scene the last a room at the swan mrs bundle robin and company afterward wilelmina and afterward tug and bundle mrs bun my dear mr wick as to that gentilitys every thing  i hates to see a parcel of trumpery that knows nothing of life do robin step and see after wilelmina  what can be become of the girl   rob she is here maam   mrs bun come my dear you will lose the sight they tells me that the rowers have set out from the old swan some time   will they are very near surely for see what a number of boats are come in sight   mrs bun oh i can see them very plain how many is there   will one two three four i think i can count five   mrs bun that smart young man will certainly win it how clean and neat he looks   will here he comes his boat perfectly flies   mrs bun oh he will win it   will he has won it already madam he is past the stairs   rob see he jumps on shore   will and see he is coming this way  surely it is not    bun coming on here is your thomas for you he is coming  i told you he would be the first that would do any thing to deserve you  here he is   will and was it you that won the coat and badge   tug twas indeed miss   will and what made you   air tug i rowed for the prize to receive from those eyes a kind look from those lips a sweet smile but lest i should lose and you for that fault your poor tom should refuse my heart it went pitapat all the while when we came to the pull how i handled my skull twoud have done your heart good to have seen us there was never a boats length between us but the swan once in view my boat how it flew and verily blieve twas all thinking of you  will thus then i reward you   rob what is all this   tug why all this is that i am a happy fellow and you are knocked out of your chance   will is not he a sweet fellow maam how ne and clean he looks   mrs bun wilelmina dont put me in passion   will i have no intention maam to do any such thing   mrs bun why you impudent slut have not you deceived me deposed upon me promised me to marry this young man  and now    will indeed maam you must excuse me but in so serious a matter i thought it of much more consequence to consider myself than you besides i was so situated that i must have disobliged either you or my papa for whenever i gave you a promise i gave one to him and had your choice appeared to me the most likely to make me happy i should not have hesitated a moment in refusing his   rob my hopes are all blighted then i find   mrs bun i said all along that this was a contrived thing between you but mr bundle you shall smart for it   bun my dear you know i am a man of an easy temper and few words but i am pretty firm in keeping a resolution i have suffered you to expose me at home pretty well but if you are resolved to carry your folly to such a height as to expose me abroad i am resolved it shall not be for nothing therefore either promise before this company to bid adieu to scolding for the future or before this company i will do what you threatned me this morning  be separated from you   mrs bun why i am thunderstruck   bun i expected little less but am resolved depend upon it however to let you see that you are very welcome to be mistress of your own house manage your concerns as you like do what you please so you let me be quiet in short do nothing to give me uneasiness and i make an agreement from this moment for you to govern while i smoke   will dear mama it is impossible for any thing to be fairer   bun come come she must have a little time to think of it but she will agree to the terms i am sure of it and now let us think of nothing but pleasure and as this is the happiest day i ev saw in my life i say let us make it the merriest   air tug never let your heart my girl sink down that i am true believe me or next time that i row to town may wind and tide deceive me by this here breeze my heart at ease now dances at high water my labors over i have gained the shore and free from fear am landed here with my dear gardeners daughter mrs bundle i see my dear it is all in vain since this you think expedient if of the past you will not complain henceforth i will prove obedient folks used to cry a tartar i had proved and you had caught her but now shall raise each voice in praise through all her life of the gardeners wife as well as of his daughter bundle my child you have fairly won my heart you took no counsel from us but prizing love and scorning art preferred your honest thomas twas wisely done shake hands my son loves lesson you have taught her and now my dear be but sincere i do not fear therell never appear so good a wife and daughter wilelmina and now good friends pray take my part i kept them to their tether for i had sworn my hand and heart should always go together from fops and beaux a maiden chose an honest heart that sought her see her appear on trial here this very right if she was right applaud the gardeners daughter  finis
