unnatural pleasure in ridiculing the sacred mysteries and despising the pure doctrines of our holy religion you have accounted it an honor to be devoted to officiate in divine services and consecrated

reflects a darker shade on all the glories earth can boast of than the serious consideration of their transitory nature how do their richest beauties fade as the colors of a rainbow and vanish like the gaudy images of a deluding vision the sweetest pleasures which charm mankind that warble so agreeably on the senses and surprizingly captivate the imagination glide away in a moment and are often succeeded by the most melancholy sentiments such an easy transition is there from the mirth of a festival to the gloom of a funeral that we cannot but admire the wisdom of those ancients who mingled the emblems of mortality with the brightest and gayest scenes of nature and thought the glowing crimson of a rose and the virgin whiteness of the lilly less ornamental to their gardens than the awful monuments and venerable urns of their departed ancestors all conditions of life are open to the strokes of fortune whose violent and unrelenting storms will rend alike the hermitage the cottage and the palace though the greater part of mankind delight in mirth and flee from sorrow as from the horrors of a midnight apparition yet it frequently overtakes them and often pierces the very soul of the dullest peasant of the most airy wit of the most consummate politician dishonor and grief have many times soiled the royal purple and stained the triumphant luster of imperial ensigns what favorite of nature what darling of fortune can then promise himself with security a long continuance of felicity had young philindus well attended to such thoughts as these had not his ungoverned fancy raised imaginary scenes and dressed them in fairy beauties his disappointment would not have been so great nor the tide of his sorrows so considerable and impetuous indeed when first he began to converse with the world and make a public appearance twas with so much advantage that perhaps a more solid genius than his would have promised himself not a little happiness from such an agreeable prospect the comeliness of his person the sweetness of his temper the brightness of his parts and the luster of his fortune conspire to distinguish him as a person born for some noble end in whose future behavior one might hope distinctly to trace the christian the patriot and the gentleman yet alas this blooming youth enchanted with the music of the sirens and seduced by flattery and voluptuousness lost his innocence his friends and his fortune after which he would often take a solitary walk round the neighboring fields and there lament like eve when she left her nuptial bower and surveyed with streaming eyes the departing beauties of eden one morning in particular he rose very early and being full of meditations and intensely pursuing a long train of thought he wandered much farther than usual whilst the verdure of the fields and the music of the woods entertained his senses in the most agreeable manner thus roved the unfortunate philindus till the heat of the sun obliged him to stop at a little grove in the most retired part of which he found a pretty arbor and there he sat down to rest him at that instant he was oppressed with a torrent of grief and the unhappy youth cried out in the greatest agony of spirit assist me most merciful redeemer and send some tender guardianangel to support my fainting spirits and help an imagination which bleeds a fresh at every momentary reflection oh the fatal errors of my past life were i master of the eastern magnificence or lord of the stars i would with transport resign all for the happy opportunity of correcting them but the months that are gone are fled for ever  he had proceeded in his soliloquy had not he been hindered by the approach of a young clergyman who was coming to that arbor which he almost daily visited it is a common observation that when persons of learning and politeness meet together though strangers to each other they soon fall into an easy graceful and familiar air and converse in some measure like intimate acquaintance this was the case before us the clergyman after some little time began in an obliging manner to enquire what adventure had brought him thither for says he i do not remember to have seen any here before except those who came from our family and no wonder since there is no common path lies any way near it philindus told him it was his custom to walk round the fields and there sooth a melancholy softness incident to him that he had wandered far beyond his usual limits and at last by accident found out that place of ease and refreshment  the chaplain for such it seems he was gave him to understand that he lived about a mile off in the house of a great gentleman and then added with a sigh our family has this morning met with the sharpest affliction imaginable in the death of that inestimable person o dear serino how dismal is the sound of thy death to every distressed neighbor whilst each person laments as though he had lost the darling of his hopes and family and the women were preparing their firstborn for the funeral even this delightful retirement has now lost its beauty and i find twas his endearing conversation and reviving presence that gave the grove its richest charms how many thousand eyes will then overflow with tears when he shall be carried to his grave whose bounty and compassion have rescued many from it however he will be laid to rest with honor and his unstained ashes shrined in immortal urns whose gold no rust can canker not malice nor envy itself did once attempt to defame him living much less will they offer to violate his peaceful marble  here he paused and philindus desired he would be pleased to favor him with some account of that gentleman whose virtues were so conspicuous indeed continued he i have heard of many noble actions of the brave serino but since you had the honor and happiness to be intimate with him i may reasonably expect something more entertaining and particular and since we are thus by accident met together i should be very glad to spend some time in free and serious converse which may perhaps prove of more advantage to us than if we had indulged ourselves in melancholy and solitary meditations which i perceive is what we both proposed at our walking out and for my part i cannot but think the many tedious steps i have this morning taken sufficiently recompensed by my meeting in this place a gentleman whose aspect and obliging address promise so much agreeable entertainment the chaplain replied that nothing could be more grateful to him than such a proposal and then immediately began after this manner to give an account of serino  as religion is certainly the chief concern and greatest ornament of mankind which adds fresh luster to the jewels of a crown and adorns with a new grace the noblest scepters twas always serinos opinion that the sincere practice of it did much more recommend a gentleman to the esteem of his contemporaries than the most stately buildings the most delicious gardens or the most shining equipage as well knowing and considering that all this pomp and beauty would soon be lost in silence and obscurity whilst virtue reserves for her votaries rewards which are unknown and eternal indeed of late years some who would be thought men of uncommon parts and set up for wits of the first rank are of a quite different opinion and whilst they are industriously propagating their atheistical notions make no scruple of bantering the most aweful mysteries of religion but he always thought there was so much absurdity and contradiction in their impious schemes as was sufficient to hinder any wise man from embracing them i believe i shall never forget those conferences which i have had with him on this weighty subject the substance of which i shall be very ready to impart to you provided you will be so free as sometimes to relieve me by intermingling such observations as shall appear most natural and proper  philindus i shall be very glad if i can say any thing which may deserve to be joined to the refined thoughts of serino or even with your own agreeable sentiments therefore pray sir go on   chaplain his reasonings upon this head were after this manner that there is a supreme being of infinite perfection and glory is a notion which the mind of every man is apt to assent to as soon as it is proposed and some great men cicero in particular carry the matter much farther and represent this notion of a god as an innate idea which is born with us and interwoven with our constitution now that such an almighty being does really exist is evident from diverse considerations as   st from natural effects which are observable by every man the heavens says the royal psalmist declare the glory of god and the firmament shows his handiwork day unto day utters speech and night unto night shows knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their sound is gone out into all lands and their words unto the ends of the world the polite and judicious mr addison has obliged us with a curious ode on these sublime thoughts of king david i am confident you will not think it loss of time to hear it repeated i the spacious firmament on high with all the blue ethereal sky and spangled heavens a shining frame their great original proclaim the unwearied sun from day to day does his creators power display and publishes to every land the work of an almighty hand ii soon as the evening shades prevail the moon takes up the wondrous tale and nightly to the listening earth repeats the story of her birth whilst all the stars that round her burn and all the planets in their turn confirm the tidings as they roll and spread the truth from pole to pole iii what though in solemn silence all move round the dark terrestrial ball what though no real voice nor sound amidst their radiant orbs be found in reasons ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voice for ever singing as they shine the hand that made us is divine   how exactly is the sun placed at such a due distance from the earth that he may by just degrees give his heat both by sea and land for suppose it in a remoter place of the ether how exquisite a scene of desolation had our globe been and unsufferable winter had defaced its blooming charms we could have had then no gentle zephyrs rich with the spoils of balmy flowers but must have been oppressed with piercing tempests and buried under pyramids of snow on the other hand had it been nearer his fiery beams would have burnt up every beauty of nature and made this world an universal sandy desert how wonderful are the motions of other heavenly bodies how clear an argument of stupendous art and perfect prudence if we descend from the skies where so many thousand gems glister round the azure ring of heaven and take a serious view of the earth which is to us the most observable part of the universe we shall there find the clearest demonstrations of almighty goodness wisdom and power this is very well represented by the admirable dr barrow in his exposition of the creed  that this earth was designed for the accommodation of living creatures which are upon it and principally of man we cannot be ignorant or doubtful if we be not so negligent or stupid as to let pass unobserved those innumerable signs and arguments that show it if we look upon the frame of the animals themselves what a number of admirable contrivances in each of them do appear for the sustenance for the safety for the pleasure for the propagation for grace and ornament for all imaginable convenience suitable to the kind and station of each if we look about them what variety and abundance of convenient provisions offer themselves even to a careless view answerable to all their needs and all their desires wholesome and pleasant food to maintain their lives yea to gratify all their senses fit shelter from offense and safe refuge from danger all these things provided in sufficient plenty and commodiously disposed for such a vast number of creatures not the least most silly weak or contemptible creature but we may see some care has been had for its nourishment and comfort what wonderful instincts are they endued with for procuring and distinguishing their food for guarding themselves and their young from danger but for man especially a most liberal provision has been made to supply all his needs to please all his appetites to exercise with profit and satisfaction all his faculties to content i might say his utmost curiosity neque enim necessitatibus tantummodo nostris provisum est usque in delicias amatur says seneca all things about him do minister or may do so if he will use the natural powers and instruments given him to his preservation ease and delight the bowels of the earth yield him treasures of metals and minerals quarries of stone and coals serviceable to him for various uses the vilest and commonest stones he treads upon are not unprofitable the surface of the earth what variety of delicate fruits herbs and grains does it afford to nourish our bodies and cheer our spirits to please our tastes and remedy our diseases how many fragrant flowers most beautiful and goodly in color and shape for the comfort of our smell and delight of our eyes neither can our ears complain since every wood has a choir of natural musicians to entertain them with their sprightful melody every wood did i say yes too the woods adorned with stately trees yield pleasant spectacles to our sight shelter from offenses of weather and sun fuel for our fires materials for our buildings our houses and shipping and other needful utensils even the barren mountains send us down fresh streams of water so necessary for the support of our lives so profitable for the fructification of our grounds so commodious for conveyance and maintaining of intercourse among us even the wide seas themselves serve us many ways they are commodious for our traffic and commerce they supply the bottles of heaven with water to refresh the earth they are inexhaustable cisterns from whence our springs and rivers are derived they yield stores of good fish and other conveniences of life the very rude and disorderly winds do us no little service in brushing and cleansing the air for our health in driving forward our ships in scattering and spreading about the clouds those clouds which drop fatness on our grounds as for our subjects the animals it is not possible to reckon the manifold utilities we receive from them how many ways they supply our needs with pleasant food and convenient clothing how they ease our labor and how they promote even our sport and recreation and are we not only very stupid but very ungrateful if we do not discern abundance of wisdom and goodness in the contrivance and ordering of all these things so as thus to conspire for our good is it not reasonable that we devoutly cry out with the psalmist o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom have thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches so is the wide and great sea the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou give them their meat in due season   philind pray sir before you proceed give me leave to mention one grand objection which is brought in behalf of infidelity and that is this that we can have no idea of god and therefore can have no evidence of his existence and some atheistical persons argue after this manner the notion of a deity which is commonly entertained is nothing but a bundle of incomprehensibles inconceivables and impossibles it being only a compilement of all imaginable attributes of honor courtship and compliment which the confounded fear and astonishment of mens minds make them huddle up together without any sense or philosophical truth this seems to be intimated by a modern writer in these words the attributes of god signify not true nor false nor any opinion of our brain but the reverence and devotion of our hearts and therefore they are not sufficient premises to infer truth or convince falsehood and the same thing again is farther set out with no small pretense to wit after this manner they that venture to dispute philosophically or reason of gods nature from these attributes of honor losing their understanding in the very first attempt fall from one inconvenience into another without end and without number in the same manner as when one ignorant of the ceremonies of the court coming into the presence of a greater person than he is used to speak to and stumbling at his entrance to save himself from falling lets slip his cloak to recover his cloak lets fall his hat and with one disorder after another discovers his astonishment and rusticity   chapl to affirm that there is no idea of god is all one as to affirm that there is no conception of the mind answering to that word or name and indeed the modern atheists stick not to maintain that the word god has no signification and that there is no other idea or conception in mens minds answering thereunto besides the mere phantasm of the sound and since as the learned dr cudworth observes there are different words for god in several languages and men have the same notion or conception in their minds answering to them all it must needs be granted that they have some other idea or conception belonging to those words besides the phantasms of their several sounds and indeed it can be nothing else but either monstrous sottishness and stupidity of mind or else prodigious impudence in these atheists to deny that there is any idea of god at all in the minds of men or that the word has any signification but whatever these atheists deny in words it is notwithstanding evident that even themselves have an idea or conception in their minds answering to the word god when they deny his existence because otherwise they would deny the existence of nothing and then as to his being absolutely perfect and of infinite power the pagantheists did acknowledge it as might be proved from vast numbers of passages in their writings thus virgil at pater anchises oculos ad sydera laetus extulit and coelo palmas cum voce tetendit jupiter omnipotens precibus si flecteris ullis    philind this seems very natural as does also your last inference from the beauty and harmony of the universe and yet so very unreasonable are the atheists that they will not allow even of this but find fault with the creation and pretend to spy out many considerable defects in the frame of nature and constitution of the heavens for instance the disposition of the equator and ecliptic intersecting each other in an angle of twentythree degrees and upwards whereby as they say the terrestrial globe is rendered much more uninhabitable than otherwise it might be again they remark that part of the earth lies deformed and inhospitable either by burning heat or freezing cold they likewise take notice of the variety of those savage beasts which terrify mankind and thence with lucretius conclude that these things are not under the conduct of a wise and merciful being   chapl as to their notion of the equator it is built upon a false supposition of the ancients that the torrid zone or all between the tropicks was utterly uninhabitable by reason of the extremity of the heat and it is certain that there is nothing which does more demonstrate a providence than this very thing it being the most convenient site or disposition that could be devised as will appear if the inconveniences of other dispositions be considered especially these three   if the axis of these circles should be parallel and their plaries coincident   if they should intersect each other in right angles and   which is a middle betwixt both if they should cut one another in an angle of fortyfive degrees for it is evident that each of these dispositions would be attended with far greater inconveniences to the terrestrial inhabitants in respect of the length of days and nights heat and cold and that these two circles should continue thus to keep the same angular intersection when physical and mechanical causes would bring them still nearer together this is a farther evidence of a providence also and then as to the savage animals as we are assured by revelation that they were not originally noxious to mankind but became so by sin so even now they are of some use and service to them   philind let us sir if you please proceed to some farther arguments in defense of this great truth   chapl that there is a god is proved by the general consent of mankind concerning it by that testimonium as lactantius speaks populorum atque gentium in una hac re non dissidentium that unanimous testimony of all people and nations not disagreeing in this only point if the authority of some particular men agreeing in vote of one city of one nation does pass for an argument and shows the thing probable how can we decline or contemn the common suffrage of mankind another argument of gods existence which gave great satisfaction to serino is drawn from the discoveries of a divine power in works that cannot be ascribed to any other cause visible or natural such are the prediction of future events especially such as are contingent and depend upon mans free choice curing the sick of great chronical distempers without any medicinal applications restoring limbs to persons maimed sight to the blind and raising the dead to life a thing which pliny deemed impossible to god himself to this head belong those opinions and testimonies of mankind concerning apparitions enchantments and consederacy with bad spirits   phil as to the general opinion of mankind the atheist would make us believe that this apprehension of a god does spring from an infinite jealousy in the mind of man and an endless fear of the worst that may happen according to that divine saying of the poet which he can never sufficiently admire primus in orb deos fecit timor fear first made gods so that it is granted on both sides that the fear of a deity does universally possess the minds of men now the question is says the learned archbishop tillotson whether it be more likely that the existence of a god should be the cause of this fear or that this fear should be the cause why men imagine there is a god if there be a god who has impressed this image of himself upon the mind of man there is great reason why all men should stand in awe of him but if there be no god it is not easy to conceive how fear should create an universal confidence and assurance in men that there is one for whence should this fear come it must be either from without from the suggestion of others who first tell us there is such a being and then our fear believes it or else it must arise from within from the nature of man which is apt to fancy dreadful and terrible things if from the suggestions of others who tell us so the question returns who told them so and will never be satisfied till the first author of this report be found out but if it be said that this fear arises from within from the nature of man which is apt to imagine dreadful things this likewise is liable to inexplicable difficulties for first the proper object of fear is something that is dreadful that is something that threatens men with harm or danger and that in god must be either power or justice and such an object as this fear indeed may create but goodness and mercy are essential to the notion of a god as well as power and justice now how should fear put men upon fancying a being that is infinitely good and merciful indeed as that great prelate just now mentioned observes if a man had arguments sufficient to persuade him that there is no god as there is infinite reason to the contrary yet the belief of a god is so necessary to the comfort and happiness of our lives that a wise man could not but be heartily troubled to quit so pleasant an error and to part with a delusion which is apt to yield such an unspeakable satisfaction to the mind of man did men but consider the true notion of god he would appear to be so lovely a being and so full of goodness and all desirable perfections that even those very persons who are of such irregular understandings as not to believe there is a god yet could not if they understood themselves refrain from wishing with all their hearts that there were one for is it not really desirable to every man that there should be such a being in the world as takes care of the frame of it that it do not run into confusion and in that disorder ruin mankind that there should be such a being as takes particular care of every one of us and loves us and delights to do us good as understands all our wants and is able and willing to relieve us in our greatest straits when nothing else can to preserve us in our greatest dangers to assist us against our worst enemies and to comfort us under our sharpest sufferings when all other things set themselves against us   chapl it is really so very plain and evident that i shall go farther on this subject after having taken notice that the epicurean account of the original of the world as expressed by lucretius is most intolerably romantic and ridiculous for how is it any ways possible that chance should make this great volume of the world which can never produce the least book how long might a man be in sprinkling colors upon canvass with a careless hand before they would happen to make the exact picture of a man and is a man easier made by chance than his picture   phil i think there is one considerable objection of the atheists which as yet we have not touched upon i should therefore be glad if you would a little consider it before we dismiss this subject   chapl pray what is that   phil the seeming confusion of human affairs that all things fall alike to all the innocent and the guilty the pious and the impious the religious and the profane nay that many times the worser causes and men prevail against the better as is intimated in that passage of lucan though in the person of a theist victrix causa diis placuit sed victa catoni and that the unjust and ungodly often flourish in the greatest prosperity whilst the innocent and devout worshippers of the deity all their lives long struggle with adversity whereas were there a god and providence as they conceive profane and irreligious persons would be presently thunderstruck from heaven or otherwise made remarkable objects of divine vengeance as also the pious miraculously protected and rescued from evils and harms   chapl it must indeed be granted that this consideration has too much puzzled and staggered weak minds in all ages because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore is the heart of the sons of men fully set in them to do evil and the psalmist himself was sometimes much perplexed with this phenomenon the prosperity of the ungodly who set their mouths against heaven and whose tongue walks through the earth so that he was tempted to think he had cleansed his heart in vain and washed his hands in innocence till at length entering into the sanctuary of god his mind became illuminated and his soul fixed in a firm trust and confidence upon divine providence whom says he have i in heaven but thee etc my flesh and my heart fails but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever for as some will be apt from hence to infer that there is no god but that blind chance and fortune steer all  the fool has said in his heart there is no god so will others conclude that though there be a god yet he either does not know things done here below  how does god know and is there knowledge in the most high or else will not so far humble himself or disturb his own ease and quiet as to concern himself in our low human affairs first of all therefore we here say that it is altogether unreasonable to require that divine providence should miraculously interpose upon every turn in punishing the ungodly and preserving the pious and thus perpetually interrupt the course of nature which would look but like a botch or bungle and a violent business but rather carry things on in a still and silent path and show his art and skill in making things of themselves fairly unwind and clear up at last into a satisfactory close passion and selfinterest are blind or shortsighted but that which steers the whole world is no fond pettish impatient and passionate thing but an impartial disinterested and uncaptivated nature nevertheless it is certain that sometimes we have not wanted instances in cases extraordinary of a  god appearing as it were miraculously upon the stage and manifesting himself in taking immediate vengeance upon notorious malefactors or delivering his faithful servants from imminent dangers or evils threatened as the same is often done also by a secret and undiscerned overruling of the things of nature but it must be granted that it is not always thus but the periods of divine providence here in this world are commonly longer and the evolutions thereof slower which proceeds not from slackness and remissness in the deity but either from his patience and longsuffering being willing that men should repent or else to teach us patience by his example they therefore who because judgment is not presently executed upon the ungodly blame the management of things as faulty and providence as defective are like such spectators of a dramatic poem as when wicked and injurious persons are brought upon the stage for a while swaggering and triumphing impatiently cry out against the dramatist and presently condemn the plot whereas if they would but expect the winding up of things and stay till the last clap they should then see them come off with sufficient shame and punishment   phil it is indeed most absurd for such weak and ignorant creatures as mortals are to presume to pronounce rashly of the divine government but pray sir go on in your account of serinos sentiments as to religion   chapl he thought it no less evident that we ought to worship this god and to pay him our most solemn adoration the beauties of nature so warmed the breasts of the heathens that in those groves where they had so often enjoyed the soft delights of the refreshing breeze and the flowery shade there they performed religious rites and each retired grotto became a sacred temple now its very natural to conceive that almighty god should make some discovery of his will to his creatures by remarkable and distinct revelations and not permit the devout soul whom the glories of the creation has raised to a sacred ecstasy to offer up his sacrifice to an unknown deity is it not absurd to suppose that the king of heaven should give to men his subjects no certain rule for their conduct of life but leave every one to act according to what he imagines most agreeable to the laws of nature and honor uncertain guides into what various and opposite paths do you lead your wandering followers whilst one man thinks that action natural and honorable which another perhaps of more wisdom reckons base and unnatural from such an uncertain sound who can prepare himself to the battle   phil and yet the deists insist upon it that reason alone is an unerring guide in matters of religion and sufficient to make us happy which say they is as much as we need desire about which mr clifford thus expresses himself being resolved according to the duty of every private person to make a search into the nature and quality of my religion and according to my interest in human society to communicate the effects of that search to others if i shall believe it profitable for them i am in the first place to consider of the choice of some guide for so long and dangerous a journey where i shall sometimes meet with no track or path at all and sometimes with so many and those so contrary in the appearance of their first entry that the variety will confound me more than the want especially there being so many mists cast before me by the errors and deceits of others that one had great need of a better eyesight than is left us by the fall of our first forefather and this consideration after a long and serious debate thereof brings no other guide to me but my own reason which if it take such directions as it ought and may do before it sets forth and pursue those directions with care and constancy though it may possibly lead me into errors yet will bring me at last even through them to the proposed end of my journey which is happiness   chapl notwithstanding what these gentlemen assert it is certain that natural religion without revealed is not sufficient because it wants clearness and authority especially concerning those two great articles of forgiveness of sins and a future state   phil as to these points i remember mr blount the great champion of the deists in his oracles of reason makes these brief observations whatsoever is adorable amiable and imitable by mankind is in one supreme infinite and perfect being who is to be worshipped not by an image sacrifice or mediator but by an inviolable adherence in our lives to all the things  by an imitation of god in all his imitable perfections and believing magnificently of it and then he goes on speaking of a future state a man that is endued with the same virtues we have beforementioned need not fear to trust his soul with god after death for   st no creature could be made with a malevolent intent the first good who is also the first principle of all beings has but one affection or property and that is love which was long before there was any such thing as sin   dly at death he gives to god one and the same being who in his own nature for the sins of the penitent has as well an inclination to pity as justice and there is nothing dreadful in the whole nature of god but his justice no attribute else being terrible   dly infinite power is ever safe and needs not revenge for selfpreservation   thly however verisimile est similem deo a deo non negligi   chapl after they have said all they can natural religion without revealed is not a solid foundation of happiness besides there never was any age or nation in the world when or where such a pure natural religion as they talk of without any manner of rituous worship was ever practiced i know not what secret histories these gentlemen may have of the golden age but as for us dull believers we cannot see one word in all the ancient books we meet withal that gives us the least hint of such a naked natural religion as you speak of if we have recourse to the poets to whom we are beholden for all that is known of these golden ages when these brave men lived they make religion as ritual as it is now and altogether as full of sacrifices and revelations nay the account we have of the goddess astraea which is a principal part of the poetical history of the golden age is that she was a numen sent from heaven to converse with men on earth to inspire them with justice and sobriety and to teach them virtue and a good life which fable is but an ancient tradition of the frequency of gods conversing with holy men in the first ages of the world neither do we see any of the ancient poetical heroes your herculess and polluxs your brave naturalreligion men but they frequent sacrifices as much as other people as we see by the examples of priam ulysses achilles and aeneas of cadmus perseus theseus and all the argonauts in apollonius and other poets so that we cannot but conclude that the story which the deists tell us of the ancient universality of pure natural religion is all philosophical romance and never had any being but in the brains of the gentlemen of their persuasion and those of some systemmakers and preachers of late drawn from the scattered sayings and books of philosophers   phil if natural religion then proves so insufficient we must consult revealed which i suppose was practiced by serino   chapl undoubtedly concerning which method serino would express himself after this manner the next thing which a considering man has to do after he has discovered the insufficiency of reason without revelation to make a man happy is to enquire into the nature of those religions that lay claim to a divine authority if we take a steady view of the pagan scheme we shall find it so overrun with ignorance barbarity and monstrous fiction that any person of tolerable parts might soon draw a better and more rational plan in which there is little tending to the reverence of god or the good of man to the promoting virtue and goodness in human conversation to the breeding love and good will in men toward one another their worship that of the supreme lord being neglected is directed toward objects most improper and unbecoming to the ghosts of dead men men in their lives if we may trust the reports of their devoutest adorers famous for nothing so much as for vicious enormities for thefts and rapine for murders and parricides for horrid lusts and adulteries rapes and incests and such persons alive or dead what wise and good man would not rather loath than worship and respect if we consult the alcoran of mahomet that notorious antichrist and vile impostor we shall reap but little benefit from a silly rhapsody of lewdness and cruelty indeed mahometism in respect to its age and the port it bears in the world demands some consideration for to speak in the words of a great man of our church it has continued a long time and has vastly overspread the earth neither is it more formidable in its looks than peremptory in its words vaunting itself to be a complete general and ultimate declaration of gods pleasure cancelling all those that have gone before but examining both the substance and circumstances thereof considering the quality of the instruments by whom of the times when it was introduced of the places where of the people who first or afterward did receive it the manner of its rise progress and continuance as also the matter it teaches we shall not find stamped on it the genuine characters of a divine original but have great reason to deem it a brood of most lewd and impudent couzenage in times of great disturbance and confusion when barbarous nations like torrents did overflow the world and turned all things upside down in times of general corruption and disorder in mens minds and manners when even among christians ignorance and superstition dissension and uncharitableness impiety and iniquity did greatly prevail in a very blind and obscure corner of the earth among a crew of wild thieves and runagates such have those arabians been always famed and known to be this sect had its birth and fosterage among those fierce and savage overrunners of the world it got its growth and stature into this sort of people being indeed in its constitution well accommodated to that humor and genius it was partly insinuated by juggling tricks and partly driven by seditious violence the first author hereof being a person according to the description given of him in their own legends of no honest or honorable qualities but having all the marks of an impostor rebellious and persidious inhuman and cruel lewd and lascivious of a base education of a fraudulent and turbulent disposition of a vicious life pretending to enthusiasm and working of wonders but these such as were in their nature most absurd and incredible at such a season and in such a soil by such means and by such a person was this religion first planted and afterward carried on by the sword now that divine wisdom should choose those black and boisterous times to publish his will is as if the king should purposely order his proclamations to be made in a tempestuous night when no man scarce dares to stir out nor could well see what was done or hear what was said much fitter surely to that purpose were a serene and calm day a time of general civility and peace like that of augustus caesar that the declaration of gods mind should issue from the deserts of arabia that den of robbers is as if the king should cause his edicts to be set up in the blindest and dirtiest nook of the suburbs the marketcross surely or the exchange the place of most general and ordinary concourse such as in respect to the world was the flourishing empire of rome were more convenient and wisely chosen for that purpose that passing over the more gentle and tractable part of his people a prince should send his laws to a rabble of banditti should pick out for his messenger a most dissolute varlet attended with a crew of desperate ruffians resolved to buffet and rifle all they met were an odd way of proceeding to communicate his pleasure to the better and more orderly sort of his people such as were the subjects of that wellgoverned empire by persons of good meaning mild disposition and innocent behavior such as were the apostles of our lord in a quiet and gentle manner such as these only used would surely better become a wise prince thus even the exterior circumstances of mahometism are strong presumptions against its divinity but farther if we look into the frame and matter of it we shall find it a mass of absurd opinions odd stories and uncouth ceremonies compounded chiefly of the dregs of christian heresy together with some ingredients of judaism and paganism confusedly jumbled such considerations as these seem sufficient to demonstrate that religion not to be of a divine extraction   phil but then as to the jewish religion we must acknowledge it had its birth from the revelation and appointment of god   chapl its truth and its goodness we do not call in question but yet looking into it we shall find it in many respects defective for   st this revelation was not general but peculiarly intended for the benefit of a small nation he showed his word to jacob his statutes and his judgments to israel he has not dealt so with any nation and as for his judgments they have not known them we may also observe that as the laws and rites of this religion were designed only for the people of israel so they were only suited to their inclinations and capacities their inclinations which were very stubborn and perverse their capacities which were very low and gross as their own prophets do upon many occasions affirm and complain being repugnant to the common humor and genius of mankind   dly as it was particular so it was also partial as god did not by it speak his mind to all so did he not therein speak out all his mind our apostle to the hebrews charges it with blameableness if the first covenant had been blameless etc with imperfection weakness and unprofitableness there is made an abolition of the precedent commandment for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law was nothing perfect neither does this lay any misbeseeming imputation upon god the author of that religion for a dawning of light more became that morning of times than a meridian brightness   dly it was not designed for perpetual obligation and use the glory of that institution is long since departed and the miserable jews labor under the weight of the most dismal curses they are now more outrageous enemies to the doctrine of the cross than the blasphemous turk or the barbarous pagan in the christian religion that deserves the serious regard of a considering mind it is this alone appears most worthy of a god and by its radiant appearance discovers itself to be celestial it would be endless to reckon up all the distinct beauties that are so conspicuous in this venerable institution i shall but just touch on some few which fully convinced serino of its certainty and excellency first it gives us a lovely and clear idea of our creator and sets his infinite perfections before us in a true and amiable light the benefit of which will be more evident to us if we consider into what wretched notions the blinded pagans were led for want of such a great advantage their gods were represented as cruel indigent and lustful subject to the meanest passions of human nature nay sometimes to the lowest inclinations of brutes what noble objects of adoration must here be what admirable patterns of sanctity and good behavior but christians are taught from the holy scriptures to believe that god is a being of infinite purity and mercy a second great excellency peculiar to the christian institution is this that it faithfully informs us concerning ourselves concerning our nature our original our end all our state past present and final points about which otherwise by no reason no history no experience we could be well resolved or satisfied it is also a peculiar excellency of our religion that it prescribes an accurate rule of life most congruous to reason and suitable to our nature it sets before us a living copy and visible standard of good practice it frees us from a tedious observance of numerous external rites and superficial formalities and builds our duty upon most solid grounds presses it with most valid inducements draws it from the best principles and drives it to the best end and farther which no other law or doctrine so much as pretends to provides sufficient help and ability to practice its commandments in a word it alone can appease and satisfy a mans conscience breeding therein a wellgrounded hope and a solid comfort healing the wounds of bitter remorse and anxious fear and so appears manifestly to be the true and direct way to eternal happiness it is observable also that the sacred oracles furnish us with the most awful descriptions of gods power and majesty quite different from that tinsel pageantry which so glitters in the machines of the heathen poets how bright is the coloring of the royal psalmist how lofty and refined his diction when he celebrates the honor of his god bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honor and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters who makes the clouds his chariot who walks upon the wings of the wind who makes his angels spirits his ministers a flame of fire psalm civ      the book of psalms is full of such divine and magnificent images as are also many of the writings of the prophets especially isaiah who apparently excels the most celebrated of the grecian or roman orators many such observations did the dear serino make   phil i think these heads of argument very just and sufficient to give a solid and inward satisfaction to every man who will give himself leave seriously to attend the consequences of them and if we add to these the numerous miracles wrought in confirmation of these doctrines by our savior and his apostles the wonderful and speedy propagation of the gospel under seemingly insuperable difficulties the magnanimous sufferings of the noble army of martyrs who when they were tortured would not accept of deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection the fierceness of the raging flames could not shock their faith or remove their constancy because they well knew that when our savior had overcome the sharpness of death he opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers if we consider all these things we must own that none but christians deserve the honorable name of freethinkers and their dull adversaries oppose these sublime truths from a certain narrowness of mind meanness of thought and contractedness of soul that tamely submits to vulgar prejudices and not being able to rise to the contemplation of eternal joys dreads so vast an idea as that of immortality but pray proceed   chapl serino being thus fixed in the principles of religion resolved to act accordingly and not to omit any duty out of compliment to the prevailing humor of a degenerate age and though now in great families it is reckoned unfashionable to beg a blessing upon our daily bread he thought it proper to have prayers read twice a day in a little chapel adjoining to his house at which all his menial servants were obliged to be present he would by no means allow of the least tincture of profaneness in his family yet being himself of a most gay and airy temper he would in a particular manner encourage all innocent mirth diversion and recreations   phil i have indeed observed that few things are more prejudicial to religion than the too melancholy and rigid deportment of some of its votaries   chapl i have very good reason to believe that a virtuous course of life has seldom in our days been better recommended than by the beautiful example of serino who was the real friend and powerful patron of the orphan and defenseless at his gates you might daily see crowds of indigent persons or at least those who appeared so who were all supplied with a free and promiscuous bounty for he did not relish those maxims which tend to cut off any though the least branch of charity it may be would he often say many who come to my gates for relief are cheats and impostors what then did i certainly know who these wretches were that thus impose on goodnature and compassion the noblest ornaments of human nature i surely would not throw any thing away upon them but as i do not i intend to give so long as it is in my power to all that ask because to me they appear to be in want and since almighty god has been so very liberal to me i cannot but think it will be wellpleasing to him to see me vigorously endeavoring to imitate his glorious example such in this case were the sentiments of serino and i must confess to me they appear exceeding just and delicate and were gentlemen but duly sensible of that refined and ravishing pleasure which constantly attends actions of true beneficence they could not but perform them with more frequency and readiness how faint are the delights of the most luxurious entertainments how dull the sentiments which spring from surveying a vast mass of riches if compared with the permanent joys that rise from the reflection of our having brought a seasonable relief to the distressed unhappy serino had various other ways of exercising that heroic passion of universal benevolence which ran so visibly through all his actions and gave an inconceivable grace to his whole conversation he was the founder of a large charityschool in a neighboring town and the chief supporter of it besides he liberally contributed to the maintenance of diverse others he observed that among all the melancholy symptoms of declining piety it was very comfortable to a pious mind to see one very eminent sign of the reverse that is the flourishing of charityschools in this kingdom the design of which is so very excellent that it cannot but be highly pleasing to the divine majesty and draw down many blessings on the place where they are encouraged   phil all good christians must certainly highly approve of and to the utmost of their power encourage those useful nurseries of learning and piety which are of the greatest service for forming the minds and manners of youth and by which many poor children have happily been rescued from poverty ignorance and profaneness   chapl so intent was he on doing good that he used to give his steward orders to enquire after poor housekeepers who had large families or were disabled from work by sickness or any other casualty to these he was liberal in such a manner as even sometimes gave them a temptation to be glad at those misfortunes which were the occasion of their receiving such uncommon supplies he used often to employ me and another gentleman who attended on him in finding out such as were reduced from favorable circumstances to great necessity and fallen from the hopes of a good fortune and liberal education to the unspeakable sorrows of a melancholy despondency such persons have many times been unexpectedly relieved by his bounty which has quite changed the scene and dressed the gloomy nightpiece in the softest airs of the morning   phil this branch of charity is not the least considerable in my opinion for surely if we reflect on the sad condition of those who are fallen from plenty to poverty and from a soft and easy life exposed to all the hardships of tempestuous storms if we have pity in our breasts we cannot but drop a tear at the consideration of such piercing misfortunes but i fear i shall by my digressions hinder myself of hearing such a full account of serino as i desire   chapl not at all without those what a great part of the entertainment and profit of our converse must be lost and the time seem to move heavily but to go on so great was his zeal for the honor of god so warm his passion for the beauties of holiness that he not only contributed largely toward the rebuilding diverse decayed churches but also erected a most stately one in his own parish upon which he would look with much more pleasure than upon that ancient and stately structure in which he dwelt he has more than once expressed his approbation of the conduct of the romanists in this particular that they spare no costs to adorn their churches which however weak minds may call a useless pageantry yet seems very agreeable to those notions which both nature and revelation give us of the divine majesty there is no person of distinction among us but is willing to have his house beautiful and stately nay men of an inferior rank will be at considerable charges to render their apartments neat and pleasant and does it then become us to think that cost and labor misemployd which is spent in adorning the sacred temples it is true the primitive christians sometimes worshipped god in caves in fields and the meanest rooms you can imagine and i fear to better purpose and with greater ardour of devotion than most christians nowadays in magnificent churches yet this was not of choice but necessity for let some men think and say what they please the noble beauty and solemn ornaments of a temple serve to excite reverence and raise devotion though at the same time it must be confessed that sincere worship performed in the poorest place when no better can be obtained is as grateful to our creator as the most tuneful anthems that resound in gilded roofs and lofty arches   phil i have heard that serino had one of the finest private libraries in england and i cannot but imagine that a gentleman of such peculiar accomplishments must have had a more than ordinary taste of the politer parts of learning and therefore should be very glad to hear something of his fancy as to this matter and who were his favorite authors   chapl he had indeed a large and wellchosen library filled with the best writers on all subjects there was his chief delight and when he had been out a few hours a hunting or upon some other diversion would return to his study with the greatest pleasure he was a very great admirer of the ancient fathers and did by no means approve of the opinion of some modern divines otherwise men of good judgment who set too light by those venerable remains of pious antiquity he seemed in a more particular manner to be delighted with the writings of origin and st chrysostom though diverse authors very injuriously place the former in their catalogues of heretics yet he shines with distinguished rays amongst the brightest of his contemporaries as to the subtle volumes of aquinas scotus durandus and the rest of the schoolmen he was no great admirer of them yet thought the study of them sometimes necessary he had with the utmost care examined the controversy between us and the church of rome and though he could not but admire the learning and smart turns of cardinal bellarmin and others of their ablest champions yet he was so well assured of the agreeableness of the protestant faith to the holy scriptures that there was no more probability of his relinquishing it than of forsaking the first principles of natural religion since he always looked upon the former to be a direct opposition to the gospel both by its superstitious doctrines and bloody maxims about which he would sometimes thus express himself when speaking of the goodnatured church of rome we cannot but take notice of such a disagreeable image where the features are so very grim and its garments deeper died with blood than paint where human gore hides all the softer crimson a strange and monstrous spectacle which at once appears gay and horrible glittering and terrifying dressed in the beauteous smiles of an angel their gilded chapels their dazzling ornaments their solemn and pompous processions and cursed with the ghastly snakes of a persecuting fury no person of common humanity can hear of those barbarities which the furious bigots of rome have committed without being shocked to the last degree and feeling a fresh pain at the reflection on those cruelties which were no more than sport to the inhuman actors but how contrary is this to the christian religion which is made up of love and sweetness as is evident from the divine anthem which the joyful angels sung at our redeemers incarnation glory be to god on high on earth peace good will toward men   phil pray sir what were serinos sentiments concerning socinus and his followers for if i dont mistake i have heard him represented by some as a favourer of the racoviandivinity   chapl this shows what little regard is due to flying reports that are often dispersed without the least foundation for as to socinuss notions concerning our blessed lords divinity none could be a greater adversary to them than serino he has often lamented with the greatest earnestness that a person of such learning parts and morality should make such desperate essays to dethrone the great god and our savior jesus christ who is the king of kings and lord of lords he wondered how he durst presume to represent him as a mere man whose goingsforth have been of old from the days of eternity and by whom were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers col i    to him throughout the sacred writings the ensigns divinely royal are every where ascribed when he brings his firstbegotten into the world he says and let all the angels of god worship him and unto the son he says thy throne o god is for ever heb i    indeed he used to read some part of socinuss works with great pleasure wherein he defends the liberty of the will and the doctrine of universal redemption and explodes the stoical and absurd opinion of the rigid predestinarians but in these points socinus agrees entirely with the primitive writers with the whole body of the remonstrants and even with the most celebrated divines of our church that he was conversant in the works of crellius volkelius and others of that clan was not with any design to fall into their scheme but only to furnish himself with some valuable flowers that were dispersed among numerous weeds i cannot say the same as to his judgment of the remonstrants for he seemed to go very much into their scheme and used to declare that he thought them a set of christians whose professed doctrines were as agreeable to the apostolical and primitive rules as any whatever and was particularly pleased with that charming air of meekness and charity which usually adorns even their polemical writings he admired the profoundness of arminius the sublimeness of episcopius the clearness of limborch and the modesty and learning of curcellaeus who were indeed among the foremost of his favorite authors and well he might since even a tillotson a scott a sherlock have not disdained in many points to imitate their manner of thinking   phil in this i have the honor exactly to agree with serino and have often perused the writings of those great men you just now mentioned with inexpressible satisfaction and once i remember night came upon me unawares whilst i was reading a little posthumous volume of curcellaeuss in answer to maresius   chapl i remember likewise he was wont to speak of the learned castalio with great respect and pity that so worthy a man should be exposed to so much want and even expire amidst neglect and indigence but in this as serino well observed he did but follow the steps of his great lord and master who had not where to lay his head and left the world under circumstances of grief and contempt atheistical wits very often complain of the meanness of the style of holy writ let them read the bible either in the original or in castalios elegant version and they cannot possibly without blushing mention any more such groundless objections another favorite author of my dear friends was the admired grotius he had also in his library a complete set of calvins works in which sometimes he would spend an hour or two but those harsh positions and unscriptural assertions which he there frequently met with concerning gods decrees made him only consult them occasionally and not with that pleasure which otherwise he might have found in the writings of a divine who was very considerable in many other respects he thought his doctrine of absolute reprobation wholly inconsistent with all the attributes of god and laboring under monstrous absurdities is it possible that the god of infinite mercy should resolve from all eternity upon the destruction of the far greater part of mankind and yet call upon them with the most moving tenderness to accept of happiness he that believes this doctrine and yet scruples to admit the doctrine of transubstantiation may in some sense be said to strain at a knat and swallow a camel for the latter absurd as it is yet is not loaded with those dismal consequences as is that of the horrible decree which like the tail of a dragon draws after it a long train of darkness and terror insomuch that bishop latimer in his sermon on septuagesima      was so offended at such kind of doctrines that he tells us according to his own plainness and that of the times that it is as needful to beware of such reasonings and expositions of the scripture as it is to beware of the devil himself and in his sermon on the following   d sunday after trinity he expressly asserts that christ shed as much blood for judas as he did for peter so that we see the orthodox doctrine of universal redemption was then taught in the church of england by those who resisted unto blood striving against the corruptions of the church of rome   phil pray sir who were his chief favorites among our english divines   chapl bp tailor archbp tillotson and dr barrow in whose writings there appears a rich variety of divine thoughts dressed in the beautiful colors of a charming diction not but that he was frequent in the perusal of all those great men of our church who have obliged us with their writings such as bishop stilling fleet dr sherlock the author of the whole duty of man etc but i think the three i mentioned were as it were his daily companions he was in constant communion with the church of england and thought it his duty to comply with her injunctions and thereby obey the lawful commands of his superiors this dr barrow had taught him in his discourse of obedience to our spiritual guides and governors where he thus speaks consider obedience what it is whence it springs and what it produces each of these respects will engage us to it it is in itself a thing very good and acceptable to god very just and equal very wise very comely and pleasant it cannot but be grateful to god who is the god of love of order and peace to see men do their duty in the respect performed to his own ministers it is also a comely and amiable thing yielding much grace procuring great honor to the church highly adorning and crediting religion the whole discourse deserves to be written in letters of gold but i shall repeat no more of it at present since i find the time will not permit us to stay much longer   phil i cannot without regret leave such agreeable conversation but since it must be i should be very glad if you would please to favor me with a few more miscellaneous hints concerning this worthy gentleman   chapl i shall readily comply with your request provided you will excuse my want of connection and regularity it was his custom every morning and evening to sing a divine hymn accompanied not only with several fine voices but also with the choicest instruments particularly every sunday morning the following one of the excellent mr addison was sung in his family and the harmony improved with the music of a curious organ i when all thy mercies o my god my rising soul surveys transported with the view i am lost in wonder love and praise ii o how shall words with equal warmth the gratitude declare that glows within my ravished heart but thou can read it there iii thy providence my life sustained and all my wants redrest when in the silent womb i lay and hung upon the breast iv to all my weak complaints and cries thy mercy lent an ear ever yet my feeble thoughts had learnt to form themselves in prayer v vnnumberd comforts to my soul thy tender care bestowed before my infant heart conceived from whence these comforts flowed vi when in the slippery paths of youth with heedless steps i ran thine arm unseen conveyed me safe and led me up to man vii through hidden dangers toils and death it gently cleared my way and through the pleasing snares of vice more to be feared than they viii when worn with sickness often have thou with health renewed my face and when in sins and sorrows sunk revived my soul with grace ix thy bounteous hand with worldly bliss has made my cup run over and in a kind and faithful friend have doubled all my store x ten thousand thousand precious gifts my daily thanks employ nor is the least a cheerful heart that tastes those gifts with joy xi through every period of my life thy goodness i will pursue and after death in distant worlds the glorious theme renew xii when nature fails and day and night divide thy works no more my evergrateful heart o lord thy mercy shall adore xiii through all eternity to thee a joyful song i will raise for o eternitys too short to utter all thy praise   this exercise he thought was exceeding refreshing to the spirits and gave the thoughts a very agreeable turn he was indeed very fond of music and looked upon it to be in its highest use when employed to celebrate the praises of our creator not but that sometimes he would be diverted with compositions of another nature and smile at the beauties of a moral politic or amorous song he was so great an admirer of poetry even in his tenderest years that i remember i have heard him say that when he was at the grammar school he wrote out all miltons paradise lost very fair so exceedingly was he delighted with it he would very often take it with him into the fields and by reading it enjoy a pleasant serenity something like that which the grove of eden afforded to its blissful inhabitants he was much pleased with spensers fairyqueen notwithstanding the bestnatured critic must own it is too allegorical yet the variety of amusing images that adorn his writings cannot fail of delighting a poetical genius he always spoke of mr cowley as a polite and fine gentleman who seemed as well turned for an orator as a poet he thought mr drydens fables much the brightest of all his performances though his translation of virgil is very smooth and musical and some of his tragedies very entertaining i shall leave this head of poetry when i have taken notice that serino amongst all other divine poems in which he was very much conversant approved of none more  milton excepted than sir richard blackmores creation mr wattss horae lyricae and dr youngs poem on the last day it was remarkable in serino that he was always so sensible of the advantages of a country life above that in the town that he would never stay there above a month in the year but when something extraordinary has called him from his beloved seat he has made all imaginable haste to return and was of claudians mind in the agreeable description he has given us of the old man of verona faelix qui propriis aevum transegit in arvis etc happy the man who his whole time does bound within the enclosure of his little ground happy the man whom the same humble place the hereditarycottage of his race from his first rising infancy has known and by degrees sees gently bending down with natural propension to that earth which both preserved his life and gave him birth him no false distant lights by fortune set could ever into foolish wandrings get he never dangers either saw or feared the dreadful storms at sea he never heard he never heard the shrill alarms of war or the worse noises of the lawyers bar no change of consuls marks to him the year the change of seasons is his calendar the cold and heat winter and summer shows autumn by fruits and spring by flowers he knows he measures time by landmarks and has found for the whole day the dial of his ground a neighboring wood born with himself he sees and loves his old contemporary trees h has only heard of near veronas name and knows it like the indies but by fame does with a like concernment notice take of the red sea and of benacus lake thus health and strength he ta third age enjoys and sees a long posterity of boys about the spacious world let others roam the voyagelife is longest made at home cowley he would take notice that the country was so empty that a true englishman could not look into it without a great deal of just pity and concern it being a very ungrateful spectacle to see so many noble houses mouldring into ruin and dropping down for want of inhabitants he has often wondered at some gentlemen of his acquaintance who used almost to drown those laudable qualities they were masters of in floods of wine and spent a great deal of time in excessive drinking which vice has very fatal effects on the mind of the person who is devoted to it not to say that it also wastes his body and dissipates his fortune for as a polite gentleman very well observes see a spectator of mr addisons as to the mind drunkenness discovers every flaw in it the sober man by the strength of reason may keep under and subdue every vice or folly to which he is most inclined but wine makes every latent seed sprout up in the soul and show itself it gives fury to the passions and force to those objects which are apt to produce them when a young fellow complained to an old philosopher that his wife was not handsome  put less water in your wine says the philosopher and you will quickly make her so wine heightens indifference into love love into jealousy and jealousy into madness it often turns the goodnatured man into an idiot and the choleric into an assassin it gives bitterness to resentment it makes vanity insupportable and displays every little spot of the soul in its utmost deformity nor does this vice only betray the hidden faults of a man and show them in the most odious colors but often occasions faults to which he is not naturally subject there is more of turn than of truth in a saying of seneca that drunkenness does not produce but discover faults common experience teaches us the contrary wine throws a man out of himself and infuses qualities into the mind which she is a stranger to in her sober moments the person you converse with after the third bottle is not the same man who at first sat down at table with you upon this maxim is founded a pretty saying of publius syrus qui ebrium ludificat laedit absentem he who jests upon a man who is drunk injures the absent thus does drunkenness act in direct contradiction to reason whose business it is to clear the mind of every vice which is crept into it and to guard it against all the approaches of any that endeavors to make its entrance but besides these ill effects which this vice produces in the person who is actually under its dominion it has also a bad influence on the mind even in its sober moments as it insensibly weakens the understanding impairs the memory and makes those faults habitual which are produced by frequent excesses serino was well aware of this and therefore strictly guarded against all excesses of this kind another prevailing vice of the age which he kept at a distance from and was extremely uneasy when in any company where it was practiced was the modish rant of oaths and imprecations it being an ungenteel dialect as well as unchristian and clashes both with the rules of breeding and the gospel the folly of them is thus admirably described by a considerable master of learning and language custom indeed  says he has made them fashionable but neither civil nor lawful for vice can never plead prescription i know it lies under the protection of numbers and quality but ill things have no right to sanctuary because vermin swarm must they be permitted to increase shall the number of felons plead for pardon no no the customariness of ill things makes them worse and the more they must be discountenanced and taught discipline in a word whatever jars with religion and cuts upon good breeding is below a gentleman and therefore in spite of example and practice i must caution young gentlemen against some parts of english civility for though they go for consent in the english dominions they will not bear the test of other nations for example damn ye says one i am glad to see you is not this a quaint salutation first to pack me away to hell and then protest he is glad to see me so conveniently lodged what provision will these blades make for their enemies if they place their friends so untowardly certainly they fancy hell is a fine seat and that the damned are in a fair way of promotion damn ye ye dog how do do cries another this feat compliment implies damnation and transformation too it is a compound of curse and raillery i am plunged into hell dashed out of the list of rationals and then with a taunt asked how i do why a man in fire and brimstone is not altogether at his ease and a reasonable creature cursed into a dog not very fond of the metamorphosis a third very ungenteelly accosts a friend he has not perhaps seen of a twelvemonth ye son of a whore where have you been this is an english address to a tittle it is a kind of staple commodity of the nation and like our wool must not be transported under pain of confiscation but surely we need not lay so severe an embargo on the ware for it is ten to one twill never find vent in any other nation on this side of the canaries a handful of dirt well applied is as civil a compliment though not quite so cleanly son of a whore there is abundance of freedom in the expression but not a grain of breeding unless you measure behavior by the dialect of billingsgate and the beargarden certainly these gentlemen are admirers of charity why else do they dignify whoredom for whore stands for a mark of quality a distinguishing character otherwise the salutation would appear coarse and homely but by their leave few are in love with crossbars and to be brother to a byeblow is to be a bastard once removed i know we fling a veil on these expressions and wash over their foulness with fair pretenses damn ye says one and son of a whore stand merely for ciphers or only serve to enliven a period and to make the expression more blustering i confess whore and damnation are near akin and often go together but for all that the silliness of the excuse cannot stifle the monstrous incivility of the compliment for though it signifies nothing to him who receives it in good time it will signify much to him who spoke it for though a friend may let such curses fall to the ground god will put them to account and though they stand for ciphers in england they may purchase eternal torments in hell they are says another marks of english familiarity pure sallies of kindness and demonstrations of friendship no doubt to deliver over to satan an old acquaintance without asking his consent to the conveyance is freedom with a vengeance but at which end of the compliment is his kindness in short such expressions grate the organ and turn the very faculty of hearing into a burden they are high symptoms of a lewd inclination and of a depraved complexion for when the breath smells rank the stomach is infected in short such a jargon is a breach of civility it is a rustic cant an uncredirable dialect nor is the whole posse of bullies able to enoble it persons of great fortunes are tempted to pride and haughtiness therefore serino labored by all means to obtain that excellent virtue of humility and was so happy as not to miss of his design nor lose his labor for i believe no man in his circumstances was ever of a more meek and humble spirit there is an admirable sentence in holy writ which says that pride was not made for man there is not indeed any single view of human nature under its present condition which is not sufficient to extinguish in us all the secret seeds of pride and on the contrary to sink the soul into the lowest state of humility and what the schoolmen call selfannihilation there is nothing in his understanding his will or in his present condition that can tempt any considerate creature to pride or vanity and yet the very reasons why he should not be proud are notwithstanding the reasons why he is so were he not a sinful creature he would not be subject to a passion which rises from the depravity of his nature were he not an ignorant creature he would see he has nothing to be proud of and were not the whole species miserable he would not have those wretched objects of comparison before his eyes which are the occasions of this passion and make one man value himself more than another but methinks the instability of human affairs the turns and vicissitudes of fortune and the sudden falls from the most swollen ambition are subjects which ought to discountenance pride shakespeare has an admirable passage on this head spoken by wolsey in henry viii which serino used often to repeat farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man today he puts forth the tender leaves of hope tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders this many a summer in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me   he had improved his natural parts which were indeed extraordinary not only by hard studies but also by his travels upon his return from which he often with an inexpressible pleasure would repeat the following ode for which the polite world is obliged to the incomparable mr addison i how are thy servants blessed o lord how sure is their defense eternal wisdom is their guide their help omnipotence ii in foreign realms and lands remote supported by thy care through burning climes i passed unhurt and breathed in tainted air iii thy mercy sweetened every soil made every region please the hoary alpinehills it warmed and smoothed the tyrrheneseas iv think o my soul devoutly think how with affrighted eyes thou saw the wide extended deep in all its horrors rise v confusion dwelt in every face and fear in every heart when waves on waves and gulphs on gulphs oercame the pilots art vi yet then from all my griefs o lord thy mercy set me free whilst in the confidence of prayer my soul took hold on thee vii for though in dreadful whirles we hung high on the broken wave i knew thou were not slow to hear nor impotent to save viii the storm was laid the winds retired obedient to thy will the sea that roared at thy command at thy command was still ix in midst of dangers fears and death thy goodness i will adore and praise thee for thy mercies past and humbly hope for more x my life if thou preservst my life thy sacrifice shall be and death if death must be my doom shall join my soul to thee in fine serino was a person in whom united virtues shone with promiscuous beauty his fortitude his chastity his prudence were as remarkable as his temperance and humility but above all charity was the virtue that constantly shone with superior brightness and gave a charming luster to all his actions a few weeks before his death he sent a thousand guineas to the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts which design he always looked upon as most noble and excellent at the same time he observed that the scandalous divisions of christians was a great hindrance to that good work how pernicious is it would he often say to hear such a variety of contrary opinions maintained in christendom and the belief of most of them imposed on us by their zealous propagators under pain of eternal damnation should a poor indian desirous to be instructed in the mysteries of the gospel make his application to one of the society of jesus as the most proper person to give him information in those weighty matters since he not only goes under the common name of a christian but as one peculiarly devoted to the service of his great master is styled a jesuit a servant of the blessed jesus we will suppose the jesuit to acquaint him with the dignity and glory of the roman catholic church and particularly of his holiness the pope who as st peters successor is as he tells him appointed by christ whose vicegerent and representative he is to be the infallible head of the christian world and center of gospelunity that all are bound to obey him and disobedience to his injunctions is no less a crime than a rebellion against the authority of heaven he farther informs him of that inconceivable mystery of transubstantiation and assures him that in the blessed sacrament of the altar he may eat the real flesh of his redeemer and swallow down the deity he is about to adore he will doubtless give him some instructions concerning the adoration of saints and angels and the veneration due to images and relics the new convert may likewise hear the doctrines of purgatory auricular confession and indulgences repeated to him with great earnestness and solemnity the poor man having thus patiently attended to a long discourse of the christian religion goes away rejoicing and blesses the happy moment in which he became acquainted with such sublime and charming mysteries and was made sensible of the darkness and ignorance of his former state in which he had been so often debased by the most stupid and idolatrous practices but supposing this convert to fall into the company of some learned protestants and hear them dispute of matters of faith how very much surprised must he needs be to find that a great part of those doctrines which he had so eagerly and joyfully embraced were not indeed the dictates of christ or his followers but the wretched and empty contrivances of crafty politicians that the beauteous and lovely system which he viewed with the deepest pleasure and admiration dissolves and is lost in air and he can see no more the transient beauties of his glorious vision now what shall this man do continue in his present faith he cannot with any satisfaction since he has heard such evident reasons against it and suppose he resolves to forsake his first scheme and attend to the instructions of a protestant guide there are such various opinions even amongst them that he is in doubt which party to apply himself to whilst with trembling he hears them loudly condemning each other serino did not take notice of this with any design to favor a skeptical humor or a certain awkard method of ranging ones thoughts which is newly called by an evident catechresis freethinking his aim was only to know the dismal effects of divisions in the church of christ which as they proceed from a scandalous neglect of the plainest rules of the gospel so might they be effectually cured would christians but read and consider those earnest exhortations to meekness and unity with half that calmness in which they were delivered by the glorious author of our salvation could they but once be persuaded to lay aside their furious and inordinate passions to quit their corrupt and sinister designs would they but make themselves so happy as to resolve to value a plain direction of our blessed lord before a thousand quaint glosses and needless injunctions then would joy and peace abound and everblooming beauties adorn the sacred temple the winter being thus happily past and the rain over and gone the time of singingbirds would soon commence and every christian be refreshed with the charming music of the turtle but the circumstances of our mourning family call for my presence i can therefore only add that when he was apprehensive of approaching death instead of sinking in sorrow he entertained himself with recounting the many mercies he had received through his whole life and called me to him to read a hymn composed by the inimitable mr addison under an indisposition and when i came to this verse o how shall words with equal warmth the gratitude declare that glows within my ravished heart but thou can read it there he desired me to repeat it and seemed transported with the fervours of grateful devotion he was also then well pleased to hear me read the whole to him i when rising from the bed of death overwhelmed with guilt and fear i see my maker face to face o how shall i appear ii if yet while pardon may be found and mercy may be sought my heart with inward horror shrinks and trembles at the thought iii when thou o lord shall stand disclosed in majesty severe and sit in judgment on my soul o how shall i appear iv but thou have told the troubled soul who does her sins lament the timely tribute of her tears shall endless woe prevent v then see the sorrows of my heart ever yet it be too late and add my saviors dying groans to give those sorrows weight vi for never shall my soul despair her pardon to procure who knows thy only son has died to make that pardon sure in a word he lived as i fain would live and he died as i fain would die by his last will he left abundance of charitable legacies and has given the bulk of his estate to a young gentleman whose misfortunes had been represented to him as very particular and though he was not acquainted with him yet reflected with pleasure some days before he died on the agreeable surprise which the young gentleman would be in at the hearing such welcome news   phil pray sir whereabouts dwells the gentleman who is thus unexpectedly master of so considerable an estate   chapl in a little village about twelve miles off his name is philindus   phil are you sure of that sir   chapl yes one of our family is gone this morning to acquaint him with it   phil he will not find him at home for according to your description i must be the very man i do earnestly desire you to continue with me as you did with serino and if at any time you see me acting contrary to his bright example be so kind as to give me those severe reproofs which are due to negligence and ingratitude and now since after all my trouble and sorrow there begins to rise a new and brighter scene i hope always to retain the most tender and grateful sentiments of the divine compassion and cannot forbear expressing myself in the beautiful expressions of the royal psalmist as paraphrased by mr addison to whom we owe all the poetic beauties that have ran through our discourse i the lord my pasture shall prepare and feed me with a shepherds care his presence shall my wants supply and guard me with a watchful eye my noonday walks he shall attend and all my midnight hours defend ii when in the sultry glebe i faint or on the thirsty mountain pant to fertile vales and dewy meads my weary wandering steps he leads where peaceful rivers soft and slow amid the verdant landscape flow iii though in the paths of death i tread with gloomy horrors overspread my steadfast heart shall fear no ill for thou o lord art with me still thy friendly crook shall give me aid and guide me through the dreadful shade iv though in a bare and rugged way through devious lonely wilds i stray thy bounty shall my wants beguile thy barren wilderness shall smile with sudden greens and herbage crowned and streams shall murmur all around    finis
