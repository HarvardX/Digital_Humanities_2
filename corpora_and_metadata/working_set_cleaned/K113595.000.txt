the haunch of venison a poetical epistle to lord clare  price one shilling and sixpence  entered at stationers hall  portrait of oliver goldsmith  the haunch of venison a poetical epistle to lord clare  by the late dr goldsmith  with a head of the author drawn by henry bunbury esquire and etched by bretherton  london printed for j ridley in st jamess street and g kearsly in fleet street mdcclxxvi  to lord clare thanks my lord for your venson for finer or fatter never ranged in a forest or smokd on a platter the haunch was a picture for painters to study the white was so white and the red was so ruddy i had thoughts in my chamber to hang it in view to be shown to my friends as a piece of virtu as in some irish houses where things are soso one gammon of bacon hangs up for a show but for eating a rasher of what they take pride in they would as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in but hold  let us pause  dont i hear you pronounce this tale of the bacon a damnable bounce well suppose it a bounce sure a poet may try by a bounce now and then to get courage to fly but my lord it is no bounce i protest in my turn it is a truth and your lordship may ask mr burn to go on with my tale  as i gazed on the haunch thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch so i cut it and sent it to reynolds undrest to paint it or eat it just as he liked best of the neck and the breast i had next to dispose twas a neck and a breast  that might rival monroes but in parting with these i was puzzled again with the how and the who and the where and the when there is coley and williams and howard and hiff  i think they love venson i know they love beef but  hang it  to poets that seldom can eat your very good muttons a very good treat such dainties to them it would look like a flirt like sending em ruffles when wanting a shirt while thus i debated in reverie centered an acquaintance a friend  as he called himself entered a finespoken customhouse officer he who smiled as he gazed on the venson and me  what have we got here  aye this is good eating  your own i suppose  or is it in waiting why whose should it be sir cried i with a flounce i get these things often  but that was a bounce  if that be the case then cried he very gay  i am glad i have taken this house in my way  tomorrow you take a poor dinner with me  no words  i insist on it  precisely at three  and now that i think on it as i am a sinner  we wanted this venson to make up the dinner  i will take no denial  you shall and you must  and my wife little kitty is famous for crust  well have johnson and burke all the wits will be there  my acquaintance is slight or i would ask my lord clare  here porter this venson with me to mileend   no words my dear goldsmith my very good friend thus seizing his hat he brushed off like the wind and the porter and eatables followed behind left alone to reflect having emptied my shelf and nobody with me at sea but myself though i could not help thinking my gentleman hasty yet johnson and burke and a good venson pasty were things that i never disliked in my life though clogged with a coxcomb and kitty his wife so next day in due splendour to make my approach i drove to his door in my own hackneycoach when come to the place where we all were to dine a chairlumberd closet just twelve feet by nine my friend bid me welcome but struck me quite dumb with tidings that johnson and burke could not come  and i knew it he cried both eternally fail  the one at the house and the other with thrale  but i warrant for me we shall make up the party  with two full as clever and ten times as hearty  the one is a scotchman the other a jew  who dabble and write in the papers  like you  the one writes the snarler the other the scourge  some think he writes cinna  he owns to panurge while thus he described them by trade and by name they entered and dinner was served as they came at the top a fried liver and bacon was seen at the bottom was tripe in a swinging terrene at the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot in the middle  a place where the venson was not now my lord as for tripe it is my utter aversion and your bacon i hate like a turk or a persian but what vexed me most was that damned scottish rogue with his longwinded speeches and smiles and his brogue  and madam says he may this bit be my poison  if a prettier dinner i ever set eyes on  pray a slice of your liver  but may i be cursed  but i have eat of your tripe till i am ready to burst your tripe quoth the jew if the truth i may speak i could eat of this tripe seven days in the week i like these here dinners so pretty and small but your friend there the doctor eats nothing at all  o ho quoth my friend he will come on in a trice  he is keeping a corner for something that is nice  there is a pasty  a pasty returned the scot i dont care if i keep a corner for thot  well all keep a corner the lady cried out well all keep a corner was echoed about while thus we resolved and the pasty delayed with looks quite astonishing entered the maid a visage so sad and so pale with affright waked priam by drawing his curtains by night but too soon we found out for who could mistake her that she came with some terrible news from the baker and so it fell out for that negligent sloven had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven sad philomel thus  but let similes drop and now that i think on it the story may stop to be plain my good lord it is but labor misplaced to send such good verses to one of your taste you have got an odd something a kind of discerning a relish a taste sickend over by learning at least it is your temper it is very well known that you think very slightly of all that is your own so perhaps in your habits of thinking amiss you may make a mistake  and think slightly of this the end epitaph this tomb inscribed to gentle parnels name may speak our gratitude but not his fame what heart but feels his sweetlymoral lay that leads to truth through pleasures flowery way celestial themes confessed his tuneful aid and heaven that lent him genius was repaid needless to him the tribute we bestow the transitory breath of fame below more lasting rapture from his works shall rise while converts thank their poet in the skies from the oratorio of the captivity by dr goldsmith song the wretch condemned with life to part still still on hope relies and every pang that rends the heart bids expectation rise hope like the glimring tapers light adorns and chears the way and still as darker grows the night emits a brighter ray song i o memory thou fond deceiver still importunate and vain to former joys recurring ever and turning all the past to pain ii thou like the world the oppressed oppressing thy smiles increase the wretchs woe and he who wants each other blessing in thee must ever find a foe
