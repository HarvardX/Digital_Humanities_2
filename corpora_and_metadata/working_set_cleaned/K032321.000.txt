golden bible next paulsgraveheadcourt without temple bar   0   to samuel brown esquire of stockinghall in rutland sir young authors like young wives are liable to distrust their own conduct in every thing and whilst they fear venturing too far are apt to stop short and rob their benefactors of those acknowledgments they justly deserve or by useing too loose a rein unavoidably run into adulation but i need fear neither of these censures since your modesty which is so conspicuous will pardon one and your character be a sufficient defense against the other for it is impossible to say more of you than you deserve  to attempt your character would be too daring an undertaking for what pen besides your own could express that just thought lively fancy flowing and easy language that adorn those pieces which like inestimable jewels too valuable for common use are reserved for the entertainment of your happy friends your luckly genius in poetry and your peculiar taste for music proclaim you the muses darling for you they reserve their choicest favors and indeed without such qualifications no man can have a true relish for productions of this kind and the most excellent pieces would be entertained with coldness and contempt  how i have performed in the following scenes is neither possible nor proper for me to determine it is praise enough that you have given me leave to lay it at your feet which i prefer before the vain applause of clapping multitudes nor could i ever excuse it either to the world or my self if i slipped any opportunity of publishing the honor you do me it is a vanity we are all liable to and we glory in the excellencies of our patron besides the advantage it is a piece of justice due to this poem and my self to fly for sanctuary to one who is most apt to pardon because the most capable to judge and has himself not only approved but also by his inimitable performance corrected and refined upon the most pleasant parts of poetry  to conculde sir for i would above all things avoid being too prolix give me leave to join my hearty wishes with the rest of mankind for your long continuing as you are a great incourager and principle ornament of all

fiddlers at his heels as a general officers at his lovee   col whose attendance is better rewarded i fancy no doubt they taste the fruits of their labors sweetly   toper imy conscience i believe they

questions prithee have some pity and spare me a little   em dear cousin do you pity me and answer me a little   clar i have answered you these three days you have been in town more questions than all the astrologes and philomaths in london could resolve in a month   em and i have as many more to ask before i can be satisfied i would fain know the cause of all this alteration why so much uneasinels and so much spleen never pleased but when you are displeased nor like your company but when you are alone in short i have observed    clar what have you observed cousin   em why that your father is never well but when talking to you of sir william nor you pleased but when you are thinking of some body else   clar oh howinquisitive are girls   em oh how reserved are lovers   clar prithee cousin learn to be more serious   em prithee cousin learn to be more free   clar then you positively believe i am in love   em positively   clar and with    em anotherguessd man than your father designs for you   clar and nothing    em will persuade me to the contrary   clar why then i am and since it is in vain to hide it from you emilia i will try you with that confidence i hitherto thought you too young for   em alas she little thinks i have as great intrigues of my own as any she can trust me with though i have been but three days in town aside   clar i am as you see cousin besieged night and day by two as different as night and day one in the head of innumerable fopperies and insolences attacks me with the assurance of a conqueror before he enters the field being supported by the harsh authority of a rigid father the other after a thousand obsequious demonstrations of love at respectful distance courts to be admitted mine rather than seeks to have me his   em imy conscience were it my case i should not be at a stand which to choose there being such apparent difference   clar nay there is more yet for one is generous and brave the other cowardly and pitiful one judicious the other impetinent one constt other whimsical one a man of sense the other a blockead one admired by all the other ridiculed by all   em one i suppose is the gentleman that gave the serenade sir william of whom i have heard so much since i came to town but the other clarinda i fear is no where to be found such men appear but as they say the phoenix does not above one in an age   clar and that ours has one in him the judicious part of mankind bears me witness   em lovers clarinda like people in motion fancy every thing they see moves as they do and may be from the knowledge of your own principles and resolutions you from your notion of his  now could i almost find in my heart to discover my own intrigue ittwere only to let her see there are men that equal if not exceed hers but that i am ashamed of its forwardness in so snort a time aside but how comes it cousin that we never see this man   clar before you came to town my father forbid him the house with any farther pretentions to me upon sir williams account to whom his honor was engaged before he saw him or else i believe his follies would have outweighd his estate for he you know    em i know too much of him for i have seen him   clar so you have the other too he was one of the two that bowed to us the other night from the sidebox and of whom you have since been so inquisitive though i never let you into the secret till now   em of one of those i know a secret which believe you are a stranger to and which i would not for the world discover till i know more on it aside if that be he i like him as well as you can but i think a gentleman of sir williams estate should not seem to contemptible   clar o dear cousin dont name him or besides the particular aversion i have for him twould beget in the world a very slender opinion of my sense should i encourage such a fop   em o quite contrary for women of sense strive to distinguish themselves by their choice of asses fit to bear their burdens besides cousin if you hate him you can never get it in your power to torment him more than by marrying him   clar that would be making my self uneasy purely to trouble another no no i must have some contrivance to expose him and our neighbor mrs plotwell shall help me in it   em does that lady still continue her persecution of ops   clar with as much address and success as ever and her pleasant accounts of her feigned intreagues makes her very entertaining company she hates sir william mode and i am sure will assist in any thing i never had a stronger temptation to disobedience than now love and merit plead on manlys side reason too approves my choice the others an empty nothing a mere talker well show his right side expose him shall we not my dear   em with all my heart i love mischief so well i can

oath is in my opinion as undecent as wearing his cloths and to be in the road of the vulgar is beneath a gentleman who in my judgment ought to be as much distinguished by his expressions as by his coach and livery   cap bell right sir for since every body that has money enough sets up an equipage a gentleman ought to sind out some other way of distinguishing himself   sir will of my conscience they will ape us in that too for they ape so proud of following their betters that they even tread upon their heels not a formal cit or awkard lawyers clerk that on cour the cookwench a quarter for

clothes ha ha ha the law makes better provision for mens live   sir will the law should make better provision for mens clothes too for the insolence of the vulgar is insufferable and if one or two of them were made examples the rest would be more cautious  one night after play i waited on a lady from the box to her coach comes a clumsy cit with a paultry mask out of the gallery rushed against me threw down the ladies page brusht all the powder out of my wig then cried ha ha ha we have ruined the beau had i been a lord i would have run him through the guts but to be tried by a iddlesexjury is the devil   top ay  these vulgar as you call them have a greater respect for mens lives than to suffer that man to escape that kills one of them but i suppose your principle concern rises from your loss of the ladies favor   sir will it had no such essect on her i assure you sir wherever i get sooting in a ladies esteem i stand too firm to be justled out by a cit as for instance i will give you another adventure of mine being engaged by appointment to meet a lady at vvhites and detained by some extraordinary business the lady chanced to be there in her coach as soon as i arrived in mine so that lighting out of my coach to go to hers a nasty fellow running just against me almost beat me backward and though he did it designedly yet cried zounds cannot you see your wig blinds you does it

when she has been in it and as soon as my back has been turned she has always taken an occasion to commend me and say something extraordinary in my praise which my landlady never failed to tell me but

their perfection are by nature cowards fooish useles fools made men by tayors and by women fools a fckle false a singing dancing crew nay now we hear they have smiling masters too just now a frenchman in the dressing room from teaching of a beau to smile was come he showed five giea  warnt he rarely paid thus all the world by smiles are once betrayed the states man smiles on them he would undo the courtiers smies are very seldom true the lovers smiles too many do believe and women smile on them they would deceive when tradesmen smile they safely cheat with ease and smiling lawyers never fail of fees  the doctors look the patients pain beguiles the sick man lives if the physician smiles thus smiles with interest hand in hand do go he surest strikes that smiling gives the blow poets with us this proverb do defy we live by smiles for if you frown we die to please you then shall be our chief endeavor and all we ask is but your smiles for ever going hold  i forget the author bid me say she humbly begs protection for her play it is yours  she dedicates it to you all and sure youre too generous to let it fall she hopes the ladies will her cause maintain since virtue here has been her only aim the beaux she thinks will not fail to do her right since here they are taught with safety how to fight she is sure of favor from the men of war a soldier is her darling character to fear their mrmrs then would be absurd they only mutiny when not preferred but et i see she does your fury dread and like a prisoner stands with fear half dead while you are judges do her sentence give  youre not pleatd she says she cannot live let my petition then for once prevail and let your generous claps her pardon seal
