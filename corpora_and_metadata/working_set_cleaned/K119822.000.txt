the legal means of political reformation proposed in two small tracts viz  the first on equitable representation and the legal means of obtaining it  the second on  annual parliaments the ancient and most salutary right of the people  the third edition  the legal means of political reformation never were the baneful effects of undue influence more sensibly felt or more generally acknowledged than at present  the legal means of curbing this dangerous evil are proposed in two little tracts presented with this paper the one points out a legal mode of obtaining a more equal representation of the commons the other demonstrates the ancient popular right of holding newelected parliaments every year once and more often if need be and the sum of both jointly considered may be included in the following short proposition  that a more equal representation of the commons in annual parliaments i e elected every year once and more often if need be is not only an ancient but even an indispensable right of the people that this ancient constitution is indispensable the many fatal effects of deviating from it have rendered sufficiently obvious and therefore no remedy can be more efficacious and constitutionally natural than a revival of that primitive and fundamental right according to the rule of law that as often as any thing is doubtful or corrupted we should recur to first principles lofts elements of law no   and we have no reason to expect that the petition and resolutions of the truly respectable and loyal county of york though highly worthy of being adopted by the other counties or indeed any other true principles of reformation will be admitted and rendered effectual by the legislature until the several counties themselves shall reassume this their ancient and constitutional right of being more equally represented in new annual parliaments  equitable representation necessary to the establishment of law peace and good government shown in some extracts from mr prynnes brevia parliamentaria rediviva printed in      and dedicated to k charles ii  relative to examples of joint elections for knights citizens and burgesses for whole counties by the same

with some occasional remarks concerning the necessity as well as the means of promoting a more equal representation of the commons in parliament mr prynne informs us in p     that in sundry counties the elections of knights citizens and burgesses were anciently made all together in the county court of the shire on the same day and all returned together in and by one indenture between the sheriffs

testimonium etc  there is the like indenture says mr prynne for wiltshire where the knights citizens and burgesses are jointly elected and returned together an   hen v  remarks etc the circumstances of those ancient times are so totally different in many respects from the present times that it is difficult to determine whether any such joint elections of knights citizens and burgesses by the united equal suffrages of all the electors together of every degree in each county can now be made and of course it is doubtful whether such a measure is even advisable many laws have since been enacted respecting elections all of which must first be well weighed and considered for if any thing therein is incompatible with the necessary alterations it must be repealed by the same authority which ordained it because non est recedendum a forma per statutum prescripta and again nil temere novandum est  yet as the injustice and fatal consequences of the present enormous inequality of representation in favor of petty venal boroughs to the disadvantage of the counties and great cities is notorious and undeniable some prudent remedy is surely become necessary and ought to be most earnestly sought after by all lovers of peace and good government  the ruinous effects of a long continued parliamentary corruption and of its baneful companion national reprobacy which is the sure harbinger of public misfortune and approaching slavery have made such hasty advances of late that many people begin to be alarmed and to talk seriously concerning the necessity of endeavoring to obtain a more equal representation of the commons in annual parliaments as the true legal means of restoring public credit and of saving the state such a disposition toward parliamentary reformation i have perceived in several places amongst people who have not the least connection with each other so that it seems to be the most natural and obvious conclusion of common sense upon the present alarming state of public affairs and will probably if matters should grow worse become more and more general till the measure be irresistibly demanded by the voice of the people in which case all those persons who have been most concerned in the management of the public treasury must expect to undergo a severe scrutiny or if any sudden invasion of our natural enemies should be really intended which there is but too much reason to suspect the people it is to be feared as soon as they are informed of the public danger will be so transported with sudden indignation against particular persons whose measures may seem to have contributed to the national weakness that they will not easily be restrained from violent and inconsiderate acts of personal resentment and it is not at all probable that the people will be thoroughly or sufficiently united to act against the common enemy until they have taken such steps as they may think effectual to insure a reformation of government in case their endeavors against the common enemy should prove successful and to prevent the like calamities in future  those stateministers therefore who shall have sufficient courage to give up in time all reliance on undue parliamentary influence and shall prove that their regard for good and legal government is sincere by promoting some legal means of restoring to the electors of counties and great cities their due proportion of representation and consequence in the great national assembly those ministers i say howsoever their former measures may have been disliked will by such a proof of their sincerity in reformation insure to themselves the public esteem and confidence for there is a general disposition in englishmen to overlook all differences of opinion in politics and to forget all party animosities against those persons who by a change of conduct give proofs of a future regard for popular and constitutional rights and the almost certain advantages to the crown by adopting and promoting such a measure will be the recovery of a great and extensive empire memorandum these remarks were written in march      the author had previously informed a nobleman in administration that the americans were inclined to a reunion even under the crown on constitutional principles provided his majestys ministers could give a proof of their sincerity in treating by adopting some legal means of political reformation at home and that the proper constitutional terms consistent with the natural rights of british subjects would certainly be accepted if tendered within two or three months but that no terms short of independency would or could be accepted after the expiration of six months from that time the desire of pointing out such a plan of reformation as might be suitable to the proposed reunion occasioned these remarks for no ground of accommodation will be so effectual and certain as such a proof of sincerity in the sovereign that he desires to rule his subjects at home according to the strictest rule of legal and constitutional principles and is willing to drop all measures or designs which cannot obtain the uninfluenced assent of his great national council and the kings ministers are never answerable for measures howsoever unsuccessful after the same have obtained the sanction of a free and uninfluenced parliament by such righteousness as this the throne shall be established whereas an obstinate perseverance and continuance in the contrary mode of administration will of course occasion what is vainly called a statenecessity for advancing still farther in violent and unpopular measures which like the case of richard ii but the king was not satisfied with these repeated declarations he thought his power and dignity very precarious while it depended on the authority of parliament he dreaded the popular party and the effects of opposition and resistance which he had so lately experienced and could not bear the restraint which these apprehensions laid him under his whole views therefore were from this time directed to one end to set himself above all opposition and resistance first by making peace and gaining firm alliance abroad and then by establishing an uncontrollable power at home in consequence of this design he entered with more earnestness upon a treaty of peace with france etc see the learned bishop lowths life of william of wykeham p     king richards obstinate perseverance in such erroneous and dangerous notions produced those very evils of which he was most afraid viz the loss of his crown his liberty and his life for the machiavelian policy of his ministers in promoting parliamentary corruption and in maintaining a standing army of cheshire timeservers served only to precipitate the monarchs destruction and to hasten the revolution must inevitably end in destruction no reformation however can be safely made respecting a more equal representation of the commons until the mode of doing it has been first adopted and approved by the majority of the electors themselves in each county but when their consent is once obtained the ostensible proposers and promoters of the measure will be amply secured from all blame in case the alteration should not prove effectual and on the other hand they will certainly enjoy the principal credit of the amendment in case the measure should be found to answer the desirable purpose  the king might safely signify in a speech to his parliament or by proclamation his earnest desire to be more accurately informed of the sentiments of his people and that he therefore wishes to promote by legal and constitutional means a more equal representation of all persons who are at present entitled to vote for knights citizens and burgesses in parliament that elections may be made in an equitable and just proportion to the numbers of those who vote for each denomination without lessening the total number of representatives sent up at present from each county and he might refer the consideration of the most just and unexceptionable means of doing this to the very persons whose rights are concerned by authorizing his sheriffs to summon grandjuries in their respective counties to consider and propose the most equitable mode of sending the present number of knights citizens and burgesses for each county in an equal proportion to the whole number of electors and afterward to submit the result of their consultation to a generalcourt or assembly of all the electors in each county for their assent or amendment or to a chosen committee appointed by a majority of all the said electors that shall think fit to attend the assembly agreeably to the first example in the indenture for the county of kent wherein the twelve persons named in the indenture are said to have chosen eligerunt the two knights for the county and four citizens for canterbury and rochester for it is manifest that the twelve persons named acted only in trust as a committee for the electors of the whole county because the election is expressly declared to have been made assensu totius comitatus illius by the assent of the whole county and in the other example for the county of wilts wherein only twentysix persons named in the indenture are said to have chosen sixteen representatives viztwo knights two citizens and twelve burgesses in one joint election yet we must not consider the said twentysix persons as the only electors but rather as an acting committee empowered by the whole body of electors in that county for though the words assensu totius comitatus illius are omitted yet the beginning of the indenture expressly informs us that it was made  in pleno com wiltes tento in plain shire  or full county meaning a full county court of wilts holden etc  etc and likewise it is not improbable that the said twentysix electors who are expressly named in the indenture with the sheriff but exaltera part were considered as the manucaptors or sureties for the appearance of the elected which will account for their making the indenture with the sheriff for no manucaptors are mentioned as such in these indentures though the appointment and express mention of manucaptors were generally esteemed a necessary precaution in those ancient times of which more shall be said hereafter  the most obvious means of reformation are either to divide each county into so many equal districts as may most conveniently be represented by     or   deputies so as to include the whole number now sent from each county or else to choose the whole number of knights citizens and burgesses by the joint suffrages of all the electors together at the county court agreeably to the ancient examples already cited by these regulations indeed the boroughvoters might complain that they would be injured by losing a large proportion of their borough representation that is they would certainly lose that unreasonable proportion of representation which is injurious to the rights and freedom of their neighbors but they would be so far from losing any just and equitable right really due to themselves that they would actually gain thereby a right of voting for all the knights and citizens as well as for all the other deputed burgesses of their respective counties to which at present as mere burgesses of one borough they have no pretense the experience also of late years has shown that it is become necessary to enforce the ancient laws which ordain that both the electors and the elected shall be in eodem comitatu commorantes et residentes  in the same county dwelling and resident that the knights of the shires within our kingdom of england to be chosen to come to the parliaments from henceforth to be holden should be chosen in every county by men dwelling and residing in the same county etc and that they who are to be chosen be likewise dwelling and residing in the same counties etc quod milites com infra regnum nostrum angl eligend adveniend in parl ex tunc tenend eligantur in quolibet com per homines in eodem com commorantes et residentes etc  et quod illi qui eligendi fuerint sint similiter in eisdem com commorantes et residentes etc extract from the copy of a writ in p     of prynnes second part of a brief register etc of parl writs see also an act of parliament to the same purpose which is still in force viz   henry v chap   and also to renew the ancient custom of obliging the persons elected to find sureties or manucaptors beforementioned for their appearance and constant attendance  constant attendance being sometimes expressly required by the writs the king to the sheriff of kent greeting  forasmuch as on certain difficult and urgent affairs etc we have appointed our parliament to be holden at westminster on the day etc  we command you strictly enjoining that you cause to be chosen of the aforesaid county two knights gift with swords etc and of every city of the same county two citizens and of every borough two burgesses of the best and most able and most discreet knights citizens and burgesses of the county cities and boroughs aforesaid and cause them to come to westminster on the day etc there and then during the aforesaid parliament continually to remain etc rex vic kanc salutem  quia super quibusdam arduis et urgentibus negotiis etc parliamentum nostrum apud westminster die etc  tenere ordinavimus etc tibi praecipimus

moraturos etc prynnes  d part of a brief register etc p  0   the usual old forms says prynne elsewhere being to retorn on the back of the writ or a cedule nomina militum manucaptores i s militis man n f militis or alterius militis or that two persons were elected milites or duos milites naming both their christian and sirnames of the county of b and that such and such were their manucaptors they having for the most part two four some six manucaptors apiece that they should appear at the day and place appointed in the writ some few of them now and then refused to find manucaptors whereupon their goods and cattle were destreined to cause them to appear in parliament at the time and place prescribed by the writs etc prynnes brevia parliamentaria rediviva p     so that men of known abilities and integrity howsoever fond of their own ease and private amusements might then be compelled to serve their country in parliament though their electors were also compelled to pay them wages and perhaps the renewal of both these ancient usages would contribute much to the national welfare that useful talents of private gentlemen might neither be unemployed nor unrewarded  in order to prevent such shameful and unmeaning secessions from public business as have lately been made by the gentlemen in opposition to ministry as well as by many who profess to be the ministers friends a parliament so far reformed viz by having an equal representation of all the electors in each county might be well qualified to consider of some farther regulations to render the representation of the counties themselves more equal and proportionate with respect to each other according to the number of inhabitants for in ancient times all men in each county that were free howsoever poor enjoyed a share in the legislature which may be clearly proved by the very act of parliament    henry vi cap vii whereby the right of voting was limited to those who have land or tenement to the value of forty shillings by the year at the least etc the preamble of this act however sufficiently proves the fact that all the common people thought themselves entitled to vote at elections for knights of shires whereas the elections of knights of shires to come to the parliaments of our lord the king in many counties of the realm of england have now of late been made by very great outrageous it is very easy to give hard epithets without proofs of their propriety and truth and excessive number of people dwelling within the same counties etc of the which most part was of people of small substance and of no value the value of our christian brethren before god both in church and state is inestimable for all christians that are not convicted of crimes ought surely to be equally esteemed the adopted brethren of christ and members of that everlasting building the church of god whereby they are entitled to judge not only of things in the present world but also in that which is to come for if they shall hereafter have authority even to judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life   cor vi   for herein consists that natural equality of all christians which some political writers affct to deny whereof every of them pretended a voice equivalent as to such elections to be made with the most worthy knights and esquires dwelling within the same counties whereby manslaughter riots batteries and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties shall very likely rise and be unless convenient and due remedy be provided etc but the inconveniences here alleged for which the iniquitous remedy of depriving the common people of their right of voting at county elections was provided deserve to be no otherwise esteemed than as so many mere imaginary pretenses to excuse the injustice of the act for if any such manslaughter riots batteries etc had ever been really occasioned by the former popular elections the framers of this act would not have failed to cite the examples for they could not say that any such mischiefs had ever happened before that time but only that they shall very likely rise and be  unless convenient and due remedy be provided whereas since their iniquitous remedy has taken place all these baneful circumstances do notoriously attend it though the framers of the act could not cite a single example of such mischief before that unhappy alteration  it is therefore high time to repeal that act which unjustly deprived them of that right  the nation has severely felt the bad effects of that unjust innovation witness the present iniquitous practices at contested elections and the helpless and endless manner of adjusting them besides the ruinous expense of influencing a majority when chosen which at present is considered as a measure of state necessity and compare these modern corruptions with the happy manner of conducting elections in general for near two hundred years before that period as related by prynne in his brev parl rediv p      sundry persons of eminency quality parts and wisdom says he in most counties were elected knights of the shire by the unanimous consent of the gentry freeholders and people not only twice or thrice but              0 times or more after another to serve in parliaments without any emulation polling feasting or canvassing for voices or future complaints contests about their elections polls undue or double retorns which of late times have disturbed the counties peace and interrupted the parliaments proceedings there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of from    hen iii till    edw iv for ought that appears by the retornes or parliament rolls and not so much as one double retorn or indenture wherewith all the late bundles prynne wrote in the reign of king charles ii and the corruption has notoriously increased since that time of writs are stored and the house of commons and late committees of privileges pestered perplexed to the great retarding of the more weighty public affairs of the king and kingdom let it also be remembered that by the beforementioned unhappy deprivation of the common peoples rights the king has lost the advantage of the proper legal balance against the dangerous power of rich and ambitious men and overgrown landholders the fatal want of which has lately been most notoriously demonstrated in the unhappy ruined kingdom of poland for as the authority of a king is amply sufficient to defend the common people from the oppression of the rich and great by a due exertion of the laws provided the common people be allowed a due share in the legislature so the latter in return and for their own sakes will always be ready to exert their legislative authority as well as their strength and power in a free militia memorandum a militia cannot be free if the individuals of it are compelled under the terrors of martial law to be withdrawn from their families their ordinary callings and even from their counties for six months or more without return for by these means they are withdrawn also from their civil capacity in the state and are apt to become mere soldiers or mercenaries for when a man loses his trade or ordinary occupation together with his family and local connexions on which his maintenance depends he may justly be said to lose his civil capacity because he is thereby rendered dependent on his military sold or pay like the common soldiers of all standing armies and therefore whenever the public defense requires the national militia to form an army in the field the service ought to be supplied by a regular military roster or rotation circulating monthly in due and equal proportions throughout all the counties by which means no man would be so long withdrawn from his home as to be injured either in his family or occupation and yet the most distant parts of the kingdom would be defended by the returning disciplined troops and military vigor would be circulated by the roster like the blood of life throughout the whole body of the nation which would give it under god such internal strength as must render all attempts of foreign invaders fatal only to themselves to maintain the king and the laws which by their union with the crown they will always be able to do whenever the aristocratical power requires any just limitation  the end annual parliaments the ancient and most salutary right of the commons of great britain  being an extract from sharps declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature printed in      p     to   0  wherein is shown that the statutes of   edw iii c    and    edw iii c  0 which ordain that a parliament shall be holden every year one etc must necessarily be understood to mean  a new election of representatives every year once and more often if need be  london printed in the year mdcclxxx  preface to the reader the editor earnestly recommends the subject of the following pages to the consideration of the public because he conceives that the restoration of elections every year once and more often if need be and those in a more equal proportion of deputation according to the number of electors in each county is the only measure that can be safely adopted for a solid and firm basis of that political reformation which at present is almost universally acknowledged to be necessary as well for the security of the people as the dignity and safety of the crown the unhappy effects of modern deviations from that fundamental rule do clearly demonstrate that it was not only an ancient right of the commons but even an indispensable right without which peace and good government cannot be maintained  mos retinendus est fidelissimae vetustatis quae praeter consuetudinem et morem majorum fiunt neque placent neque recta videntur   coke     as often as any thing is doubtful or corrupted we should recur to first principles  lofts elements of law no    annual parliaments the ancient and most salutary right of the commons of great britain  the authority of the nominal legislature in    0 was entirely illegal as well as that in      both of them having been set up and maintained by the same unconstitutional arbitrary power and both of them totally void of the indispensable representation of the people for though the wretched remains of the longparliament in    0 being about  0 representatives or members instead of     that had been elected at the beginning of that parliament were indeed chosen by a small part of the people of england yet the legal representation even of that small part was out of date and void from the length of time that the said representation had continued without reelection which was about ten years whereas it is well known that the due effect or virtue of popular representation was formerly supposed to be incapable like some annual fruits of being so long preserved in useful purity without a seasonable renewal from time to time so that our more prudent ancestors imitating nature required also an annual renewal of their parliamentary representation as being necessary for the maintenance of public virtue  sir edw coke in his  th inst p   speaking of the matters of parliament informs us of the reasons usually expressed in the writs for calling a new parliament as pro quibusdam arduis urgentibus negotiis nos statum et defensionem regni nostri angliae et ecclesiae anglicanae concernentibus quoddam parliamentum nostrum etc teneri ordinavimus etc and he adds in the next paragraph now for as much says he as diverse laws and statutes have been enacted and provided for these ends aforesaid and that diverse mischiefs in particular and that diverse mischiefs in particular and diverse grievances in general concerning the honor and safety of the king the state and defense of the kingdom and of the church of england might be prevented an excellent law was made anno    edw iii c  0 which being applied to the said writs of parliament does in a few and effectual words set down the true subject of a parliament in these words for the maintenance of the said articles and statutes and redress of diverse mischiefs and grievances which daily happen a parliament shall be holden every year as another time was ordained by a statute which statute here referred to was made in the  th year of the same reign cap    item it is accorded that a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be but sir william blackstone supposes that the king never was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business if need be   com c   p      it is too true indeed that our kings in general did not think themselves  obliged by these statutes as they ought in conscience to have been for the safety of their souls to call a new parliament every year nay it is certain that many of them would never have called a parliament at all had they not been obliged by necessity and the circumstances of the times but by what authority could a representative in one parliament take his seat in the next annual parliament without reelection before any laws were made for lengthening the duration of parliaments and besides if the king did only permit a parliament to sit annually etc by what authority could the parliament be convened at all under such a circumstance seeing that a mere permission to sit excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year however the learned commentator himself very justly observes in a preceding page   0 concerning the manner and time of assembling that the parliament is regularly to be summoned by the kings writ or letter issued out of chancery and it is well known that these writs are not addressed to the knights citizens and burgesses elected for any former parliament but to the sheriffs alone to cause knights citizens etc to be elected for when the said acts were made such an absurdity in politics had never been conceived in england as that of trusting the representation of the people for a term of years as at present to the persons elected on the contrary when the business of each session was finished the parliament of course was at an end and therefore lord coke did not speak in vain when he mentioned the excellent law  viz the act for annual parliaments being applied to the said writs of parliament etc before recited  a man of so much good sense learning and judgment as sir william blackstone is master of must be well aware of the pernicious effects of investing the representatives of the people with a legislative power beyond the constitutional term of a single session without reelection and therefore i cannot but be surprised at the unguarded manner in which he has expressed himself in his comment on the two excellent statutes of edward iii for annual parliaments viz that the king is not or ever was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year etc he has caused the word new to be printed in italics as if he meant thereby to insinuate that the legislatures of those early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular representation a kind of continued senatorial dignity without reelection for several years together whereas he certainly must have known that this corrupt modern practice has produced a new order of men amongst us a most dangerous increase of aristocratical power which was entirely unknown to our ancestors in the glorious reign of edward iii if he could show that there ever was a parliament in those times that was not a new parliament his comment might be justified but it is notorious that writs were issued to the sheriffs for new elections almost every year during that whole reign the writs for the most part are still preserved with the returns upon them in the catalogue of electionwrits which prynne has given in his brevia parliamentaria rediviva p   to   there is an account of writs issued for new elections in every year of that kings reign between his   th when the last act for annual parliaments was made and his  0th year except   viz the  0th   st and   th years in which years the records of summons to the prelates and lords of parliament are also wanting as appears by sir william dugdales perfect copy of summons to parliament of the nobility etc  and yet this affords no absolute proof that parliaments were not holden in those very years for which the writs are wanting because the bundles of writs for the said years may have been lost or mislaid the only wonder is that more have not been lost when we consider the very little care that had been taken of them for prynne found many of these writs dispersed among a vast miscellaneous heap of other records on various subjects as he himself relates in his epistlededicatory to king charles ii of his brevia parliamentaria rediviva calling the said heap a confused chaos under corrding putrefying cobwebs dust and filth in the darkest corner of caesars chapel in the white tower as mere useless relics not worthy to be calendred etc and in page  0  of that same work he speaks of     bundles of writs whereof    had only been then lately discovered filed and bundled by himself but many of these     bundles says he are not complete above half or three parts of the writs being either rotted consumed maimed torn or utterly lost through carelessness wet cankers or other casualties and some of them have not above two three or four writs and one or two but one writ and retorn remaining  but that there were really writs for parliaments even in those three years which appear to be wanting at least in two of them is very certain because it was in the  0th year of this reign as sir edward coke informs us   inst p    that the pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of england and ireland and the arrears of revenue granted by king john to pope innocent iii whereupon the king in the same year calls his court of parliament in this parliament it was unanimously agreed by the prelates dukes counts barons and commons et la commun and again et communes that the said king john nor no other could put himself nor his realm nor his people in such subjection without their assent sans assent de eux and if it was done it was done without their assent that is without the assent of the common for the assent of the barons was expressed in the charter and contrary to his oath at his coronation p    whereupon lord coke remarks in the margin that no king can put himself nor his realm nor his people in such subjection without assent of the lords and commons in parliament etc etc as sir edward coke proves from the parliamentrolls of that year no   remarking at the same time that the act then made was never yet printed see the margin  th inst p     and it appears that a parliament was held also in the   th year of this reign because supplies were in that year granted to the king by parliament as related by sir richard baker in his chronicle p     viz in his eight and fortieth year in a parliament is granted him a  0th of the clergy and a   th of the laity so that there is but one year out of so many in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual parliaments and annual writs for new elections were regularly issued for the first    years of the following reign as appears by prynnes  d part of a brief register and survey of the several kinds and forms of parliamentary writs pages     and     till richard ii that wretched perjured monarch had rendered himself absolute his arbitrary proceedings very soon afterward occasioned his own loss of power and total fjectment from the throne so that notwithstanding his boasted firmness in executing his favorite measures he was at last reduced to the most abject acknowledgements of his own unworthiness to reign   after considering these unquestionable evidences of the issuing writs annualy for new elections it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of sir william blackstones comment on the said two acts for annual parliaments not that he the king is or ever was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business if need be  these last words says he are so loose and vague that such of our monarchs as were inclined to govern without parliaments neglected the convoking them sometimes for a considerable period under pretense that there was no need of them etc  but these last words are not so loose and vague as either to justify his own explanation of the said statues  viz not to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit etc or to excuse in the least degree the criminal neglects of those depraved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them for the words if need be cannot according to the most obvious sense of the act wherein they are found be applied to the main purpose of the act the holding annual parliaments but merely to the remaining part of the sentence viz and more often that is and more often if need be the order that a parliament shall be holden every year once is absolute and the discretionary power expressed in the words if need be relates apparently to the calling parliaments more often for if the said discretionary words if need be could with any propriety be applied to the whole sentence the act itself would have been nugatory which could never be the intention of the legislature but the true meaning and sense of the legislature is very clearly proved by the histories of those times for it is manifest not only that new representatives were elected every year with only one exception for a considerable number of years after the last of the said acts was made which confirms the main purpose of the acts viz the holding annual parliaments but it is also manifest that parliaments were frequently holden more often than once a year writs were issued for electing   new parliaments in the  th year of edw iii   in his   th year   in his   th year and even   in his   th year and there appear to have been   new parliaments in the  th of rich ii see prynnes brevia parliamentaria rediviva p   and   which amply confirms also what i have before said concerning the meaning of the discretionary power expressed in the said act by the words if need be  these very frequent elections sometimes two three and four times in one year sufficiently prove that the power delegated by the people to their representatives continued no longer in force than during the session of the particular parliament to which they were summoned which being once determined says prynne is it part of brief register etc of parl writs p     they presently ceased to be knights citizens burgesses barons in any succeeding parliaments or councils unless newly elected and returned to serve in them by the kings new writs as our law books referring to   ed iv f    brook officer      hen viii c    and experience resolve etc and therefore judge blackstones insinuation against the calling of a new parliament has no real foundation for if it was the intention of the legislature in the two acts abovementioned that the king should ever summon any parliament at all they must necessarily be understood to mean a new parliament on all occasions i e not only that the regular parliaments which they ordained to be holden every year once should be new parliaments but also those that should be summoned upon any extraordinary unforeseen occasions which is sufficiently expressed in the  st of the said acts by the words and more often if need be the meaning of the act is unquestionably proved by the actual issuing of writs to the sheriffs for electing knights citizens etc for two three and sometimes four new parliaments in one year as mentioned above and if any person should object that such very frequent elections must be attended with insuperable difficulties and inconveniences we may quote the experience of all ancient times as affording ample and sufficient proofs to the contrary there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of from    hen iii till    edw iv that is more than  00 years for ought that appears by the retornes or parliamentrolls and not so much as one double return or indenture wherewith all the late bundles or writs are stored and the house of commons and late committees of privileges pestered perplexed to the great retarding of the more weighty public affairs of the king and kingdom prynne brevia parl rediv p     this enormous evil the retardment of business by undue returns will not i may venture without the spirit of prophecy to assert be remedied by the new regulation for that purpose the commons were never in ancient times of freedom esteemed the proper judges of their own elections but the king alone that is in his limited judicial capacity by his justices and his sworn juries in the courts of common law if my countrymen will seriously consider all these points they must be convinced that the only sure method of healing the alarming distempers of our political constitution viz the enormous national debt the numerous pensions the secret parliamentary insluence a standing army of near  00 battalions of foot besides cavalry in time of peace this was first printed in      etc etc etc which must render the estates and property of individuals precarious and insecure or finally eat them up with growing burdens if these fatal symptoms of the most dangerous political consumption are not speedily checked and thrown off by the wholesome prescriptions of a free and equal representation of the people annually elected is to restore to the people their ancient and just right to elect a new parliament every year once and more often if need be  no parliament could have any right to deprive the people of this inestimable law unless the representatives had expressly consulted their respective constituents upon it as the alteration was of too much moment to be entrusted to the discretion of any representatives or deputies whatsoever being infinitely more important than any new device moved on the kings behalf in parliament for his aid or the like for the most essential and fundamental right of the whole body of the commons i mean the principals not the deputies or agents was materially injured by the fatal change and the peoples power of control for the general good of the kingdom was thereby apparently diminished so that if it is the duty of representatives even in any new device of mere aid or the like to consult their constituents how much more upon the proposal of so material an alteration in the constitution ought they to have answered that in this new device they dare not agree without conference with their countries these are the words of lord coke who mentions them as the proper answer see also the answer of the commons in    edw iii as reported in sir robert cottons abridgement of the records etc p    almost in the same words when any new device is moved etc and he adds whereby it appears says he that such conference is warrantable by th law and custom of parliament  th inst p    so that no representative can be justified according to the law and custom of parliament who refuses to receive the instructions of his constituents notwithstanding that several very sensible worthy and i believe sincerely patriotic gentlemen have lately declared themselves to be of a contrary opinion but when they peruse the several authorities which i have cited concerning the absolute necessity of a very frequent appeal to the sense of the whole body of the people i trust in their candor and love of truth that they will alter their sentiments  the end
