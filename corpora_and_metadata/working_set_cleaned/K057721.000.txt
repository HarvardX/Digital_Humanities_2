tapping more she will come to the dregs and for my friend mrs langrish if i cannot prevail on her to prate less she will not last me another spring  that woman will talk two hours without breathing to describe the effects of an emetic and if i did not lower her now and then by a gentle cathartic she would evaporate through the lingual organs like air through a cracked bladder   serve i had like to have forgot  mr bellair is coming sir   feelove coming no poor young fellow he is going  he is going there there is the end of the life of a man of pleasure  it must be very unpleasant to be a man of pleasure nothing could ever prevail on me to be a man of pleasure  oh the temptations that i have withstood from black eyes and gray from tall and short   serve i have often thought sir  with submission  that the gentlemen of the wig go through more temptations than people are aware of   feelove aye aye  there are josephs in the faculty i can promise ye oh the white hands that i have seen put out between the sarcenet curtains with pulse disordered only by too much health oh the bright eyes that i have seen on snowy pillows oh the  but come the facultys great faculty is that of keeping secrets  i say no more did mr bellair crawl up stairs last night   serve no sir i could not persuade him when he found miss arabella was alone   feelove aye he abhors women now  the sight of a young woman throws him into a catalepsy i have seen him faint only at the touch of arabellas hand when she has been chaffing his temples with spirits of hartshorn   serve yes sir i have sometimes thought he

you agree that she shall be mine on paying you onethird for your consent   feelove one half   everg no  onethird i am sure ten thousand pounds for a simple aye is very well we know a place where they would say aye for half the money   feelove come dont libel your betters till you are poor and want a pension as to our affair consider every thing you know i boarded arabella with two sisters at a village in cornwall who could teach her nothing but her sampler the sole employment of her life for sixteen years has been her needle with the occasional reliefs of making seedcake and stewing codlings   everg i know all that  i know all that   feelove yes you know but you dont draw the inference let me tell you that a girl who cannot write who never heard of point or brussels whose only game at cards is beggar my neighbor and who thinks the playhouse ranelagh and vauxhall the three great turnpikes to the devil is a better fortune with fifteen than a town bred miss with thirty thousand pounds   everg well well it is in vain to argue here take the parchments  fill up the blanks and write your name shall i see my little bell   feelove to be sure call down my niece tell her my

verge of riding under your own coronet  why so sad   arab i am always sad i think they told me when i left cornwall i was coming to london to be very happy but indeed i was happier there in the mornings i rambled in the woods and used to listen to the sweet birds till they made me weep  in the evenings i walked by moonlight  oh how i love moonlight walks with the distant village sounds dying on the ear till like the soft shades of the flowers they could hardly be distinguished   everg why you may have moonlight in london when it is not foggy and sounds of all sorts   arab but my uncle never suffers me to stir   feelove no to be sure  not till you are married   everg no nor then neither without your husband   arab nor then neither why they tell me but i dont care about it that when i am married i must pay visits and receive company and ride in hyde park and be always in public without once thinking of my husband   everg apart doctor five thousand must be added for that   feelove why how now hussy  who has been putting these wicked notions into your head   arab why sure they cannot be wicked for the rectors wife and daughters over the way do so and go out in fine carriages and have cards on sundays   feelove hussy hussy that is a bishops family  a parish priest dared not be so wicked for his ears   everg come doctor dont be so harsh  my little pet will be a good girl i have convinced her that she was made on purpose to be my wife and that it will be the duty of my wife to hate gadding and particularly to hate all young fellows   arab no  you said particularly those with cockades and gorgets   everg did i  then i was too slack they are all the same  the gorgeted the scarfd the broad bands and the narrow bands if they are young you must hate them all  and if they presume to talk nonsense to you make me your secret keeper and then i shall be able to hold you up as the exact model of a perfect wife   feelove yes and like other models it will be very badly copied but pray mistress in this pretty lesson of yours where do you find any thing about your visitings and gadding about in the libertine style you were just now speaking of   everg no no  no modest woman receives visits from any but relations nor amongst those from none of a remoter degree than uncles and aunts   arab what not a cousin   everg not if it is a male cousin  oh horrid a male cousin in the family of a young married woman is a worse monster than a mantiger   arab but mr bellair is not my cousin  so i may let him come without any harm  oh how i shall like to support his poor aching head on my bosom and when he is fainting to give him cordials and weep over him till he recovers  aside feelove what are you saying arabella   arab i was only conning my lesson sir that part of it is so pretty that whenever i think on it i sigh and feel so melancholy  and yet it is a melancholy sweeter than all the pleasure i have ever tasted   exit everg aye go go that is my pretty bell get it all

parchments   exit feelove i will why now i have been a fool i have made the bargain more favorable on his side than i needed i really believe he would have taken her with the ten thousand only i will try to start some difficulty in the business  i hate to be overreached   exit with the parchments scene carltons carlton and bellair at breakfast carl more ways than one indeed and your way is most singular imported with you i suppose from leyden  assume sickness to captivate a blooming girl such a way of lovemaking could never have occurred but in a college   bell my sickness was assumed not to captivate but to get introduced to her you have often heard that pity is sister to love and i have proved it so in the heart of the gentle arabella   enter a servant speaking to bellair serve your servant has been here sir to say that doctor feelove requests you not to call till one as he is obliged to make a wide circuit this morning   bell very well bid him let my wrapping gown be ready with my pale complexion and all other necessaries exit servant i must have a wider gown in that i am not sufficiently screend who but a doctor could believe that these limbs belong to a fellow in the last stage of an atrophy   carl oh they are so used to wonders you may make them believe any thing but have you never yet found a moment to convince the lady that you have as much health and assurance as any man in town   bell never  nor do i know that i yet wish it for i should then lose the luxury of her tender assistances the soft pressure of her hand and the tear dropping from her blue eye on my cheek whilst she believes me in a state of insensibility  how can i bear to give up all that   carl faith i dont know   bell then to hear her sigh and ask her uncle in the teaderest accents if nothing can be done for me i swear a direct avowal of her passion would not give me such transport how charming to witness natures genuine feelings in a beautiful girl instead of those factitious ones imposed by education   carl her mode of education has been strange sure do you find nothing repulsive in it   bell repulsive quite the reverse  it has a thousand charms for me her mind is naturally so elegant and ingenuous that the task of polishing it can be but slight and that charming task will be mine i shall be her enamored abelard   carl is it so very charming to be a schoolmaster   bell what a phrase impatiently to unite the characters of lover and instructor seems to me the most interesting of human situations  what joy to wind along the cool retreat to stop and gaze on delia as i go to mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet and teach my lovely scholar all i know so sung you know one of our first poets   carl one of our first poets is very welcome to have sung or said it but give me a woman whose soul is all informed and alive to every enjoyment of taste and feeling i would rather my wife should join in conversation with grace than shrink from it overpowered by her blushes and that she should make the men afraid of her wit rather than allure them by her simplicity   bell you speak as though you knew such a woman   carl perhaps i may  but of that hereafter   bell hereafter be it then for now i am impatient to be gone i must practice an hour before i shall reduce my pipe to the shrill tone suited to my appearance  you would not insure my life three days if you should see

those who are most kind to him now i would have you show every kind of decent civility to him that a modest young woman may show   arab i am sure i always do i would lay down my life to bate his pains sometimes they are very bad and then he grasps my hand so hard  but i am not angry with him   feelove no to be sure he is sick poor man  if he was well twould be quite another thing  never let a man in health press your hand but as i was saying i have no doubt but his gratitude will secure us some acknowledgement at his death   arab oh dear uncle you had better secure an acknowledgement for saving his life   feelove yes but when peoples lives are saved they seldom think of an acknowledgement  if you can get into a sick mans will it is safer to let him go   enter servant serve mr bellair

bell my spirits are very low and i have odd fancies doctor  very odd fancies   feelove aye sir but you should always oppose odd fancies i knew an old lady who fancied herself pursued by death  she swore he should not have her and actually contended with the phantasm so long that she vanquished him that very obstinacy which sent three husbands out of the world kept her in it contrary to the predictions of the wisest heads in warwicklane   bell but i have a stranger fancy than that doctor  i have a fancy that i shall live and be some day or other a hale stout young fellow   feelove aside

witchery is the most perverse the most capricious the most proud the    carl tut tut that is to say you have been her slave and a neglected one   bell faith there is hardly a man of your acquaintance who will not subscribe to my opinion of her   carl the strongest proof of her charms and of her power i adore her for being hated by all the men who have had the presumption to sigh for her there is a degree of impurity in a woman who smiles on and listens to all who choose to make love to her when i marry my wife must bring me an ear as unessayed as her heart and the first whispers of love that reach her must be from my lips   bell well carry your whispers to miss archer kneel sigh weep and  be despised   carl ha ha ha   bell what do you laugh at   carl at your conceiving that with a woman of her character i should pursue so beaten a track no no i have resolved to woo her but it shall be by an appearance of indifference i will set her heart in a blaze by my coldness and conquer her with

there is a thing of mine in the papers today you know for every body knows miss archer   carl doubtless   marv you know she is the most haughty affected creature living and today i gave her in

marv yes i have why not satirize miss archer i satirize myself sometimes and answer it again the next day   carl by heaven on reflection it pleases me   marv besides to tell you the truth there is another reason  now i shall surprise ye i know  i hardly expect ye to believe me  but  in short she has actually refused me   bell refused you nay then carlton you may as well give it up  you will hardly expect to succeed where sir marvel has failed   marv oh i dont know that  i dont know that those capricious women generally choose the worst  you know the proverb  dainty dogs   carl delicate so it is revenge then    marv yes revenge  but i still continue to visit her in a friendly way for she is fashionable and one finds the first dash there besides i have such goodnature and generosity about me that i never can be out of humor with people to their faces   carl in course you dont mean to acknowledge your satire but is it very severe   marv oh tears her like a bramble bush   carl then do me the favor to give me for the author   marv are you serious   carl most particularly so  in short i want to be introduced to her and i know no better way   bell tell her he is dying for her  that is a better way   carl yes to be made a fool will you oblige me   marv to be sure  gad i shall like such a screen for i have had the terror of her fingers before my eyes   carl go then this instant my

her i never read such a piece of abuse in my life  i wonder how the author got it in i have wrote twenty pretty things of this sort myself but some wise grave editor or other always cropped my laurels the next morning the answers to correspondents never failed to inform them that the lines of l s were inadmissible or the epigram signed laura wont do for our paper or we must desire our fair correspondent clarissa to learn to spell before she pretends to write heroic verse i wonder really at their impertinence  that a young lady of fashion cannot amuse herself in rhyming a little about her friends but they must pretend to judge of the matter  miss archer enters oh my dear miss archer do you know that some cruel wretch here    miss archer oh yes my dear i know it all you are the

what is your motive for reading it to me   marv motive  motive  why it is fit every body should know what is said of them that great philosopher heliogabalus said the abuses of his enemies were more serviceable to him than the praises of his friends   miss archer i am quite of that opinion and wish therefore to know whom i have to thank for this service   marv do you would you really wish to know him   miss archer yes really   marv shall i bring him to you   miss archer then you know him   marv perfectly well i will not give his name but if you have any curiosity he shall receive your thanks

why really miss juvenile i am surprised that people will give opinions so rashly miss the person who wrote this little morceau is remarkable for his skill in belles lettres   miss juv belles lettres  skill in bell metal might do for such lines as these  they might be hammered out of any thing   marv very well maam very well i must beg leave to say that it is not so agreeable to hear the talents of ones friends slighted   miss juv indeed you are mighty liberal  in general it is the most agreeable treat a friend can have i wish you would let me know who this friend is for whose reputation you are

doctor  no more fees  he has given you the goby fairly is it not a shame that a man of your prowess in the fields of galen should not be able to conquer such a pitiful hectic as drove him him out of the world why a physician ought to have the diseases at his call and whistle them on and off as a huntsman does his hounds   bell aye twas a crying sin to let such a spirited fine young fellow be kicked out of life by a rascally little feveret an old woman would have cured him but such an obstinate confidence in the skill of the renowned doctor feelove he died full of resentment and his last words were  toss the doctor in a blanket   feelove i can forgive that  i can forgive that  but i cannot forgive your illiberality sir an old woman cure him it was not in the power of all the

wonder the loss of your niece sits so lightly my little hippocrates   feelove oh sir i have a great heart  a prodigious great heart its feelings are for the faculty a girl may run away from an uncle without reproach to him but when a patient runs away from the sentence of his physician the reputation of the doctor must soon run after him   carl happily our patient knew his duty better  and so as we are now three very happy fellows let us even adjourn to the star and garter and live the evening like bon vivants   feelove with all my heart  and egad gentlemen i am so offended with the insolence

her at all fifteen thousand pounds if i thought my niece would ever look upon thee or ever think of thee as a husband i would put fifteen thousand pounds in each pocket drive to gravesend and leap into the sea to disappoint thee   everg why wed have you up again if you did  wed empty your pockets i warrant you riches are no more safe now in the bottom of the sea than a rainbow is in the clouds

suppose them   miss archer i dont know what i ought to suppose sir   carl you ought to suppose that you are lovely and that i have eyes  you ought to suppose that you have a charming spirit and that i

till she wakes   mrs tomson presents a pamphlet and goes out miss archer tumbles over the leaves a short time miss archer well now what signifies my attempting to read my thoughts are so deranged that greek would be as pleasant to me as don quixote what a peculiar fate is mine to receive a declaration of love from the only man whose lips i ever wished to hear it from and yet to be conveyed in such a way as to give me more pain than pleasure the air of sincerity with which he made it would have transported me had it not been poisoned by an unaccountable boldness and freedom   walks toward the bookcase and takes a book  carlton enters without seeing her  throws himself on a chair and his hat on a table  sees her suddenly carl zounds miss archer here again nay then she is my own  it would be

you but resolved not to be made a dangler  which if i had approached you in the common modes of courtship would have inevitably followed  i therefore took the road you have seen and in consequence you will condescend to be happy and make happy a year or two sooner than your coquetry would have allowed   miss archer to be happy and make happy  smiling and tossing her head carl yes and that in spite
