calvary or the death of christ  calvary or the death of christ a poem in eight books  by richard cumberland  london printed for c dilly in the poultry mdccxcii  calvary or the death of christ  book i  the argument of the first book after a short introduction which states the miraculous acts of christ and serves to mark the period at which the poem commences satan goes forth by night into the wilderness and finds himself in the very spot where he had in vain practiced his temptations upon christ here he falls into meditation upon that unsuccessful interview and vents himself in soliloquy indignant under disappointment and impatient to repair his defeat he ascends to the summit of the mountain from whence he had exhibited the kingdoms of the earth and calls the devils from all parts of the heathen world the whole host of infernals assemble at his summons the chief leaders are enumerated their persons and attributes described satan addresses them and proposes the subject matter for their consultation namely by what means to counteract the power of christ upon earth baal delivers his sentiments by stating difficulties and objections without any decided opinion unless for seduction in the general moloch angrily resents what he considers as pointed at himself and speaks disdainfully against the proposal of seduction as not only desperate but disgraceful belial replies and after much circumlocution suggests a temptation to be set on foot by mammon he is interrupted by satan who reproves him for certain digressions in his speech but adopts his hint of employing mammon and calls upon that evil spirit to attempt the fidelity of judas iscariot whom he points out to him as the only one of the disciples open to seduction mammon at first affects to excuse himself from the undertaking but in conclusion accepts it and taking wing in presence of the whole applauding host sets out upon his embassy directing his course to the city of jerusalem  calvary book i the assembling of the devils hail awful calvary forsaking now aonian haunts and the unhallowed nine i visit thy sad mount and thence invite the mournful echoes to my deeptond harp hymning the whilst in solemn numbers praise to god for mercies purchased by the death of that mysterious being virginborn savior of lost mankind who on the cross lord though he be of life and one with god in mortal pangs expired there to atone for a degenerate world by his pure blood to wash original corruption out and rising victor from the grave dispel sin and it is offspring death with all the train of idol gods usurping earth and heaven now had the wondrous acts by jesus wrought spread wide his fame through all judaeas realm the leper cleansd the blind to sight restored the sick to health and even the dead to life though warned to silence for his modest ear sought not the praise of men so much the more published his mercies demons at his call with horrid shrieks that testified his power came forth from men possessed and fled his voice rebuked the seas and winds vast was the throng that followed where he led and thousands found in the waste wilderness miraclous food they saw they marveld and of force confessed messiah in his power not so in form for there no comeliness no outward grace no princely state appeared slow to renounce illusions long indulged their wavering minds twixt two opinions halted while in place of these bright visions they beheld a man lowly and meek a houseless wanderer that had not where on earth to lay his head  such can our israels great restorer be such our messiah  thus their troubled thoughts like meeting currents clashd when as he spoke truth flowed resistless from his lips his eyes beamed mercy and his fathers glory shone effulgent in his face then every tongue was hushed to silence every doubt dispelled and every heart confessed him lord and christ twas night when satan prince of darkness called and fitly called for evil hates the day walked forth on hellish meditation bent prowling the wilderness wherever he trod earth quaked beneath his foot before him rolled thick cloud and vapor making nights dark shade more black and terrible the beasts of prey every wild thing that roams the savage waste and howling to the moon demands it is food fled his approach the lion and the pard scented the blast and slunk into their dens for whilst his breast with raging passions boiled hatred revenge and blasphemous despite the sighs he vented from the hell within breathed death into the air his haggard eyes which still in speechless agonies he rolled outglard the hyaenas other fires than theirs to light his dismal path he needed none now having stretched athwart the sandy wild clear to its rocky verge the archfiend paused and upward cast his eye if happily there darkling he might discern what saucy mound dared to arrest his course for yet there dwelt such vigor in his wing nor depth nor height mountains nor seas might check his bold career were he so purposed neither would he deign to ask one charitable star for light thoughtful of former glory when he soared son of the morning far above their spheres whereat he gan put forth his plumed vans from either shoulder stretched for flight when soon the fueld clouds to fierce encounter rushed loud thunders bellowed and the lightnings flash smote on the craggy cliff at sight whereof conscious that now he pressed the fatal spot where late he commund with the son of god who for the space of forty days and nights foiled every vain device with shame abashed and pondering in his mind his foul defeat down down at once his flagging pinions fell close cowring to his ribs as some proud ship between the tropics over the atlantic wave speeding amain to reach her destined port if chance the experienced mariner espies the gathering hurricane no stay no stop quick to the yard each swelling sail is furled the curled waves whitening as the torrent drives and soon her taunt and lofty topmast lowered strikes to the gale so he his towering height that to angelic stature now had swelled shrunk into human size nor other seemed than pilgrim squalid and with years and toil bending decrepit when from his full heart words intermixed with groans thus forced their way yes hateful wilderness detested rocks whom i would curse had nature left one blade on your bare ribs which cursing i might blast full well i know you deep too deep engraved on memorys tablet your rude horrors live and you officious lightnings hide your fires come night again let central darkness shroud scenes whose tormenting recollection stabs my unavenged soul can i forget this son of joseph son of god henceforth of force i must confess him for what less than godlike constancy could have withstood temptations great and terrible as mine something which man is not he needs must be virtue that angels boast not he must have else had my snares enclosed him else the world which then was mine to give had been a bribe too glorious not to dazzle every eye but his who made those glories what they are still i must doubt the fathers love sincere though loudly vouched by his own voice from heaven is this a fathers love is this his care here to expose him to this desert wild forty long sleepless nights and fasting days no angel guard about him lost forlorn abandoned to the elements to beasts more fierce than this loud storm nay fiercer still to me than all more terrible to me foe of his life inveterate and avowed rare sample of gods love if here his christ encountered aught of danger and if none what else could prompt him to this vain display of voluntary penance but the love of flattery and a despicable wish to hear himself applauded in this spot beneath the jutting roof of this rude cliff i first surpised this wandering son of god this savior of the world fainting he seemed with thirst and hunger pale as death his cheek his hollow eyes deep sunk and from his brow big drops of sweat distilled as one oerspent and sinking to the earth there to expire a ready tale he had for pitys ear a melancholy list of wants and woes he had not tasted food and fairly owned that natures cravings were intense when i glad at the heart to find him thus besieged with appetite so eager stooping down from the disseverd fragments that here lie about the base of this stormbeaten rock chose out a few smooth stones and tempting said if thou art hungry eat convert these stones if thou art gods own son to bread and eat but he not so beguiled spurned them away and silenced me with text of holy writ a nobler appetite i next assailed ambition to the mountains top we soared i spread the kingdoms of the earth in sight fit sight to whet the hunger of the mind but mind and body he alike would starve nor thank nor homage render back for food of my providing one last hope remained methought there was a godly pride about him which with right holy flattery i might win upon the temples topmost pinnacle i placed this scorner of an earthly crown and bade him be a god cast thyself down behold quoth i the angels are on wing to bear thee up unhurt with stern rebuke get thee behind me satan he replied some power unseen controlled me down i fell down from the giddy eminence i plunged and left him to his angels whilst their hymns and halelujahs echoed through the air his triumphs and my second fall from heaven and now if dark despair shall reach this heart which of hells tetrarchs can arraign their king or fix on me his share of public loss and overthrow sustained in this attack none for none dare if i till now supreme great idol of the gentile world for whom so many groves so many altars blaze if i to whom by various names adored thousands of temples rife whilst one alone one solitary pile on sions hill echoes the praise of god neglected else of all if i if satan must submit to christ revenge to patience war to peace and men must learn new maxims of forgiveness maxims i neither practice nor instill heroes and kings and conquerors farewell greater is he who serves than he who reigns to suffer to submit to turn the cheek to the proud smiter these are virtues now hence with such virtues if these rules obtain if this tame doctrine shall unman the world altars and groves and temples all must sink olympus and its synod every grace and every muse all that the chissel wrought in greece or rome shall moulder into dust and christ and reason shall usurp the world he ceased and now his swelling bosom heaved with indignation like the laboring earth which subterranean vapors undermine pent in it is sulfurous entrails up he sprung to that high mountain top whence he reviewed the kingdoms of the earth whilst at his side christs humble virtue stood on other realms realms of immortal happiness intent here as a vulture on the craggy peak of caucasus or haemus left to watch screams out his shrill alarm at sound whereof the carrion troop upon the wing for prey come flocking to the signal satan thus stood eminent and called his dark compeers so loud he called that to the farthest bounds of pagan isle or continent was heard his voice reechoing through the vault of heaven heroes and demigods olympian powers infernal princes of hells dark abyss heavens exiles spirits of air water fire or whatsoever element confines your incorporeal effences oh hear hear and assemble it is your leader calls it is your champions voice in happier hours heard and obeyed now in extremest need be present and assist our great divan no more for soon was heard the distant sound of wings that beat the air from every point of the four winds the gathering swarm came on from great from cyprus and the ionian coast from egypt afric and the ausonian shores gods of all names dimensions and degrees great was their sovereigns triumph to behold this prompt obedience to his high command for now descending on the desert heath to martial music the infernal host in bands and columns by their chiefs arrangd stood firm if ever gleam of joy might reach heart so accursed the archfiend had felt it here as with a monarchs eye he now reviewed his armies covering all the swarthy plain come muse and to your suppliants eyes impart one ray of that pure light which late you poured on the dark orbs of your immortal bard eclipsed by drop serene conduct me now me from my better days of bold emprize far in decline and with the hoary hand of time hard stricken yet adventuring forth over natures limits into worlds unseen peopled with shadowy forms and phantoms dire oh bear me on your pinions in this void where weary foot never rested and behold all hell bursts forth support me or i sink now glimmering twilight streaked the eastern sky for he that on his forehead brings the morn starcrowned phosphorus had heard the call and with the foremost stood beside him one of towering stature and majestic port himself a host his black and curling locks down his herculean shoulders copious flowed in glittering brass upon his shield he bore a kingly eagle ensign of command baal his name second to none in state save only his great chieftain worshipped long in babylon till daniel drove him thence with all his gluttonous priests exalted since high above all the idol gods of greece throned on olympus and his impious hand armed with the thunder yet he rud the zeal of furious jehu and that mournful day when he beheld his altars stream with blood his prophets and his priests by hundreds slain upon mount carmel moloch in the van maild at all points for war with spear and helm and plumed crest and garments rolled in blood flamed like a meteor him with horrid joy satan awhile surveyed then sighing cried oh worthy of command had all like thee so bravely fought heaven never had been lost thence as he glanced his eye far other form and much unfit for war he next espied chemos the sin of moab power obscene emasculate and soft in loose attire a sensual deity his glory twas in arts of base seduction to excel and leagued with harlots to have turned the heart of that wise king and drawn him from his god to bend his aged knees at idol shrines close at his side stood one in whose soft eyes ensnaring smiles and beauteous ruin lurked oh that such grace should be allied to sin zidonian goddess ashtoreth her name heaven would not quite destroy so fair a work but wantonness usurped an angel face and with her innocence had changed her sex yet let that sex beware for in their souls when once she enters peace no longer dwells witness that magdalen whose frantic breast till by christs mercy healed sevn demons rent all sinbegotten all her brood accursed but satan whose stern heart stranger to love all weakness though in shape of sin disdained and only prized spirits more like himself indignant turned aside and bent his eye where dagon giant god amidst the ranks like teneriff or aetna proudly towerd dagon of gath and askalon the boast in that sad flight when on gilboas mount the shield of saul was vilely thrown away and israels beauty perished him awhile with scowling eye the infernal king surveyed then taunting cried o dagon vast in size in soul diminutive had that huge mass valor proportionate heaven had been ours but fitter thou dull spirit to people hell than reassault gods throne where was thy pride when overthrown in gaza by the strength of that uxorious danite humbled now i know thy nightly haunts and how thou drivst wretches possessed to hide themselves in tombs whence i beheld thee midst the herd unclean scour down the steep and plunge into the sea but now a fairer form arrests the eye of hells despotic lord his radiant vest of tyrian purple studded thick with gems flowed graceful he for courts was formed for feasts for ladies chambers and for amorous sports he loved not camps nor the rude toils of war belial his name around his temples twined a wreath of roses and wherever he passed his garments fanned a breeze of rich perfume no ear had he for the shrilltoned trump him the soft warble of the lydian flute delighted rather the lovesoothing harp sapphos loose song and the aonian maids and zoneless graces floating in the dance yet from his lips sweet eloquence distilled as honey from the be but still his voice never counseled aught but cunning and deceit mean truce and base capitulating terms therefore by satan held in slight account for devils affect a dignity in sin last in the field and from the rest apart was mammon cautious was his step and slow his eye still watchful to prevent surprise squalid his vesture and his locks uncombd for gain and usury engrossed his soul nor other care had he but to amass wealth unenjoyd and gloat upon his hoard had there been only happiness in heaven and gold in hell mammon had spurned the bliss and hugged the treasure cheaply earned with pain his princes thus reviewed from the hill top satan swiftglancing flew and in the midst rose like a meteor whereat all the host sent up a general shout he with his hand gave sign and wheeled the stygian phalanx round horrible sight a theater of fiends and each the foe of man idols and imps wizzards familiars sprites phantasmas dreams sorrows and pains and deaths in every shape covered the blasted heath the infernal king though in his heart by mutinous passions torn thought clashd with thought and all was anarchy yet with assumed composure beckning forth his princes whilst the inferior throng stood off and mute attention reigned in few thus spoke friends and confederates welcome for this proof of your affiance thanks on every call whether we need your counsel or your arms joyful i see your ready zeal displays virtues which hell itself cannot corrupt i mean not to declame the occasion told speaks its own import and the times dispatch all waste of words forbids gods son on earth christ the revealed messiah how to oppose is now the question by what force or power  temptations have been tried i name not them  or dark conspiracy we may pull down this sun of righteousness from his bright sphere declare who can i pause for a reply silence ensued whilst every eye was turned instinctively on baal he of all hells magi filled the seat of wisdom chief experienced long in craft and nothing apt to give strait counsel slow of speech he was to hint propound dilate and so entice other opinions forth them to refute and thereon build his own was all his art after long pause and hesitation feigned stale trick of orators he thus began why thus on me as i were worthy me lost being like yourselves as i alone could compass this high argument on me least in your sapient conclave why you point these scrutinizing looks i muse and awed by this your expectation fain would shrink from the great task to silence had you not over these poor faculties such full control as to put by all pleas and call them forth in heaven or earth or hells profound abyss yours in all uses present at all hours our kingly chief has told us we are met to combat christ on earth be it so we yet may try our fortune in another field worse fortune than in heaven befell our arms worse downfall than to hell we cannot prove but with the scene our action too must change how to what warfare circumvention fraud seduction these are earthly weapons these as man to man opposes so must we to christ incarnate there be some who cry hence with such dastard arts war open war i honor such bold counselors and yield all that i can my praise till one be found one that may rival gods own son in power and miracle to miracle oppose more than my praise i cannot my assent i will not give twere madness and how war with god what arms may we employ against him whose very prophets can call down heavens fires upon our priests and altars for myself what powers i had i shall not soon forget what i have left i know and for your use shall husband as i may not vainly risque where they must surely fail the jews pretend that christ colludes with beelzebub the jews as far mistake my nature as my name the fallacy o peers confutes itself forged to disparage christ not honor me oh that i had his wonderworking powers i am not that fool to turn them on myself no my brave friends i have yet too much to lose though babylons proud shrines are laid in dust romes capitol survives and through the world wherever her eagles fly upon their wings they bear my thunder and they spread my fame therefore no more of beelzebub and christ no league no compact can we hold together what then ensues despair perish the thought the brave renounce it and the wise prevent you are both wise and brave our leader says temptations have been tried and tried in vain himself the tempter who will tread that ground where he was foiled for adam a mere toy an apple served christ is not bribed by worlds so much the second man exceeds the first in strength and glory but though christ himself will not be tempted those who hear him may jews may be urged to envy to revenge to murder a rebellious race of old to kill a prophet or betray his god what jew was ever found to need the spur wist ye not what a train this preacher has what followers what disciples these are men mere men frail sons of adam born in sin here is our hope i leave it to your thoughts he ceased but neither murmur nor applause followed his speech for moloch whose fell heart ill stomachd this tame counsel least of all taunts thinly covered under mask of praise sprung forth impetuous and with scowling brow and accent acrimonious thus replied my thoughts it seems are known before i speak war open war is all my note i rise to thank the prophet who thus reads my heart where honesty should wear it in my face that face from danger i did never hide how then from him nor am i by his praise more honored than by his dissenting voice for whilst he counsels circumvention fraud seduction  if my memory wrongs his words i yield it to correction  we stand off wide as the poles apart much i had hoped when the great tempter failed and in your ears sung his own honors dirge we had heard the last of plots and mean temptations mean i call them for great names cannot sanctify mean deeds satan himself knows i opposed the attempt appealed protested my thricehonord chief knows it full well and blushes for the event and are we now caballing how to outwit a few poor harmless fishermen for such are christs disciples how to gull and cheat their simple hearts of honesty oh peers for shame if not for pity leave them that that beggars virtue and is this the theme the mighty theme which now employs the thoughts of your immortal synod shame oh shame princes dominions archangelic thrones imperial lords these were your titles once by these names ye were known above the stars shame not your ancient dignities nor sink beneath the vilest of the sons of men whisperers informers spies if christ be god fight as becomes you to fight with god if man and sure his birth bespeaks no more why all this preparation this consult these mighty machinations and cabals off with your foe at once dismiss him hence where all his brother prophets have been sent where his precursor john is gone before whose voice still echoes through this wilderness  repent ye for gods kingdom is at hand prepare ye the lords way  it is prepared it leads to death it marshals him the road to that oblivious bourne whence none return herod yet lives another royal feast another wanton dance and he for whom so many innocents were slain shall fall once vanquished are we therefore to despair in heaven unequal battle we provoked though vast our host the million was with god on earth enquire of all the nations round whom they will serve with one voice they reply we are their gods they feed us with their blood their sons and daughters they make pass through fire to do us grace if their own flesh they give shall they withold to sacrifice a foe twelve tribes were all jehovah had on earth and ten are lost of this small remnant few and wretched are the friends that league with heaven and where is now christs promised reign on earth when gods own servants rise against his son and those to whom the promises were given revolt from their messiah can we wish greater revenge what need have we to tempt them who have hearts rebellious as our own as prompt to malice no less prone to vex gods righteous spirit and let come what may it comes not to our loss rather our gain let god arise to vengeance let him pour destruction on his temple whose proud height our chief can witness measured by his fall let him not leave one stone upon another as his rash son has menaced let his wrath through all the inhospitable earth disperse his scattered tribes such ever be the fate of all his worshippers may scorn contempt derision be their lot and may their god never recall his curse are we o peers to mourn for his jerusalem our joy springs from confusion enmity twixt god and man is our best triumph for myself war is my harvest then my altars blaze brightest when human victims feed the flame breathless he paused so rapid was the pulse of his highbeating heart he stood as one choked and convulsed with rage when as he ceased he smote his mailed habergeon so loud hells armed legions heard and shook their spears betokning war frowning he looked around whilst from his fiery eyes such terror glanced it seemed as if his pride meant to abash and silence all opposers yet not long his triumph for now belial from the ranks graceful advanced and as he put aside his purple robe in act to speak the throng such was the dazzling beauty of his form fell back a space then stood all eyes and ears in expectation mute as death though hell owned not a spirit more false sensual and base yet ever as he spoke such action graced his words so musically soft they flowed who most despised the pleader praised the speech when thus with mild insinuating looks masking his rancorous heart the fiend began after so many peaceful ages past since first emerging from hells dark abyss roused by our archangelic chief we sprung up to this middle region and here seized on this terrestrial globe created first for man our vassal now where at full ease lords of the elements and gods adored we reign and revel undisturbed of heaven if god whose jealousy be sure ill brooks that this fair world should be so long possessed of us his exiled angels and his name pent up in palestine should now arouse his slumbering wrath and his best strength put forth to wrestle for lost empire and our earth as we in evil hour his heaven assail who of this mighty synod but must own the provocation warrants the retort if then the maker of mankind has cause to meditate their rescue we no less have cause to oppose the attempt and hold them fast to their allegiance in despite of heaven much then we owe to our great leaders care which ever watchful over the public weal calls us to this full council here to meet in grave consult how best we may repair past disappointments and repel the spite of this new champion levelled at our shrines great is the trouble of my thoughts o peers and much perplexed am i with doubts what name nature and office to ascribe to christ in form the lowliest of the sons of men in miracles omnipotent as god whose voice controuls the stoutest of our host bids the graves open and their dead come forth whose very touch is health who with a glance pervades each heart absolves it or condemns whose virgin birth credulity scarce owns and nature disavows praised to all time immortal as himself be the renown of that wise spirit who shall devise the means by force or fraud to overthrow the power of this mysterious foe what shall i say  priest prophet king messiah son of god yet how gods unity which well we know endures no second should adopt a son and essence indivisible divide baffles my weak conjecture let that pass to such hard doctrines i subscribe no faith i will call him man inspired and wait till death gives sentence of mortality upon him meanwhile let circumspection on our part fill all the anxious interim alarm romes jealousy stir up the captious spleen of the proud pharisee beset him round with snares to catch him urge the envious priests for envy still beneath the altar lurks and note the man he trusts mammon could tell though mammon boasts not of his own success how few of human mould have yet withstood his glittering golden lures the sword can kill mans body gold destroys his very soul yet mark me well i counsel not to tempt the master poverty can do no more than his own mortifying penance does hunger and thirst and obstinately starve when his mere wish could make the rock a spring and its hard fragments bread yet sure i am all are not christs in heart who with their lips confess him these are men and therefore frail frail and corruptible and let none say fear prompts this counsel i disclaim all fear but for the general cause in every heart nature has built my altar every sect nation and language with one voice confess pleasure the sovereign good the stoic churl the dogged cynic snarling in his tub and all the ragged moralizing crew are hypocrites philosophy itself is but my votary beneath a cloak it harms not me though every idol god were tumbled from his base alike i scorn sampsons strong nerve and daniels flaming zeal and let christ preach his mortifying rules let him go forth through all the gentile world and on the ruin of our fanes erect his church triumphant over the gates of hell still still mans heart will draw the secret sigh for pleasures unenjoyd the gloomy cell and melancholy fast the midnight prayer and pale contrition weeping over her lamp are penances from which the sense revolts fines that compounding superstition pays for pleasures past or bribes for more to come enough of this vain boast here satan cried more than enough of these voluptuous strains which though they lull the ear disarm the soul of its best attribute not gaudy flowers are culled for medicine but the humble weed true wisdom ever frugal of her speech gives sage advice in plain and homely words the sum of all our reasoning ends in this that nothing but the death of christ can solve the mystery of his nature till he falls scarce can i say we stand all voices then though varying in the means conspire his death some cautiously as baal some with zeal precipitate as moloch whose swift thought vaults over all impediments to seize the goal of his ambition but o peers ours is no trivial care direct your sight along the ranks of that redeemed host on us hangs all their safety night and day my anxious thoughts are laboring in their cause and whilst christ walks the earth i take no rest a watchful spy for ever at his side noting each word and deed sometimes i mix with the selected twelve that page his steps of these though some have waverd none is false save one alone iscariot he by name the taint of avarice has touched his heart i have marked him for my own hear princes hear this night the priests and elders will convene their secret conclave i am in their hearts burning with envy malice and revenge their only thought is how to tangle christ in whom of force i own no guile is found but gentleness instead and perfect truth a lamb in nature without spot and pure fit victim therefore for their paschal rites which now are near at hand apt is the hour apt are the instruments what now remains but to send forth a tempter to persuade iscariot to betray his masters life and damn himself for gold speak is there one one in this patriot circle whom all eyes point out for this emprize most sure there is belial has well predicted of our choice mammon stand forth on thee the election lights he spoke and all approved for choice so fit none could oppose when mammon thus replied prince of this world to whom these armies owe lost but for thee in everlasting night the glorious prospect of yon rising sun it is not to evade the labor but prevent the failure of your hopes that i beseech your wisdom to correct it is choice and lodge this arduous embassy in abler hands nathless if such your will and my compeers adjudge me to this service i submit in me is no repugnance no delay for ever what these toiling hands could do or patient thoughts devise that i have done whether in heaven ordained to undermine gods adamantine throne or doomed to dig the solid sulphur of hells burning soil fearless i wrought and were there no tongues else to vouch my services these scars would speak how many daintier spirits do i see fair as in heaven and in fresh bloom of youth whilst i with shriveld sinews cramped and scorched midst pestilential damps and fiery blasts drag as you see a miserable load agestruck without the last resource of death this for myself no more youre not to know the snares which i employ are golden snares these are my arts and like the crafty slave who in romes circus hurls the fatal net over his fierce pursuer so often times have i entangled the proud hearts of men and made their courage stoop to shameful bribes paid for dishonest deeds perjuries and plots that draw them off from god who else had filled his courts ere now with guests and peopled heaven these weapons and these hands you still command so dear i hold the general cause at heart so disciplined am i in dutys school that reckless of all hazard i present myself your servant or if so fate wills your sacrifice for though from mortal man discomfiture i dread not yet if christ whom the great tempter foiled not shall stand forth the champion of his follower witness for me you my brave peers and this angelic host i sought not this bold height whence if i fall i do but fall where satan could not stand go then exclaimed the archenemy of man go brave adventurer go where glory calls auspicious thoughts engender in my breast and now prophetic visions burst upon me i see the traitor judas with a band of midnight ruffians seize his peaceful lord they drag him to the bar accuse condemn he bleeds he dies darkness involves the rest ascend the air brave spirit and midst the shout of grateful myriads wing thy course to fame he said and pointing to the sacred towers of gods high temple waved his sceptred hand whereat the infernal armies gave a shout that shook the rocky desert to its base meanwhile the fiend ambassador of hell exulting heard his high election crowned with these applauding voices and the call of his great chieftain echoed to the skies pride swelled his conscious breast no longer now crouching with age and pain but nervd anew as with a spell transformed erect he stood with towering stature tallest of the throng and looks of high supremacy and state and now from either shoulder he unfurled his widestretchd pinions and uprising swift towerd in midair the host with loud acclaim hailed his ascent he on the wellpoisd wing hoverd awhile till from his cloudy height sweeping the wide horizon he descried far in the west the holy city of god his destined port then to the orient sun turned his broad vans and plied their utmost speed end of the first book calvary or the death of christ  book ii  the argument of the second book mammon alighting on the holy mount assumes the form and character of a levite and under that appearance goes in search of judas iscariot he meets that disciple most opportunely for his purpose in a solitary place and entering into conversation with him pretends a commission from the priests and elders for engaging him in their service with the promise of a reward and urges many insidious arguments for detaching him from his master they separate with a promise on the part of judas to report his final answer to the priests that evening christ is now brought to view sitting in the midst of his disciples at his last supper he addresses them in those solemn and affecting terms recorded in the gospel of saint john washes their feet foretells his death and points out to them his betrayer in the person of judas then present the traitor perceiving himself discovered hastily departs christ pitying the affliction of his disciples tenderly consoles them with the promise of his support under their future tribulations and concludes with an aweful invocation to the father in their behalf whereupon warning them that his hour is come he goes forth to the garden a reflection naturally springing from the subject addressed to unbelievers closes the book  calvary book ii the last supper now on the consecrated mount of god mammon invisible to mortal eye stooping the wing from his aerial height with feet unhallowed lands a direful pest farthest from heaven of all that outcast crew who fell from bliss fit messenger was he and fatal was their choice who sent him forth to work corruptions purpose in mans heart for in his power excelling he can take the semblance of each virtue shift each form and turn and turn new faces on the world till he has snared a soul then he appears in nature as he is loathsome obscene rapacious as those filthy monsters feigned by fabling poets of amphibious breed harpies of earth and ocean the foul spawn half brute half human with cadaverous face horribly pale and hollow hungry eye glaring aghast with wings outstretchd to chase and talons crookd to pounce their mangled prey and now by devilish spell transformed he seems a reverend levite bearded to the waist hypocrisy never wore a graver mask and still with wolflike watch he prowls around if happily in those haunts he might surprise occasion to put forth his damning arts and from the flock of their good shepherd cull one tainted straggler one whose sordid soul avarice might tempt to take the price of blood and sacrifice the son of god for gold of christ no care had he but to elude his vigilance which still was all his dread nor of the twelve save judas was there one whom to assail on him alone on him son of perdition rested all the hopes of satan and his legions now the fiend with ineffectual search had coasted all the sacred region round and in the shade beneath the temple porch awhile reposed listening the converse of the idle crowd the sun then high at noon and much they talked of christ and his great miracles of some elias deemed of some the baptist john risen from the dead but by all tongues confessed a prophet mighty both in word and deed silent the whilst in secret musings wrapped the wizard spirit stood when all at once loud voices strike his ear and strait comes one leaping and bounding midst the shouting throng a cripple new restored the very bed which from his birth the palsied wretch had pressed now in it is turn was carried and to all triumphantly exposed behold he cried the token of my cure i am the man whom ye all knew and this the doleful bed on which fast bound in misery and pain helpless before your charitable gates i laid and begged for pity and relief lo i am free mark how these newfound limbs nimbly the healthrestoring voice obey christ gave the word he spoke and i am whole this whilst he heard conviction smote the fiend his conscious heart a sudden tremor seized and off he slunk abashed a winding path led down the mount and here as he pursued in gloomy thought his solitary way behold by happy chance the man he sought iscariot and alone joy flushed the cheek of the incarnate demon thus to find his labor in auspicious moment crowned hail son of simon peace be to thee friend fairly encountered art thou in good hour the priestlike tempter cried thy worth is known to all our levites from whose tribe i come with friendly greeting charged this night they meet in special conclave our chief pontiff there will in the holy convocation move points of high import to our ancient law questions it much imports thee to hear and well accepted shall thou be of all who with large recompense and honors due will greet thee so complying i have said grave sir i know thee not judas replied yet for thy greeting thanks and peace for peace as holy men becomes to him the fiend unknown i well may be who night and day serving gods altar rarely stir abroad and little commerce hold with this great world but thee i know one of that teachers train who walks at large nor shuns the haunts impure of sinners and of publicans alas that one of thy wise bearing should be seen in such base fellowship paging his steps calling him lord and master whom the world in mere derision suffers to grow up to fullblown vanity at once to crush but good report is pregnant with thy name as one exempted from the general scorn and sure i am thou will not so abase and lower thy nobler thoughts to one so mean vile and mechanic to the drivling crew of children and of women leave that task to peter and his brethren of the net fine reasoning we shall have and well be schooled when fishermen turn preachers and instill doctrines and laws which moses never taught woe to our scribes rare mockery of the world and the worlds wisdom if these simple folk lured from their daily drudgery should set up fishers of men the synagogue to them a barren element will never yield such gainful earnings as the sea affords and what is christ that judas so should court his starving service what so tempting lure has this deceiver to beguile thy hopes not of this world my kingdom he has said yet of this world are we in this alone we live and move here only we expect or pain or pleasure all that lies beyond in the unknown abyss is dark as death and wherefore carriest thou that bag about a beggar needs no treasurer and thy lord feeds but by miracle alas for him who serves a master that keeps sabbath fasts forty long days in the bare wilderness makes poverty his passport into heaven and bids us throw away lifes present means for doubtful chance of interest after life and art thou of all reason so bereft as to account prosperity a crime or think none blessed but him whose every step through miserys thorny path is marked with blood o son of simon take thy last resolve either resign thy body to the worm and die with christ or him renounce and live rich honored prosperous and enjoy the world the fiend now paused well pleased that he had gained audience so large when judas in whose soul the poisonous instillation gan to work thus to corruptions advocate replied that christ rejected and despised of men has in this world no part i freely grant therefore if we his followers who renounce things present build our hopes upon a dream of what shall never come we are of all most miserable if we who bid farewell to all that nature holds most dear to share sorrows and pains and poverty with christ find not those blissful mansions in the heaven which he has promised if when all is past and this sad scene concludes no reckoning comes no grateful compensation after death hard is our fate and much has he abused our weak credulity but still these hopes of an expected glory though with doubt and darkness clouded faint yet not extinct yield not to words words made them what they are christs words and surely man never spoke like him wherefore if these your doctors of the law invite me to their conclave but to hear a railing accusation i hold off from their assembly and to christ adhere as to the better reasner and though poor the servant equal is the masters lot poor as the poorest houseless and forlorn a man of sorrows nor can we complain whilst he of all we suffer still partakes first in all labors penances and pains you ask and bid me take my last resolve if i will give this body to the worm and die with christ to die is natures dread instinctively she loathes the gloomy grave and turns a longing eye to light and life but fortune gives to all things their degrees to them who bask in sunshine through the day night comes with double sadness whilst to me who toil from morn to noon from noon to eve yet nothing but a dim horizon see lowering in clouds darkness is nothing strange nor death a terror wealth presents no dower to wed me to the world no pleasures cling around my heart no soft affections woo my longer stay on earth there to prefer brief joys possessed to hope of future bliss thus whilst he plaind the subtle tempters ear caught the soft murmur that betrays the soul the sigh capitulating virtue breathes when from her last defenses she retreats whereat a bolder tone he now assumed and thus the wavering false disciple plied all joys that gold can purchase wait your choice rich to your hearts ambition you shall be nor only rich but rescued from a doom so dreadful had you all the wealth in store which the sea covers or the earth contains twere well bestowed to purchase your redemption with christ impending death with me you meet life with encircling pleasures throw aside that beggars purse your starving office spurn serve gods high priest whose treasury is full cast those few mites away the scanty dole of some contaminating lepers hand for which you bid god heal him and pass on whilst he good credlous soul cries out amain as powerful fancy works lo i am clean behold a miracle but gold performs greater and happier miracles than this gold with a touch can heal the minds disease quicken the slowpaced blood and make it dance in tides of rapture through each thrilling vein cast out that worst of demons poverty and with a spell exorcise the sad heart haunted with specter of despair and spleen if then this prize can tempt thee if thy soul still thirsts for life for riches for repose if in thy breast there dwells that manly scorn which slighted merit feels when envious pride thrusts it aside to build the unworthy up now now assert it from a master turn who turns from thee who before thee exalts thy meaner brethren peter james and john on them his partial smile for ever beams they have his love his confidence his heart of them revolting he might well complain of thee he cannot thine were just revenge he is no traitor who resents a wrong who shares no confidence can break no trust bid conscience then be still let no weak qualms damp thy reviving spirit but when night wraps her dark curtain round this busy world come thou to caiaphas there will be found our priests and scribes in council to attaint and bring to judgment this presumptuous man who boasts himself messiah son of god if thou to whom his midnight haunts are known his secret incantations and his spells by which he does those feats that cheat our sight wilt to those guilty haunts conduct our guard and render up his person to the law much praise and large reward shall thou receive if thou will not  but wherefore should i doubt i would persuade not threaten know withal it is not thou it is justice gives the blow the law will have its victim think thou that we to whom the custody is given of gods prophetic oracles ordained to guard his worship and expound his laws will let this innovating teacher spurn our holy order mock our ancient rites profane our sabbaths and himself exalt coequal with jehovah to confound his unity and claim divided power no let death arbitrate twixt him and us if he be very christ death shall not dare to aim his dart at immortality his incorruption shall defy the grave if man blaspheming man he justly dies living or dying thus his fate dispells all mystery truth starts of force to light and god is glorified in either case he ceased and on the traitor fixed a look which like the serpents fascinating eye gazed motions power away sullen he stood as with a spell entranced the aweful sense of his great masters virtue and the dread of an hereafter terrible to thought no longer served to hold the wizard fiend and his fell arts at bay the word of truth sown on the surface of his stony heart had perished without root religions lamp faint and more faint as mammons crafty breath blew up the storm of passion now expired in his benighted soul there rankling pride malicious envy avarice and revenge leagued with hells minister and uncontrolled their impious orgies held at length the wretch to calm deliberate treachery resigned with all the unrighteous mammon in his heart and vile prevarication on his lips thus with consent in dubious phrase implied the grand seducer of mankind dismissed great is the peril of the attempt you urge for great the power of him you would destroy therefore if i demand some pause for thought deem it not much your offers shall be weighed but now no more occasions call me hence this night the master has convokd the twelve to keep the sacred feast ordained of god with bread unleavened and the paschal lamb thither though last and in his favor leaft i go a cited guest there whilst i sit unnoticd at his tables lowest foot my meditations shall recall your words and ponder them apart say to your priests those conservators of our ancient law this night they may expect my last resolve and now behold the lengthening shadow marks the evening hour that warns me hence farewell this said their confrence ended they embrace as friends who plight their faith upon the touch so quick the infection ran so dire the blight the poisonous ferment on the instant reached iscariots tainted heart and now he burnt with the fell lust of gold joy seized the fiend for well he knew how mortal to the soul that deadly aconite the growth of hell oh wretch for ever lost for ever cursed whom mammon thus embraces who shall wake thy conscience from its lethargy who now shall stop the courses of that baneful drug and stem the swift destruction it is too late better for thee had thou never seen the light or lost it ere this fatal hour had birth thy doom is sealed hell has its hour of joy thou traitor an eternity of woe the meditation of thy heart shall hurl thee to perdition and thy lord to death now judas down the mountain turned his steps not so the tempter he from the high rock exalted where he stood his impious eye glanced over the city of god full in his view from east to west in moony crescent stretched here yet jehovah was adored here reigned all else to satan and his idol gods through earths wide range belonged to their dire names each temple echoed every knee was bowed how often even here upon his holy hill did judahs kings with their polluted groves affront gods house and pagan altars raise to chemos milcom ashtaroth and all the host of heaven within his sacred courts witness that impious king who passed his son through fire to moloch homicidal god which roused the almightys vengeance and entailed mournful captivity on all his race hither as to the deluged world of old in promised time the dove of peace was sent upon this ararat his sacred mount he rested hence salvation dawned on man him to destroy the tempter now aspired secure of his new convert firmly leagued in his dire plot and to perdition sealed nor rested on that mount the darkling fiend nor further need had he of priestly garb than till he saw iscariot join the train of christ and his disciples then at once to his own airy properties dissolved a spirit invisible with eager speed to hells assembled chiefs he winged his flight the sun had sunk beneath the western hills and now at evening hour the jews prepare to celebrate their passover ordained to eternize their deliverance when gods wrath smote every firstborn male in mizraims coast save where the blood of lamb piacular sprinkling the consecrated door was found of the destroying angel to this feast prelusive of his own pure sacrifice and type of his bloodshedding jesus came the guests were present and the table spread with loins begirt as men upon the march and staff in hand they snatch a hasty meal this done in pensive meditation rapt the savior conscious of impending death sat in the midst to his allpresent mind the treason and the traitor stood confessed lowering abashed and from the rest apart iscariot at the tables lowest foot took post where best he might escape that glance from whose intelligence no heart could hide its guilty meditations all eyes else were centered on the saviors face divine which with the brightness of the godhead mixed traces of human sorrow and displayed the workings of a mind where mercy seemed struggling to reconcile some mortal wrong to pardon and forbearance such a look made silence sacred every tongue was mute even peters zeal forbore the vent of words or spent itself in murmurs half suppressed at length the meek redeemer raised his eyes where gentle resignation tempering grief beamed grace ineffable on all around and with these words the awful silence broke muse not if i am sad nor stand aghast as doubtful of my constancy these pangs and more which i must suffer were foreseen the hour now coming comes not by surprise it is the consummation of my charge and fills the measure of atonement up shall i then say father avert this hour and save me from these agonies not so with heart prepared to suffer and submit i meet my doom forewarned yet ere we part take this last office from your masters hands and when you see me stoop to wash your feet as soon as you shall remember it is your lord your dying lord this legacy bequeaths and edify by his humility this said his seamless mantle he threw off and girt his tunic close about his waist and now with mute amazement they beheld the son of god in servantlike attire prepared to execute his menial task all gazed all wondered but no voice opposed none dared to pray forbearance of the deed till he whose heart was ever on his lips peter in warm expostulation cried lord do thou wash my feet thy servants feet mean as the dust he treads on never lord never shall thou do that for one so vile so allunworthy that be far from thee such homage ill beseems thee to pay me to receive  to him the lord replied peter as yet thou know not what i do hereafter thou shall know therefore no more cease to oppose for if i wash thee not with me thou have no part  struck to the soul with horror at the thought his eager words winged with the flame of rhapsody burst forth oh not my feet alone my hands my head wash me all over and sanctify each part there needs not this the meek redeemer cried enough is done thus washed though but in part thou shall be clean throughout yet i will not say ye are all clean spite of the shepherds care the taint has touched his flock alas for him on whom the foul contamination lights woe to that wretch that ever he was born and do ye need a comment to expound this lesson of humility and lore ye call me lord and master well ye say for such in truth i am if then your lord be meek and lowly will not ye renounce pride and contention if the master stoops to wash his feet who serves shall ye do less to these your equal brethren learn of me and each with other deal as i with you write on your hearts my words the time draws nigh when i shall speak no more with you on earth ye have all heard how blessed if ye obey i speak not of you all whilst here ye sit in seeming fellowship around my board sharing this social meal my last on earth doubt not but i can search into your breasts and see whose hearts are loyal whose is false and mark me well i fall not by mans wiles not unpredicted is the traitorous act and well i know the wretch whose faithless hand dips with me in the dish shall soon be died with my devoted blood betrayed i am deceived i cannot be   this when they heard each with the other interchangd a look of question and suspect speechless they stard confounded and aghast as men drawn forth for decimation tremble to unfold the lot of life or death so these in doubt on whom the word of prophecy might light curious yet fearful to enquire of christ searched their own hearts in silence all perceived omniscience which to god alone belongs familiar with their thoughts and every soul save that dire wretch whom conscience inly smote trembled lest unpremeditated guilt might be denounced upon him or the sin of one man as of korah move the lord with the whole congregation to be wroth but peter in whose everanxious mind these terrors undispelld long could not dwell to the beloved disciple on the breast of christ reclining now gave sign to ask the fearful question in what traitors heart plot so accursed could harbor thus besought though much his humble nature feared offense in accent soft with supplicating eye turned on the master the meek suitor said lord show thy true and faithful servants grace and let us know the traitor  he it is jesus replied on whom i shall bestow this sop when i have dipped it in my cup he said and as he plunged the morsel in all eyes were fixed upon the fatal work wondering on whom he would bestow the spell and soon with silent horror they beheld the saturated sop to judas given pledge of perdition he with greedy haste devoured it by the fiend within him urged for mammon to the dark divan had told the joyful tidings and had posted back swift as the magic whirlwind conjured up by all hells wizard imps could drive him on and now sat nestling in the traitors heart brooding his filthy spawn great was the joy of the infernal tempter thus to find that guardian power whose providence he feared by these symbolic elements withdrawn and his apostate victim now cast out from the lords supper alien from gods grace and soulsurrenderd to hells gloomy realm now as the spell within him gan to work the traitors visage like the troubled sea uptorn and furrowed with tempestuous winds shifted it is hues now deadly pale aghast and horrorstruck now fiery red deformed with hellish rage and from mans semblance changed to very demon terrible to sight oh what a fall from heaven to deeper hell than thought can fathom horrors worse than heart of man unless abandoned of his god can suffer or conceive words do but fail to paint that unreveald abyss those depths of the immeasurable profound where groans wailings and woes and tossings amidst fires unquenchable await the wretch condemned meanwhile in cloudless majesty and mild the saviors face divine on all around effulgent beamed about his temples shone a radiant glory this when judas saw whom now the spirit of darkness had possessed and none such in the sphere of that pure light long could abide he started from his couch prepared for flight when thus in few the lord  go then and what thou have in hand to do do quickly so depart  the word of power though gentle yet commanding judas heard and instantly the spirit took him thence nor could he not obey for so rebuked the prince of hell satan himself had fled the faithful remnant sat in mute suspense pondering what this dismission might import the master with a glance discerned their thoughts he saw them in profound conjecture lost humbled in heart and sad their honor stained by base defection and their faith convulsed when thus at once to strengthen and console their wavering minds these healing words he spoke let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me his son doubt not but in the compass of the heavens my father will provide for all his saints mansions of peace seats of eternal bliss where spirits made perfect after death shall dwell and rest from earthly toils thither i go to seal your sure election and prepare for you my faithful servants an abode that as in sorrow here so there in bliss with me your lord now dying for your sakes ye may surmount the grave and ever live in heavenly communion undisturbed lament not therefore if i now depart your provident precursor for ye know whither i go and also know the way lord we are ignorant and dimsighted men thomas replied we see not what thou see and as it stands not in our reach to guess whither thou go how should we know the way i am the way the inspired teacher cried i am the truth the life none can approach the father but by me me had ye known this blindness had been done away and now behold him present  where still doubting cried one of the astonished number oh impart that intellectual vision to discern and see the father set him in our view in form demonstrative we ask no more say thou resumed the lord and have i been so long familiar yet so little known will not the works o philip i have done done in thy sight instruct thee whence i am and what my power does there need light for this midst the broad blaze of proofs that shines about thee can thou not see gods presence in his power of this mortality which ye behold this fleshly self i speak not it is the spirit the virtue of my father which is in me in act how visible in voice how strong clear and express and can you see and hear and yet withhold belief oh slow of faith if words cannot persuade let works convince if miracles which only god can do are done before your eyes how say you then show us the father sanctify your hearts from fear and terror though the hour comes on when to the silent mansions of the dead from this impenitent world i must withdraw mourn not but let your grief be turned to joy for as in me the father so in him i live and move my spirit though unseen still present shall protect and hover over you i will not leave you comfortless my name shall be your tower of refuge with my peace now dying i endow you of that peace the powers of this world never shall despoil you and in my name whatever ye shall ask believing ye shall have by faith in me ye shall command the elements uplift the everlasting mountains by their roots and whelm them in the center of the sea this in my name potential ye shall do and greater works than this by faith in me ye shall confront the oppressor midst the shock of tribulations and the angry scorn of a malignant world abhorred despised thrust from their synagogues ye shall possess your souls in patience glorying to endure like tribulation with your martyred lord despair nor therefore for before that day a comforter shall come whom i will send and he shall teach you all things when ye stand before the judgment seat of impious men friendless accused environed with a throng of perjured witnesses athirst for blood your guardian spirit shall provide a voice action and eloquence and prompt your lips with untaught languages to sound my name with tongue miraculous through all the world wars then and rumors and portentous signs famine and earthquakes and disastrous plagues shall vex the nations prophets shall arise with lying divinations to confound the weak pervert the wavering and perplex the very saints themselves await the time these are but harbingers of mightier woes the day of terror is but in it is dawn the powers of earth and heaven must undergo direful convulsion this majestic pile this temple shall become so mere a wreck that not one stone shall rest upon another then shall your hour of tribulation come then to confess my name shall be your crime by torture and by death to be atoned the tyrants of the world shall then let loose their persecuting rage and great shall be the fallingoff of many rocks and caves shall be your hidingplaces yet from thence your sound shall echo to the farthest ends of the redeemed earth from those dark cells the beams of revelation shall break forth maugre the powers of hell and blessed is he whose faith unshaken shall abide the time till the great end and consummation comes my peace and my salvation to ensure few are the moments now and passing swift which thus conversing we have yet in hand servants no more henceforth i call you friends therefore as friends and children let your love each to the other knit your hearts together in brotherly communion this command new to the world i give you let good will and peace and concord harmonize your souls and mark you as the followers of him whose every act was charity whose life was spent and closed expiring for your sakes and stronger proof of love what man can give than to yield up his body to the grave and die as shortly i shall for his friends time was that i have shadowed out my speech in proverbs and allusions time now is to cast obscurity aside and show the unveiled glories of the father to you henceforward ye shall ask of him and have my name for your petitions shall suffice my prayers ye need not for the fathers love without an intercessor shall protect mine as you love me and prevent your wants from him i came into this world to him this world now leaving i again return this said conviction smote their glowing hearts with faith and hopes bright image new inspired and scenes of future glory beaming on them when thus with voices joined in loud acclaim christ in the godhead manifest they hailed now lord we hear and understand thy words plain words and not in parables involved now are we sure all knowledge is revealed all power committed to thee from above and without further question we believe and henceforth know thou came forth from god do ye at length believe the master cried behold the hour comes on yea now is come when your strong faith shall stagger at the scene of these impending horrors and shrink back confounded and appalled to the four winds wide as your fears can spread you all shall fly and leave me struggling with a storm of woes unfriended and alone what did i say alone i cannot be for in me dwells the father ever present let this thought arm you with constancy to meet the shock of tribulation and withstand the powers of this brief world for to your comfort know i have overcome the world this said he paused and sat whilst all were hushed as one entranced so fast the heavenly vision poured upon him then with uplifted eyes and heaving breast full of his god this solemn prayer breathed forth o father give thy glory to the son as he has glorified thy name on earth and these whom thou have given him taught to know thee the true god alone and jesus christ thy messenger and advocate with thee for lost mankind father to me restore that glory which was mine before all time or ever the world was made and man fell off from his obedience now at length redeemed from sin by my atonement and made heir of life eternal purchased with my blood the act of mediation is complete thy work is finished and thy name gone forth to these of thine election thine they were to me thou gavst them and they have received and kept as faithful witnesses thy word for them i pray the world which now i leave has no more part in me for them alone not for the world i pray they must abide i shall depart and be at peace with thee o holy father keep them in thy name whole and entire linked in the bond of faith firm as i hold them one alone is lost son of perdition him the prophets saw in their prospective visions and foretold that so thy son should suffer but for these they are unstained they stand not in the guilt and condemnation of that wretch accursed i pray thee not to take them from the world through which i send them forth as shining lights to draw mens eyes and hearts and guide their search to the bright source whence thy salvation beams these are my ministers as i am thine oh sanctify them through thy truth for them and all through them converted to thy word father i pray translate them in thy time from this unquiet world to that high state of heavenly bliss where they may dwell with me and see my glory so shall they receive thy love through me transfused into their hearts and rest from all their sorrows in thy peace so spoke the lord and with these gracious words his faithful remnant cheered for soft they fell as heavens blessed dew upon the thirsty hills and sweet the healing balm which they distilled on sorrowwounded souls  now treacherous eve crept silent on and threw her dusky veil over natures face masking the deeds of men the savior rose for in his conscious breast a warning voice had whispered up arise go forth to death one solemn act remains one sacrifice it is now gods wrath demands atonement a whole worlds redemption now hangs on the minutes point behold him then a voluntary victim leading forth his sad disciples to the fatal spot where treason lurked in ambush for his life where stood the prince of darkness and his powers armed with commissioned terrors to assail him single him forsaken him opposed to myriads whilst heavens angels soared aloof trembling spectators of the unequal strife who now so comfortless as gods own son his soul in woes unutterable whelmed all commerce with its native heaven denied pressed down to earth nor other strength had he than in his human nature might be found to combat more than human agonies accumulated pangs which all the sins of all the world from loss of paradise by mans first fall to the last damning page of heavens black register had pild upon him the mass of ages oh what tongue can speak the love of our redeemer and yet man ungrateful impious man hourly reviles his benefactors name affects the style of sophistry and metaphysic pride to quibble with salvation and renounce those guides that lead us by the hand to heaven this they call reason this mans natural right to question his creator and in pride of independent dignity reject salvation rather than consent to own gods privilege to save him by such means as to gods wisdom best and meetest seemed such monsters does this teeming earth produce impious audacity which dares to say  i need no mediator i disclaim christ and his offered peace twixt god and me i want no advocate to plead my cause by my own rectitude i stand or fall the evangelic volumes i regard as fabricated tales of juggling tricks witnessed by none but partners in the craft deep read in pagan story i confront the sacred records with the silent page of those who register no strange eclipse no noonday darkness not one friendly groan of sympathising nature to attest christs dying hour  shut shut the book of life go to the jews the pagans for thy creed go to the dust blasphemer in the ear of death whisper thy doubts and learn of him thy follys confutation and thy doom in those sad realms to which he shall conduct thy trembling soul when the archangels trump has summoned thee to judgment and set open the grave thy rashness deemed for ever closed end of the second book calvary or the death of christ  book iii  the argument of the third book iscariot having separated himself from christ wanders through the streets of the city in a disconsolate manner and at length arrives at the brook cedron without the gates here he breaks forth into soliloquy in which after reviewing his past situation he affects to justify his present motives for betraying his master to the priests christ and his disciples proceeding to the mount of olives are discovered by him as they are passing the brook in their way thither and judas resolves upon availing himself of the opportunity for delivering christ into the hands of his enemies in the mean time the priests and elders assemble in the palace of caiaphas and there hold a council upon the measures to be pursued for the apprehension of christ the high priest harangues the assembly to this immediate purport in the interim judas is announced and being admitted makes his proposal to the council this produces some observations on the part of caiaphas and is objected to by nicodemus who after delivering his opinion quits the assembly caiaphas then takes up the matter afresh controverts the sentiments of nicodemus and with the approbation of all present closes with the proposals of judas and sends out a company with that traitorous disciple to the mount of olives there to apprehend the person of christ the assembly breaks up and the hall is no sooner evacuated by the priests and elders than their seats are filled by satan and his infernal spirits satan addresses to them a congratulatory speech on the success of mammons temptation on whom he bestows many high encomiums an ovation takes place in honor of that demon when chemos appears wounded by the spear of gabriel whom he had encountered on the mount of olives where he had been posted as a spy upon the motions of christ and his disciples satan enraged at the account sallies forth with a resolution to revenge the attack by punishing the temerity of gabriel arms himself for the occasion and after much proud vaunting of his superior prowess disappears and the infernal spirits disperse  calvary book iii the treason of judas dark came the evening on and the pale moon now faintly glimmering through a wintry cloud shed her dim horrors over the shadowy earth whilst through the silent streets with step disturbed and heart by hellish meditations rent the outcast of the lord pursued his way iscariot name for evermore accursed onward he went unquestioned unobserved for all upon this solemn night kept house nor stopped till forth the city gates he came to cedrons brook whose bubbling current laves the olivecrowned mount favored of christ for its umbrageous groves and silent haunts for prayer and contemplation fit retreat here first as one awakened to new thoughts starting he checked his step and with a groan that rent his laboring bosom thus broke forth oh my torn heart oh soultormenting scenes can i forget the blissful hours i have passed beneath your shades liftning the masters words when as he spoke of heaven and heavenly joys of righteousness and the blessed spirits with god such life in his description glowed methought all paradise was present to my view and courted me to enter heaven and earth must i remember never man like him could with such magic eloquence entrance the senses of his hearers lift the soul to heavenly contemplations and transport to thoughts beyond itself thence to look down upon this lower world and all it is cares it is pains it is persecutions with contempt sometimes envelopd in mysterious schemes and parables he couched the moral truth which painted on the memory left it is tints indelible but when with tongue inspired the fall of nations he foretold and drew the curtain of futurity aside when in the pomp of numbers he described jerusalem beleaguered with a host of gentile foes and trodden down to dust her matrons and her virgins whelmed in blood or dragged to violation shame and bondage by ruffian spoilers when his soaring flight spurning the worlds wide compass scaled the skies and there amidst the empyrean fields as in his proper region shook the spheres of sun moon stars as with a masters hand and showed them falling in prophetic awe of his own glorious coming in a cloud with power and state supernal then our hearts with sympathetic raptures burnt within us and we vain mortals saw or thought we saw our own vile bodies glorified to share in his triumphant entry and ourselves to dignities and thrones and starry spheres exalted loftiest in the realms of light but now these bright illusions are no more vanished these glittering scenes my claims on heaven all cancelled and my hopes a bankrupts dream mocking the haunted fancy with a pile of visionary wealth behold me shamed banished his board detected and my thoughts turned outward to provoke my brethrens scorn and blazon forth his prescience let that pass traitor pronounced a traitor i will be that prophecy at least shall be fulfilled though master of my will i could refute and dash his bold prediction yet my heart ponders revenge more suited to it is wrongs greater than such slight triumph can bestow and not less terrible than death itself this night the last that he shall walk at large this night shall be his triumph or his fall if these grave elders who conspire his death these reverend priests revolt not from the deed that casts on them their function and their tribe the peril of his blood why should my heart shrink from it is purpose what have i to fear in act subordinate in cause supreme traitor prejudged of uncommitted crimes arraigned and thrown upon the world condemned more he had said but like a serpent coild with sudden start he shrunk into himself and listening held his breath to catch the sound of steps that echoing over the flinty soil bespoke a company in near approach with these the masters wellknown voice he heard whereat like murderous cain when called of god the cowring conscious outcast slunk aside and wrapped his russet cloak about his head then darkling stood the holy troop meanwhile forded the shallow brook and held their way strait to the olive mount their wonted haunt forth sprung the lurking caitiff from his watch the greedy mammon rushed upon his heart glorying that now he held them in his net darkness conspiring with occasions apt of hour and place to make his vengeance sure remorse was dead within him every sense of virtue lost yet in his coward breast such languor dread and cold repugnance dwelt scarce could the breath of hells worst fiend suffice to blow it into flame now sudden rage impelled him onward now with palsied fear struck back he reeled and shook in every joint this satan saw and evermore at hand to drive the wavering sinner to his doom breathed all his spirit upon him direr blast cocytus never vented the full tide of aconite engendered with his blood his brain set every fevrish nerve in play and screwed his heated fancy to the pitch of daring and defiance yet the wretch not less a traitor to himself than christ or ever the acting of the dreadful deed thus strove by sophistry to gloss it over why do i doubt what horrors shake my mind why should not my affronted honor stir me to betray as their insulted law provokes our elders to destroy their foe for moses they i for myself oppose and where is the wrong if he who knows my heart and all it is meditations will not deign to turn it from it is purpose and divert the danger he foreknows nay rather helps to lure the embryo treason into birth either his own free will makes death it is choice and so becomes accomplice in the deed or else foredoomd to die he knows his hour and thus not acting of ourselves but ruled by strong necessity we stand absolved mere guiltless tools and instruments of fate what then why let the scriptures be fulfilled let prophecies which are the voice of god sound out his knell we fight not against heaven let christ if glory waits him in the grave descend into the dust and seek it there if his soul covets to make league with death and dwell in consort with corruptions worm what time more apt for death than this dark hour image of death itself and who so fit as gods high priest the temples minister to put lifes intervening veil aside and usher him to glory i meanwhile his humble harbinger will go before to announce his coming and make clear the road that leads to death the goal of his ambition yet how if all this tame indifference be but a feint to draw the world about him and then amaze them with some grand display of wonderworking power and who can tell how far his hand miraculous may stretch who from the tomb plucked forth the festring corpse of shrouded lazarus three days in earth and bade him live again stupendous act this we beheld and hailed him lord of life but still the unconverted jews stood off and deemed us witnesses of slight account weak credlous men first dupd and thence become associates in imposture what remains but instantly to put my thoughts in act and yield him up to those who in the attempt succeeding vindicate their disbelief failing abide the shame of their defeat in this or that opinion there must be a dangerous error to persist were fatal this night dispells all doubt if he be christ he lives confessed and triumphs over death if man he falls unpitied and abjured thus for foul deeds pretending fair excuse the caitiff wretch on traitorous errand bent back through the city gates pursued his way and to his nightly assignation hied perched on the summit of the sacred mount shouldring gods temple a proud palace stood there dwelt the sovereign pontiff and this night held solemn convocation and consult not for gods glory other cares had they cares nearer to their selfish hearts concerns heaven had no part in impious dire cabals how to prevent the dayspring from on high now by christs revelation and his acts miraculous just dawning on the world aforetime wrapped in darkness black as death best veil for their hypocrisy and craft in their great hall of council there in ranks precedencies and dignities disposed doctors and longrobd pharisees and scribes and bearded elders met senate to whom for machinations plots and secret wiles romes purple conclave stoops high over all on throne pontifical in robes of state with sacred ephod girt of various hues and breast plate glittering bright with mystic gems mitrecrownd caiaphas the temples chief exalted sat the sanhedrim was full all came whom lust of power or bigot zeal or enmity to christ roused to the call mouthworshippers of god agents of hell in heart and hypocrites abhorred of christ to public scorn held up and pictured out as rebel husbandmen who basely slew their lords commissioned son scarce was there one whose galled conscience had not felt the sting of some keen truth extorted from the lips of the elsehumble jesus meek to all but the proud pharisee or cavilling scribe to knaves who thought by cunning to outwit wisdom itself and snare him in his talk to hypocrites who fasted often with sad and woeworn faces to be seen of men or such as made long prayers for a display of righteousness and vaunted their good deeds mocking their conscience and insulting heaven to these in all the majesty of truth frowning he spoke nor spared he for rebuke severe indignant many a time and often to their whole sect he had denounced woe woe trebled on their heads what wonder then if thus combined by interest to oppose his spreading glories their envenomed hearts rankled with envy hatred and revenge nor were there wanting to their great divan those who can work unseen within the heart dark ministers who know to touch the springs and cords whose movements can convulse the soul with furious passions bursting from their mine like sulfurous fires that tear the quaking earth satan himself was there for at this hour he and his host had furlough upon earth demons of blood ambition envy strife ranged the vexed world at large loud were their tongues and fiery hot their zeal against the lord whose miracles resounding through the land rung in their ears the downfall of their power illomend knell  brethren it is time to rouse cried caiaphas and started from his throne furious as korah when at his tent door with his rebellious company he stood and waving high his censer called aloud to mutiny against moses so now called with voice as loud and deeper plunged in crime than these who sunk outright this second priest this worse revolter against god himself in his own son reflected from his state high over their heads exalted he looked down on all beneath then with uplifted eyes and hands extended as in act to rend his robes pontifical  yes sacred seers again he cried yes venerable priests elders and reverend sages of our law it is more than time to call your vengeance up awake ye sleep too long for me your slave servant of servants me by how much more in place exalted so much more in heart abasd as meritless of such high state i were content to cast these robes aside pluck off this beard and on this mitred head unworthy of such honors scatter dust and ashes might such penitence avert the shame that for my sins is falling on you and quell the madning faction now afloat since this bold bethlemite has started up to mock the church of god shall it be said that for my punishment these evils light on you the righteous that in my day rose this innovator to conspire your fall to broach new doctrines and unhinge the faith of the still wavering multitude if i if i am in the crime if in your thoughts my negligence has fostered this revolt make me your sacrifice thrust me from hence for this high place unfit set up your cross and there exalt me but if i am clear and this your looks encourage me to hope if christ not caiaphas deserves the death why do ye pause what terror holds you back timehonord rabbi elders sages guides and masters of our israel ye by whom our synagogues are taught of gods own law interpreters ordained which of your grave and reverend council will at once unfold to my yet faithless ears the mighty spell by which this jesus works who will expound this prodigy that sets the crowd agape this more than man of whom the people bruit these more than human doings you are dumb none offers a reply for none will say this wisdom and these mighty works accord with one so mean of birth with josephs son a base mechanic fitter task for him to use his father craft and humbly ply the workmans tools than in the temple sit disputing with our doctors or withdrawn as late the baptist to some desert mount there sit in sullen dignity enthroned and from his rocky theater declaim to listening thousands here be some have heard his doctrines many have endured his taunts and though in wise and wellpoisd minds like yours such meteors breed no terror yet they draw the gazing vulgar and so rank a taint runs through the infected fold that much i doubt if half the flock of israel be not touched so diligent is he to spread the plague so careless we to stem it if his word be suffered thus to overturn our law the monument of ages then alas we have seen the last of these solemnities before this night returns therell not be found or lamb to sacrifice or priest to slay or temple to receive our paschal rites rome whose ambition grasps the conquered world shall plant her eagles on our holy mount and jupiter usurp jehovahs shrine he paused yet stood as one in act to speak struggling for words which furious passion choked and stifled on his tongue a stormy cloud hung on his brow his visage ghastly pale madning with rage he stamped and shook his robe as when the delphic prophetess convulsed and foaming on her tripod sets aghast the scard enthusiasts who believe her filled and fighting with the god oracular so through the hall of council silence reigned whilst expectation turned all eyes and ears on their rapt prophet till the word being given that one of christs disciples stood without and instant audience craved that awful name their spellbound faculties at once set free instant loud murmurs filled the vaulted roof like the deep roar of subterranean tides whose eddies undermine the cavernd shores of seagirt mona or bermudas isle this past the senates chief resumed his throne whence from his state inclining he gave sign for silence and commanded to admit their unexpected suitor at the word wide flew the doors apart and there behold with cloak to the knee tucked up and staff in hand iscariot caitiff viler than the worst that ever wore pilgrims sanctimonious garb in aftertimes when fierce crusading zeal sent forth it is wandering eremites to put the murderous sword in meek religions hand the cross on which our patient lord expired their badge of victory and signal made for their destroying armies lured to war with pardons earnt in fields of carnage fought for gods pretended glory as if dire hope rivers of blood could waft their souls to heaven founder of these and prototype of all who died the cross with blood iscariot stood full of the fiend and cast around on all his haggard eyes that augurd vengeful ire and fraud deep brooding in his treacherous heart when after pause now summoned to expound his purpose whether by his master sent or selfimpelld thus mammons convert spoke fathers of israel patrons of our law and chiefly thou great priest vicar of god and faithful shepherd of the remnant saved from abrahams scattered flock i muse not lords that you are cast in wonder to behold me standing in this place me to your cause unfriendly deemed and which to all is known nor on my part denied one of the twelve and follower of jesus but grave sirs i do adjure you by your love to truth no longer wear this jealous eye upon me than to your patient ears i shall unfold why hither i am come not as a thief to steal into your councils spy them out and after blazon them but in fair faith and plain sincerity with no double heart to make confession sure and give my life a pledge into your hands stand not amazed as if it were a thing impossible that christs disciple should not be his friend mine has been toilsome husbandry my lords and none but bitter fruits have i reaped from it fruits of repentance weary days and nights i have ministerd to him without reward and weary miles full many traveled over fainting and pinched with hunger then at night when the wild creatures of the earth find rest and covert in their holes houseless have watched amidst the shock of elements and braved storms which the maild rhinoceros did not dare unshelterd to abide sometimes on sea lashed by the surging waves i have toiled for life whilst he sat sleeping reckless of the gale rescued from these for i of force confess his power is absolute and safe on shore my labors ceased not with the scene new toils new tasks succeeded now to rocks and caves to sandy wilds or wheresoever else the spirit led and desolation reigned his wandering steps i followed yes his steps but at what distance from his heart he held me bear witness memory others had his heart peter and james and john to them he breathed the secrets of his soul on them he showerd his promises of these he made no thrift these he abounded in to me he gave what he had least in store a barren purse and bade me bear it no hard task i own for it was light as beggary could make it but office most ignoble here perchance your wisdom would demand of me a cause why i endured these slights year after year and still toiled on in such a thankless service what fascination and what spell you will ask does this man work with so to charm the mind and lure it on through mortifying toils sorrows and pains and worse than these contempts yet hold it still enchaind slave to his will most equal judges i must here submit my weakness to your censure and refer my cause to mercy or in selfdefence conjure you for a moment to descend from your high state and to my humble place and peasant thoughts accord your own great minds my lords i neither mean to varnish over my own too feeble nature nor to smooth the rough sincerity of truth through fear or flattery of those before whom i speak if jesus works by spells i know them not prayers but not incantations i have heard if these be charms they are no charms for devils yet such he is charged withal neither by league with beelzebub as some have gravely urged nor art samaritan nor else by imp or genius as the heathen loudly vouch of their famed socrates do i believe his miracles are wrought alas alas which of hells ministers will be suborned to work his own confusion no they shriek they tremble at his bidding they come forth from men possessed they vanish to the winds they sink into the pit from whence they sprung i am a man my lords not overprone to rash credulity nor apt to veer with every breath of doctrine and i have heard a voice that sways the elements commands the springs of health making maimed nature whole nay life itself return into the trunk which it had left and give a second pulse to the cold heart of death this to have seen and not to stand in reverence of the power that wrought these miracles were a degree of apathy above my natures reach no more cried caiaphas no more of this you much abuse our patience with this talk here is no place to sound christs praises forth we are not met to recognize his power and back his daring claims but to chastise imposture to assert our sacred law and vindicate the majesty of heaven you tell us you are wearied with the tasks of a hard master quit him then and earn a better service earn a rich reward by yielding him to justice you well know his haunts his privacies his darkling hours when without hazard of a public brawl we may make lawful seizure for the state of his attainted person on this point so you will order your discourse aright you may speak freely of his praise no more to him the apostate if from my forced lips unwilling witnesses although they be truth wrings this praise the last which they will utter suffer thus far in candor and let pass these words in justice to a masters fame whom i renounce and with an oath devote to wrath to punishment to death itself if death you doom but oh most reverend lords it is not as a false and juggling cheat a dealer with familiars i present him to your just judgment wretches vile as these would but disgrace your wrath and my revenge but take him as a victim from my hands richer than hecatombs of vulgar blood a sacrifice for gods high priest to make whilst all earths sceptered monarchs stood around to gaze upon the work be not deceived i know the jeopardy in which i stand yet i will on in me is no delay this night this hour this instant i am yours to trace him to his haunts to be your guide and marshal you to vengeance but beware let them be chosen men you send approved and constant though the heavens shall rain down fire and the earth rock beneath them he who called the dead anatomy to life can well make corpses of the living  here the voice of one who nearest to the throne had place cut short the traitors speech of high renown was he now rising nicodemus known to afterages as the nightly guest of jesus and his converse with our lord in holy writ recorded grave he was a pharisee and ruler of the jews yet not of soul vindictive like the rest nor aspect arrogant when thus he spoke i call the time misspent that is bestowed on loudtongud orators whose art it is to launch their hearers upon passions tide and drive them on by gusts of windy words a giddy desperate course to rocks and shoals which steered by sage experience they had shunned such shipwreck of our wisdom we might make should we our better senses now permit to take improvident counsel of our ears by this hightond declaimer thus assailed i pray you therefore carry back your thoughts to times foregone when prophets have arose and boasted mighty works which being done of mans device and cunning came to naught so will it be with jesus if his spirit be not of god time will overtake deceit if time be let to run but cut it short by deaths rash stroke you cover him with glory and from his ashes raise a mightier name than living he had reached with all the aids of artifice to back him give me heaven that tolerating policy which shows no bitterness in speculative points disdaining from my heart what this man says a traitor says who comes to sell his master my sentence never shall affect the life of this or any other man accused on vague presumptions nor will i say die till i have that in proof which merits death for if this jesus vaunts himself to be what he is not god will confute his pride but if with power divine he acts and speaks commissioned to some awful unseen end shall man contend with god vain strife shall we fall off from our great origin the faith of our blessed father abraham shall we sore smitten for our trespasses cut short and wasted to a remnant we on whom the guiltless blood of all the prophets rests send this man up to heaven to cry against us and to a burden heavier than enough add more and weightier guilt than all the rest heavens grace forefend you have my conscience lords i leave it to your thoughts i stand absolved he said and conscious that his words were lost upon obdurate hearts departed thence so warned of god and from the gulf escaped of that nights dire perdition wherein all save him alone were lost so in the wreck of some great admiral full fraught for war when his tall vessel splits and the bold crew plunge quick into the abyss heaven sometimes deigns by wondrous providence to snatch one life from the devouring waves and waft him home a solitary relick there to tell gods mercies and his sad companions fate him thus departing the proud pontiff eyed with look malign and to these taunts gave vent weak is that cause whose advocate flies from it i pause to see if any here will follow none moves none speaks none seconds his appeal it is well one only convert to our foe one patron of his cause this senate held and holds no longer vanished flown escaped one heart one mind one voice now rules the whole for me i nor opinion shift nor place faithful i shrink from neither you have heard what this wise elder counsels he has left his conscience as a legacy behind him let him who loves the giver take the gift i for such part as to my share may fall scorn to engraft that scyon on my heart which if admitted might impart the seeds of treason and apostasy like his till cold and hot agree till selfish fear and temporising maxims coalesce with patriot zeal for israel and firm faith in gods revealed decrees his thoughts and mine will never mix and the attempt to join their jarring elements could only serve to make this breast a field of mental war mark brethren mark how this man contravenes your ancient just retaliating law moses said  eye for eye and tooth for tooth so is revenge a virtue by this rule jesus must die for who puts out the law puts out the light of israel stabs the life and life for life is justice upon record this ordinance our absent elder spurns he holds at naught our ancient equity and sets new doctrines forth tells us forsooth that we must wait the time wait till the light of israel be extinct and leave redress for those who without eyes can spy it out such councils would make cowards of us all rebels to god deserters from the faith traitors to israel can i wear these robes and wear a heart within so vile so base tear them away uncover me to shame make me the scorn of men if thus arrayed and trickt in outside honors i am found false to that king whose standard i support no venerable sages if your rule were short to teach us what our duty is the very heathen would inform us of it the roman soldier who deserts his post or sleeping suffers a surprise shall die but we with gods own armies in our charge we whose commander is the lord of hosts should we be found thus criminal what death what doom more terrible than death itself can recompense such treason forth then lords draw out an armed band and send them forth behold a ready leader time yet serves this night no stir no stragglers in our streets to shake the citys peace jesus secured and hither brought a largess i decree to all concerned to judas a reward befitting us to give him to receive no more loud acclamations shook the hall the assembly rose the traitor bowed assent a band of ruffians armed with swords and staves forth issued with iscariot at their head and to the olive mountain bent their course oh hour accursed oh all ye stars of heaven and thou pale waining moon etherial lights firstborn of nature look not ye chaste fires upon this monsterbreeding earth but quench your conscious lamps and whelm this murderous crew in darkness black as their own damning plot and thou conductor of this stygian band vile hypocrite what fiend inspired the thought to hail thy master with the kiss of peace and so betray him wretch the time will come when racked with horror and to all hope lost thine agonizing soul shall rue this deed curse its birthhour and whilst thy master soars to heaven triumphant over death and sin thou shall sink howling to the depths of hell now break your synod up ye envious priests elders and scribes prepare your hardened hearts to judge the lord of life convene your spies to forge false witness and make smooth the way to mans redemption by the blood of christ the very paschal lamb whom by the type of this nights sacrifice ye shadowed forth blind unbelieving prophets as ye are fit hour ye chose ye murdrers to embrue your cursed hands in that pure victims blood peace offering for the sins of lost mankind hence to your homes there meditate new plots the fiends shall be your helpers to your thoughts present though not to sight they swarm around now here now there now hovering over head where as your enmity to christ breaks forth and your blaspheming voices fill the roof like steaming vapors from sulphurous lakes joyous they catch the welcome sounds and fan with clapping wings the pestilential air applauding as they soar now clear the hall yield up your seats ye substituted fiends hence minor demons give your masters place and hark the king of terrors speaks the word he calls his shadowy princes they start forth expand themselves to sight and throng the hall a synod of infernals forms more dire imagination shapes not when the wretch whom conscience haunts in the dead hour of night whilst all is dark and silent round his bed sees hideous phantoms in his fevrish dream that stare him into madness with fixed eyes and threatening faces floating in his brain the ghostly monarch mounts the vacant throne gives sign for order the superiors sit each as his stellar attribute gives rank and place peculiar the untitled stand circling their lucifer their fallen sun he of his state more jealous as in heart conscious of faded glory in the midst now rising after many a hard essay to wreathe his warworn face into a smile semblance at least of joy at length with voice screwed to the pitch of triumph vaunting cries powers and dominions lords by victorys right of earth and man now from his maker won by overthrow of heavens last champion given in gods own city battle fairly gained on hostile ground his sions sacred mount warriors your king applauds you thanks brave friends now shall your temples with loud paeans ring your vindicated altars and your groves exhale rich clouds of incense steaming forth from odorous gums your statues gaily crowned with garlands every trophy that the art of painting or of sculpture can bestow shall be hung round to decorate your shrines your oracles henceforth shall find a voice which future christs shall never put to silence and nations from your lips shall ask their fate this day to all posterity shall be sacred to games processions triumphs feasts and laurelcrowned bards shall hymn your praise but sure no spirit of etherial mould for such of right ye are will so forget his native dignity as to repine or gloat with envy if i now demand your tribute of especial praise to him whom your joint suffrages deputed first to this important embassy a spirit our subterranean empire cannot mate for high authority and potent sway over mans subjected heart mammon stand forth stand forth thou prosperous rich persuasive power worshipped of all great idol of the world may fortune on thy patient labors smile thou persevering deity pursue thy darling metal through earths central veins ransack her womb for mines send forth thy slaves to undiscovered realms and bid them sap potosis glittering mountains for their ore pull down her golden temples strip her kings rack them with tortures wring their secrets out by slowconsuming fires lay nature waste let nothing mortal breathe upon the soil that covers gold all hell applauds thy zeal and all hells engines shall assist thy search he said and lo from either side the throne upon the signal a seraphic choir in equal bands came forth the minstrels strike their golden harps swift over the sounding strings their flying fingers sweep whilst to the strain melodious voices though to heavenly airs attund no longer still in sweet accord echo the festive song now full combined pouring the choral torrent on the ear in parts responsive now warbling by turns their sprightly quick divisions swelling now through all the compass of their tuneful throats their varying cadences as fancy prompts whereat the stygian herd like them of old lulled by the theban minstrel stood at gaze mute and appeased for music has a voice which even the devils obey and for a while sweet sounds shall lay their turbid hearts asleep charmed into sweet oblivion and repose the praise of mammon the rapt seraphs sung and golds almighty power free flowed the verse no need to call the muse for all were there apollo and the heliconian maids and all that pagan poet ever invoked were present to the song above the flight of bold alcaeus tisias bard divine or pindars strain olympic high it soared in dithyrambic majesty sublime at the right hand of hells terrific lord mammon exalted sat and as the choir chanted their hymn his swelling bosom throbbd in concert with the strain pride flushed his cheek furrowed with care and toil his eyes now raised from earth their proper center sparkling gleamd malicious triumph whilst ovations loud and thundering plaudits shook the trembling roof the song was closed and order now resumed mammon stood forth to speak when ere the words from his slow lips found way the infernal king with eager action starting from his throne gave sign for silence and thus interposed pause worthy spirit awhile my mind forebodes cares more immediate for amid the throng i spy our faithful chemos well i know it is not on slight occasion he has left the post assigned him and behold his looks augur important tidings fall back friends and give our gallant sentinel access obedient to the word the opening files fell back and let him pass he to the throne low reverence made and thus his chief addressed imperial lord of this seraphic host as i kept station on the faithless mount where once my altar blazed revolted now from it is allegiance and with olive crowned in token of gods peace i thence descried by glimpse of the pale moon a vagrant train with jesus at their head fording the brook as thither bound i couched upon the watch so biddn and to their talk gave heedful ear a melancholy theme the master chose sadly he warns them of his own deaths hour now near impending and how all shall fly like scattered sheep and their lone shepherd leave forlorn abandoned this the fiery zeal of peter to our chief well known disclaims who boldly vouches though all else should swerve his own unshaken constancy when christ severe though not with railing him reproves and solemnly denounces triple breach of this vain boast and instant for this night or ever the cocks shrill trumpet twice shall sound so christ predicts he shall be thrice denied of this selfvaunting man all this i heard and held it for my duty to report what more ensued imperfectly i learn for now the master takes three apart and much disturbed in soul and sore amazed wills them stand off and watch whilst he retires and vents his grief in prayer i saw him fall prostrate to earth and vent such heartfelt groans that were i other than i am less wronged less hostile to the tyranny of heaven whence i am exiled i had then let fall weak pitys tear and been my natures fool but lords i cannot so forget your cause or my own wrongs nor would i wear a heart made of such melting stuff with noiseless tread the kneeling suppliant i approached and marked his agony of soul whilst from his brow i saw large drops and gouttes of bloody sweat incarnardine the dust on which they fell bear witness my revenge twas there even there the very spot on which he knelt and prayed where now his blood wrung out by agony as in atonement dropped on which my shrine reared by the wives of the uxorious king decked out with blazing tapers proudly shone and front to front of gods own temple stood till asas parricidal hand plucked up maachas groves and burnt my shrine to dust now hear the sequel as i stood at gaze noting his prayer one of the heavenly band and of the highest gabriel with his spear couched as for combat started forth to view and frowning bade me take my flight with speed nor trouble that just person valiant peers i am not one to back at his proud bidding nor ever did i turn my face to flight save in our armys universal rout when all from heaven fell headlong to the gulf such weapon as i had this trenchant sword of adamantine proof forthwith i drew but ere my arm could wield it swift as thought i felt his spears sharp point with forceful thrust deep plunged into my side staggering amazed i gave back so compelled he still advanced armed for a second onset when my strength foiled though immortal and my sight grown dim my wound the whilst sore rankling i took wing and hither came on painful pinions borne your faithful servant whether to attempt fresh battle or my present loss repair this said he put his azure tunic by and barred his wounded side where gabriels spear had lodged it is massy fluke a ghastlychasm trenchd by the force of archangelic arm and to aught else than deathless spirit death fired at the sight with eyes that sparkling blazed satan uprose and thus infuriate spoke gabriel in arms hah warriors we are braved christ has his guard about him and defies us if this immortal spirit could not stand what shall iscariot do myself will forth we shall then see who wields the stronger lance satan or gabriel in the fields of heaven in the midair on earth in deepest hell he knows my might superior and shall rue his dastardly assault why not with me the sender rather than the sent this strife so might he boast the contest though subdued the scars by this sharp sword in battle dealt are the best honors gabriel has to vaunt the brightest laurels on his brow are those i planted when in equal fight i deigned to measure spears with such inferior foe does gabriel think gods favor can reverse immutable preeminence and raise his menial sphere to that in which i shone son of the morning does he vainly hope exiled from heaven we left our courage there or lost it in our fall or that hells fires have parched and withered our shrunk sinews up delusive hope the warriors nerve is strung by exercise by pain by glorious toil the torrid clime of hell it is burning rock it is gulf of liquid flames in which we rolled have calcined our strong hearts breathed their own fires into our veins and forged those nerves to steel which heavens calm ether her voluptuous skies and frequent adorations well nigh smoothed to the soft flexibility of slaves till bold rebellion shook it is fetters off and with their clangor raised so brave a storm that gods eternal throne rocked to it is base now break we up this council each disperse or to his post his pleasure or pursuit suffices for this task my single arm chemos shall be revenged the public zeal of mammon still shall be our theme of praise nor shall iscariots nightly plot be foiled by intervening angels nor these priests whose seats we fill and whose allies we are fail of their victim or find us remiss to second them in this our common league and joint emprize against the powers of heaven twas said the princes of the assembly rose in reverence to his will the legion round smote on their shields the signal of assent towering he stood the majesty of hell dark over his brows thick clouds of vengeance rolled thunder was in his voice his eye shot fire and loud he called for buckler and for spear these bold azazel bore enormous weight for atlantean spirit proper charge with eager grasp he seized the towering mast and shook it like a twig then with a frown that awed the stoutest heart gave sign for all strait to disperse and vanished from their sight end of the third book calvary or the death of christ  book iv  the argument of the fourth book a general review of christs agony in the garden his disciples who are ordered to watch fall asleep christ prays apart he wakens them and warns them to watch left they enter into temptation satan arrives and takes post near the spot where christ is praying in his agony he is discovered by gabriel the supporting angel their interview described christ approaches and reproving satan by the word of power casts him to the ground disabled and in torments judas now advances with an armed company betrays his master with a kiss christ is seized and carried away to the palace of the high priest satan unable to rise laments over his disconsolate condition he is discovered by mammon who consoles him and assists in raising him from the ground satan testifies to the power and divinity of christ feels a presentiment of his impending doom and having delivered his last injunctions to mammon is lifted from the earth by a stormy gust and carried through the air out fight of that evil spirit who terrified by the fate of his chief turns to flight and escapes  calvary book iv the agony in the garden o mount of agony watered with tears from my redeemers eyes and by his knees pressing thy turf made sacred as the ground where even the chosen shepherd might not stand but with unsandald feet ah where is now that purifying angel me to cleanse from this vile world that so i may approach though but in thought with a right spirit renewed thy hallowed solitude lo where the lord sorrowing retires apart where are the three stationd to guard his sacred privacy stand they aloof as their forefathers stood when from the midst of darkness cloud and fire jehovah thundered out of sinais mount ah no within that olive grove they lie stretched on the ground a drowsy slumbering guard and could ye not ye sleepers watch one hour for such a master oh what heart could taste of rest or peace whilst his was racked with pain was it the sighs his suffering virtue breathed into the air of sad gethsemane that so entranced your senses or was he the strengthening angel sent from heaven to shield the saviors anguish from all human eyes and veil the mystery of that awful hour then was that angry cup full mixed and red from gods right hand presented to his lips the bitter essence of original sin with every lifedestroying extract drawn from mans corruption since were there infused compounded and resolved into that draught mixed by the hand of death and druggd in hell the coward shrinking under fortunes blows with desperate lip has ofttimes drank and died it is refuge it is desertion from a post he dare defend no longer it is the hope false fruitless hope of a perpetual sleep when he has bottomed that lethaean cup but our redeemers potion was not such horrors and heartdissolving woes and pangs that mock imaginations scope and stretch the hearts strong cordage till it bursts asunder and leaves the mind a wreck these were the drugs that brewed that cup of agony which god now tendered as the wrathatoning draught for a revolted world mysterious act the father sacrifice the son beloved the just to spare the unjust lay the rod upon the guiltless head shall all offend and one atone for all one victim bear the accumulated load of punishment the mass of vengeance that amazing whole which each particular sin had pild in store and that devoted sacrifice a lamb pure without spot or blemish o my soul beware nor to that tabernacle press where clouds and darkness canopy thy god lo where the savior kneels he looks around for some to succor to support some friend whose sympathising eye might beam upon him and with a moments glance of pity cheer his desolated spirit all around is vacant horror solitary dark the partners of his heart the chosen few the friends who should have watched are wrapped in sleep insensible supine oblivious sleep woes multiplied by woe and that the worst ingratitude the sharpest fang that gnaws mans bleeding bosom in this sad extreme his soul revolting from the noisome draught with eyes to heaven uplifted and a sigh which showed that human weakness then oerpowerd his souls diviner part  abba he cries father all things are possible to thee remove this cup  then bows his patient head and qualifies the prayer  yet not my will but thine be done  no voice from heaven replies all nature sleeps in silence still as death as if the planets in their spheres had paused to watch the trembling balance on whose point the fortunes of this globe suspended hung it is ruin or redemption death or life twas then the strengthening angel dealt the blow that put the hovering spy of hell to flight seen of our lord in ambush where he lay and now the mourner rises from the earth on which he knelt and a few paces moves pensive and slow to find his stationd friends he finds them not as friends upon the watch not as gods faithful soldiers should be found but at their length stretched out in lazy sleep with folded arms supine roused by his voice they stare they start confounded and amazed could ye not watch one hour the sufferer cries watch for the foe of man is near at hand pray lest ye fall into the tempters snare the spirit is ready but the flesh is weak so warned he leaves them with this mild rebuke a second time he seeks the dismal dell again he prays remission of his woe and deprecates the agonizing cup meanwhile his drowsy sentinels perceive a languor which their senses must obey and down they sink their leaden eye balls closed as in a deathlike trance again he comes again he calls a second warning gives and so departs  now satan on the wing swift as a fiery meteor rides the air with shield and spear armed at all points for war then down at once with huge titanian bulk plumb down he lights upon the solid soil hard by the angelic post earth felt the shock and trembling to her center inly groaned nor did his haughty courage deign to crouch or lurk with lion watch but firm of foot erect and confident in arms he stood as one whose prowess all advantage scorned and mean surprise of an unguarded foe such arts to weaker spirits he resigned he of his former self felt no decay or feeling scorned confession for his pride still deemed that heaven though lost contained no peer to mate with him in hardihood and proof save only the almighty to such height of arrogance had power long time usurped over the gentile nations and the sight of gods own son now as he falsely deemed vanquished and prostrate swelled his impious heart our blessed lord meanwhile having preferred for the last time his interceding prayer summoned his strength and conscious that the hour was come which finished or revoked the task of mans redemption from the powers of hell whose representative hard by at hand stood eager to arrest the forfeit prize put forth his hand and as he took the cup satan who stood spectator of the deed started aghast cold tremor shook his joints his threatening spear now drooped and his broad shield so proudly borne aloft weighed down his arm slack and unnervd confusion seized his heart and his high courage quaild this gabriel saw yet left he not his post till christ had drained the cup mysterious to its lowest dregs he drank it now convulsion shook the fiend death shrieked amain and through his hollow ribs drove his own ebon dart with desperate rage bitter the draught and hateful to the taste but immortality had crowned the cup and light and life on phoenix wings sprung forth from the foul dregs in newborn glories bright gabriel who knew that by this solemn act thus happily performed his charge expired now turned away in search of that fierce spirit whom through the darkling covert he had seen whilst by the side of gods afflicted son ministring he stood right well he knew the form and towering port of hells terrific king nor had the dire confusion and dismay of that fell demon escaped the angelic glance him now within a gloomy dell retired to further distance wrapped as it should seem in pensive thought the guardian seraph spied in the same moment satans ghastly eye glanced on his foe bright in caerulean arms heavens champion shone high over his crested helm the archangelic plume triformed waved ensign of throned state and high command the grifly monarch gnashd his teeth with spite to find himself encountered at such odds his foe fresh blooming in immortal youth vigorous in heavnlytemperd armor braced himself at this ill hour surpised his strength as by enchantment blasted and that voice which in the ears of all hells princes vouched such bold achievements shrunk from it is high pitch to feeble murmurs and weak whining sighs so when on zamas plain the rival chiefs romes consul and the punic captain met to parley in midway twixt either camp the warworn veteran blighted and defaced by wintry marches over noisome fens and snows on mountains pild with envious eye sole relick of his toil surveyed the form and blooming features of his youthful foe then to his mind recalling glories past when his proud menace awed immortal rome sighed to reflect how far in the decline from that bright morn his evening sun had sunk then eyed the youth again and in his face shadowed by fate saw carthage doomed to fall and his own glories to a foe transferred less than his equal once his conquror now but twas not long that satan so endured for now the conscious sense of former deeds bold though unblest and high innate disdain of mean capitulation and demur roused his proud heart like a hot courser spurred to chase and lash his languid courage up redning he swelled and gnawed his nether lip for vengeance that it would not give him words to hurl defiance on the advancing foe when gabriel noting his disordered mien and haggard aspect strait bespoke the fiend thus ever may the foe of christ be found speechless abashed struck down of heaven and quelled how long malicious spirit will thou persist to trouble this vexed earth how long to haunt this righteous person whole strong virtue mocks thy faint attempts warned by this shame avaunt hence baffled tempter roaming thus at large thou do but show by melancholy proof that a tormented conscience never rests as the fierce panther through the ribs transfixed writhes round the bloody weapon in his side and tugs it to and fro with foamy teeth madning with pain and gnashing at his wound so against himself and foe alike enraged hells gloomy lord by this deserved taunt cut to the heart with many a hard essay struggled for voice at length collecting breath these words disdainful though of their full tone and energy abated found their way gabriel the brave in danger earn renown true valor spares the weak but thou more wise than valiant studiest well the safer hour when to come forth and wage inglorious war against unprovided foes if chemos then or some slight cherub cross thy wary path woe to the straggler if thy barbed spear can make safe tilt at his unweapond side but i who day and night have paced this globe found in all quarters i who never shunned rather have sought thy walk am left to roam free and of thee unquestioned from the hour when on the confines of this newmade world we parlied under edens shady fence to the instant now when faint and ill at ease unwarlike angel thou have found me here nerveless and little more than match for thee to whom the indignant virtue thus replied if satan here is found in evil plight he is found of me unsought thine own dark wiles degenerate spirit and heavens allruling hand have cast thee in my way must i turn off from dutys road direct because forsooth a wounded adder hisses in my path why did thou press into this place of prayer this hallowed solitude where christ has breathed a charm that withers up thy blasted strength could thou not learn by late experience taught there is a sphere about the son of god in which no spirit like thee accursed can draw his breath blaspheming at a word begone though with my foot i could have spurned thee hence i tread not on the fallen nor do i vaunt conquest of thee that to a mightier arm rebel to god to gods own son thou owst to christ not gabriel nor shall thou alone stoop to his name but every idol god and every power of darkness with their prince and sin hellborn and thy soul offspring death whereto by these prophetic words appalled satan with taunting argument replied since this angelic form from death exempt sometimes shall yield to aches and transient pains and natural ailments for awhile endured what wonder if etherial spirit like me pent in this atmosphere and fain to breathe the lazy fogs of this unwholesome earth pine for his native clime what if he droop worn out with care and toil were thou as i driven to and fro and by gods thunder hurled from heavens high ramparts would that silken form abide the tossing on hells fiery lake had thou like me traversed the vast profound of ancient night and beat the weary wing through stormy chaos voyage rude as this would ruffle those fine plumes i have kept my course through hurricanes the least of which let loose on this firm globe would winnow it to dust snap like a weavers thread the mighty chain that links it to heavens adamantine floor and whirl it through the infinite of space and what have thou soft cherub done the whilst what are thy labors what have thou achieved heaven knows no winter there no tempests howl to breathe perpetual spring to sleep supine on flowery beds of amaranth and rose voluptuous slavery was gabriels choice his bosom never drew the indignant sigh that rent my heart when called to morning hymn i paid compulsive homage at gods throne warbling feigned hallelujahs to his praise spirits of abject mould and such art thou may call this easy service for they love ignoble ease to me the fulsome task was bitterest slavery and though i fell i fell opposing exiled both from heaven freedom and i shared the same glorious fall go back then to thy drudgery of praise practice new canticles and tune thy throat to flatterys fawning pitch leave me my groans leave me to teach these echoes how to curse here let me lie and make this rugged stone my couch my canopy this stormy cloud that rolls stern winter over my fenceless head it is freedoms privilege nor tribute owes nor tribute pays to heavens despotic king thus whilst he spoke the savior of mankind new risen from prayer drew nigh whereat the fiend or ever the awful presence met his eye shivering as one by sudden fever seized turned deadly pale then fell to earth convulsed dire were the yells he vented fierce the throes that writhed his toiturd frame whilst through the seams and chinks that in his jointed armor gaped blue sulfurous flames in livid flashes burst so hot the hell within his fueld heart which like a furnace sevn times heated raged meanwhile the winged messenger of heaven gabriel with horror and amazement fixed stood motionless behind his orbed shield not so the savior he with look composed and steadfast noting the disastrous plight of that tormented fiend these words addressed satan thou see the serpents primal curse at length falls heavy on thy bruised head when man lost paradise by thee betrayed this was thy doom deceiver and although ages have rolled on ages since yet god who from eternal to eternal lives blessed for evermore computes not time as thou whose misery makes short years seem long yet was the interim thine and thou who first brought sin into the world have reigned in sin thou had the power of death but i through death am destined to destroy that power and thee and now my hour is come i go to death that all through me may live therefore begone get thee behind me thou have now no part on earth thy dwelling is prepared in hell there when we meet expect to meet thy doom this said the fiend replied not but with groans nor staid the angel longer than to turn one last sad look upon his prostrate foe then flew to heaven the savior bent his steps in search of his disciples them he found wrapped as before in sleep  sleep on he cried and henceforth take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man into the hands of sinners is betrayed rise let us go the traitor is at hand and lo while yet he spoke a mingled crew armed and unarmed approach before them all judas advancing thus bespeaks the throng whom i shall kiss is he the christ him seize and in safe keeping hold  upon the word he gives the traitorous greeting and exclaims hail master  when at once the swarming crowd rush in a space then stand in circle round like bloodhounds held at bay their eager eyes fixed on his face which to behold they rear their flaming torches whilst the prospect round glares with the ruddy blaze a ghastly troop like that dread chorus which the tragic bard poured on the scene when the athenian wives dropped their abortive burdens with affright to see their snaky locks and fiery brands kindled in phlegethons sulphurous waves so glares that haggard crew in front they see jesus in conscious majesty unmoved behind him to some little space withdrawn peter and james and john the chosen three small band but in their leaders power a host invincible against whom whole armies leagued were but as chaff before the whirlwinds blast had he so willed but now with accent firm whom seek ye he demands they answer make jesus of nazareth  i am the man jesus replies he whom ye seek is found his air his utterance and that voice divine which could have armed heavens legions in his cause or gulphd them to the center at a word swift as the vollied thunder smote their hearts and hurled them to the ground headlong they fell with hideous crash nor ever thence had risen had not his gracious purpose so decreed for mans redemption up they rise from earth and in like manner to the same demand a second time make answer he repeats  i told you and ye heard that i am he if therefore me ye seek let these depart then burst the chidden zeal of peter forth armed with a sword he rushed upon the throng and at the foremost aimed a random blow that gashd the caitiffs head but missed the life put up thy sword rash man the savior cries did i want rescue would i ask of thee with all my fathers angels at command no let me do his will and drink his cup and you that here encompass me about as twere a felon ye came out to take with swords and staves suffer thus far behold the wound his weapon makes my touch shall heal it is done know all that they who take the sword shall perish by the sword what needs this stir this midnight plotting and this traitors kiss these staves these torches and this armed array to make one harmless peaceful man your prize you saw me daily in my public walks freely we commund for you harmed me not you heard me in the temple for i taught in very zeal the simple way of truth laboring full hard to turn your hearts to god if this were my offense why not arrest your preacher in the act and drag to death him who would fain have trained you in the road to life eternal never on the poor turned i my back i courted not the rich were this my fault in the broad face of day ye might have smitten me and earned the praise of the proud pharisee and braggart scribe i fed the hungry and i healed your sick i succored the tormented and possessed are these the heinous acts for which i die in field in city in frequented ways the wretched flocked around if these be crimes why is their punishment so long reserved to this dark hour of night the sun himself witnessed my doings so might he my death but see my followers are dispersed and fled and i stand in your peril here alone no need to fear him who makes no defense conduct me to my doom gods will be done this said their sacrilegious hands they laid upon his sacred person he in the midst with meek composure and submitted look marched slowly onward as they led the way to the proud dome of caiaphas high priest of moloch than of god more fitly called oh ye hard hearts was this the paschal lamb ye worse than pagan butchers whom ye culled pure and unspotted for your bloody feast well did your lawgiver decree this day a record and memorial to be kept throughout your generations to all time a memorable day a noted feast your stubborn incredulity has made it to you a day of darkness and disgrace to us salvations glorious dawn to us by our great captain led the lord of life who through the darksome avenue of death and depths mysterious of the mazy grave holding the clue of prophecy in hand unravelled all the ways of providence and to our view set open the golden gates of paradise regained whence light and life and bliss eternal beam on all mankind for all who with their lips confess the lord and in their hearts believe that from the dead god in his power has raised him shall be saved meanwhile the prince of hell whom christ had left rolling in torments on the stony rock mad as leviathan when tempestwreckd floundring he lies upon the shoaly beach now to one last and desperate effort driven straining each nerve with many a dolorous groan half his huge length had reared his right hand grasped his spear the other on his buckler proppd pillowd his head raging with pain and thoughts black as the night around him to arise and stand surpassed his power in vain he spread his feathery vans to raise him in the air about him all the ground with azure plumes beat from his shattered pinions was bestrewn despair now seized him now too late he rued his blasphemies and bold rebellious taunts against heavens omnipotent his judge incensed hopeless of mercy now he cursed his doom of immortality and as he rolled his haggard eyes in night hells flaming gulf terrific vision seemed to burst upon him with treble horrors charged then with a sigh that strained his heaving corslet he breathed forth in murmuring lamentations these sad words ah who will lift me from this iron bed on which prometheuslike for ever linked and rivetted by dire necessity i am doomed to lie and wail the cruel boon of immortality my baneful fate o earth earth earth cannot my groans pervade thy stony heart to embowel me alive under this rock before tomorrows sun find me here weltering in the sordid dust a spectacle of scorn to all my host wont to behold in me their kingly chief will not some pitying earthquake gulf me down to where the everlasting fountains sleep that in those watery caverns i might slake these fires that shrivel my parched sinews up ah whither shall i turn who will unbrace this scalding mail that burns my tortured breast worse than the shirt of nessus oh for pity grant me a moments interval of ease avenging angry deity draw back thy red right hand that with the lightning armed thrust to my heart makes all my boiling blood hiss in my veins or if thou will destroy whom thou have vanquished terminate these feuds twixt good and evil thee and me reduce this incorruptible to mouldering dust make death a parricide and so conclude me and my sufferings and my sins at once but twill not be happy i might have been immortal i must be god can create nothing but bliss i made the pains i feel sorrow had no existence death no name till i lost heaven to be was to be blessed and beings blessed could never cease to be this earth and man its habitant were good till envy pride rebellion in my heart engendring marred gods perfect work with sin and but for sin the universe were heaven so am i author of the hell within me and these tormenting fires god cannot quench for that would be to turn from what he is parent of good and to become like me patron and friend of evil reasoning thus i must renounce all hope of future peace and wage eternal enmity with god whom longer to oppose i now despair and under whose strong hand weighed down to earth prostrate confounded i can rise no more must i be ever thus must these fierce pangs or worse if worse can be torment me ever are there no means to make a truce with heaven submission penitence atonement prayers and intercessions  oh fallacious vain impracticable terms can pride shed tears falsehood keep faith or perjury pass it is oath upon that judge to whom all hearts are known it cannot be ages of sin have rolled twixt me and pardon gulf impassable mans loss of paradise a deluged world sin paramount on earth the nations turned from god to idols scarce a remnant left of this his chosen race corruption spread even to the heart of judah and from this mount sad witness of my overthrow and shame scene of my triumphs once his standard torn and hells proud banners flanting in it is place these and a countless multitude of wrongs cry in the catalogue so loud against me that should the thunder of gods vengeance sleep mercy herself would seize the uplifted bolt and speed the lingering blow what is my hope if such the task to purchase peace for man man so subordinate in sin to me the spring and fountainhead of that soul stream which he at distance drank if christ must die for man if nothing less than gods own son can stand betwixt the fathers wrath and man what mediator can be found for me none and no wonder if his wrath withdrawn from man now pardoned fall with worse recoil on my devoted head even now it falls me like an eagle in my towering flight from the proud zenith of the suns bright sphere headlong he hurls to earth with shattered wing and plumes dishevelled groveling in the dust me the sole mover of mans foul revolt he marks for tenfold vengeance for if christ the patient meek redeemer groans in pain what shall the tempter feel if on the rack of agony his guiltless brow sweats blood well may this body of sin burst out in flames a conflagration horrible to sight and blazing beacon to the astonished world and what is this vile judas who seduced by wily mammon sells his masters life what peters self whom had not jesus prayed i would sifted into chaff these purblind priests who with their halfshut eyes askance behold their own messiah in his wondrous acts yet give those wonders to the powers of hell and trembling for their craft complot his death what are they whence but from myself their lies it is i in them and not they of themselves that kill the prince of peace his guiltless blood sprinkles their hands but in a floodgate tide redder than scarlet whelms my sinking soul he ceased and in his mantle hid his face for shame and sorrow to be thus surpised for mammon ever on the foot by night had spied him through the gloom and thus began what ails thee prince of air that here thou lie on the dull earth not resting it should seem from victory but vanquished and overthrown vanquished alas and in the dust overthrown by gods allpowrful son satan replied too sure i am and how it wrings this heart so to be found of thee words cannot speak yet thou of all the spirits heaven has lost art he of whom my pride has least to fear for thou will not as others gall my spleen with scorn and taunting thou a friendly chief have pity for the sorrows of a friend to thee my valor and deserts are known for thou were ever nearest where i fought in front of danger on the battles edge thou know the hazard and the chance of war and with what malice fortune thwarts our best our bravest efforts scarrd thyself with wounds thou from the wounded wilt not turn aside therefore o mammon as my hand to thee were present did thou need it so to me thy sovereign in distress reach forth thine hand and if thou can upraise me from this fall if thou can not let not my armies know their leaders fate be mindful of my fame and bury this sad secret in thy breast he said nor need had he of further suit for mammon now had put forth all his strength to raise him from the ground in his strong grasp he seized his giant limbs in armor clad of adamant and gold a ponderous wreck earth trembled with the shock dire were the groans hells monarch vented horrible the pains that racked his stiffend joints yet on he toiled till by heavens sufferance rather than by aid of arm angelic once again he reared his huge titanian stature to the skies and stood yet not as late with look erect and lofty mien ruin was in his face sordid and soiled with ignominious dust his robe imperial and his azure wings and glossy locks that over his shoulders curled dishevelled now and in like tattered trim with vessel tempesttorn or by the force of engines weighed from bottom of the deep foundered in creek or harbor where she lay gulphd in the slimy ooze when mammon thus joy to our gallant leader once again with firm foot planted on the subject earth we stand as spirits by our own strength redeemed erect and dauntless wherefore droops that eye as it would root itself into the soil from which with vigor new restored you rise antaeuslike indignant of defeat often when in search of gold or silver ore in earths metallic veins i have labored long and hard in damp and darksome caverns pent mining the solid rock at length to light and the free air emergd i have found my limbs stiffend with cramps or with cold ague numbed yet never did my patient courage droop or slack it is gainful toil i am not apt when wealth or glory can be bought with pain to stagger at the terms and if it please heavens monarch in his vengeance to attach to this eternal being eternal pain good hope as poisons may be sheathed by use so long familiarity with pain may draw it is sting and habitude convert it is hostile property to friendly ease but thy great heart perhaps is rent with grief of pain disdainful as of lesser ill and wherefore grieve our joys were lost with heaven our passions all reversed our natures changed virtues to vices amity to hate deeds that in heaven had been our shame in hell become our glory and whilst the world endures whilst evil is to good opposed we keep the fight at doubtful issue ofttimes win the glorious field and triumph over god why did i tempt iscariot to betray his guiltless master twas not that i loved the traitor no the treason was my joy i laugh at fools in their own folly caught the wretch i tempted him i shall destroy and like a wornout weapon cast him by he shall not live to see his masters fall and for the sorry purchase of his sin he shall but touch the adders sting and die so much for judas thus at once i slay two victims and refine upon revenge to whom with clouded brow and nothing cheered by this discourse hells gloomy power replied mammon you well describe the rueful change wrought in us by our overthrow from heaven and for such solace as in thought you find pondering the sad eternity of pain my argument shall never be employed to make that little less but when you vaunt iscariots treason and the impending fall of that just person now before the bar of envious judges who shall doom his death you vaunt a deed which though the elect of hell jointly with me advised brings on us all ruin with loss of empire and all hope so quenches naught can stand us now in stead but patience and your reconciling rules to wont our natures to eternal pain my potency you know and can you think less than the hand of god could hurl me down to misery like this it must be god who speaks in christ the father in the son though meek almighty he controuls the world and me the worlds late master he destroys sin my begotten and sins offspring death oh that i never had approached him more foiled in my first temptation now even now i feel a nature in me not mine own that is my master and against my will enforces truths prophetic from my tongue making me reverence whom in heart i hate i feel that now though lifted from the ground i stand or move or speak but as he wills by influence not by freedom i perceive these exhalations that the night breathes on me are loaded with the vaporous steams of hell i scent them in the air and well i know the angel of destruction is abroad i cannot fly from fate the man foredoomd to bruise my head is christ the time is come the prophecy is full exiled from hence as first from heaven my reign on earth is over and my last care is for those hapless friends the partners of my fall when i am gone left like a headless trunk warn them to fly impending ruin sure i am when christ breathes forth his sacred spirit into the air his dying gasp shall blow them like a spell to the four winds of heaven let them be gone in time and ply the wing there is shelter yet in this wide world for them though i must hence they may abide and though their names be lost their altars levelled and their idols maimed yet shall their arts and offices endure their influences still shall draw the hearts of many sin shall not at once secede from earth nor darkness wholly yield to light to thee auspicious spirit whose potent arm has raised me from the ground i can assure a longer term of residence and power thy empire in earths inmost center roots thy influence circulates through all her veins nor earth alone but ocean wafts to thee continual tribute commerce hails thy name in thee war triumphs thee fair peace adores and gilds the feathers of her dove with gold to dedicate to thee her worldly god thee the last foe whom christ shall chase from earth so spoke the parting fiend in his last hour prophetic father though he were of lies to him the inferior demon answer none attempted but in ghastly silence stood gazing with horror on his chieftains face that changed all hues by fits as when the north with nitrous vapors charged convulsive shoots it is fiery darts athwart the trembling pole making heavens vault a canopy of blood so over the visage of the exorcisd fiend alternate gleams like meteors came and went and ever and anon he beat his breast that quick and short with laboring pulses heaved one piteous look he upward turned one sigh from his sad heart he fain had sent to heaven but ere the hopeless messenger could leave his quivering lips by sudden impulse seized he finds himself uplifted from the earth his azure wings to sooty black now changed in wide expanse from either shoulder stretch for flight involuntary up he springs whirled in a fiery vortex round and round as when the lybian wilderness caught up in sandy pillar by the eddying winds moves horrible the grave of man and beast him thus ascending the forkd lightning smites with sidelong volley whilst loud thunders rock heavens echoing vault when all at once behold caught in the stream of an impetuous gust high in midair swift on the level wing northward he shoots and like a comet leaves long fiery track behind speeding his course strait to the realms of chaos and old night hellbound and to tartarean darkness doomed his sad associate left on earth looked up and with like conscious terror eyed his flight as when the merchant trembling for his freight looks seaward from some promontorys top and thence descries his gallant bark a wreck driving at mercy of the winds and waves full on the rocky shoal her certain grave then having bid farewell to all his hope in this one bottom stored now lost to sight turns with a sigh aside and over the strand with heavy heart takes homeward his slow way so sighed the fiend and for his own sad fate trembling yet fearful to attempt the wing slunk cowring off veiled in the shades of night end of the fourth book calvary or the death of christ  book v  the argument of the fifth book this book proposing to treat of the trial and condemnation of christ opens with an invocation to the evangelists the sacred historians of that event  christ brought before the priests and elders in council accused by the witnesses interrogated by caiaphas persists in keeping silence till being solemnly called upon to declare himself he answers by an affirmation of the truth instantly all voices are let loose upon him accusing him of blasphemy and pronouncing him worthy of death he is delivered over to mockery and insult the jews resolve to arraign him before pilate on the following morning he turns and looks upon peter who according to prediction had three several times denied him the sorrow and contrition of that disciple is described he retires apart to bewail his crime and supplicate forgiveness his prayer and confession in the templeporch the council of the jews resort to pilate next morning and appeal against christ he informs them that by the roman law no judgment can be given till the accused is confronted with his accusers and heard in his defense now commences the trial of christ before pilate who finding nothing worthy of death in that just person refers him to herod as belonging to his jurisdiction herod after mocking him arrays him in a gorgeous robe and in that apparel sends him back to pilate he again appears in the judgment hall before pilate who after many fruitless efforts to save him the jews still urging him by their clamorous importunity to crucify him finding no other way to prevent a tumult of the people after declaring himself innocent of the blood of jesus by the ceremony of washing his hands before the multitude delivers him to be crucified  calvary book v the condemnation of christ ye sacred guides whose plain unvarnishd page penned by the hand of truth records the scene where christ before the bar of impious men patient of all their scorn arraigned betrayed and of his own abandoned silent stands you i invoke so from the same pure source whence my faith flows shall also flow my song not idly babbling like that shallow rill trickling at foot of the parnassian mount but deep serene to hallowed airs attund aid me from heaven where now before gods throne in evangelic attributes ye stand sixwingd and thick bespangled over with eyes ranging all points before you and behind seraphic minstrels chanting day and night your ceaseless hallelujahs to the name of him who was and is and is to come led by your hand with trembling step i press the sacred ground which my redeemer trod now like a lamb to slaughter led and now pendent oh horror on the bloody tree and whilst to tell his sacrifice of love his souldissolving agonies i strive my heart melts into sorrows deep as those when the sad daughters of jerusalem watered his passage to the cross with tears musing my pious theme as fits a bard far onward in the wintry track of age i shun the muses haunts nor dalliance hold with fancy by the way but travel on my mournful road a pilgrim gray with years one that finds little favor with the world yet thankful for it is least benevolence and patient of it is taunts for never yet lured i the popular ear with gibing tales or sacrificed the modesty of song harping lewd madrigals at drunken feasts to make the vulgar sport and win their shout me rather the still voice delights the praise whispered not published by fames braying trump be thou my herald nature let me please the sacred few let my remembrance live embosomd by the virtuous and the wise make me o heaven by those who love thee loved so when the widows and the childrens tears shall sprinkle the cold dust in which i sleep pompless and from a scornful world withdrawn the laurel which it is malice rent shall shoot so watered into life and mantling throw it is verdant honors over my grassy tomb here in midway of my unfinished course doubtful of future time whilst now i pause to fetch new breath and trim my waining lamp fountain of life if i have still adored thy mercy and remembered thee with awe even in my mirth in the gay prime of youth  so conscience witnesses the mental scribe that registers my errors quits me here  propitious power support me and if death near at the farthest meditates the blow to cut me short in my prevented task spare me a little and put by the stroke till i recount his overthrow and hail thy son victorious rising from the grave now to that dismal scene return my thoughts where christ in midst of an irreverent crew ushered by torches through the darkling streets and now at summit of the holy mount arrived before the pontiffs lofty gate waiting the call of impious pride attends the halls and lobbies vomit forth a swarm of saucy servitors with idiot stare gazing the wondrous man and venting loud their coward mockeries he stands unmoved great is the stir within and on the post through all the palace runs the buzzing news of this great prophets capture circling round with ever new enlargement of strange sights and fearful doings in the garden seen of those who took him caiaphas meanwhile summons the templechiefs elders and scribes a hasty sanhedrim no longer now with stately step in measured pace they march huddled together by their fears they flock they cluster in a throng safest so deemed and fill the council seats in speech abrupt and brief their hierarch the cause expounds of their so sudden meeting  christ is seized the prophet whom they dreaded is in hold thenchanter who by league with beelzebub scared them with magic spells is at their door now is the time to put his art to proof now is the moment to decide if thus their unreveald messiah shall appear after long promise in this abject state a shackled prisoner or a conquering king admit him with faint voice some two or three of the least timorous cry  behold he comes the rabble throng rush in and at the bar of the immured divan present him bound with cords his raiment soiled with hands profane his head uncovered and his sacred locks by the rude winds and ruder men despoiled of their propriety dishevelled spread like shattered fragments on the branching top of piny lebanon after a storm silence now reigned the roar of tongues was hushed and expectation with suspended breath sat watchful when some sign or word of power should in a miracle break forth upon them none such that patient sufferer vouchsafed nor menace nor complaint his eye bespake but meek serene composure noting this as cowards out of danger loudest vaunt the council now took heart then soon were heard the lying tongues of witnesses suborned various and loud but these no order kept falsehood with falsehood clashd and each to each irreconcilable as all to truth shame held the council mute for vilest hearts cloakd in the robes of judgment will affect some outward show of what they ought to be then most malicious when most seeming just confusion now ensued and perjury in it is own labyrinth had lost itself when some of graver note within the pale of justice seated but far thence removed in conscience and in heart started new charge averring they had heard the prisoner say  i will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days will another build made without hands  the charge was gravely urged and colored to the semblance of a plot breathed sacrilegious menace to gods house fit matter for descant pontifical when caiaphas as foremost in degree so first to sound forth danger and affix solemnity to malice from his state with magisterial dignity arose and sternly fixing on the face divine his eye inquisitorial thus began hearst thou what these allege the words in charge stand witnessed by these present face to face the accusers they and thou the accused meet justice is open what is thy defense answerest thou nothing  nothing answered he but as a lamb before it is shearers mute he opened not his mouth the mystery couched under those words prophetic of his death and following resurrection to expound to their perverted minds beseemd not him searcher of hearts and savior of mankind silent not pertinacious he endured their scorn nor did his meek demeanor show more than the dignity of conscious truth which knows itself prejudged and scorns a plea but caiaphas who brookd not this repulse and still occasion sought from his own lips by subtlety to ensnare him thus reurgd question with solemn adjuration backed hear me thou man accused and answer make i do adjure thee by the living god to what i now demand art thou the christ the very christ son of the eternal god or art thou not resolve us who thou art then jesus by this solemn adjuration urged lifting his eyes to heaven in mute appeal whilst all his fathers virtue in his face effulgent beamed these glorious words pronounced hear them o heaven and oh record them earth write them ye mortals on your hearts  i am i am the christ all that you ask i am and ye shall see me coming in the clouds of heaven enthroned at the right hand of power as when on rapine bent a savage horde arab or indian in some sandy dell or by the sedgy lake in ambush lodged upon the watchword by their leader given leap from their treacherous lair with sudden yell and bloody weapons waving to surprise and overpower the unguarded traveller fatally trappd into their murderous snare so at the signal of their priestly chief uprose the dire divan with rushing sound like roar of distant waters terrorstruck frantic as bromius with furious hands the enthusiastic hierarch seized his robes and into tatters like a cancelled scroll tore them exclaiming vehement and loud that all might hear  what need of further proof ye have heard his blasphemy how think ye sirs what may such crime deserve  the infuriate priests seized by like phrensy with one voice pronounce  death be his sentence  death through all the hall rebounding echoes back the accursed decree horrible sentence murder hatched in hell libation for the fiends demons on you and on your generations to all time his righteous blood shall rest now uproar wild and horrid din succeeds the scoffing crowd rush to the bar so privileged and there with scurril taunts and blasphemies revile the patient son of god oh thought of horror the savior of mankind reviled by man the just by the unjust others more profane vent their vile rheum upon his sacred face or smite him with their palms then gibing cry  tell us who smote thee prophesy thou christ monsters that christ has prophesied your doom already by that prophet is pronounced the lips you strike have uttered it behold jerusalem is fallen her towers are dust your city smokes in ruin lo what piles of mangled carcases what horrid scenes of violated matrons hark what screams of infants butchered in their mothers arms and look your temple blazes to the sky it is beams of cedar overlaid with gold it is fretted roof with carvings rich embossed and all it is glorious splendour feeds the flames insatiate mark how high their serpent spires hissing ascend god fans them in his ire thither the wild beasts of the desert hie there carrion owls by midnight haunt there dwells the dragon and the satyrs dance it is done that prophecy is sealed there yet remains an awful consummation unreveald till god shall gather up your scattered race still vagrant over the inhospitable earth ah wretched people broken and dispersed did ye preserve the oracles of god but to convict your own obduracy sad nation on whose neck the iron yoke of persecution hard too hard has lain and yet lies heavy will ye not accept a high priest holy harmless undefiled from sinners separate and exalted high above the heavens and do ye not perceive the word of jesus in yourselves fulfilled rue then the prophecy which you provoked of faithless fathers ye still faithless sons whilst shuddering i recount the impious taunts of that blaspheming rout but neither taunts nor violence could shake the saviors peace he in his own pure spirit collected stood nor of their base revilings took account twas now that christ knowing himself denied three times of peter turned and looked upon him he from the garden where his lord was seized following at distance judas and his band had kept his eye upon their moving fires and up the sacred mount pursued their track till at the palacedoor he stood and sought admission with the crowd when there behold a damsel at the portal scans him over with scrutinizing eye and strait exclaims  thou too were in this galileans train thou art of jesus  sudden to his heart the coward tremor runs and there suggests the fearconceived lie before them all with confidence to falsehood ill applied  i know not what thou say  he strait avers and to the porch goes forth there in his ear the cock his first shrill warning gives and sings the knell of constancys predicted breach of constancy alas too strongly vouched by him in rash and overweening zeal boasting like martyrdom with christ himself sole sacrifice appointed for mankind but he though of presumption warned by fear still haunted and the guilty dread of death strait to a second questioner replies  i do not know the man  and to engage belief binds down the falsehood with an oath fatal appeal to heaven insult to god and his allrighteous ears is this the man who with such glowing ardor selfassurd  though all shall be offended i will not  proudly averred and for that pride reproved  though i should die with thee dauntless rejoined yet will i not deny thee  man weak man pride was not made for thee if peter fell presuming who shall say behold i stand in my own strength nor ask support of god and now as if devoted to his shame curious to pry yet fearful to be seen he mixes with the throng that crowd the hall and there once more is challenged for his speech as savoring of the galilean phrase then with reiterated oaths abjures his master the third time when hark again the cocks loud signal echoes back the lie in his convicted ear the prophet bird strains his recording throat and up to heaven trumpets the trebled perjury and claps his wings in triumph over presumptions fall oh fallen how low is this thy promised faith favored of christ so highly know thou not disciple thine own lord or know him only in safety in prosperity in power for thine own selfish ends a summer guest prone to desert him in the wintry hour of tribulation poverty and woe is thy frail memory of that slippery stuff that a friends sorrow washes out all trace of a friends features look upon his eyes behold they turn on thee them do thou know their language can thou read and from them draw the conscious reminiscence thou disownst mark is their sweetness lost ah no they beam celestial grace a sanctity of soul so melting soft with pity such a gleam of love divine attempring mild reproof where is the man that to obtain that eye of mercy on his sins would not forego lifes dearest comforts to embrace such hope o death death where would be thy sting or where these awful tremblings which thy coming stirs in my too conscious breast might i aspire to hope my judge would greet me with that look vaunt not yourselves ye scorners nor exult in this recital of a good mans fall faithful historian of his own offense but rather let it physic your proud spleen to mark how mean prevaricating false and despicable a vainglorious man peters denial davids heinous sin and all the guilty lapses of mans heart though summed together into one account each spot and blemish malice can search out to tarnish the fair luster of a name stand but as lessons of humility warnings of frailty to oerweening man and if our mournful page has now set forth the fall of virtue let it next record it is glorious resurrection we have shown the offender in his shame what now remains but to display the penitent behold abashed he stands bathed in remorseful tears one glance from his beloved masters eye like nathans parable has roused from sleep his drowsy conscience mark where he retires to weep in solitude and purge his heart by sorrowful repentance of it is guilt o peter could my verse fit offering make that verse should be bestowed upon thy tears now the assembled elders and their chief after short consultation had resolve with the next dawn of morning to arraign their prisoner at the praetorian bar of pilate procurator for the state imperial of rome and caesar he held judgment sovereign of life and death in tributary jewry judge corrupt and like romes venal emissaries prone to every sordid purpose trained in blood and for tribunal bloody therefore fit meanwhile forth issuing from the fatal hall scene of his shame the sad disciple took his pensive way across the templecourt silent and solitary seeking where to unbosom his full sorrows and give up his soul to prayer and pardon seek of god for his revolt pale through nights curtain gleamd by fits the lunar intermittent ray that quivering served to light his lonely steps to the fair gate called beautiful whose porch high overarchd on writhed columns proppd of spiral brass convolvd was for it is shade of christ and his disciples much in quest hither he came and falling on his knees like the humble publican smote on his breast and this confession selfaccusing made here let me fall and in repentant tears weep out my soul upon these pitiless stones made sacred by his steps whose awful name thrice blasphemed thrice abjured i dare not speak though in my supplication can i say spare me o god of mercy can i ask pardon of god unpardoned of myself oh wretched recreant creature as i am what shall redeem me from this misery and reconcile my conscience to itself a perjured conscience never more can peace dwell in this bosom never can my soul ascend out of the dust or lift a thought in hope toward heaven with judas let me dwell colleague in treason with his sin my sin in the execration of all time be linked or shall i venture to look up and say o god behold a wretch who dares not sue for mercy but for mitigated wrath for punishment proportioned to my bearing protracted not too sudden lest it take my senses from me and with them all power of meditation penance and atonement spare me a little to abhor myself and if the arrow which my conscience drives into this guilty heart draws not enough of it is vile blood to purify what is left let the strong hand of justice force it home and finish me at once was i not warned of my presumption and a signal set to number my denials when i swore never to swerve but follow him to death mine like iscariots was predicted sin i spared not him i called his wilful guilt obstinate malice and can i now urge necessity my plea all things are known to christ the evil motions of my will he saw not overruled i might have prayed for grace support prevention i prayed not but heedless of the prophecy and blind rushed into sin prepense selfwilled selflost what fascination seized me to draw forth the sword in rash defense of him whose word legions of angels could have called from heaven and what prevaricating demon breathed the lie into my lips when the same night nay the same hour that saw me prompt to oppose my life to danger saw me meanly shrink from what i courted and behind a lie three times repeated like a coward sculk and did i not know christ whom i denied did i not know the master whom i served who called me to him poured into my heart his heavenly doctrines raised my lowly thoughts from the mean drudgery of a fishers trade and taught me in the energy of faith to walk upon that sea in which erewhile i dragged the net and toiled for daily bread o memory once my glory now my curse to what sad purpose do i call thee home absent in danger present in despair is there a wonder done of christ on earth i have not witnessed did i not behold dead lazarus revive at his command what shall i say to him whom i saw die when living he arraigns me face to face what answer make to those whom i have served from one small wallet with the bread of thousands the very blind ere they received their sight saw more than i and hailed him lord and christ who shall believe when i renounce belief the very devils own him whom i denied can i call these accursed whose impious cry dooms him to death who smite him with their palms blaspheming harder than their hands my heart wretch twas my false tongue trained them on to murder on me me only all their sin rebounds i stand condemned they free can i forget how often my lips confessed him son of god perish that tongue which could revoke it is faith disown confession and belie my heart denied of me on earth when in the clouds of heaven he comes at the right hand of power and sends his angels with the trumpets sound to gather his elect from the four winds when as a shepherd culling out his flock to separate all nations and divide the good from evil he proceeds ah then then will he not retort the fatal words first used of me i know thee not depart thou wicked servant into outer darkness there weep and gnash thy teeth in fires prepared for satan and his outcast crew accursed thus he all night with deep remorse overwhelmed mournfully kneeling at gods templegate bewailed his crime and supplication made for pardon and let aftertimes attest how full a portion of gods spirit abode in this blessed penitent when with the sound of rushing mighty winds it was poured down on him and on his fellows thence installed apostles and with gifted tongues inspired to speak all languages and preach the word of christ throughout the whole converted world here in this very spot where now he kneels repentant filled ere long with power divine he bade the cripple in the name of christ rise up and walk he at the word in sight of all the people rose and stood and walked and in the temple gave loud praise to god then let not his offense pardoned of god by man but for examples sake be named and once more hail thou renovated saint made brighter by repentance enter thou into thy masters joy once more resume thine apostolic primacy and feed shepherd of christ deputed feed his flock nor shall thy faith once faulter nor thy zeal shrink from the test of martyrdom reserved to glorify thy master on the cross now morning from her cloudy barrier forth advancing crimsoned all the fleckerd east as blushing to lead on the guilty day with the first dawn the wakeful elders meet short council hold for little time sufficed to take their voices whose relentless minds in the same bloody league were banded all and now unanimous with their high priest in stately grave procession forth they march to find their heathen judge and at his bar arraign the holy one  but check my heart thine indignation let the verse proceed  him in his seat of judgment high enthroned with axes and with lictors round embayd in martial state with reverence they salute and lowly stoop their tributary heads to his vicegerent majesty with smile of condescending favor he accepts their abject greeting and to his right hand their chief advances others in their ranks and orders he disposes then with feigned solicitude as if to seek the cause of this concerted meeting he begins what cause so weighty brings jehovahs priest with these wise elders and timehonord scribes thus early to seek justice at my bar appeal so reverend with such leader graced and by such followers witnessed well demands of caesars servant his most equal ear whereto the high priest second to none in craft with solemn accent and demeanor grave masking his base collusion thus replies when he whose hand the sword of justice sways her balance also holds in equal poise over this realm provincial we have cause to thank the master of our liberties who by such delegation of his power makes light that yoke which else would gall our necks though caesar lays it on us then let praise be given to caesar for the love we bear to pontius pilate have i leave to say that we your servants a peculiar race pay worship to one god and hold at heart as sacred that commandment handed down from our forefathers which for ever makes his undivided unity the creed of all our nation and whoever blasphemes his name and controverts our holy faith dies by our law this sentence we have passed but execution staid so bound in duty upon a certain nazarite by name jesus obscure of birth but of our peace no slight disturber for the common herd a monster as you know with many heads and every head with twice as many ears itching for novelties have raised this man to dangerous eminence and for he cheats their gross credulity with juggling sleights which they call miracles have blown his pride to such a monstrous bulk he now scales heaven there seats himself  oh where shall i find words to speak his blasphemy  at gods right hand his son his equal sharer of his throne judge of the world if this be not a crime for death to expiate we are slaves indeed and every statute ordinance and law rome leaves inviolate jesus shall break unpunished nor is this dread sir the whole of his presumption mark i pray the height to which his phrensy rages mark his threat he will put down this temple in three days and in like time with hands invisible erect another  patron of our laws fountain of justice ought this man to live such madness breathed into our peoples minds will spur them to the deed break every band that ties them down to order and turn loose their fury not on us alone but rome not on our temple only but perhaps on this tribunal which heaven guard and now take the whole matter of our charge at once this jesus has pronounced himself a king our king your masters rival you best know if your great emperor abdicates his right to our allegiance which we fain would hold where we have vowed it to imperial caesar not to this mean mechanic josephs son this is our plea o pontius why we claim justice against the prisoner who now waits your sentence under guard and bound as fits delinquent so atrocious i have said to him the roman  be it known to all the sentence which you urge against the life of your now absent prisoner cannot pass by practice of our law till face to face with his accusers he shall stand at bar and license have to answer for himself touching the crime in charge therefore these words which you have largely spent are spent in air else might the ear of justice be forestalled by the empleaders charge and so perchance let fall the axe upon the guiltless head much knowledge of your laws i cannot boast nor with these learned scribes hold argument for so much therefore as to them pertains i on the part of caesar am no judge his tributes his supremacy and rights disputed or opposed i shall uphold against all offenders let the accused appear this said behold the blessed son of god dragged to a pagan bar there whilst he stood a spectacle of pity patient meek submitted to his fate pilate who knew him innocent and his accusers false envious and cruel eyed him over and over and as he pondered in his mind how base the sentence he was now required to give some sparks of roman virtue not quite dead though faintly felt in his degenerate breast revolted from the deed soft was the touch though ineffectual which sweet pity gave to his stern heart he wished yet knew not how to unfold the gates of mercy and through them let pass the rescued innocent to life the son of epicurus could no more upon the sufferers brow serene he saw where innocence and sanctity enthroned sat visible and claimed his just award he turned him to the accusers and beheld such malice as brought up to view a groupe of his own furies from their fabled hell then with a frown he cries  what law is yours which makes this man a culprit ere he is tried unmanacle his limbs a roman judge hears no man plead in shackles he who speaks in lifes defense has call for every aid that nature can bestow free use of limbs action and utterance to grace his cause and hold him up against the worlds contempt i will not hear a man that pleads in bonds cut those vile cords asunder set him loose and now our blessed lord his arms released from the harsh thongs which the malignant jews had bound about them gan to recompose his decent vesture and with calm survey to note his persecutors those dire priests and cruel hypocrites that bayd him round in every breast transparent to his eye malice and craft and envy he discerned in pilates face the shifting hues bespoke internal strife of passions all in arms combat twixt good and evil in his hand he held a scroll which with intentive eye and thoughtful brow deep pondering he perused the writing well he knew but the contents thus worded much perplexed his wavering thoughts o pilate if thy wife was ever held in honor love or trust i do adjure thee this once take warning from her voice inspired to snatch thee from destruction oh withhold thine hand from that just person harm not him that holy jesus who now stands before thee touch not his sacred life or on thine head a fearful judgment thou shall else pull down a mighty power protects him what i know not but mightier sure than all the gods of rome for i have seen his glory in a dream and dreams descend from heaven pilate beware such was the warning scroll he now perused even on the judgment seat by timely hand sent for his rescue happy had he turned his heart so warned to justice and obeyed the visitation of the spirit vouchsafed but he like caesar deemed his manhood pledged to make slight count of a weak womans dream yet much confused uncertain and perplexed he looked around and saw all eyes upon him the jews impatient jesus at the bar prepared for trial what shall he resolve break up the court and judgment put aside for a mere vapor for no better plea than to indulge a womans fond caprice and bid the law stand still and wait the time  till pilates wife shall meet with better dreams  such scorn he dared not to provoke and now loud murmurs filled his ear compelled to rise though uncollected and in mind disturbed he thus addressed the lord  art thou a king and of this nation who accuse thee to me king of the jews  thou say it jesus cried but say thou of thyself this thing or taught of others art thou prompted so to speak  am i a jew the faultring judge replied not i but these who if thou were a king were thine own subjects elders priests and scribes these have accused thee not of them am i nor in this business covet further share than on the part of justice to demand what have thou done how answerst thou their charge of this world were my kingdom said our lord my servants would defend their king and fight to save me from my oppressors but i reign not on this earth nor is my power from hence art thou a king then  interposed the judge  thou say cried jesus that i am a king and truly to this purpose was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should witness bear unto the truth and all that to the truth belong hear me  what is the truth said pilate but his voice now falterd and his thoughts unsettled wild and driven at random like a wreck could grasp no helm of reason only this he knew there was no fault before him this aloud to all he published and pronounced him clear whereat with rage and disappointment stung furious as wolves defrauded of their prey uprose the priests appellant and afresh urge over and over their aggravating charge forging new falsehoods and reforging old the preacher of forbearance peace and love perverter of the nation now they call fomenter of sedition spreading wide from galilee the cradle of his birth throughout all jewry to the capital where now assuming to himself the name prerogative and state of king and christ he stirs up the people to revolt forbidding them to pay their rightful dues of tribute to romes emperor himself exalting above caesar this and more in the like strain of virulence with lips in aspic venom steeped they now depose nor had they brought their malice to a pause when pilate hoping he had now found plea to shift the dreaded sentence from himself thus interposing checked their clamorous spleen break off and let your tongues take rest awhile it is not at this bar you must emplead this man a galilean as it seems whom being such it is not mine to hear but herods let his special tetrarch judge twixt him and you thither remit your suit this said he rose preventing all reply whilst they though by procrastination galled yet of their tetrarch confident submit but nor with herod could their malice speed to it is main purpose little care had he for all their priestly clamor in his thoughts religion had no interest truth no weight for prophets and for prophecies no ear had he alike regardless how christ preached or they complained yet much he wished to see some splendid miracle of him performed something to strike his senses with surprise and satisfy a wanton curiosity made eager by the fame of those great works whereof he much had heard and nothing seen but when our lord to all his questions mute nor word nor sign vouchsafed to wrath impelled what by enticements he had failed to gain by taunts he hoped to extort and now his spleen to impious scorn and mockery gave the rein forthwith his prisoner in a gorgeous robe appareld as a king to all his court held up for sport and laughter he exposed loud was the roar of blasphemy the whilst and wild the revels of the scoffing throng as the lewd orgies of the frantic god or clamor of that sacrilegious rout when their mad rage the thracian minstrel tore whose wonderworking harp could charm the ear of hell and call dead nature into life the priests looked on and grinnd malicious joy yet would not herod execution doom or willing to appease the jealousy of pilate or content to mark his scorn of jesus by this arrogant display of mercy as not dreading whom he spared now once again at pilates bar he stands not as before like malefactor tied and round begirt with cords but overlaid with a rich load of sumptuous mockery a lamb compelled to carry the proud spoils and guilty trappings of the tyrannous wolf again the judge with slow unwilling step to his tribunal mounts and thus he speaks you still persist to bring this man to me as a perverter of your nations faith and loyalty your witnesses i have heard pondered their depositions and throughout examined every tittle of your charge him too i have questioned in the ears of all here present and no shadow of offense can i discern to warrant your appeal for execution and pass judgment on him no nor yet herod for to him i sent you and your prisoner and behold him freed nothing is done unto him worthy death i will chastise him therefore and release yet this chastisement rather to allay your anger than so merited of him i shall inflict remember this your feast has the long plea of custom to be marked with pardon and forbearance to reprieve one culprit from his sentence i am bound no less by inclination than by rule and usage immemorial make your choice but let it fall on innocence not guilt instant all voices echoed forth a cry  hence with this man away with him to death give us the murderer set barabbas free let jesus perish  wherefore for what crime pilate exclaimed what evil has he done no cause of death in jesus can i find be witness for me justice none in him but for that wretch on whom ye would bestow pardon misplaced so various are his crimes so black their quality ye cannot name a death more terrible than he deserves take of the guiltless blood what stripes can draw to satisfy your longing but forbear to take the life if not for pitys sake in honor of yourselves that ye may say there was one prophet whom ye did not kill loud as the winds that lash the raging seas and all as deaf redoubling now the roar the infuriate jews rend their blaspheming throats howling for blood till deafend with the din of crucify him crucify him dreadful cry pilate who twixt their tumult and the death of that just person saw no middle course by which to escape one solemn act prepared by expiatory washing of his hands in presence of the multitude to purge his soul and thereof god alone is judge from the pure blood of that devoted lamb behold he cries i pour this water forth and therein make ablution of my soul from all participation in your crime by washing of my hands from every stain of this inhuman sacrifice each spot and sprinkling of this guiltless victims blood rest on your heads the murder i am clean this said he turned and fixed a pitying look upon the lord then sighed and gave the word eager as hounds when slipped upon their prey in rush the throng and soon the hissing scourge whirled with impetuous swing aloud resounds gashing that sacred flesh whose bleeding stripes healed our sinwounded souls upon his brow a thorny crown they fix whose torturing spikes thrust rudely in by sacrilegious hands furrow his temples and with crimson streams cover his face divine him thus abused mangled with stripes and all over bathed in blood in purple robe they scornfully array and drag to public view  behold the man  pilate proclaimed with horror in his voice and outstretchd arm that pointed to a sight which had to pity moved their steely hearts had they not been of metal forged by fiends and tempered in the sternest fires of hell dryeyd as rock of adamant unmoved obdurate to his sorrows they looked on nor from their crucifying clamor ceased till pilate now all hope for jesus lost yielding to their tumultuous fury cried take him and do your bloody work yourselves impose it not on me i find no cause of death no fault in jesus take ye him and crucify him of his guiltless blood lo i am innocent see ye to that on us and on our children be his blood  then answered all the jews tremendous words tremendously fulfilled and now afresh they clamor for the cross when thus the judge  would you that i should crucify your king  we have no king but caesar they rejoin nor art thou caesars friend to spare this man  twas past to that dread name the roman bowed obedient and from his sad heart sighed forth the extorted doom  death to the lord of life end of the fifth book calvary or the death of christ  book vi  the argument of the sixth book judas iscariot seized with remorse returns the thirty pieces of silver to the priests and departs mammon reassumes the habit of a levite and meeting judas after he had returned the money to the priests instigates him to destroy himself that evil spirit now takes wing and repairs to the wilderness convenes the demons from all parts of palestine and informing them of satans expulsion from earth warns them by his command to betake themselves to flight before the hour of christs crucifixion this is no sooner announced than the whole infernal host breaks up in disorder and disperses to various parts of the world therein described  the subject of the crucifixion is now brought forward the procession sets out for mount calvary christ bearing his cross is bewailed by the spectators as he passes he is seen by gabriel and the angels with him from the mount on which they were stationed he addresses himself to the daughters of jerusalem the executioners nail his hands and feet to the cross the priests revile him and call upon him to come down one of the malefactors crucified with him casts the same in his teeth he is reproved by the other whose penitence is rewarded by the promise of immediate salvation and glory christ from the cross recommends his mother to john the beloved disciple christ dies the sun is darkened the earth quakes the rocks are rent and the bodies of the saints and prophets are raised from the dead and appear upon earth the priests and elders alarmed by these prodigies resort to pilate and demand a guard of romans to defend the sepulcher lest the disciples should take away the body of christ and pretend that he was risen pilate replies that they have a watch bids them see to it themselves and dismisses them  calvary book vi the crucifixion on us and on our children be his blood  such was your imprecation o ye jews when in your sight the worlds redeemer stood gashd over with wounds and emptying every vein for mans redemption and behold it flows it whelms upon you in a floodgate tide steeped to the lips ye are in all the blood of all the righteous shed upon the earth from blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah whom your fathers stoned betwixt the altar and the house of god ye have enough the mark is on your race ye have drawn down the judgment ye provoked it rests upon you yet for you no rest no station no abidingplace is found strangers and weary wandrers upon earth if in the dust of your jerusalem with foot proscribed ye dare to tread ye die a savage race usurps your sacred mount and jordan echoes an unhallowed name should ye but stop to shed a filial tear upon the soil where your forefathers sleep woe to the circumcised that so is found oh slow of heart when will ye understand that thus afflicted scattered and dispersed through every clime and kingdom of the world ye are sent forth to publish as ye pass how truly christ predicted of your fate and though your lips deny your sufferings prove that prophet jesus whom your fathers slew was savior christ messiah son of god amidst the throng that filled the judgmenthall stood judas he upon the watch to avoid the masters eye with caution took his post yet was his ear to all that jesus spoke still present and though few the words yet strong and potent of those few the impressive truth there was a magic sweetness in his voice a note that seemed to shiver every nerve entwined about his heart though now corrupt debased and hardened ill could he abide murderer although he were the dying tones of him whom he had murdered twas the voice as of a spirit in the air by night heard in the meditation of some crime or sleepcreated in the troubled ear of conscience crying out beware it smote upon the soul for it was christ who spoke well then might judas tremble twas the traitor listening the plea of innocence betrayed well might that plea awaken his remorse when the perverting witnesses deposed to crimes of which he knew his master free the refutation quiverd on his lips and hard he struggled to bring forth the words yet could not tonguetyd with despair and shame but if his hearing so alarmed his heart what were his feelings when at times his eye glanced on the sacred person of his lord bound like a felon his defenseless hands in manacles confined behind his back his cheeks with blows sufflated and his face oh piteous with blaspheming slaver stained then stripped transformed in purple stole arrayed saluted with the insolent allhail king of the jews a spectacle of sport and merriment to all the scoffing crowd could heart of man bear this who had beheld his miracles his mercies proved his love his patience his forbearance shared his cares his labors and his watchings heard his voice when tempesttost rebuke the elements though silent now amidst the roar of tongues twas all that priestly malice could inflict but more than mammons convert could support yet worse had these tormentors in reserve to agonize his soul another scene to shift new horrors on that bloody stage the torturing scourge now sounded in his ears the mangled flesh flew off in tattered stripes the crimson stream ran down the pavement drank libation of his immolated blood the hall rebellowd with the echoing cry of monsters who applauded every stroke wolves vultures oh for words to speak them worse men turned to demons traitor though he were son of perdition this was all too much take hence he cried take back your bribe accursed damned price of damning deed tell over your coin count out your thirty pieces for each piece is thirty thousand daggers to my heart burdened too much already with my sins i should but into worse damnation sink under this mercenary load oppressed i have betrayed the innocent too late for pardon i am past redemption lost ye may redeem the time if ye recall your fatal condemnation and atone to that just person ye have doomed to death if not ye crucify the lord of life this said he threw the thirty pieces down and strait departed they to his retort short answer made remorseless and malign and now disburthend of his filthy bribe it seemed as though his conscience would permit a momentary pause for one short gleam of hope to visit his benighted soul twas something like atonement twas one step turned backward from the precipice of sin and pointed toward repentance twas the last faint effort that reluctant nature made to struggle against selfmurder but how vain for mammon once the tyrant of mans heart ill brooks expulsion thence from youth to age from age to lifes extremest hour he holds absolute empire nor does hell contain spirit so jealous of usurped command he in the bosoms of those impious priests held high preeminence and them amidst himself unseen had noted all that passed and much indignant to be now abjured of that compunctious traitor swift as thought such was his power of motion took the form and habit of that levite first assumed and him close following to the outward hall there with these taunting words assailed his ear a losing game friend judas thou have played to set thy soul upon a desperate cast and after pay the stake on either side what folly is it to be knave by halves who would strike virtue in the face and then ask pardon for the blow fall off from truth enlist with falsehood and take pay for treason then by a paltry plea of restitution think to compound one trespass by another desertion by desertion get thee hence thou shame to manhood wring out the sad dregs of thy detested life in hopeless tears for thou have thrown away both worlds at once all gain in this all glory in the next and what art thou cried judas so to gall a wounded spirit wounded by thy arts tempter accursed human thou can not be else thou would find some pity in thy heart for wretch like me who but thyself seduced my loyalty from christ who sappd my faith who fixed this adder to my breast but thou thou demon as thou art have hurled me down from my high hope to fathomless abyss of misery and despair from heaven to hell rail not on me quoth mammon but thyself and thine own folly there the charge were just did thou not sell thy master for a bribe my part was faithfully performed the price conditioned for was paid what would thou more i needed treason and i sought out thee as fittest for my purpose envious proud lustful of pelf a villain readymade and ripe for mischief such i marked thee down nay and yet better for i thought thee whole and perfect villain with no rotten part of penitence to mar thee but behold thou have deceived me vilely and have got a blinking vice about thee a perverse and retrograde depravity of soul that makes thee hateful to my sight begone that thou art wicked put not me to blame had thou been constant i had made thee rich and riches would have saved thee from contempt now thou art poor and loathsome hence avaunt one remedy i will give thee for despair this cord a remnant of thy masters bonds a legacy most opportunely left to heal thy cares and recompense thy love take and apply it to it is proper use it tied his limbs let it encase thy throat he said and stooping from the pavement took the cord there left and hurling it with scorn to the desponding traitor disappeared nor did that wretch the fatal gift reject but eager seized the instrument of death and soon within a darksome vault beneath the judgmenthall fit solitude he found and beam appropriate to his desperate use whereto appendent he breathed out his soul not daring to put up one prayer for peace at his dark journeys end but trembling wild confused of reason as of hope bereft with heaving breast and ghastly staring eyes there betwixt heaven and earth of both renounced hung terrible to sight a bloated corpse oh how shall rash and ignorant man presume to judge for god and on his narrow scale think to mete out by limits and degrees immeasurable mercy who can tell how high the sorrows of mans suffering heart ascend toward heaven how swift contrition flies what words find passage to the throne of grace what in midway are lost dispersed in air and scattered to the winds oh that my harp could sound that happy note which stirs the string responsive that kind nature has entwined about the human heart and by whose clue repentance heavenly monitress reclaims the youthful wanderer from his dangerous maze to tread her peaceful paths and seek his god so could my fervent my effectual verse avail posterity should then engrave that verse upon my tomb to tell the world i did not live in vain but heedless man deaf to the music of the moral song by mammon or by belial led from sin to sin runs onward in his mad career nor once takes warning of his better guide till at the barrier of lifes little span arrived he stops death opens to his view a hideous gulf in vain he looks around for the lost seraph hope beside him stands the tyrant fiend and urges to the brink behind him black despair with threatening frown and gorgon shield whose interposed orb bars all retreat and with it is shade involves lifes brighter prospects in one hideous night so judas fell so like him every wretch by the same filthy mammon lured shall fall meanwhile the vengeful demon unappeasd pondring the warning of his stygian lord late driven from earth and mindful that the charge and conduct of hells host on him devolved now claimed his wariest thought upon the wing sets forth full sail to summon his compeers as many as in that quarter might be found and them apprize of their foul loss incurred by their great captains fall and what dispatch behooves them now put forth timely to scape impending danger of their chief foreseen if christs deathhour should unawares surprise them idly stationd or with curious gaze hovering about his cross so forth he goes but first to spy the land he wheels his flight athwart mount calvary and there on guard a file of heavenly warriors he descries covering the sacred hill and at their head gabriel in golden panoply arrayed armed at all points commander of the band the fate of satan and the recent sight of chemos ghastly wound with guilty fears haunting his coward fancy warned him fly beyond the range of that strong spear from which spirit more warlike than himself had fled as when a pirate galley on the scout roving the seas of some strongguarded coast in bay or inlet moored under the lea of headland promontory at anchor spies a warlike fleet whose towering masts and sails unbent for sea bespeak their ready trim down goes the helm at once the felon crew bestir all hands and veer the vessel round to seaward then ply oars and sails for life so at the sight of that angelic band the stygian scout wheeled round and sped his flight sheer to the wilderness on swiftest wing there on the watch azazel happily found he bade sound forth the loud satanic trump heard through all palestine at call

archangelic chief they cast an anxious look but look in vain him in far other region they shall find in chains fast bound amidst eternal fires his dismal dwelling for them also reserved in gods appointed time to whom the fiend i muse not warriors that ye stand amazed to see yourselves in absence of our chief here summoned by his archangelic trump which other breath than his before never filled but public danger urges this bold step in me presumptuous had i not to plead your safety for my warrant and withal his last sad mandate earnestly bequeathed at parting when sole witness i beheld his utter loss discomfiture and flight ah friends how sympathetic with my soul is that deep general groan which now i hear full cause immortal mourners have we all to groan and beat our breasts nor i the least whose melancholy task it is to pour these heavy tidings in your grieved ears but let us yet remember what we are and be not therefore heartless though bereft of him who was the head and brain of all many and mighty are the chiefs yet left though he prime chief no longer shall review this widowed host of satan the return is desperate such a whirlwind caught him up so strong a southern blast at christs command blew him beyond the stretch of angel ken right onward to the realm of ancient night impetuous through the empyrean void sheer on the level wing of him the fate is worse than doubtful of his victors power and godhead irresistible what proof greater than this sad downfall can we need or after such example what provoke behooves us now prepare for instant flight this our late chief prophetic in his fall with his last words enjoined me to propound to these our legions scattered over the coasts of palestine whom else the coming hour of christs mysterious passion shall involve in like disgrace and ruin with your prince who to his latest moment upon earth was studious of your safety i have now in words unworthy of my charge yet such as heart overwhelmed with sorrow can supply surrendered to your ears my painful trust but whither to repair whom to elect as captain and conductor of this host now headless conscious that such high command with none but with the worthiest should be lodged i as becomes me to your wiser thoughts submit and with the general choice shall close no more for now with sudden panic seized the stygian host no voice imperial heard nor rule nor order kept uprose at once disbanded lawless dreadful was the yell of that infernal rout a swarm as thick as locusts making horrid night beneath their wings that with like clangor beat the air as of a flock of cormorants disturbed from some lone island on the rocky coast of chili where they haunt so they with cry more hideous mount there hover for a while then to all points disperse as chance falls out or short consult prescribes some to the south with isis and osiris at their head to memphis thin and tamis take their flight there with the bestial deities to herd birds serpents reptiles monsters of the nile gods that would half unfurnish noahs ark some with melcartus demigod of tire light short and in his temple refuge take where armed with massy club and lion hide his huge athletic idol frowning stands others with rimmon eastward wing their way to famed damascus there in bowring shades by rilling fountains on the flowery turf to doze away the soft oblivious hours a slumbering synod some the golden spires of nineveh attract and nisrocs fane stained with sennacheribs imperial blood there by the parricidal princes shed to byblus and belitus others speed

presides the power of thundering baal he that station keeps preeminent over all the idol gods and in his festive hall rich nectar quaffs with purple lips and midnight revels holds luxurious sensual lewd in vice immersed yet some there were and of no vulgar note who grief to tell to the biforked mount flew off and there with the parnassian maids held shameful dalliance from whose lewd embrace descended a whole family of bards corruptive illegitimate and base a spurious breed of wickedness and wit a muses genius with a daemons heart mammon meanwhile a solitary sprite selfish morose and even by devils abhorred hied him alone on sordid thoughts intent to rummage in pactolus sands for gold none joined nor sought he partner in his flight his sole ambition to engross and hoard now came the awful consummation on the hour of promise dimly shadowed out by types and prophecies when from the womb of mystery long travailing in pains and groanings now in ripe time should spring forth her full formed revelation to dispel the obscure of ancient days and usher in twin birth of immortality and life now god by the offering of his only son the type of abrahams sacrifice fulfilled who though unconscious of that type by faith righteous was of the promises made heir and now as moses in the wilderness lifted the serpent so the son of man exalted on the cross shall heal the world of sin and expiate the widewasting plague now the peace offering of the spotless lamb by one conclusive passover shall rend the laws symbolic veil and all absolve whose consciences are sprinkled with his blood from punishment entailed upon the world by mans first disobedience forth he comes from condemnation ye too from your tombs come forth ye prophets  son of amoz thou prepare for resurrection come and see not darkly as in a glass but face to face the object of thy vision him the man of sorrows him who like a lamb is brought to slaughter mark the travail of his soul witness how he is stricken for our sins witness how we are healed by his stripes and by the note and comment of his death construe thine own predictions forth he comes from condemnation under roman guard bearing his cross upon his bleeding brow ensign alike of royalty and woe a thorny crown no friendly hand is found to wipe away the tear mingled with blood that hangs upon his cheek the soldiers cry room for the criminal and rest their pikes to keep the crowd aloof staggering beneath the ponderous burden of his cross he faints and sinks to earth oerspent till one is found a sturdy stranger of cyrenean birth on whom to lay the venerable load hail simon blessed above men were thou if faith in him that suffered on that cross glowed in thy heart and furnished thee with zeal to render this last service to thy lord without the city walls there was a mount called calvary the common grave it was of malefactors there to plant his cross it was decreed long was the way to death and like the ascent to glory hard to climb upon the summit stood the angel troop of mammon seen though to mans filmed eye invisible here gabriel from the height noting the sad procession had espied the suffering son of god amidst the throng dragged slowly on by rude and ruffian hands to shameful execution horrorstruck pierced to the heart the indignant seraph shook his threatening spear and with the other hand smote on his thigh in agony of soul for mans ingratitude glistning with tears his eyes whence late celestial sweetness beamed now shot a fiery glance on them below then raising them to heaven he thus exclaimed oh that the everlasting would permit his angels to chastise these impious men and from their hands his holy son redeem whom in the heaven of heavens we have beheld beloved of the father ever blessed at the right hand of power in glory throned but this for purposes beyond our reach god ever wise forbids and who against gods interdict shall stir therefore retire stand off and wait the time if christ commands we are his ministers to do his will be it to lift this mountain from it is base and whelm it on his murderers if not patient spectators we must here abide and let the sacrilegious work proceed knowing that god has said i will revenge vengeance belongs to the lord alone now on the news of their great prophets fate each heart with fearfulness and trembling seized through all jerusalem the tumult ran native or stranger aged or infirm none in the holy city now kept house wherever the savior passed his presence drew thousands to gaze and many an aching heart heaved silent the last tributary sigh in memory of his mercies zealous some rushed in the grateful blessing to bestow for health or limbs or life itself restored but these the soldiers rudely thrust aside and some with brutal violence they smote thickning their files to hem their prisoner close as fearful of a rescue loud the cry of women whose soft sex to pity prone melts at those scenes which flintyhearted man dryeyd contemplates mothers in their arms held up their infants and with shrill acclaim begged a last blessing for those innocents whose sweet simplicity so well he loved and ever as he met them laid his hands upon their harmless heads with gentle love and gracious benediction breathing heaven into their hearts oh happy babes so blessed fenced in with shields and spears and compassed round with roman guards the persecuting priests elders and scribes followed their victims steps amidst the scoffs and hissings of the crowd and still as christ approached the fatal spot loud and more loud the sad lamentings grew till at the foot of the funereal mount arrived he stopped and turning to the group of mourners these prophetic words addressed daughters of solyma weep not for me weep rather for yourselves and for your babes for lo the dawn of sorrows is at hand the dread prediction presses to the birth when through jerusalem a voice shall cry  give thanks ye childless matrons and confess a barren bed your worst misfortune deemed now your best blessing break forth into joy ye at whose breasts no infant ever hung for ye have none to mourn now to the clefts and caverns of the mountains they shall say fall on us cover us ye rocky vaults and hide us from this wrath for if with us already it begins what shall the end of the ungodly and the sinner be if the green tree cannot abide the storm how shall the dry escape  and now no more upon the summit of mount calvary they rear his cross conspicuous there it stands an ensign of salvation to the world kneel all ye christian nations bow your hearts and worship your redeemer in whose death ye live and from whose issuing wounds flows life by his blood purchased hopes best promise flows of joys immortal for the just reserved the soldiers now by their centurion formed in hollow orb around the cross begin their horrid prelude to the murderous scene and first his vesture their accustomed spoil and perquisite they part but for his coat from top to bottom woven without seam that they rend not but on it cast their lots whose it shall be entire upon his cross in hebrew greek and latin they inscribe so pilate willed though by the priests opposed jesus of nazareth king of the jews this title in three several tongues displayed read all those crucifiers of their king and murmured as they read hard to the last obdurate unbelieving now began the executioners to spread his arms upon the beam transverse and through his palms monsters of cruelty and through his feet they drove their spiked nails whilst at the clang of those dire engines every feeling heart uttered a groan that with the mingled shrieks of mothers and of children pierced the air the priests and elders gnashd their teeth for rage and rancorous spite to hear him so bewailed women dropped down convulsed and on the spot let fall their burdens immature for birth words fail to paint the horrors of that scene the very soldiers paused and stood aghast musing what these lamentings might portend scarce dared they to pursue the dreadful work awestruck and gazing on the face divine of the suspended savior he though stretched upon the rack of agony to heaven raising his eyes  father of mercy cried forgive them for they know not what they do o ruthless murderers could ye hear these words and yet persist blasphemers can ye read and not adore the people stand at gaze the rulers eager to provoke anew their quailing resolution with one voice cry out amain  ah thou that on the cross now hangest thou that boastedst to destroy our temple and rebuild it in three days where art thou if thou be the very christ the king of israel now come down descend and save thyself this seeing we will then confess thee and believe but it is in vain he hears not he replies not he expires others he saved himself he cannot save peace peace revilers nor expect reply think not that christ thus dying for mankind will from his great commission turn aside and stop the sacrifice and quit the cross on which his body offered up for sin as on an altar lies your taunts he hears yet will he not descend called down by you nor at the door of death shrink back and leave short of perfection his allglorious work but wait the time and greater sign than this ye shall behold when rising from the dead and incorruptible he shall return on earth triumphant over the cross and death yet such is the perverseness of your hearts him nor descending would ye now believe nor reascending will ye then confess and now behold on either side the cross of christ a wretched malefactor hung groaning and writhing in the pangs of death when one of these encouraged by the taunts of the reviling priests scornful exclaims  hearst thou not what they say if thou be christ why art thou in this torture save thyself and us thy fellows from this cross redeem  this when his penitent companion heard new horrors smote his heart his faultring voice he raised and thus the blasphemy rebuked have thou no fear of god expiring wretch stretched as thou art upon the tree of death have thou no terror for the wrath to come and truly we the merited reward of our ill deeds receive but this just man what has he done in him no fault is found this said the penitent with faith inspired upon the savior turned his dying eyes and  lord he cried with supplicating voice when to thy heavenly kingdom thou shall come oh then remember me  to him the lord  i tell thee of a truth this very day thou shall be found in paradise with me oh words of joy that breathe into the ear of the expiring penitent the pledge of pardon and acceptance words that waft the soul yet hovering on the lips of faith into the heaven of heavens with grateful heart we hail the glorious promise which unfolds the gates of bliss and present entrance gives to the repentant sinner now no more conjecture ponders on the life to come our dying savior draws aside the veil through which dim reason caught a doubtful glimpse of shadowy realms that stretched beyond the grave elysian scenes in clouds and mist involved yet with this comfort take the caution too for who shall say what penitence was his that earned this promise fatally he errs whose hope foreruns repentance who presumes that god will pardon when he is tired of sin and like a stale companion casts it off oh arrogant delusive impious thought to meditate commodious truce with heaven when deaths swift arrow smites him unprepared and that protracted moment never comes or comes too late turn then presumptuous man turn to the other sinner on the cross who died reviling there behold thy doom thou too the virgin mother of our lord by the angelic salutation hailed blessed above women thou amidst the group of sympathising mourners at that hour wast present when the incarnate virtue born of thine immaculate womb impregnd of heaven hung on the cross expiring he from thence on thee disconsolate a dying look of tenderest pity cast and at thy side noting the meek disciple whom he loved thus both addressed  woman behold thy son son look upon thy mother  sacred charge and piously fulfilled  now darkness fell on all the region round the shrouded sun from the impenitent earth withdrew his light i thirst  the savior cried and lifting up his eyes in agony  my god my god ah why have thou forsaken me  exclaimed yet deem him not forsaken of his god beware that error twas the mortal part of his compounded nature breathing forth it is last sad agony that so complained doubt not that veil of sorrow was withdrawn and heavenly comfort to his soul vouchsafed ere thus he cried  father into thy hands my spirit i commend  then bowed his head and died now gabriel and his heavenly choir of ministring angels hovering over the cross received his spirit at length from mortal pangs and fleshly prison set free and bore it thence upon their wings rejoicing then behold a prodigy that to the world announcd a new religion and dissolved the old the temples sacred vail was rent in twain from top to bottom midst the attesting shocks of earthquake and the rending up of graves now those mysterious symbols heretofore curtaind from vulgar eyes and holiest deemed of holies were displayed to public view the mercyseat with its cherubic wings oershadowd and the golden ark beneath covering the testimony now through the rent of that disseverd vail first saw the light a world redeemed had now no further need of types and emblems dimly shadowing forth an angry deity withdrawn from sight and canopied in clouds him face to face now in full light revealed the dying breath of his dear son appeased and purchased peace and reconcilement for offending man thus the partition wall by moses built by christ was levelled and the gentile world entered the breach by their great captain led up to the throne of grace opening himself through his own flesh a new and living way then were the oracles of god made known to all the nations sprinkled by the blood of jesus and baptized into his death so was the birthright of the elderborn heirs of the promise forfeited whilst they whom sin had erst in bondage held made free from sin and servants of the living god now gained the gift of god eternal life soon as these signs and prodigies were seen of those who watched the cross conviction smote their fearstruck hearts the sun at noonday dark the earth convulsive underneath their feet and the firm rocks in shivered fragments rent roused them at once to tremble and believe then was our lord by heathen lips confessed when the centurion cried  in very truth this righteous person was the son of god  the rest in heart assenting stood abashed watching in silence the tremendous scene the recollection of his gracious acts his dying prayers and their own impious taunts now rose in sad review too late they wished the deed undone and sighing smote their breasts strait from gods presence went that angel forth whose trumpet shall call up the sleeping dead at the last day and bade the saints arise and come on earth to hail this promised hour the dayspring of salvation forth they came from their dark tenements their shadowy forms made visible as in their fleshly state and through the holy city here and there frequent they gleamd by night by day with fear and wonder seen of many holy seers prophets and martyrs from the grave set free and the first fruits of the redeemed dead they who with christ transfigurd on the mount were seen of his disciples in a cloud of dazzling glory now in form distinct mingling amidst the public haunts of men struck terror to all hearts ezekiel there the captive seer to whom on chebars banks the heavens were opened and the fatal roll held forth with dire denunciations filled of lamentation mourning and of woe now falling fast on israels wretched race he too was there hilkiahs holy son with loins close girt and glowing lips of fire by gods own finger touched there might be seen the youthful prophet belteshazzar named of the chaldees interpreter of dreams knowledge of god bestowed in visions skilled and fair and learned and wise the baptist here girt in his hairy mantle frowning stalked and pointing to his ghastly wound exclaimed  ye vipers whom my warning could not move timely to flee from the impending wrath now fallen on your heads whom i indeed with water christ has now with fire baptized barren ye were of fruits which i prescribed meet for repentance and behold the axe is laid to the unprofitable root of every sapless tree hewn down condemned and cast into the fire lo these are they these shadowy forms now floating in your sight these are the harbingers of ancient days who witnessed the messiah and announcd his coming upon earth mark with what scorn silent they pass you by them had ye heard them had ye noted with a patient mind ye had not crucified the lord of life he of these stones to abraham shall raise up children than you more worthy of his stock and now his winnowing fan is in his hand with which he will purge his floor and having stored the precious grain in garners will consume with fire unquenchable the refuse chaff thus the terrific vision in the ears of the astonished multitude declaimed with threatening voice and wrung their conscious hearts whilst the blaspheming priests who in their scorn triumphant saw the savior of the world expiring on the cross and deemed him lost now by the resurrection of the saints ushered on earth with prodigies and signs confounded and amazed began to doubt if yet the sepulcher had power to keep it is crucified possessor safe in hold and with these thoughts perplexed masking their fears under pretense of caution they repair to pilate and demand a roman guard to watch the tomb of christ and then they add  for we remember that deceiver said whilst he was yet alive after three days i will again arise therefore we pray command the sepulcher to be made sure till the third day lest his disciples come by night and craftily remove him thence so the last error shall outgo the first but pilate whose unrighteous judgment still sat heavy on his heart had little care for what might them befall and to their suit briefly replied  why do ye ask of me that custody which in yourselves ye have take your own watch and to their charge commit the safeguard of that body which though dead keeps yet alive your fears it is your own cause as such i leave it with you so begone he said and turned aside nor did they tempt further discourse but murmuring went their way end of the sixth book calvary or the death of christ  book vii  the argument of the seventh book this book opens with the scene of mount calvary at the coming on of evening christ still hanging dead upon the cross the disciples standing apart and the holy women watching amongst whom is the blessed virgin supported by st john christ having bequeathed her to his care his address to her on this subject and her reply the soldiers come and break the legs of the two malefactors but finding christ already dead they pierce his heart with a spear and blood and water issues from the wound they take him down from the cross and lay him in the sepulcher his spirit in the meanwhile is conveyed by the angels into the region of death that region described and the distant prospect of the bottomless pit where the souls of the wicked are in torment christ points out these scenes to gabriel and instructs him as to the future objects of his descent into this gloomy region satan expelled from earth falls prostrate at the foot of the throne of death he makes suit to that power for protection death rejects his intercessions the person and palace of the king of terrors described the triumphant entry of christ satan is hurled into the bottomless pit and there bound by the strong angel the horrors of that dreadful abode are represented death humbles himself before the redeemer of mankind and conscious that his power is overthrown tenders his crown to christ as to his conqueror he lays the key at his feet which sets free the souls of the saints who are destined to be partakers of the first resurrection this key is given to gabriel with instructions for their release christ in his reply to death forewarns him of his doom but signifies to him that the dissolution of his power will not be immediate the approach of the saints concludes the book  calvary book vii the descent into hell now hesperus renewed his evening lamp and hung it forth amid the turbid sky to mark the close of this portentous day the laboring sun in his midcourse eclipsed darkling at length had reached his western goal and now it seemed as if all nature slept oerspent and wearied with convulsive throes upon his cross the martyred savior hung pale through the twilight gleamd his breathless corpse and silvery white as when the moonbeam plays on the smooth surface of the glassy lake his thorncrownd head upon his breast reclined his arms were wide outspread as if in act to embrace and welcome the converted world so were they late expanded when he cried  come all ye heavy laden come to me and i will give you rest death had not dared to rob those features of one heavenly grace nor had the worm authority to taint that incorruptible and hallowed shrine wherein his purity had deigned to dwell the living saints here mingling with the dead stood round in pensive meditation rapt silent spectators of the awful scene there his disciples in a group apart like frighted sheep that cluster in a storm thronged each on other interchanging looks of sorrow and despair no voice was heard no utterance but of sighs though all had need of comfort none had comfort to bestow but peter in whose selfaccusing breast grief rolled in tempests had the whilst chosn out a solitary spot where at his length outstretchd with face incumbent on the ground he lay like one whom fortune had cast off of all hope reft most wretched and forlorn there too the holy mother might be seen like rizpah watching over her murdered son rooted in earth a monument of woe beside her bathed in sympathising tears first in his masters love as meek of soul stood john adopted by his dying lord son and supporter of that mournful saint at length with reverend love he turned his eyes upon the virgin mother and thus spoke oh thou participant with god himself in his incarnate offspring if i claim the glorious title which my dying lord on me thy servant ever now thy son gracious bequeathed let not my words offend high honor and a trust than life more dear has christ by this adoption deigned to cast on me unmeriting yet well i heard those sacred words  mother behold thy son son look upon thy mother  yes i heard and treasuring in my heart the rich bequest bowed and obeyed even then my zeal had spoke the dictates of devotion had i dared to break the awful silence of that hour or sacrilegiously divert the ear of mute attention whilst those lips divine those living oracles had breath to move now mute alas for he is now no more who had the words of life our hope is quenched our glory vanished see the deed is done those murderers have killed the prince of peace cold on the cross and stiffning in the wind to the rude elements his corpse is left nor is there found who shall provide a grave for the sad relics of the son of god but lo the heavens that three long hours have mourned in darkness now throw off their sable shroud the earth no longer quakes beneath our feet the shattered rocks subside nature is calm the sun unmasks and through disparted clouds with ruddy twilight streaks the western sky and may not we since god has now withdrawn his terrors and asswagd the wrathful sky may not we hope that as his light revives at the third hour so of his blessed son the promised resurrection to new life at the third day shall also come to pass when as the sun emerging from eclipse darkness dispells so christ from out the grave arising shall dispell our dark despair to him the holy mother thus replied thou meek disciple in thy masters love preeminently blessed since he whose will should govern so decrees it from this hour henceforth i lodge thee in a mothers heart and hold thee as my son for i perceive christ from his human nature is withdrawn and to mortality has rendered back all that from me a mortal he received his incorruptible now lives with god and in that glory i no part must claim flesh cannot share with spirit henceforth thou thou art my son adopted in the place of that incarnate virtue of whose birth miraculous the eastern star gave sign and angels witnessed him the son of god and now behold what wonders mark his death whence are these prodigies what but the hand of god can shake the pillars of the earth seal up the sun and rend these rocks in twain turn day to night tear down the temple vail break up the graves and bid the saints come forth lo where they pass as sensible to sight as in broad day substantial man to man and can we ask if he be very christ whom stars and angels ushered into birth can we doubt him on whom the spirit of god dovelike descended can we stop our ears against a voice from heaven are we so blind dull and insensible not to behold that sun emergent and these moving shapes that to revisit earth have left their graves awakened as from sleep if these can rise if these whose bones are moulderd into dust on whom the worm has fed for ages men as mortal as ourselves can reascend out of the pit do not these signs bespeak his second coming who is lord and christ he shall he shall return upon the earth victorious over death and we though now humbled in heart and for a season sad yet wavering not in faith and holding fast the anchor of our hope shall yet again behold his glory and as now his death turns day to night his resurrection then shall into joy convert our present gloom but see where peter prostrate on the earth is lost in sorrow haste and bid him rise tell him the days at hand when he must work has he not heard the servant shall not sleep in his lords absence strengthen thou his heart so spoke these saints and each to other gave alternate solace faith inspiring hope and hope asswaging woe at peters side behold the meek disciple  up he cries awake and put on strength the virgin saint the mother of our lord bids thee awake unprofitable grief avails naught but godly sorrow is approved in works meet for repentance up for christ though dead yet speaks and shall come again on earth woe to that servant therefore whom his lord shall find thus sleeping great shall be his wrath this said he reached his hand and raised him up he stood and spoke  servant of christ approved thee and thy blessed sender i obey yet does my heart by deep remorse subdued press downward to the dust a wretch i am who has denied his lord what can i do a miserable man o righteous john when thou shall spread abroad as sure thou will the direful doings of this fatal day and publish to mankind the wondrous love of christ thus dying for them i conjure thee be faithful to the truth screen not my crime foul though it be but let the nations know peter who vaunted of himself was false so shall they reap instruction from my shame and by despising me correct themselves thus spoke the contrite saint when now the priests whose custom was upon this solemn eve to purge their golgotha from human blood send forth their guard official to remove christ and the slaves convict before the dawn of that great day too hallowed to permit their bodies festring on the illomend cross and lo the soldiers so enchargd arrive survey the victims and begin the work but first the ponderous sledge with horrid crash descending breaks the knees and ankle joints of these two criminals for stubborn life still hovered on their lips and now and then their heaving bosoms fetched a deepdrawn sigh like the slow swell of seas without a wind but when the saviors body they approached and saw there needed not a second blow to make his death secure the word of god prophetic moved their else obdurate hearts to break no limb yet one so destined thrust his spear into his side and forthwith flowed water and blood from the heartpiercing wound so deep the stab that to lifes citadel had life remained the mortal point had reached and there had finished it meanwhile behold joseph arrives a counselor was he but not for death and rich and just withal in ramoth born where samuel first drew breath and as his heart in righteousness and faith stood firm with christ whilst living so his zeal an honourable interment to bestow on his dead master prompted him to make bold suit to pilate for the lifeless corpse nor failed he of his suit therefore he came so favored to receive the precious charge of those dear relics and with decent rites commit them to the grave speard to the heart and death with double diligence ensurd the body they take down the hands and feet pierced through with nails and all besmeared with blood o piteous spectacle which to behold bathes every angel face in heaven with tears accursed deicides the time comes on when every mark your sacrilegious hands have printed on that corpse shall be a seal to testify against you every gash unclosd shall with it is living lips proclaim christ in his human attributes renewed corporeal yet immortal then the hand of him who doubts shall probe those gaping wounds and by the evidence of sense compel the faithless and reluctant to believe and now they place the body on the bier cleansd of the blood and wrapped in seemly cloths then under guard convey it to the vault hewn in the rock where never corpse was laid and there consign it to it is dark abode rolling a massy fragment to the door unwieldy vast and having sealed the stone they post their sentinels and so depart meanwhile the unhoused spirit of christ set free from gross communion with his earthly clay borne with the meteors speed upon the wings of mightiest cherubim had now approached the dark confines of deaths engulphd domain here at the barrier of that vast profound on the firm adamant from whence uprose the towering structure of hells ebon gate the heavenly visitant descending bade his cherub bearers stoop their wings on which as in a plumey chariot he rode and now alighted on the dreadful brink the savior paused and downward cast his eye over that immeasurable blank the grave of universal nature founded then and charterd to the gloomy powers of sin and death sinborn when the primaeval pair lost immortality and fell from god the starry lamps of heaven here lost their light no sunbeam ever reached this dismal realm yet in christs spirit divine that living light which from the father of creation flowed before all time inherently supplied selffurnishd vision to explore the bounds of that oblivious pit in whose dark womb myriads of unredeemed souls were plunged all who of human birth had passed that gate from righteous abel the firstfruit of death to him whose heart had newly ceased to beat were in that gulf immersed at farthest end of that obscure a pillary cloud arose of sulfurous smoke that from hells crater steamd whence here and there by intermittent gleams blue flashing fires burst forth that sparkling blazed up to the iron roof whose echoing vault resounded ever with the dolorous groans of the sad crew beneath thence might be heard the wailing suicides remorseful plaint the murdrers yelling scream and the loud cry of tyrants in that fiery furnace hurled vain cry the unmitigated furies urge their ruthless task and to the cauldrons edge with ceaseless toil huge blocks of sulphur roll pild mountains high to feed the greedy flames all these the accursed brood of sin were once the guilty pleasures the false joys that lured their sensual votarists to the infernal pit them their fell mother watchful over the work with eye that sleep never closed and snaky scourge still waving over their heads for ever plies to keep the fiery deluge at it is height and stops her ears against the clamorous din of those tormented who for mercy call age after age implored and still denied these when the allpresent spirit of christ descried at distance tossing in the sulfurous lake and heard their dismal groans the conscious sense of human weakness by experience earned in his own mortal body now put off and recollection that himself of late in his sublunar pilgrimage had proved temptations like to theirs drew from his soul a sigh of natural pity as from man to man although in merited distress but when his human sympathy gave place to judgment better weighed and riper thoughts congenial with the godhead reassumed the justice of their doom the abhorrence due to their vile deeds by voluntary act of will left free committed in despite of conscience moving them to better thoughts turned him indignant from the loathed sight of these impenitents when after pause to gabriel chief of the cherubic host and late his strengthening angel thus he spoke gabriel or ever from this high steep we launch with prone descent into this gloomy vast this shadowy dark inane the realm of death after so swift a race through all the spheres from earth to this hells portal it behooves thee and thy plumed cohort to recruit the vigor of your wings for sure i am that in this subterranean we shall find no breeze from heavens pure ether to give aid to motion or uphold in steady poise your feathry vans outstretchd nor may we look for star or planet or one straggling ray from circumlucent sun to guide our course through this obscure domain of night and death nor less behooves thee gentle as thou art friendliest to man of all heavens angel host and for each task of mercy and of love first in the choice of god to arm thy heart for the sad spectacles the dismal scenes which we must needs encounter in this gulf of human misery this world of woes fit residence for satan and his crew of outcast angels sad reverse to thee inhabitant of heaven and now behold where hells infernal pit with horrid glare flames through the dismal gloom there but that god in mercy films thine archangelic eye such myriads in that everburning lake of souls tormented thou would else discern as would appal thy nature but these scenes from thee a spirit so loving to mankind so melting soft to pity are withheld no mercy can i meditate far them impenitent no embassy of peace have i in charge no respite till the trump of general resurrection calls them up at the last day of judgment then to hear their crimes rehearsed their blasphemies exposed their envyings frauds revilings treachries plots and every secret of their hearts unmasked by an allrighteous judge who shall pronounce their final condemnation and decree their present pains perpetual we meanwhile to other regions shall divert our course from them and from their torments far apart regions of night and silence where the souls of righteous men in their oblivious caves sleep out the time till their deliverer comes to wake them from their trance dissolve the spell of their enchanter death and set them free to range the fields of paradise where flows as from a fountain by gods presence fed beatitude surpassing human thought pleasures unseen unnumberd unconceivd this said from those high battlements the dove of peace upon redemptions errand sent borne on the wings of his cherubic choir descended swift and through the drowsy void to deaths terrific palace steered his flight here the archfoe of man from earth expelled by mans redeemer newly had arrived but fearstruck and in like disastrous trim with warworn sisera when in his flight from the victorious naphthalite he came to ask protection at falfe jaels tent and ruin found instead the whirlwinds blast had shattered his proud form now scorched by fires now driven to regions of perpetual frost beyond extremest saturns wintry sphere no middle course kept he nor had his feet from their aerial journey once found rest till at the threshold of deaths gloomy throne down on the solid adamant he fell precipitate at once and lay entranced of archangelic majesty the wreck scared at the hideous crash and all aghast death screamd amain then wrapped himself in clouds and in his dark pavilion trembling sat mantled in night and now the prostrate fiend reared his terrific head with lightnings scorched and furrowed deep with scars of livid hue then stood erect and rolled his bloodshot eyes to find the ghastly vision of grim death who at the sudden downfall of his fire startled and of his own destruction warned had shrunk from sight and to a misty cloud dissolved hung lowering over his shrouded throne when satan whose last hope was now at stake impatient for the interview exclaimed where art thou death why hide thyself from him of whom thou art come forth thou grisly king and though to suitor of immortal mould thy refuge be denied yet at my call thy fathers call come forth and comfort me thou gaunt anatomy with one short glimpse of those dry bones in which alone is peace and that oblivious sleep for which i sigh he said and now a deep and hollow groan like roar of distant thunders shook the hall and from before the cloudenvelopd throne the adamantine pavement burst in twain with hideous crash selfopend and displayed a subterranean chasm whose yawning vault deep as the pit of acheron forbade all nearer access to the shadowy king whereat the imprisoned winds that in it is womb were cavernd gan to heave their yeasty waves in bubbling exhalations till at once their eddying vapors working upwards burst from the broad vent enfranchised when behold the cloud that late around the throne had poured more than egyptian darkness now began to lift it is fleecy skirts till through the mist the imperial phantom gleamd monster deformed enormous terrible from heel to scalp one dire anatomy his giant bones stard through the shrivelled skin that loosely hung on his sepulchral carcass round his brows a cypress wreath tiaralike he wore with nightshade and cold hemlock intertwind behind him hung his quiverd store of darts winged with the ravens plume his fatal bow of deadly yew tall as goliahs spear proppd his unerring arm about his throne if throne it might be called which was composed of human bones as in a charnel pild a hideous group of dire diseases stood sorrows and pains and agonizing plagues his ghastly satellites and even than these more terrible ambitions slaughtring sons heroes and conquerors styled on earth but here doomed to ignoble drudgery employed to do his errands in the loathsome vault and tend corruptions neverdying worm to haunt the catacombs and ransack graves where some late populous city is laid waste by the destroying pestilence or stormed by murdering russ or tartar bloodbesmeard and furious in the desperate breach to plant his eagle or his crescent on the piles of mangled multitudes and flout the sky with his victorious banners now a troop of shrouded ghosts upon a signal given by their terrific monarch start to sight each with a torch funereal in his grasp that over the hall diffused a dying light than darkness self more horrible the walls of that vast cenotaph hung round with spears falchions and poleaxes and plumed helms showed like the armory of some warlike state there every mortal weapon might be seen each implement of old or new device which savage nature or inventive art furnished to arm the ruffian hand of war and deal to man the lifedestroying stroke and them betwixt at intervals were placed the crowned skeletons of mighty kings caesars and caliphs and barbarian chiefs monsters whose swords had made creation shrink and frighted peace and science from the earth pondering the scene in mute amazement rapt the lost archangel stood when soon the voice of death as from the tombs lowmurmuring thus bespoke attention  what uncivil cause prince of the air provokes thee to offend against the peaceful charter of these realms by voice thus rude and clamorous know thou not i reign by privilege though son not slave of thee heavnexild here no place have thou for here is peace no part in this domain to thee and to thy rebel host belongs they in the flames of tartarus but we dwell with the silent worm the power we have over mans corruptible and mortal part ends with the body here the bones may sleep for these anatomies disturb us not but for the spark unquenchable the soul immortal which survives the fleeting breath of that we take no charge that must abide in other regions it is appointed lot of misery or bliss what then has death to do with satan can the son who drew existence from the father quench that spirit which god decreed eternal will those fires cease at my word hell will not hear my voice nor can the howlings of the infernal pit enter my ears ask not repose of me tormented fiend there is no grave for sin no sleep for satan fallen from heaven thou art there thou have no abode fallen now from earth where is thy lodging where but in those flames pass on then in thy course nor loiter here for hell expects thee were thou here to stay death in destroying thee himself destroys whereto the unwelcome visitant replied  inhospitable power and is it thus thou greetst a father in his extreme need suppliant for leave to draw a moments breath in thy pale presence till this furious blast that followed me from earth shall spend it is rage and cease to howl through the profound of hell if in thy heartless trunk no memory dwells of what i was oh teach me to forget what now i am and make my senses dull to pain as thine to gratitude are lost but if thy mind be present to record my fall from bliss will it not also serve to put thee in remembrance how that fall bestowed on thee a station and a name had i not fallen from heaven man had not lost the joys of paradise immortal joys till i destroyed them who then but myself exiled from god brought death into the world gave thee the sepulcher for thy domain and every mortal body for thy prey whose hand but satans thankless as thou art placed that victorious wreath upon thy brow armed thee for war and bade thee be a king and what does satan now demand of death what but a moments respite the small boon of hospitable shelter where to lay my aching head and rest my weary wing this to the father can the son refuse i ask no more if christ from whom i fly pursues me to this pit and into hell descending shall repass her gloomy gates guarded by sin that barrier lost farewell to all thy greatness where shall be thy sting o death and where thy victory o grave then to have harbord satan shall not add one feather to the balance of thy fate all must be lost together i to flames consigned thou phantom into air dissolved no more of this vain arguing death replied my peace and my repose i can but deal as god decrees and as he wills withhold thus wrangling to the latest hour of time nothing o satan could thou wring from me but the same answer and the same despair i with mortality alone confer thou art a deathless spirit if my power cannot annihilate the soul of man how then of angel guilty thou have been conscious must ever be and therefore cursed of me complaining thou condemnst thyself the righteous ever are at peace with death thou art not of their number spirit unblest author of mans revolt and all things ill the hell which thou have peopled is thine own earth thou have made a ruin men by thee perverted turn to monsters heaven itself disturbed by thy rebellion for a while suffered convulsion and her thrones besieged echoed the din of battle the fair bloom of paradise was blasted by thy spells and man driven forth to till the unthankful earth and toil and sweat for a precarious meal degraded from his origin at length to me and to corruption was consigned these were thy doings this was my descent and my inheritance the loathsome worm the throne funereal and this yawning gulf impassable which i am yet to thank for that it holds thee at a distance from me this is thy bounty look upon these bones survey this dread anatomy and say if son so fashioned owes his father thanks proportioned to thy goodness i accord my gratitude by bidding thee avaunt hence from my sight intruder thrust from earth as heretofore from heaven and tempesttorn with bruised head and shattered flagging wing hither thou come a fugitive from him whom in the wilderness for forty days tempting thou did annoy dull doting spirit blind to thine own destruction not to see gods power in christ nor understand that he who foiled thy cunning might defy thy strength but neither strength nor cunning shall prevail to draw me forth upon a losing side and set this empire on a desperate cast i lack presumption to oppose that power which puts hells monarch to inglorious flight what shelter can thou find behind a shade an airy phantom such thou say i am such let me be that phantom will not tempt the furious blast of gods avenging breath nor moved to pity by thy treacherous plaints tender oblivions boon to soul accursed such favor when thou would extort from death that phantom will be adamant to thee now learn a truth christ in the flesh is dead yet long i cannot hold him in the grave his body interdicted to the worm for some mysterious purpose is reserved from all corruption free and sure i am he will not leave his enemy at large in this obscure domain where sleep the souls of righteous men fly then whilst yet the hour serves thee for flight  and hark the angel trump sounds his approach now tremble thou accursed no more encanopied beneath the wings of mighty cherubim with sounding trump and joyful chaunt the lord of life came on  lift up your heads the heavenly chorus sung lift up your heads ye everlasting gates and christ the king of glory shall come in  bright as the sun his presence darkness fled down to the center satan on the earth fell motionless death trembled on his throne and called his shadowy guards they with loud shrieks vanished in air whilst from the gulf profound blue lightnings flashed and deepmouthed thunders roared when christ with eye severe on satan turned bade the storm cease and thus addressed the fiend well art thou found thou serpent on the brink of thy last home this horrible abyss for thee and for thine impious crew prepared man from his god by thy corruption turned is by my death received into the peace of his offended maker and if faith opens his way to heaven in righteousness and true conversion death cannot retain his soul in darkness nor thy crafty wiles puzzle his path and damp his glowing zeal but thou presumptuous who have had the world to range at will and from gods altars plucked their consecrated honors falsely viewed those spoils by sufferance yielded as the prize of thine own proper victory behold these are thy triumphs in this pit receive thy follys confutation and the doom of woe eternal on thy sin denounced he said nor other answer satan gave than one deep groan rent from his laboring breast the strong vindictive angel to whose charge the key of that infernal pit belonged now seized him in his grasp and from the ground lifting his ponderous bulk such vigor dwelt in arm celestial headlong down at once down hurled him to the bottom of the gulf then followed on the wing his yelling cries death heard whilst terror shivered every bone not so the choir cherubic they with joy beheld redemptions triumph in the fall of that great dragon enemy of man that ancient serpent now with bruised head and stingbereft hurled down into the pit whereat in heavenly concert they begin to raise their tuneful voices and sing forth praise to the lamb of god and joyful strain of gratulation to the saints redeemed  now is salvation come and strength and power the kingdom of our god and of his christ now is that railing and malignant foe cast down into the pit which day and night accused our righteous brethren to their god now are they made victorious by the blood of the redeeming lamb and in the word of truth their fearless witness through the world go forth against the anarchy of sin a host of martyrs faithful unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye of earth inhabitants awake to joy and hail the dayspring of salvation from on high satan meanwhile ten thousand fathoms deep at bottom of the pit a mangled mass with shattered brain and broken limbs outspread lay groaning on the adamantine rock him the strong angel with ethereal touch made whole in form but not to strength restored rather to pain and the acuter sense of shame and torment hideous was the glare of his bloodstreaming eyes and loud he yelld for very agony whilst on his limbs the massy fetters such as hell alone could forge in hottest sulphur were infixd and rivetted in the perpetual stone upon his back he lay extended huge a hideous ruin not a word vouchsafed that vengeful angel but with quick dispatch plied his commissioned task then stretched the wing and upward flew for now the infernal cave through all it is vast circumference had given the dreadful warning and began to close it is rocky ribs upon the imprisoned fiend fierce and more fierce as it approached became the flaming concave thus comprest the vault red as metallic furnace glowed intense with heat that had the hideous den been less than adamant it had become a flood or satan other than he was in sin and archangelic strength preeminent he neither could have suffered nor deserved panting he rolled in streams of scalding sweat parched with intolerable thirst one drop of water then to cool his raging tongue had been a boon worth all his golden shrines vain wish for now the pit had closed it is mouth nor other light remained than what the glare of those reverberating fires bestowed then all the dungeon round was thick beset with horrid faces threatening as they glard their haggard eyes upon him from hells lake flocking they came whole legions of the damned his worshippers on earth sensual profane abominable in their lives monsters of vice bloodstained murderers apostate kings and crowned tyrants some tormented now for their past crimes and into furies turned accusing their betrayer curses dire hissings and tauntings now from every side assailed his ear on him on him alone from cain first murderer to iscariot all all with loud voices charged on him their sins their agonies with imprecations urged for treble vengeance on his head accursed founder of hell sole author of their woe and enemy avowed of all mankind now when the king of terrors had perceived the power of his new visitant and saw satan engulphd and the devouring pit best barrier of his throne for ever closed descending from his state with heart abashed conscious that pride would ill befriend him now in presence of his conqueror at the feet of christ with low obeisance he put off the trophies of his brow and on the knee stooping his vassal head low homage paid and suppliant thus his humble suit preferred immortal king all glorious and all good at whose great name befits that every knee in heaven or earth or in these realms beneath should bend adoring let thy will prevail here as wherever else and sure i am it is not my power but thine own wondrous love consenting to the deed has brought thee here in pity to mankind to taste the cup of agony and visit these sad shades though deathless thence to reascend as soon thou shall victorious to the realms of light i know thee for the christ the son of god messiah of the prophets long foreseen yet of the unbelieving jews despised rejected for thou came not in the pomp of temporal majesty and only great in patience in humility in love and miracles of mercy at thy feet this head uncrownd thus stooping i resign all empire not on me let fall thy wrath as on that bruised serpent what am i what is the sword what is the pestilence and all my host of mortal ministers but servants of thy providence a scourge and rod of vengeance wherewith to chastise presumptuous guilty pride whose hand but mine strikes terror to the atheists hardened heart who plucks the tyrant from his bloody car and rolls him in the dust or at a blow strangles the curse in the blasphemers throat if on the martyrs head my axe descends the same hand plants a crown of glory there and if in my dark caves the righteous sleep peaceful they sleep i break not their repose for silence dwells with me and night and rest behold the key inviolate that guards their hallowed slumbers never did i yield though often solicited this sacred pledge to satan or his sindefiled crew faithful i have kept it ever faithful now to thee their savior i resign my charge this said the golden badge of his command rich and of heavenly workmanship with gems of azure green and purple thick embossed humbly he laid at the redeemers feet he to the zeal of gabriel strait consigned the enlargement of those spirits to bliss preferred fit minister for office so benign whereat he bade sound forth the signal trump of the first resurrection heard of none save of those holy saints elect of god martyrs and prophets called to live with christ in antecedent glory till the day of general resurrection shall awaken and summon into judgment all mankind swift hied that friendly angel on the wing swifter for that on gracious errand sent joy urged him to put forth his utmost speed meanwhile the heavenly visitant of death upon that ghastly vision turned his eyes and thus in accent mild addressed the shade that i came down from heaven and am the christ rightly o death thou have pronounced yet here i come not to destroy thy power at once but to set free the saints thou holdst in thrall and call them to my peace but even of these part till my second coming must abide of thee and all things of corruption bred the term is fixed god must be all in all but time as man computes has yet to roll through numerous ages ere the final trump shall sound thy knell i brought not upon earth peace but the sword the gospel i have preached man will corrupt misconstrue and pervert nor shall my church be only drenched with blood of it is own martyrs zealots shall arise aliens to my humility and peace with more than pagan enmity enflamed each against other then shall ruthless war and persecution and fierce civil rage ravage the christian world intolerant pride usurping power infallible shall send it is heralds forth with cursing in their mouths and fetters for mans conscience in their hands they in the battles front shall plant the cross and bid the unconverted nations kneel under their conquering standard and adopt the creed of murderers who in the place of the pure bond of charity present a forged scroll blurred and defaced with lies and impiously inscribe it with my name these are religions traitors and from them an ample harvest shall thou reap o death suffice it thee to know that for a while thou shall be spared and now no more behold gabriel leads on the congregated saints vanish pale phantom give the ransomed place end of the seventh book calvary or the death of christ  book viii  the argument of the eighth book christ having closed his interview with death prepares to receive the saints of the first resurrection now approaching under the conduct of the angel gabriel and having ascended a mount in the midst of the congregation appears to them in glory they pay homage to their redeemer in a hymn of praise and thanksgiving he addresses them in reply and assures them of the blessings of immortal life bestowed upon them by the father as the reward of righteousness the patriarch abraham enters into conference with christ in the conclusion of which the savior of the world shows him the glorious vision of the heavenly jerusalem the holy city as described in the apocalypse when this beatific vision is passed away christ reascends to earth in view of the whole assembly of saints the angel gabriel who is left behind addresses them from the mount and expounds the purposes of the saviors resurrection from the dead and return to earth moses recapitulates the events of his life instances the frequent rebellions of the lords unfaithful people and laments their future impenitence and incredulity gabriel replies and from the nature of mans free will explains the origin and necessity of evil from which he deduces the benefits of christs death and redemption and now the spirit of god descending on the hearts of the righteous inspires them with all understanding and knowledge fitted to their happy condition a paradise arises within the regions of death gabriel addresses them for the last time and upon his departure the poem concludes  calvary book viii the resurrection from the dead now had the savior by the word of power wafted the magic phantom into air and all the horrors of the scene dispelled swift as the stroke of his own winged dart or flitting shadows by the moonbeam chased death on the instant vanished what had seemed a citadel of proud and martial port with bastions fenced and towers impregnable of adamant composed and lofty dome covering the throne imperial now was air and far as eye could reach a level plain in the interminable horizon lost unfolded it is vast champain to the view darkness twinborn with death had fled the rays that from the saviors suncrownd temples beamed with dazzling luster brightened all the scene there just emerging to the distant view and glittering white a multitude appeared stretched east and west in orderly array swift marching underneath the mighty wings of the protecting angel who in air soared imminent and with the broad expanse from flank to flank envelopd all the host he with the blast of the awakning trump gave note of their advance in the midplain there was a mount thither the savior hied with his cherubic guard and there in view of the assembled myriads stood sublime the saints in order formed themselves around orb within orb each in his proper sphere instinctively arrangd then all at once as by one soul inspired with bended knee and forehead prostrate on the earth they paid joint homage and adored oh who shall dare with bold conjecture to compute the list of that blessed multitude or say who first who last received the glorious allhail ye blessed of my father yet perchance so warranted by scripture and so taught by moral sage experience we may doubt if many rich if many great or learned were of that righteous company be sure the lover of this world had there no place he bartered it for gold he passed it off to belial for a perishable toy he sold it to a wanton there the proud were brought down and the meek and lowly raised the conqueror not of others but himself there found preeminence all joy to him who reared the orphan dried the widows tears and sought affliction in her secret haunts not for the praise of men and may not we born in an age when mild philanthropy has taught a better lesson to the heart may not we foster a kind hope that some of pagan name were called who through the maze of dark idolatry took reasons clue and found a mental avenue to god here with the father of the faithful stood a host of patriarchs prophets judges saints noah who perfect in the time of wrath and righteous found was left unto the earth a remnant when the waters fell from heaven and was in covenant with the most high that man no more should perish by the flood moses the faithful servant of the lord meekest though mightiest of the sons of men and glorious in the sight of dreadful kings joshua the avenger of the elect of god whose voice upon mount gibeon staid the sun in the midheavn and bade the moon stand still in ajalons dark vale till israel ceased from slaughter and the conquering sword was sheathed here samuel in his linen ephod girt thrice called of god amid the foremost stood he who with baals priests contending reared his rival altars and brought fire from heaven to vindicate his god the psalmist king and he at whose sick prayer the sun went back and he surnamed the good daniel the feer and they who in the furnace walked unhurt all in the sacred page recorded just and faithful servants of the living god for who can doubt the holy word of truth attesting their salvation yet there is one who by promise sacredly assured of bliss immediate heard the glorious call whilst hanging on the cross by penitence and faith obtained from the allgracious lips of gods own son expiring at his side hail holy congregation elderborn of righteousness and first fruits of the grave elect unto salvation hail blessed saints now clothed in white robes as in your lives with purity sound forth your praise to god and to the lamb in whose blood ye are washed wave high your branches of victorious palm hymning the strain which he in patmos heard what time the glorious vision was revealed hail first and last the immortal chorus sung of all things the beginning and the end for thou art he who lives and wast dead and lo thou art alive for evermore and holdst in hand of hell and death the keys salvation to our god and to the lamb at his right hand who sits on the throne blessing and glory wisdom honor power might and thanksgiving evermore to god and to his christ father we give thee thanks lord god which wast and art and art to come for this thy mighty power in us fulfilled now are the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever now thy wrath on the rebellious nations is let loose now is the first call of the sleeping saints and all thy servants faithful unto death thou have rewarded with eternal bliss henceforth for ever blessed are the dead thus dying in the lord for they shall rest from labor and their good works are not lost their hymn performed the whole redeemed host with hands uplifted and all eyes direct upon the glorious presence bent the knee silent whilst thus the lord of mercy spoke ye blessed of my father prophets saints and martyrs ye of abrahams faithful stock and ye though wild by nature grafted in upon the parent tree and bearing fruits to life eternal welcome to my peace now are your watchings and your labors past your tribulations selfdenials pains and mournings recompensed never again shall ye know thirst or hunger nor the sun scorch you by day nor yet by night the moon for ye shall dwell before the throne of god and i will feed you i will lead you forth to living founts and wipe away all tears come enter ye into your masters joy come for the throne awaits you take the crown of glory take the kingdom from all time for you prepared possess your happy rights the earnings of your charity and love for i was hungered and ye gave me meat thirsty i was and ye asswagd my thirst i was a stranger and ye took me in naked ye clothed me sick ye visited i was in prison and ye came unto me when lord the righteous humbly interposed when were these charities by us performed how have we merited this praise of thee whom in the flesh we knew not tell us lord when saw we thee anhungred and gave food when thirsty and gave drink a stranger when and took thee in naked and clothed thee when saw we thee in sickness or in prison and came unto thee when did thou endure these hard necessities or we relieve whereto the lord replied truly ye say me in the flesh ye knew not yet in spirit ye knew me for my law was in your hearts and what to these my brethren ye have done or to the least of these ye did to me patron of mercy and the friend of man to every one but not to all alike some talent is in trust the loan of heaven to husband as he may and he who spares from his imparted fund wherewith to help his neighbors scantier dole improves the loan and makes his lord his debtor first and last ere abraham was i am open your ears hear mark and understand the world by sin original had fallen off from god man was become corrupt idolatrous abominable satan reigned on earth ye are of various ages all have slept and some from earliest times or ever the flood swallowed the nations yet with one accord all in your several periods have bewailed degenerated man noah can tell how all the earth with violence was filled or ever the fountains of the vasty deep were broken up moses can well declare how hard and to rebellion prone the hearts of those whom he led forth samuel beheld a stiffneckd generation spurn the yoke and kick against their god but vain his voice vain all the prophets voices which foretold my coming without whom the world were lost now is salvation come i have drank the cup of bitterness and died the death for man my peace i have left on earth the living world they have the word of truth and by that word through faith they shall be saved from them i came to visit these dark regions and redeem the saints who slept behold ye are alive death has no more dominion satan chained for ages shall abide his time to come meanwhile in glory ye shall dwell with me by resurrection purchased with my blood ye are the first fruits of immortal life now abraham father of the faithful band and first in station nearest to the mount his eyes uplifted to the face divine of the effulgent virtue and thus spoke yet once more as aforetime in the days of sodom suffer me to plead for man and ask of thee his savior if these few few not in numbers yet for heaven too few and for heavens mercy seeing there are past so many many ages of the world are all that shall be saved alas for man if this be the whole remnant all the stock culled from so many myriads for gods fold where are the nations vanished where the hosts that sea earth flood and fire have swallowed up can hell contain them can devouring death find stomach for them all did god make man for death and hell or thou endure the cross only for us are all the righteous shrunk to this small measure and if these be all are they not yet enough to save the rest if heavenly mercy listen to our prayer may not our righteousness so save a world from wrath as once the righteousness of five had saved a guilty city from it is fate to him the lord of mercy i have said ye are the first fruits by my blood obtained the earnest of redemption i have bruised not crushed the serpents head he shall arise out of the pit once more to vex the earth death the last enemy is not destroyed yet is his scepter shortened and the key that opens into life now in those hands where mercy best can place it for mans good thus of all power though death is not bereft yet i have shook his throne with inroad deep pierced his dark realm and you redeeming thence made tenantless your graves his strongest holds with you when from this depth i reascend and through heavens golden portal lead my host of saints highwaving these victorious palms your white robes glittering in gods starry courts great sure will be the triumph loud the acclaim when all my fathers angels shall sound forth their joyful halelujahs round his throne enough for victory has been achieved destruction is reserved to that great day when the compelling angel shall go forth to gather every atom of mans dust which the seas cover or the earth contains then shall all souls be judged if abraham then when of all hearts the secrets shall be known then if the friend of god has aught to urge in mitigation of mans guilt be sure ere justice strike mercy will hear the plea of this no more the seasons and the times are with the father the dread hour draws on but i must first revisit those on earth whom i have left in sorrow for their sakes i must again submit me to the flesh and by the evidence of sense confirm my promised resurrection this performed and immortality revealed to man by faith made sure my gospel shall go forth my office then the comforter will take the weak he shall make strong the foolish wise and by the mouths of sucklings and of babes he shall confound the wisdom of the world and over the gates of hell erect my church when thus the patriarch glowing still with zeal for mans salvation further question urged lord will not then the faithless world believe when thou returnst with glory from the dead when they behold thee visible on earth and thence to heaven ascending can they doubt such revelation can their eyes resist their ears such truth recorded shall there then be left a gentile idol upon earth to rival israels god shall there not be one shepherd and one fold for all mankind one faith one baptism one lord and christ but i perhaps too bold offend thine ear with my rude converse lord if so command my tongue to silence yet not in thy wrath not in thy wrath o lord reprove my zeal whereto the savior mildly thus replied o abraham in whose soul compassion glows and love that burns with zeal for all thy sons nor for thy sons alone but the whole world whose advocate thou art think not the tongue that speaks for mercy can offend my ear yet what thy zeal anticipates in time is distant far ages must roll betwixt thy hope and its completion threatening clouds lour on the glorious prospect seas of blood must first be passed long pilgrimage and sad my martyrs have to make through valleys dark where ignorance shades the sun through frightful haunts where superstition pictures out the scene in monstrous forms and worships what it dreads painful their march and round beset with snares here treachry lurks there persecution flames before them infidelity behind reproach and slander and the roar of tongues contentious urging them to turn from god and waste their nobler zeal in vain dispute thus step by step in righteousness and faith armed at all points my servants militant shall win their way and what they earn enjoy lowly and meek i came into the world and meek and lowly i shall now return not with that glory rising from the grave which for my second coming is reserved but in that mortal body which they pierced showing my wounds not with the proud display of one who courts the voice of public fame but communing apart with those i left to be my witnesses that so through them men may be taught by reason to discern not what they must but what they should believe not by the evidence of sense to feel but by the minds conviction to perceive truth in it is argument not act and build on reason not necessity their faith and on their faith and their good works their hope god will not always struggle with mankind heap proof on proof till incredulity though blind must see though deaf of force must hear he will not bring his heaven upon the earth rather will lead mans heart from earthly things to reach at heavenly the railing jews who fixed me to the cross bade me come down and with the sign of power dispel their doubts so had i frustrated all faith at once and with all faith all virtue i was dumb i opened not my mouth to their reproach i stirred not from the cross i died the death nor to my rescue brought one angel down though legions waited to obey my call and now none other sign will i vouchsafe but of the prophet jonas for as he from out the belly of the whale emergd on the third day so i from out the tomb in the same body will come forth on earth with the third mornings dawn thus shall the word of prophecy by my disciples heard not understood be perfected in me and i will breathe my spirit into their hearts to comprehend all scriptures and to preach me crucified nor shall there be a dearth of witnesses to publish and attest my resurrection hundreds shall behold my substance in the flesh and he that doubts shall touch me and believe more to expound there needs not this in all your ears aloud i now promulgate that when i am gone ye may abide the interim in peace by terror or impatience undisturbed and now not many are the days to pass ere to the heaven of heavens i shall ascend and there in blessed communion with my saints made perfect after death for ever dwell at the right hand of power meanwhile the seed which i have sown though of all grains the least yet watered by the comforter shall grow of herbs the greatest and become a tree within whose branches all the birds of air shall come and lodge so shall my kingdom rise from mean beginning into mighty growth a still small current spreading as it goes for in the arm of man i place no strength nor in the battles thunder can be heard his voice that preaches peace to storm the ear like those loud heathen orators who shake the forum with their eloquence ill suits the servants of a master little versed in this worlds wisdom and not vain of speech in love in calm persuasion and in peace my gospel i have planted woe to them who in the place of these sweet fruits provoke the baneful growth of persecution strife and discord in my church opening my wounds unheald and crucifying me afresh to him the patriarch lord we give thee thanks for that thou have imparted to thy saints these tidings of great joy though distant far and through such clouds of sorrow dimly seen and sure we are thy gospel shall prevail yet much do we lament for what thy saints and martyrs have to suffer upon earth foiled by that first deceiver of mankind who though now bruised and for awhile enchaind shall yet come forth to vex thy holy church to conjure up false prophets and pervert thy followers who are taught to live in peace and charity with all men but we know god did not build this goodly frame of things for satan to destroy and he and death shall have an end heaven is mans natural home and righteousness the impulse of his heart nor will god fail his promise that in me and in my seed the whole world shall be blessed ah when shall i behold that promised day when shall i see the warring world at peace when shall my israel scattered over the earth and straggling wide hear their good shepherds call and come into his fold sure that blessed voice that glorious vision would be heaven itself that vision thou shall see the lord replied and smiled allgracious on the enraptured saint from this prospective mount with purged eye that through the lengthening tract of time discerns futurity remote thou shall behold the apocalypse which to no living eye save of my servant john i shall disclose but know ere this blessed period shall arrive the elements must melt with fervent heat and earth and sea and heaven must pass away darkness and sin and death shall be no more and a new world shine forth ascend the mount and eastward turning tell me what thou see i see the patriarch cried an heaven and earth earth without sea and heaven without a cloud all bright and glistning from the makers hands i see descending from the throne of god jerusalem the holy city new decked like a bride for her celestial spouse order and grace and symmetry conspire in all her parts and with the rich display of vivid gems make glorious her attire to the four points of heaven in equal span she stretches out her manycolourd walls celestial masonry whose meanest stone more rare and precious than the brightest gem of earthly diadems transparent flames from the foundations to the topmost cope of mural battlement one dazzling blaze of glorious jewelry and them amidst on every flank quadrangular three gates each of an orient pearl to our twelve tribes by number and by name appropriate stand open guarded by cherubic watch through whose unfolded portals i descry a city all of purest gold and clear as the unclouded crystal on whose towers gods allsufficient glory sheds a flood of radiance brighter than the borrowed beam of shadowy moon or sun often wrapped in clouds making alternate night and day on earth but night is here unknown day needs not to rest in darkness nor the eye in sleep nor temple here for worship may be found the everpresent deity demands no house of prayer in every heart is built his altar every voice records his praise and every saint his minister and priest through the midstreet a crystal river flows pellucid welling from the throne of god it is living source upon whose border springs the tree of life bearing ambrosial fruits monthly renewed and varied through the year food for immortals in whose balmy gum and leaves medicinal a virtue dwells so general and potential that no pain or ailment but here finds it is ready cure no tear shall wet this consecrated soil nor feud nor clamor nor unholy curse disturb these peaceful echoes here the saints in sweet harmonious brotherhood shall dwell serene and perfect in the sight of god and hark i hear seraphic voices chaunt to their melodious harps the bridal hymn  now is our god espoused to his church and from their heavenly union are gone forth blessing and peace and joy to all mankind now shall his saints eternal sabbath keep from death and pain and wailing and complaint all is made new the old is passed away time draws aside the faded scene of things and nature in immortal freshness blooms now to the waters of the fount of life perpetual waters every soul may come and he that is athirst may freely drink but fire and brimstone in the burning lake shall be their portion who revolt from god there with the beast in torments they shall dwell sealed in their foreheads with his mark and drink the cup of indignation to the dregs wrung out in anger whilst their ceaseless cry shall with the smoke of the infernal pit day after day for evermore ascend no more for now the heavenly vision closed awakened from his trance the patriarch turned with grateful reverence to address the lord and giver of these newdiscoverd joys when lo ascending from the mount he saw christ in a cloud of glory on the wings of mighty cherubim upborne in air highsoaring to this orb terraqueous bound seen overhead diminished to a point dim and opake amid the blue serene his raiment whiter than the newborn light struck out of chaos by the makers hand in earnest of creation sparkling blazed in it is swift motion and with fiery track marked his ascent to earth the host of saints with joyful loud hosannas filled the air glory to god on high was all their strain on the earth peace good will to all mankind meanwhile the archangel gabriel who yet kept his tutelary station on the mount so biddn of christ with arm outstretchd and voice commanding silence thus the saints bespake now is your resurrection sure your joy your glory and your triumph over death and hell made perfect for behold where christ your firstfruit is arisn and waves on high the ensign of redemption now he soars up to yon pendent world that darkling speck which in the boundless empyrean floats poised on it is whirling axle there he lived and took your mortal body there he died and for your sakes endured the painful cross giving his blood a ransom for your sins thither he goes to reassume his flesh there when his angel ministers have opened the sealed sepulcher he shall come forth and show himself resurgent from the grave to those whom he has sanctified and called to be his witnesses in all the world and of his resurrection after death their faithful evidence to seal with blood of martyrs and apostles warning men with their last breath to be baptized and live so shall the seed be watered and increase till all the gentile nations shall come in and dwell beneath it is branches evermore now are the gates of everlasting life set open to mankind and when the lord captain of their salvation shall have lived his promised term on earth and thence to heaven ascending seat himself at gods right hand then shall the holy ghost the comforter rush like a mighty wind upon the hearts of his inspired apostles tongues of fire and languages untaught they shall receive to speak with boldness the revealed word enduring all things for the gospels sake troubled on every side yet not distressed perplexed but not surrendered to despair afflicted not forsaken they shall be cast down but not destroyed knowing that god who raised the lord jesus from the dead them also into life through him will raise and that the light affliction of this world which is but for a moment soon shall be oerpaid by a far more exceeding weight of glory eternal in the life to come he ceased and all were silent wrapped in awe of the late glorious vision yet in heart troubled for what the angel had revealed of sorrows still to come and pains and deaths to be encountered by the saints on earth when now that shepherd who on sinais mount commund with god and heard creations plan expounded by it is architect thus spoke oh thou whom through the fiery cloud i saw on horebs hill when tending jethros flock what time i heard my name twice called of god in thunder from amidst the flaming bush bidding me strait go forth to loose his sheep from egypts captive fold i do perceive that i have penned the word of god aright and now in christ behold the womans seed bruising that serpents head who wrought the fall of our first parents forty days and nights on sinais top midst thundrings clouds and fire fasting i stood and whilst the hallowed ground trembled beneath my bare unsandald feet i heard an awful voice that bade me write the glorious record of his six days work aghast confounded dazzled with the blaze of glory still my faithful pen obeyed the sacred dictates of an unseen god i wrote and to an unbelieving world published the wondrous code age after age libelled the transcript with the rod of power i smote the seas asunder israel passed through watery battlements forty long years in the waste howling wilderness i fed their murmuring tribes with food miraculous they fed but murmured still i brought them laws with gods own finger graven i came down bearing jehovahs statutes in my hand on both sides written impious noisy shouts lewd triumphs and vile revels smote mine ear the people danced around a molten calf monstrous idolatry raging with shame i dashed the stony tablets on the ground and shivered them to fragments god was mocked a stiffneckd and a stubborn race they were who from the rock of their salvation turned and sacrificed to devils and behold their sons have crucified the lord of life therefore his resurrection which shall be light and redemption to the gentile world to them is darkness and the shadow of death for they have slain the very paschal lamb that bloody symbol of their ancient law which i made sacred they have now made void and cancelled my legation i perceive a new commandment is gone forth i see the temples vail is rent for the old law a carnal shadow of things spiritual sufficed not for perfection and the power of an eternal life christ is become that king of salem that immortal priest of god most high whose ministry supreme before all time from heaven itself derived and not from right levitical removes all title from that consecrated tribe where i had fixed it god who sending me sent but his servant now has given his son more worthy of his glory without sin and spotless he the great high priest has passed into the heavens victorious over death but i whose trespasses at meribah frail sinful man provoked the lord to wrath saw but the skirts of dan from pisgahs top unworthy deemed to enter that fair land and died upon mount nebo but when christ who has awakened us from sleep shall rise and in his mortal flesh a second time visit his saints on earth who then shall say there is no resurrection of the dead faintly i shadowed forth a future life i spoke not to mens senses as christ speaks god gave me no commission to reveal the secrets of the grave corruptions worm spared not my flesh nor came my spirit back from deaths dark citadel to give mankind conviction ocular of his defeat i left him in his power till christ should come to break that scepter which had awed the world much then it moves my wonder much i grieve that darkness shall not yet be drawn aside from israel and that those who would not hear me and the prophets shall not yet believe christ their messiah rising from the dead to whom the archangel answered heavenly mild well may thou muse that reasoning man should doubt and cause we have to grieve when he neglects so great salvation but when christ has shown what is the good and true and perfect way reason must do the rest when all are free some must be faithless wilful and perverse god could have made his creatures void of sin for he can put a master in their hearts and govern them by instinct but to man he gave a nobler faculty a will a spark of immortality a soul reason to counsel that immortal soul and conscience to restrain licentious will grace shall assist the humble and devout a proud man has no friend in heaven or earth renounced of angels and by men abhorred truth must be sought it will not be imposed what were that revelation which should leave no exercise to faith all men must work with fear and trembling their salvation out god does not give free will to take away what he has given if man will sin he must nor do we call them good who cannot err else brutes would claim a virtue none is good save god alone impute we not to god the evil which man does nor him arraign for not preventing ills which he foreknows angels have sinned and some are fallen from bliss all had their days of error their degrees of good and ill else why have we degrees ranks and precedencies of bliss in heaven call your own lives to mind ye have been men your failings many yet your virtues more why are ye now rewarded by your god why but because those virtues were your own ye made them what they were ye reared their growth reason reformed the wild luxuriant soil plucked up the weeds and nursed the glorious fruit is there amongst you one that has to boast human perfection there is none that will a free yet faultless creature would be more than man than angel nor can god create an equal to himself a rival god in edens happy groves when man was placed one interdicted baneful plant there was tempting and rich in fruit all else was good fair to the eye and wholesome to the taste yet of that fruit man plucked and eat and died tempted he was but not compelled to take warned to abstain no angel stopped his hand no thundering voice deterred him from the deed for man was free so could he not have been had gods foreknowledge overruled his will thus sin had origin and death began his occupation with the human race more terrible for that he came with pangs horrors and doubts on sinoppressed man when conscience wrung him in the parting hour but still the inextinguishable soul mocked at deaths dart the body was his own from the beginning of the earth twas made the earth it tilled and from the earth it fed a tenement of dust was never formed fox immortality and now behold adam the earthy man in whom all die is buried to the world redemption brings the dayspring of salvation from on high christ in his glory comes the lord from heaven and who in him have faith in him have life he ceased when now the assembly of the saints who whilst he spoke stood in their orbs unmoved circling the mount gan feel the spirit of god descending on their hearts and like a sea by secret currents from it is bottom stirred waved to and fro their undulating files wide and more wide as with a mighty wind the heavenly inspiration on them rushed this gabriel heard and from the mount came down which quaked beneath his feet whilst overhead loud thunderings announcd the coming god and now a fire that covered all the mount bespoke him present all the air respird ambrosial odours amaranth and rose for nature felt her god and every flower and every fragrant shrub whose honied breath perfumes the courts of heaven had burst to life blooming and in a thousand colors died threw their gay mantle over the naked heath now glowed the living landscape hill and dale rose on the flat or sunk as nature shaped her loveliest forms and swelled her wavey line leaving unreind variety to run her wild career amid the sportive scene nor were there wanting trees of every growth umbrageous some making a verdant tent under their spreading branches some of shaft majestic towering over the subject groves blossoms and fruits and aromatic gums scented the breeze that fanned their rustling leaves and them betwixt a crystal river flowed over golden sands meandring in it is course through amaranthine banks with lulling sound of dulcet murmurs breathing soft repose thus at the sight of god spontaneous rose a paradise within the realm of death where that blessed congregation might abide their lords return now visitant on earth and now the eternal having breathed his joy into their hearts and given them to discern all knowledge that befitted souls so blessed withdrew his presence from the flaming mount whereat the ministring angel who beheld salvations work complete thus parting spoke god in whose presence pleasure ever dwells has for your dear redeemers sake bestowed these joys and now his presence is withdrawn yet has he left his spirit in your hearts to teach you all that is and is to be behold the cloud that veiled your mortal eyes is drawn aside and what as in a glass darkling ye saw now face to face is seen ye now discern the ways of god how just how true how wise how perfect in design and well ye know that man presumptuous man in a vain shadow walks ye perceive his boasted mind sufficient for the things that to his own salvation appertain yet when it scans the mysteries of heaven how false how weak how daringly absurd firm faith warm charity and humble hope these are the christian graces these the guides that lead to life eternal thoughts perverse pert quibbling follies published in the pride of false philosophy are devilish arts that damn the instrument who thus attempts to hide the light of revelations beam from weaker eyes and turn the world from god these verily shall have their just reward and now no more this paradise ye see is but your passage to a brighter scene a resting place till christ shall reascend to the right hand of god and call you hence to share his glory in the heaven of heavens he said and swifter than the meteors glance sprung on the wing to seek his native sphere the saints looked up then sung with joint acclaim  glory to god and praises to his christ judge and redeemer of the quick and dead end of the poem
