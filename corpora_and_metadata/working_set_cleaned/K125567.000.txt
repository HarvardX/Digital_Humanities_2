a letter to a member of parliament on mailcoaches  by thomas pennant esquire  london printed for r faulder new bondstreet  mdccxcii  dear sir i am much obliged to you for your favor of the  th instant i pay such deference to your opinion that i entirely lay aside all thoughts of troubling your honorable house with the affair of repealing the act of exemption of mail coaches from the payment of tolls i would avoid every adventure which does not promise success and should be much mortified to be unhorsed and laid sprawling on the arena of st stephens  yet i shall be extremely sorry that any member of your house should through any quickness of misapprehension wilful or natural imagine me to be so wild as to think of an attempt that was not founded on reasonable and honest principles  i am sensible that the exemption of the mails from the payment of tolls commenced very early i think first by an act of william and mary which was afterward repeated in several others till it was oppressively confirmed by that of the   th geo iii  the most secondsighted of your house could never have foreseen that the usage of the single horse and postboy afterward in many parts converted into the light mailcart drawn by one horse would be superseded by a royal carriage drawn by four horses and filled by passengers who before rode in the common stages and contributed to support the roads which they passed over this unfortunate change proceeded from an extent of prerogative repined at only when perverted to the injury of the subject as this most incontestably must be allowed to have done  under the sanction of the first act turnpike gates were erected and immense sums of money lent on the national faith for a long time the security was esteemed good and in wales where five per cent was given people at first were happy to place their money on mortgages they imagined so safe the transfer was then easy and the public rested perfectly content the commissioners did their duty fully they laid out the money to the best advantage nor did they desist till the lowering of the tolls by the fatal change of the mode of conveyance had taken place  i will exemplify the hardships only in the country i live other places equally remote from the capital must come in for their share of the grievance but they will fall under the common description  before the institution of mailcoaches two stagecoaches ran through the county of flint and were it not for an evasion the change of horses between gate and gate in the mostyn district one of the districts principally aggrieved each would have paid forty pounds a year this unhappily was left unguarded in the act by the help of that evasion both together only paid that sum and even that sum had we not been deprived of it would have enabled us to take up  00l more and given us the power of repairing every part of the road which was not unexceptionably good  many parts may have been allowed to have been indifferent but they were adequate to the uses of the country not only for the use of the farmers and the carriers but also for the luxury of carriages  in this state they were found at the introduction of mailcoaches these soon occasioned the suppression of the common stages and deprived us at once of forty pounds of annual income in the year      a person was sent from the general post office to survey the roads from his report and by the orders of the post office indictments were preferred at the great sessions at mold against the whole extent of road in the narrow but long county of flint in some instances i fear the grand jury made a strain of their consciences in finding the bills for some of the indicted places were in most admirable repair but we were unwilling to obstruct any thing that tended to promote the public good  fines to the amount of   00l were imposed on the several townships many of which were very small and the inhabitants composed of small farmers and laborers poor and distressed to the highest degree  two of these townships had a great extent of road and only a few laborers and a few miserable teams to perform their statute duty one of these townships terrified with the prospect of ruin by the execution of the summum jus performed twentytwo days duty upon the road the other township had only a single farmer living in it who performed a duty of twentyeight days  the vast expenses which the commissioners had been at in the repairs of the roads had almost exhausted the credit in some totally so that at present  0l cannot be obtained for  00l worth of our parchment securities  at this period i was moved with compassion at the complaint and distresses of the poor this induced me to write my circular letter to the several grand juries of england and wales in order to induce them to unite in a common cause i blush at my want of success resulting from either ignorance of or indifference to the first principles of security of property i was simple enough to think that the justice of the cause would have insured an approbation of my plan instead of that i am told that in some places it was even treated with rudeness and contempt i ventured even to write to two gentlemen with whom i was not personally acquainted they never paid the lest attention to my letter they forgot my character and they forgot their own  i took the liberty of getting my circular letter conveyed to a third gentleman high in office with whom i was acquainted it was returned with written on a corner of it mr pennant is in the wrong and i will have no concern in the affair the gentleman may be politically right but i am confident that mr pennant is not morally wrong  there has certainly been a strong misapprehension of my meaning i did not intend the abolition of mailcoaches they have their objections whether we consider the barbarity with which the poor horses are treated or the very frequent destruction of the passengers  our old jehus may have slain their thousands our modern their tens of thousands i only wished that they might not prove oppressive to many of our counties by causes i have before mentioned true it is that in my first circular letter i did most rashly and unadvisedly hint that they might without injury be converted into the mailcart the gentlemen of somersetshire who i must confess did admit that something should be done for us very justly fired on the idea of sending their thespis again into his cart a worthy friend of mine of that county warmly but kindly expostulated with me on the subject but i hope this my declaration of repentance will be admitted and atone for my error  the grand juries of cheshire berkshire monmouthshire and those of north wales united in the support of my design the rest of the counties proved to me the truth of the remark of swift that he never knew any person who did not bear the misfortunes of another perfectly like a christian  far the majority of the roads in england have great revenues arising from the multitude of stagecoaches that keep their ground in defiance of mails our stages are obliged to desist from traveling and give the former a most unjust and oppressive monopoly the counties interested in them feel not our unhappiness and want generosity to contribute to the alleviation of the distresses we suffer  we should have made a claim on the justice of the house had we had the most distant prospect of success we are now in the case of creditors defrauded by the superior cunning of an artful debtor had an individual received an adequate mortgage on his estate and had afterward the dexterity to lessen the income what name would he have deserved the highest term of reproach but such a one that could never be applied the most remotely to any member of your honorable house  this affair has never yet been seriously considered good men i trust will now awake as from a sleep and stand amazed and confused at the sad delusion they discovered that they had labored under favorite systems run away with mankind and totally annihilate all attention to the inconveniences they occasion the act was obtained late in the sessions hurried through a very thin house and with the slightest opposition the legislature obliges a certain time of notice to be given before the introduction of a common turnpike bill let me ask should not at lest the interval of a session have been given for the discussion of so strange and unequal a taxation  what may i ask could make the individual liable to censure and the actions of the collective body be passed over without blame either the numbers defend or some demon like the ghostly father of charles i has whispered in your ears have a double conscience one that is to make you consult the plain dictates of honesty the other telling you to support some fancied public good at the expense of a certain number of persons who in times not very remote had trusted their money to the security of the public faith  or may you not hold the same doctrine as the nuns in tristram shandy that the divisibility of sin may enable you to fritter it away into almost nothing  you certainly have the advantage the nuns were but two you are five hundred and fiftytwo to bear the featherweight of the wrong decision you had most unwarily been induced to make  let me now ask are there no instances of repeal of acts on far less important occasions i well recollect two the first is the jew act which had in fact no consequences to be feared religious or political the other was the cider tax esteemed like ours a partial grievance and yet its overthrow was easily effected i reflect on these two acts repealed without cause and on our oppressions continued in defiance of every principle of justice  since your honorable house was determined to weaken our securities ought it not to have first paid off every turnpike mortgage and then you might have had full liberty of doing what you pleased with the income of the gates  i beg leave to lay before you a case in which your house once showed a most scrupulous attention to the rights of creditors that was by the repeal of a clause in the kingsland turnpike act part of it leads from shoreditch to ware and this part was crossed by the newmarket road and tolls were taken by the commissioners of the ware road from all travelers to and from that seminary of virtue merely for crossing the road on the renewing of the kingsland turnpike act the newmarket people insisted that they should pass free of tolls a clause was inserted in the new act for that purpose and the crossgates were pulled down the creditors of the kingsland turnpike petitioned to the house of commons for redress they succeeded and the crossgates were again erected and the tolls taken till the whole of the creditors were paid  newmarket road  shoreditch to ware    i imagine that there is not a member of the house who has not acted as a commissioner of the turnpikes let me request him to call to mind whether he has not in that character or in the character of a magistrate treated with a harsh severity the delinquent who through poverty has defrauded the gate of ninepence what plea of conscience has the commissioner urged for maintaining the interests of the gates and discharging his trust like a man of honor is there not a lethean atmosphere in the chapel of st stephen so suddenly to efface all memory of transactions in the common air of the world i trust that there is otherwise the individual who in one place and in one character had been so strenuous to save a poor ninepence should in another place and in another character vote as a perquisite to the comptroller general of the post office an exemption of the mails from toll a sum amounting to not less than  0000l a year on which he has a most considerable poundage besides some very good pickings from other articles this i am assured of by a worthy member of your house i think his salary is but   00l per ann what a monstrous quantity of sack is allowed to his halfpennyworth of bread  so liberally supplied as the comptroller has been with the means cannot something be deducted to relieve our complaint if the honorable house does not choose this mode a small a very small tax on the passengers and on the immense sums got by the carriage of parcels would compensate for the loss of exemption of tolls the rich english districts would be above taking advantage of this diminution of revenue to the comptroller general it is only for the poor welsh districts and a few others like circumstanced for which it is humbly asked  i have a respect for the plan of the mailcoaches and for the inventor but i never could think of applying to him as the nizam al muluc the regulator of the postingempire there ought not to be in our constitution such a monster as a comptroller uncontrollable by his legislature or his superiors in office legislature must now see its imprudence in permitting a latitude of so dangerous a nature i an individual never could bear the thought i looked for redress to the postmaster general or to the three estates of the kingdom  i fear too great a veneration has been paid to this newcreated office and mode of conveying the mail i always wish to pay every individual and every office a due respect but in this case i must preserve the independent and useful man and endeavor to correct every abuse that falls within my sphere as a provincial magistrate what i am going to say may be deemed foreign to a legislative friend yet as it may prove useful to many who behold these new vehicles with a kind of veneration i shall mention an affair which happened in our county in the last autumn let me premise that those protectors of the mail the guards relying on the name of royalty had in the course of the irish road through north wales committed great excesses one on a trifling quarrel shot dead a poor old gatekeeper a coroners jury was huddled up and in defiance of the tears of the widow no judicial notice has been taken of the affair to this very day in anglesey another of these guards discharged his pistol wantonly in the face of a chaise horse drawing his master the rev john bulkely who was flung out and died either on the spot or soon after i think that his wife who was with him survived but a very short time these guards shoot at dogs hogs sheep and poultry as they pass the road and even in towns to the great terror and danger of the inhabitants i determined to put a stop to these excesses and soon had an opportunity  a neighboring gatekeeper laid before me a complaint that one of the guards had threatened to blow his brains out and had actually shot a dog that had offended him by his barking i issued out my warrant had the guard seized and brought before me he was a man who for his great beauty and elegant person was called the prince of wales i did not hesitate to play the judge gascoigne but from the goodness of his appearace and the propriety of his behavour i did not go quite the length that famous magistrate did i took bail for his appearance at our quarter sessions he appeared before us when by the permission of the chairman i took the lead in speaking i represented to the audience that the guards were entrusted with arms merely for the protection of the mail and the passengers not for the terror of his majestys subjects that a mailcoach was no sanctuary that the bailiff might drag the debtor out of it the constable the felon the exciseman might rummage it for contraband goods and that with as little ceremony as if it had been a higglers cart i farther added had the driver been the offender as the guard was he should have been taken into custody and the postmaster of the district left to provide another to convey the mail to the next stage the behavior of the delinquent was so becoming his situation that by the leave of the court i dismissed the offender with such a reprimand as became the high station of a british justice of the peace an office in dignity and constitutional utility inferior to none in the land young men of the age early initiate yourselves into that great character  i beg pardon for detaining you so long but so much i thought was due to myself and to the public a few papers i have subjoined will fling some farther light on the subject as well as on my proceedings from the beginning i remain with much regard  dear sir your faithful and affectionate humble servant thomas pennant georgestreet hanoversquare march         letter to thomas williams esquire of llanidan member for the borough of marlow downing oct         dear sir i am much indebted to you for your late favor with an official letter enclosed i have no kind of doubt but that the comptroller general will on cool reconsideration of his design of altering the course of the irish mail be induced to lay it totally aside he will admit the importance of the county of chester in its ancient staple of the cheese on which our fleets and armies so greatly depend the city itself if i may judge by the frequent advertisements is about to enter deeply on the fustian manufacture we have the comfort of seeing manchester burning itself to ashes so that we shall have all the manufacture to ourselves the great remittances of taxes from the county and from great part of north wales and the remittances to and from ireland and those occasioned by the great biennial linen fairs must be flung into the scale  the port of parkgate has of late years risen into much consequence it at present maintains four stout pacquets which uninterruptedly ply between that port and dublin the correspondencies of the numbers of passengers embarking or disembarking and the great remittances through this channel are of no small moment and of great general concern  the county of flint little as it is of itself thanks to you and other companies settling among us is now rising into an amazing state of opulence few perhaps can rival it our ancient lead trade was always considerable but by the introduction of the copper and cotton business holywell its environs and their dependancies may boast of commercial property probably to the amount of a million sterling  i have always considered mr palmers plan as useful to his country and an honor to himself except in one article i can never suppose that he will persist in deviating from the utility of his scheme by diverting the mail from such a country as i have described shrewsbury has already its mail after oswestry is past the greatest part of the road to conwy is mountainous poor and half depopulated  it gives me concern to find our interests clash with those of the county of salop i must allow the excellency of the great staples of its capital brawn and rich cakes but still we have the balance in our favor for on the most exact and impartial calculation i do not find that at present the annual consumption of both together can possibly exceed the sum of       l      d  the exceptionable article i allude to is the exemption of the mailcoaches from tolls this falls heavy on the lesser districts possibly we might have endured even that had we not been insulted with indictments and compelled to repairs beyond the real wants of the country that is now over we only wish the restoration of our lost tolls to enable us to support the roads in the present state and to take away all future grounds of complaint from every quarter this will induce me to persist in my design of applying to parliament for redress of the grievance that affects the gates from chester to conwy let the rich english districts take what share they please in their own concerns there is one difficulty in flintshire in respect to the road itself  i mean rhiallt hill the alteration is beyond the power of the poor parish it lies in and beyond the power of the poor mostyn district to effect possibly the improvement may cost from  00l to  00l i wish a small sum might begot from parliament for that and the relief of a few other poor townships i cannot bear to drive over roads smoothed by the bread of the poor peasantry if the mail will be permanent i will cheerfully subscribe fifty guineas toward that improvement the subscription is now begun by advice of my friends i subscribed only   l for fear of discouraging others from joining in this salutary design mr williams meditates an embankment across part of the conwy to secure passengers from the terrors of the quicksands at low water and to lessen the length of the ferry passage at high  i shall conclude with saying that a small addition to the fare of passengers between chester and conwy will indemnify the coach from the loss by toll let mr palmer who cannot but be fertile in expedients consider of the matter my earnest wish is to have harmony restored and the strongest mutual efforts made for the general good  i am dear sir your most obedient humble servant thomas pennant  a letter to the worshipful peter broston esquire mayor of chester downing january         sir on thursday two letters were laid by mr smalley before the commissioners of the flint holywell and mostyn districts signed d smith and g boulton in which our attention was requested to the repair of the roads which lay in our county in the course of the mail it falls to my lot to desire you to communicate to your respectable corporation what the commissioners have done and what they intend to do of their own proper motions not from the fear of any of the very unbecoming menaces sent forth  on the road from holywell to the extremity of the district which is called the flint has been laid out within two years      in the space of five miles great part of which long before the indictments was in most admirable repair  the mostyn district begins at the western end of the flint much of it is in very good order part is very indifferent owing to the impoverished state of the mostyn district and to the inability of the poor inhabitants of the township in which rhiallthill lies to repair that part which is bad by nature i propose a subscription you see my offer in the enclosed we look up to the city of chester as both are engaged in a common cause  the holywell district is excepting near halkin in excellent repair the part complained of will be attended to at the next meeting at holywell at eleven oclock on wednesday the  th of february we shall be happy to see any gentlemen on the part of your city  excuse me if i remind the city of chester the county and also the county of flint that our importance is such that our demand of a mail is a matter of right not a petition for favor how superior is the justice of our claim to that of salop which had long since its independent mail  in respect to my particular actings i never will persist in any thing that is wrong nor desist from any thing that is right our claim for abolishing the exemption from tolls is founded on common honesty my seizing on the guard was the act of an attentive magistrate to prevent future murders two if not three had been committed one near conwy another in anglesey besides the terror spread along the whole road by the wanton conduct of the profligate guards i brought the affair before our quartersession more to set it in the true light than to punish the offender i was aspersed in your city but the examination wiped away the dirty paragraph  i am sir your most obedient humble servant thomas pennant  to the worshipful the mayor of chester to the printer of the shrewsbury chronicle sir downing august        i request you to lay before the public the following advertisement addressed by the commissioners of the mostyn turnpike district in order to avert in future the hardships several of the townships of the county of flint labor under in the repairs of the roads the advertisement itself relates to the greater part of the grievances it was sent to the paper too late to inform the english circuits but has been approved by the grand juries of cheshire denbighshire and flintshire at the spring assizes and by that of berkshire and monmouthshire being the first of the autumn assizes let me here inform you that by indictments from the general post office fines to the amount of   00l have been laid on the several townships lying in the course of the postroads in the little county of flint many of which are very small and labor under the greatest poverty one in particular has a vast extent of road to repair and only a few laborers and four miserable teams to perform their statute labor under those circumstances terrified with the prospect of ruin they performed twentytwo days statute duty the french corvees now so reasonably abolished were introduced on british ground yet in vain for a fine of   l 0s was imposed on the poor people so little interested were they and numbers of others of the welsh townships in the passage of the mailcoach that possibly they do not receive a letter in a year yet these townships must suffer equally with the most opulent and commercial towns many of the roads were unexceptionably repaired the rest were in sufficient repair for the uses of the farmer for the uses of the gentlemens carriages and for the uses of the mail before the late unguarded innovations we are like the israelites required to make brick without straw the means of repair are taken from us and we are fined for not performing impossibilities a postroad is a national concern that to a neighboring kingdom doubly so and certainly that consideration should induce legislature to afford an aid in such cases in which it is found necessary and if a road must be finished with finical perfection the expense ought never to fall on those who are totally uninterested in it justice can never require that the poor should keep pace with the innovations made for the benefit of commerce or luxury much of the roadlaws calls loudly for a reform in all laws there should be a point of limitation the attention of the grand juries is requested at the ensuing assizes it is hoped that they will direct their representatives to make the mailcoaches liable to tolls we mean no injury to mr palmer let him before the meeting of parliament suggest any remedy for the evil and we shall rest content they will certainly do away the great parliamentary opprobrium of the act passed by their predecessors which lessens a security granted on the faith of parliament and much more may be said on this subject but the detail is reserved for another occasion you may be again troubled with my complaints as well as some account of a township grievance brought on it by those whose peculiar office it was to have guarded against the deceptions which imposed on their judgment and brought on a most erroneous and disgraceful adjudication  i am sir your most obedient humble servant thomas pennant  general turnpike concern   at a meeting of the trustees of the mostyn turnpike held at the house of joseph roberts at the blue bell on saturday july  0      the state of the roads was taken into consideration    when it appeared that parts of the coalroad were greatly out of repair the trade in which was the original foundation of this turnpike    that the present annual tolls are very inadequate to remedy the evil    that the failure of the tolls does not arise from any decay of trade in the country but from the exemption granted by parliament by the   th geo iii c    to the mailcoaches from the payment of any tolls    that by such exemption the common stagecoaches have been obliged to desist from traveling by reason of the burden they are singly to sustain and which the mailcoaches are freed from and now in many places monopolize the business    that the mostyn district alone suffers a loss of  0l a year which is the interest of  00l the loss of which prevents the trustees from the repairing of road equal to the expenditure of such a sum    that the clause of exemption in favor ot the mailcoaches is highly detrimental to the credit of the tolls and the security of the lenders who had lent their money under the pledge of parliamentary faith    ordered that the expediency of petitioning parliament on this subject be farther taken into consideration and that these resolutions be published in the next chester paper as they are public concerns every postroad and its several creditors being interested therein    that the sum of ten guineas be paid into the hands of the solicitor toward the expenses of the proposed bill for repealing the exemption of tolls of the mailcoaches and for subjecting them to tolls in case such bill be brought into parliament and that the commissioners of the several turnpike districts in great britain be invited to correspond by their treasurers on the subject with samuel small treasurer of the flint and holywell districts and john lloyd assistant treasurer of that of mostyn   0 that the thanks of the commissioners be given to the foremen and grand juries of the counties of cheshire denbighshire and flintshire for their liberal concurrence with the resolutions of the commissioners of the mostyn district     that it is requested of the gentlemen of this county to attend at mold on saturday the  th of april to give a sanction to this proposal and to prepare one or more petitions or to give necessary instruction to the representatives of the county and borough etc as may then be thought proper     and in order to give force to this reasonable claim on parliament it is recommended to the gentlemen of neighboring counties who may attend the duty of their country on the ensuing grand juries to take the above into consideration and add their weight to the common cause signed by order of the commissioners  john lloyd assistant clerk and treasurer
