washington july    0  dear general —i accept with pleasure and with pleasure reciprocate your congratulations on the acquisition of louisiana for it is a subject of mutual congratulations as it interests every man of the nation the territory acquired as it includes all the waters of the missouri  mississippi has more than    doubled the area of the u s and the new part is not inferior to the old in soil climate productions  important communications if our legislature dispose of it with the wisdom we have a right to expect they may make it the means of tempting all our indians on the east side of the mississippi to remove to the west and of condensing instead of scattering our population i find our opposition is very willing to pluck feathers from monroe although not fond of sticking them into livingstons coat the truth is both have a just portion of merit and were it necessary or proper it could be shewn that each has rendered peculiar service  of important value these grumblers too are very uneasy lest the administration should share some little credit for the acquisition the whole of which they ascribe to the accident of war they would be cruelly mortified could they see our files from april   0  the first organization of the administration but more especially from april   0  they would see that tho we could not say when war would arise yet we said with energy what would take place when it should arise we did not by our intrigues produce the war but we availed ourselves of it when it happened the other party saw the case now existing on which our representations were predicted and the wisdom of timely sacrifice but when these people make the war give us everything they authorize us to ask what the war gave us in their day they had a war what did they make it bring us instead of making our neutrality the grounds of gain to their country they were for plunging into the war and if they    were now in place they would not be at war against the alliests  disorganizers of france they were for making their country an appendage to england we are friendly cordially and conscientiously friendly to england but we are not hostile to france we will be rigorously just and sincerely friendly to both i do not believe we shall have as much to swallow from them as our predecessors had with respect to the territory acquired i do not think it will be a separate government as you imagine i presume the island of n orleans and the settled country on the opposite bank will be annexed to the mississippi territory we shall certainly endeavor to introduce the american laws there  that cannot be done but by amalgamating the people with such a body of americans as may take the lead in legislation  government of course they will be under the governor of mississippi the rest of the territory will probably be locked up from american settlement and under the selfgovernment of the native occupants you know that every sentence from me is put on the rack by our opponents to be tortured into something they can make use of no caution therefore i am sure is necessary against letting my letter go out of your hands i am always happy to hear from you and to know that you preserve your health present me respectfully to mrs gates and accept yourself my affectionate salutations and assurances of great respect  esteem    thomas jefferson july      0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss july      0  it is difficult to see what mr bond would be at i suppose he aims at our citizen laws there is a distinction which we ought to make ourselves and with which the belligerent powers ought to be content where after the commencement of a war a merchant of either comes here and is naturalized the purpose is probably fraudulent against the other and intended to cloak their commerce under our flag this we should honestly discountenance and never reclaim their property when captured but merchants from either settled and made citizens before a war are citizens to every purpose of commerce and not to be distinguished in our proceedings from natives every attempt of great britain to enforce her principle of once a subject and always a subject beyond the case of her own subjects ought to be repelled a copy of general muhlenbergs letter stating the fact of citizenship accurately ought to satisfy mr bond unless he can disprove the fact or unless admitting the fact he at once attacks our principle on that ground we will meet his government as to the patronage of the republican bank at providence i am decidedly in favor of making all the banks republican by sharing deposits among them in proportion to the dispositions they show if the law now forbids it we should not permit another session of congress to pass without amending it it is material to the safety of republicanism to detach    the mercantile interests from its enemies and incorporate them into the body of its friends a merchant is naturally a republican and can be otherwise only from a vitiated state of things affectionate salutations thomas jefferson july      0  washington ephraim kirby to the special commissioner on spanish boundary

will be mr robert carter nicholas of kentucky son of the late george nicholas of that state i am desirous of appointing to the registers office some worthy inhabitant of that part of the country but i have never been able to get a recommendation of anyone he should be of perfect integrity good understanding and if a lawyer so much the better under these circumstances i have thought it best to ask you to take charge of a blank commission to be filled up by yourself as soon after your arrival there as you can acquire information of the best character your own judgment will suggest to you the advantage of keeping it entirely secret that you have such a power in order that you may obtain disinterested information but i am obliged to impose on you    another task quite out of the line of your official duty yet within that of a citizen of the u s we have had no means of acquiring any knolege of the number nature  extent of our settlements west of pearl river yet it is extremely

committee of philada on the subject of removals from office was    received at washington on the   th inst i cannot answer it because i have given no answers to the many others i have received from other quarters your are sensible what use an unfriendly party would make of such answers by putting all their expressions to the torture and altho no person wishes more than i do to learn the opinions of respected individuals because they enable me to examine and often to correct my own yet i am not satisfied that i ought to admit the addresses even of those bodies of men which are organized by the constitution the houses of legislature for instance to influence the appointment to office for which the constitution has chosen to rely on the independence and integrity of the executive controlled by the senate chosen both of them by the whole union still less of those bodies whose organization is unknown to the constitution as revolutionary instruments when nothing but revolution will cure the evils of the state they are necessary and indispensable and the right to use them is inalienable by the people but to admit them as ordinary  habitual instruments as a part of the machinery of the constitution would be to change that machinery by introducing moving powers foreign to it and to an extent depending solely on local views and therefore incalculable the opinions offered by individuals and of right are    on a different ground they are sanctioned by the constitution which has also prescribed when they chuse to act in bodies the organization objects  rights of those bodies altho this view of the subject forbids me in my own judgment to give answers to addresses of this kind yet the one now under consideration is couched in terms so friendly and respectful and from persons many of whom i know to have been firm patriots some of them in revolutionary times and others in those of terror  doubt not that all are of the same valuable character that i cannot restrain the desire they should individually understand the reasons why no formal answer is given that they should see it proceeds from my view of the constitution and the judgment i form of my duties to it and not from a want of respect  esteem for them or their opinions which given individually will ever be valued by me i beg leave therefore to avail myself of my acquaintance with you  of your friendly dispositions to communicate to them individually the considerations expressed in this letter which is merely private and to yourself and which i ask you not to put out of your own hands lest directly or by copy it should get into those of the common adversary and become matter for those malignant perversions which no sentiments however just no expressions however correct can escape it may perhaps at first view be thought that my answer to the newhaven letter was not within my own rule but that letter was expressed to be from the writers individually  not as an organized body    chosen to represent and express the public opinion the occasion too which it furnished had for some time been wished for of explaining to the republican part of the nation my sense of their just rights to participation to office and the proceedings adopted for attaining it after due inquiry into the general sentiment of the several states the purpose there explained was to remove some of the least deserving officers but generally to prefer the milder measure of waiting till accidental vacancies should furnish opportunity of giving to republicans their due proportion of office to this we have steadily adhered many vacancies have been made by death and resignation many by removal for malversation in office and for open active and virulent abuse of official influence in opposition to the order of things established by the will of the nation such removals continue to be made on sufficient proof the places have been steadily filled with republican characters until of     offices in all the u s subject to appointment and removal by me   0 only are held by federalists i do not include in this estimate the judiciary  military because not removable but by established process nor the officers of the internal revenue because discontinued by law nor postmasters or any others not named by me and this has been effected in little more than two years by means so moderate and just as cannot fail to be approved in future whether a participation of office in proportion to numbers should be effected in each state separately or in the whole states taken together is difficult to decide and has not yet been settled in my own mind    it is a question of vast complications but suppose we were to apply the rule of pennsylvania distinctly from the union in the state of pennsylvania   offices only are subject to my nomination and informal removal of these   are in the hands of republicans   of federalists to wit republican federal the attorney dallas naval officer marshal smith surveyor collector muhlenberg commisr of loans purveyor coxe  superintdt mily stores irving  in the hands of the former is the appointment of every subordinate officer not a single one but their clerks being appointable by the latter taking a view of this subject in the only year i can now come at the clerk hire of the naval officer  surveyor is only      d that of the commr of loans   00–     the compensation of the nav off  surveyor were      d in that year the residue of custom house expenses were       d constituting the compensation and patronage of the collector except about   00 d to the officers of the revenue cutter who are republican the emoluments  patronage of the   other republican officers i have no materials for estimating but they are not small considering numbers therefore as the ratio of participation it stands at   to   but taking emolument and patronage as the measure our actual share is much greater i cannot therefore suppose that our friends had sufficiently examined the fact when they alleged that in philadelphia public employment under the general government in all its grades with scarcely an exception    is confined not to federalists merely but to apostates persecutors and enemies of representative government i give full credit to the wisdom of the measures persued by the govr of pennsylvania in removals from office i have no doubt he followed the wish of the state and he had no other to consult but in the general government each state is to be administered not on its local principles but on the principles of all the states formed into a general result that i should administer the affairs of massachusetts  connecticut for example on federal principles could not be approved i dare say too that the extensive removals from office in pennsylva may have contributed to the great conversion which has been manifested among its citizens but i respect them too much to believe it has been the exclusive or even the principle motive i presume the sound measures of their government  of the general one have weighed more in their estimation and conversion than the consideration of the particular agents employed i read with extreme gratification the approbation expressed of the general measures of the present administration i verily believe our friends have not differed with us on a single measure of importance it is only as to the distribution of office that some difference of opinion has appeared but that difference will i think be lessened when facts  principles are more accurately scanned and its impression still more so when justice is done to motives and to the duty of pursuing that which on mature consideration is deemed to be right    i hope you will pardon the trouble which this communication proposes to give you when you attend to the considerations urging it and that you will accept my respectful salutations  assurances of great esteem     thomas jefferson july    0

important matter especially what respects the mare clausum the abandonment of the colonial system  emancipation of s america on the subject of our seamen as both parties were agreed against impressments at sea and concealments in port i suppose we may practice on those two articles as things understood altho no convention was signed i see that the principle of free bottoms free goods must be left to make its way by treaty with particular nations great britain will never yield to it willingly and she cannot be forced i think i have selected a governor for louisiana as perfect in all points as we can expect sound judgment standing in society knolege of the world wealth liberality familiarity with the french language and having a french wife you will perceive i am describing sumpter i do not know a more proper character for the place i wish we could find a diplomatist or two equally eligible for europe accept my affectionate salutations    thomas jefferson aug     0  monticello john dickinson to john dickinson j mss monticello aug     0  dear sir —your friendly favor of the  st inst is received with that welcome which always accompanies the approbation of the wise  good the acquisition of new orleans would of itself have been a great thing as it would have ensured to our western brethren the means of exporting their produce but that of louisiana is inappreciable because giving us the sole dominion of the mississippi it excludes those bickerings with foreign powers which we know of a certainty would have put us at war with france immediately and it secures to us the course of a peaceable nation the unquestioned bounds of louisiana are the iberville  mississippi on the east the mexicana or the highlands east of it on the west then from the head of the mexicana gaining the highlands which include the waters of the mississippi and following those highlands round the head springs of the western waters of the mississippi to its source where we join the english or perhaps to the lake of the woods this may be considered as a triangle one leg of which is the length of the missouri the other of the mississippi and the hypothenuse running from the source of the missouri to the mouth of the mississippi i should be averse to exchanging any part of this for the floridas because it would let spain into the mississippi on the principle of natural right we have always urged  are now urging to her that a nation inhabiting the upper part of a stream has a right of innocent passage down that stream to the    ocean and because the floridas will fall to us peaceably the first war spain is engaged in we have some pretensions to extend the western territory of louisiana to the rio norte or bravo and still stronger the eastern boundary to the rio perdido between the rivers mobile  pensacola these last are so strong that france had not relinquished them  our negotiator expressly declared we should claim them by properly availing ourselves of these with offers of a price and our peace we shall get the floridas in good time but in the meantime we shall enter on the exercise of the right of passing down all the rivers which rising in our territory run thro the floridas spain will not oppose it by force but there is a difficulty in this acquisition which presents a handle to the malcontents among us though they have not yet discovered it our confederation is certainly confined to the limits established by the revolution the general government has no powers but such as the constitution has given it and it has not given it a power of holding foreign territory  still less of incorporating it into the union an amendment of the constitution seems necessary for this in the meantime we must ratify  pay our money as we have treated for a thing beyond the constitution and rely on the nation to sanction an act done for its great good without its previous authority with respect to the disposal of the country we must take the island of new orleans and west side of the river as high up as point coupee containing nearly the whole inhabitants say about  0000 and erect it into a state or annex it to the mississippi territory and  0 shut up all the rest from settlement for a long time to come endeavoring to exchange some of the country there unoccupied by indians for the lands held by the indians on this side the mississippi who will be glad to cede us their country here for an equivalent there and we may sell out our lands here  pay the whole debt contracted before it comes due the impost which will be paid by the inhabitants ceded will pay half the interest of the price we give so that we really add only half the price to our debt i have indulged myself in these details because the subject being new it is advantageous to interchange ideas on it and to get our notions all corrected before we are obliged to act on them in this idea i receive  shall receive with pleasure anything which may occur to you accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of my constant  great esteem  respect thomas jefferson sept    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello sept    0  dear sir —i now return you the several papers received by the last post except those soliciting office which as usual are put into my bundle of like papers i think it possible that spain recollecting our former eagerness for the island of n orleans may imagine she can by a free delivery of that redeem the residue of louisiana and that she may withhold the peaceable cession of it in that case no doubt force must be used however the importance    of this measure the time  the means will be for discussion at our meeting on the   th in the meantime i think clarke might be trusted with a general hint of the possibility of opposition from spain  an instruction to sound in every direction but with so much caution as to avoid suspicion and to inform us whether he discovers any symptoms of doubt as to the delivery to let us know the force spain has there where posted how the inhabitants are likely to act if we march a force there and what numbers of them could be armed  brought to act in opposition to us we have time to receive this information before the day of ratification and it would guide us in our provision of force for the object accept my affectionate salutations  respects thomas jefferson octr   0  washington doctor benjamin rush to doctor benjamin rush j mss washington octr   0  dear sir —no one would more willingly than myself pay the just tribute due to the services of capt barry by writing a letter of condolence to his widow as you suggest but when one undertakes to administer justice it must be with an even hand  by rule what is done for one must be done for every one in equal degree to what a train of attentions would this draw a president how difficult would it be to draw the line between that degree of merit entitled to such a testimonial of it  that not so entitled if drawn in a particular case differently from what the friends of the deceased would judge right what    offence would it give  of the most tender kind how much offence would be given by accidental inattentions or want of information the first step into such an undertaking ought to be well weighed on the death of dr franklin the king  convention of france went into mourning so did the house of reps of the u s the senate refused i proposed to general washington that the executive department should wear mourning he declined it because he said he should not know where to draw the line if he once began that ceremony mr adams was then vice president  i thought genl w had his eye on him whom he certainly did not love i told him the world had drawn so broad a line between himself  dr franklin on the one side and the residue of mankind on the other that we might wear mourning for them and the question still remain new  undecided as to all others he thought it best however to avoid it on these considerations alone however well affected to the merit of commodore barry i think it prudent not to engage myself in a practice which may become embarrassing tremendous times in europe how mighty this battle of lions  tygers with what sensations should the common herd of cattle look on it with no partialities certainly if they can so far worry one another as to destroy their power of tyrannizing the one over the earth the other the waters the world may perhaps enjoy peace till they recruit again affectionate  respectful salutations    thomas jefferson october      0  third annual message   j mss october      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states in calling you together fellow citizens at an earlier day than was contemplated by the act of the    last session of congress i have not been insensible to the personal inconveniences necessarily resulting from an unexpected change in your arrangements but matters of great public concernment have rendered this call necessary and the interest you feel in these will supersede in your minds all private considerations congress witnessed at their last session the extraordinary agitation produced in the public mind by    the suspension of our right of deposit at the port of new orleans no assignment of another place having been made according to treaty they were sensible that the continuance of that privation would be more injurious to our nation than any consequences which could flow from any mode of redress but reposing just confidence in the good faith of the government whose officer had committed the wrong friendly and reasonable representations were resorted to and the right of deposit was restored previous however to this period we had not been unaware of the danger to which our peace would be    perpetually exposed while so important a key to the commerce of the western country remained under foreign power difficulties too were presenting themselves as to the navigation of other streams which arising within our territories pass through those adjacent propositions had therefore been authorized for obtaining on fair conditions the sovereignty of new orleans and of other possessions in that quarter interesting to our quiet to such extent as was deemed practicable and the provisional appropriation of two millions of dollars to be applied and accounted for by the president of the united states intended as part of the price was considered as conveying the sanction of congress to the acquisition proposed the enlightened government of france saw with just discernment the importance to both nations of such liberal arrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace friendship and interests of both and the property and sovereignty of all louisiana which had been restored to them have on certain conditions been transferred to the united states by instruments bearing date the  0th of april last when these shall have received the constitutional sanction of the senate they will without delay be communicated to the representatives also for the exercise of their functions as to those conditions which are within the powers vested by the constitution in congress while the property and sovereignty of the mississippi and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the western states and an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course free from    collision with other powers and the dangers to our peace from that source the fertility of the country its climate and extent promise in due season important aids to our treasury an ample provision for our posterity and a widespread field for the blessings of freedom and equal laws with the wisdom of congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures which may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary government of the country for its incorporation into our union for rendering the change of government a blessing to our newlyadopted brethren for securing to them the rights of conscience and of property for confirming to the indian inhabitants their occupancy and selfgovernment establishing friendly and commercial relations with them and for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired such materials for your information relative to its affairs in general as the short space of time has permitted me to collect will be laid before you when the subject shall be in a state for your consideration another important acquisition of territory has also been made since the last session of congress the friendly tribe of kaskaskia indians with which we have never had a difference reduced by the wars and wants of savage life to a few individuals unable to defend themselves against the neighboring tribes has transferred its country to the united states reserving only for its members what is sufficient to maintain them in an agricultural way the considerations stipulated are that we shall extend to them our patronage and protection and give them certain    annual aids in money in implements of agriculture and other articles of their choice this country among the most fertile within our limits extending along the mississippi from the mouth of the illinois to and up the ohio though not so necessary as a barrier since the acquisition of the other bank may yet be well worthy of being laid open to immediate settlement as its inhabitants may descend with rapidity in support of the lower country should future circumstances expose that to a foreign enterprise as the stipulations in this treaty also involve matters within the competence of both houses only it will be laid before congress as soon as the senate shall have advised its ratification with many other indian tribes improvements in agriculture and household manufacture are advancing and with all our peace and friendship are established on grounds much firmer than heretofore the measure adopted of establishing trading houses among them and of furnishing them necessaries in exchange for their commodities at such moderated prices as leave no gain but cover us from loss has the most conciliatory and useful effect upon them and is that which will best secure their peace and good will the small vessels authorized by congress with a view to the mediterranean service have been sent into that sea and will be able more effectually to confine the tripoline cruisers within their harbors and supersede the necessity of convoy to our commerce in that quarter they will sensibly lessen the expenses of that service the ensuing year    a further knowledge of the ground in the northeastern and northwestern angles of the united states has evinced that the boundaries established by the treaty of paris between the british territories and ours in those parts were too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution it has therefore been thought worthy of attention for preserving and cherishing the harmony and useful intercourse subsisting between the two nations to remove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incidents might otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding a convention has therefore been entered into which provides for a practicable demarkation of those limits to the satisfaction of both parties an account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending  0th september last with the estimates for the service of the ensuing year will be laid before you by the secretary of the treasury so soon as the receipts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more distant states it is already ascertained that the amount paid into the treasury for that year has been between eleven and twelve millions of dollars and that the revenue accrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on as sufficient for our current expenses and to extinguish the public debt within the period heretofore proposed the amount of debt paid for the same year is about three millions one hundred thousand dollars exclusive of interest and making with the payment of the preceding year a discharge of more than eight millions and a half of dollars of the principal of that debt besides the accruing interest and there  0 remain in the treasury nearly six millions of dollars of these eight hundred and eighty thousand have been reserved for payment of the first instalment due under the british convention of january  th   0  and two millions are what have been before mentioned as placed by congress under the power and accountability of the president toward the price of new orleans and other territories acquired which remaining untouched are still applicable to that object and go in diminution of the sum to be funded for it should the acquisition of louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and carried into effect a sum of nearly thirteen millions of dollars will then be added to our public debt most of which is payable after fifteen years before which term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the established operation of the sinking fund when we contemplate the ordinary annual augmentation of imposts from increasing population and wealth the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new acquisition and the economies which may still be introduced into our public expenditures i cannot but hope that congress in reviewing their resources will find means to meet the intermediate interests of this additional debt without recurring to new taxes and applying to this object only the ordinary progression of our revenue its extraordinary increase in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund for any measures of safety or precaution which that state of things may render necessary in our neutral position    remittances for the instalments of our foreign debt having been found impracticable without loss it has not been thought expedient to use the power given by a former act of congress of continuing them by reloans and of redeeming instead thereof equal sums of domestic debt although no difficulty was found in obtaining that accommodation the sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by congress for providing gunboats remains unexpended the favorable and peaceful turn of affairs on the mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary and time was desirable in order that the institution of that branch of our force might begin on models the most approved by experience the same issue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of a million and a half of dollars contemplated for purposes which were effected by happier means we have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again in europe and nations with which we have the most friendly and useful relations engaged in mutual destruction while we regret the miseries in which we see others involved let us bow with gratitude to that kind providence which inspiring with wisdom and moderation our late legislative councils while placed under the urgency of the greatest wrongs guarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary contest and left us only to look on and to pity its ravages these will be heaviest on those immediately engaged yet the nations pursuing peace will not be exempt from all evil in the course of this conflict let it be our endeavor as it    is our interest and desire to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nations by every act of justice and of incessant kindness to receive their armed vessels with hospitality from the distresses of the sea but to administer the means of annoyance to none to establish in our harbors such a police as may maintain law and order to restrain our citizens from embarking individually in a war in which their country takes no part to punish severely those persons citizen or alien who shall usurp the cover of our flag for vessels not entitled to it infecting thereby with suspicion those of real americans and committing us into controversies for the redress of wrongs not our own to exact from every nation the observance toward our vessels and citizens of those principles and practices which all civilized people acknowledge to merit the character of a just nation and maintain that of an independent one preferring every consequence to insult and habitual wrong congress will consider whether the existing laws enable us efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens in all places and with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction and will give them the new modifications necessary for these objects some contraventions of right have already taken place both within our jurisdictional limits and on the high seas the friendly disposition of the governments from whose agents they have proceeded as well as their wisdom and regard for justice leave us in reasonable expectation that they will be rectified and prevented in future and that no act will be countenanced by them which threatens to disturb our friendly intercourse    separated by a wide ocean from the nations of europe and from the political interests which entangle them together with productions and wants which render our commerce and friendship useful to them and theirs to us it cannot be the interest of any to assail us nor ours to disturb them we should be most unwise indeed were we to cast away the singular blessings of the position in which nature has placed us the opportunity she has endowed us with of pursuing at a distance from foreign contentions the paths of industry peace and happiness of cultivating general friendship and of bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force how desirable then must it be in a government like ours to see its citizens adopt individually the views the interests and the conduct which their country should pursue divesting themselves of those passions and partialities which tend to lessen useful friendships and to embarrass and embroil us in the calamitous scenes of europe confident fellow citizens that you will duly estimate the importance of neutral dispositions toward the observance of neutral conduct that you will be sensible how much it is our duty to look on the bloody arena spread before us with commiseration indeed but with no other wish than to see it closed i am persuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions in all discussions among yourselves and in all communications with your constituents and i anticipate with satisfaction the measures of wisdom which the great interests now committed to

the first consul of france in due form they are communicated to you for consideration in your legislative capacity you will observe that some important conditions cannot be carried into execution but with the aid of the legislature and that time presses a decision on them without delay the ulterior provisions also suggested in the same communication for the occupation and government of the country will call for early attention such information relative to its government as time and distance have enabled me to obtain will be ready to be laid before you within a few days but as permanent

of you to meet the heads of departments here tomorrow at    oclock and afterwards to dine with us the object is to decide definitely on the arrangements which are to be despatched westwardly the next day general dearborn and myself had concluded to submit to the meeting a plan little different from that suggested in your letter of yesterday to wit to send orders to claiborne and wilkinson to march instantly five hundred regulars which are prepared from fort adams and one thousand militia from the mississippi territory if the information from laussat to them shall indicate refusal from spain to send hence on the same day a call on the governor of tennessee for two thousand volunteers and of kentucky for four thousand to be officered organized accoutred and mustered on a day to be named such as that claiborne and wilkinson might by that day send them information whether they would be wanted and to march or do otherwise accordingly i had since thought myself to propose that on receiving information that there would be resistance they should send sufficient parties of regulars and militia across the mississippi to take by surprise new madrid st genevieve st louis and all the other small posts and that all this should be made as much as possible the act of france by including laussat with the aid of clark to raise an insurrectionary force of the inhabitants to which ours might    be only auxiliary but all this with much more is to be considered tomorrow affectionate salutations     thomas jefferson nov    0  rules of etiquette  j mss nov    0  i in order to bring the members

robert r livingston to the u s minister to france robert r livingston j mss washington nov     0  dear sir —a report reaches us this day from baltimore on probable but not certain grounds that mr jerome bonaparte brother of the first consul was yesterday  married to miss patterson of that city the effect of this measure on the mind of the first consul is not for me to suppose but as it might occur to him prima facie that the executive of the u s ought to have prevented it i have thought it advisable to mention the subject to you that if necessary you may be explanations set that idea to rights you know that by our laws all persons are free to enter into marriage if of    years of age no one having a power to restrain it not even their    parents and that under that age no one can prevent it but the parent or guardian the lady is under age and the parents placed between her affections which were strongly fixed and the considerations opposing the measure yielded with pain  anxiety to the former mr patterson is the president of the bank of baltimore the wealthiest man in maryland perhaps in the u s except mr carroll a man of great virtue  respectability the mother is the sister of the lady of general saml smith and consequently the station of the family in society is with the first of the u s these circumstances fix rank in a country where there are no hereditary titles your treaty has obtained nearly a general approbation the federalists spoke  voted against it but they are now so reduced in their numbers as to be nothing the question on its ratification in the senate was decided by    against   which was  0 more than enough the vote in the h of r for making provision for its execution was carried by    against    which was a majority of    and the necessary bills are going through the houses by greater majorities mr pichon according to instructions from his government proposed to have added to the ratification a protestation against any failure in time or other circumstances of execution on our part he was told that in that case we should annex a counter protestation which would leave the thing exactly where it was that this transaction had been conducted from the commencement of the negociation to this stage of it with a frankness  sincerity honorable to both nations and comfortable  0 to the heart of an honest man to review that to annex to this last chapter of the transaction such an evidence of mutual distrust was to change its aspect dishonorably for us both and contrary to truth as to us for that we had not the smallest doubt that france would punctually execute its part  i assured mr pichon that i had more confidence in the word of the first consul than in all the parchment we could sign he saw that we had ratified the treaty that both branches had passed by great majorities one of the bills for execution  would soon pass the other two that no circumstance remained that could leave a doubt of our punctual performance  like an able  an honest minister which he is in the highest degree he undertook to do what he knew his employers would do themselves were they here spectators of all the existing circumstances and exchanged the ratifications purely and simply so that this instrument goes to the world as an evidence of the candor  confidence of the nations in each other which will have the best effects this was the more justifiable as mr pichon knew that spain had entered with us a protestation against our ratification of the treaty grounded  st on the assertion that the first consul had not executed the conditions of the treaties of cession   ly that he had broken a solemn promise not to alienate the country to any nation we answered that these were private questions between france  spain which they must settle together that we derived our title from the first consul  did not doubt his guarantee of it and we four days ago sent off orders to the governor    of the mississippi territory  general wilkinson to move down with the troops at hand to new orleans to receive the possession from mr laussat if he is heartily disposed to carry the order of the consul into execution he can probably command a voluntary force at new orleans and will have the aid of ours also if he desires it to take the possession  deliver it to us if he is not so disposed we shall take the possession  it will rest with the government of france by adopting the act as their own  obtaining the confirmation of spain to supply the nonexecution of their stipulation to deliver  to entitle themselves to the compleat execution of our part of the agreements in the meantime the legislature is passing the bills and we are preparing everything to be done on our part towards execution and we shall not avail ourselves of the three months delay after possession of the province allowed by the treaty for the delivery of the stock but shall deliver it the moment that possession is known here which will be on the   th day after it has taken place thomas jefferson nov    0  washington john breckenridge to john breckenridge j mss washington nov    0  dear sir —i thought i perceived in you the other day a dread of the job of preparing a constitution for the new acquisition with more boldness than wisdom i therefore determined to prepare a canvass give it a few daubs of outline and send it to you to fill up i yesterday morning took up the subject and scribbled    off the inclosed in communicating it to you i must do it in confidence that you will never let any person know that i have put pen to paper on the subject and that if you think the inclosed can be of any aid to you you will take the trouble to copy it  return me the original i am this particular because you know with what bloody teeth  fangs the federalists will attack any sentiment or principle known to come from me  what blackguardisms  personalities they make it the occasion of vomiting forth my time does not permit me to go into explanation of the inclosed by letter i will only observe therefore as to a single feature of the legislature that the idea of an assembly of notables came into my head while writing as a thing more familiar  pleasing to the french than a legislation of judges true it removes their dependence from the judges to the executive but this is what they are used to  would prefer should congress reject the nomination of judges for   years  make them during good behavior as is probable then should the judges take a kink in their heads in favor of leaving the present laws of louisiana unaltered that evil will continue for their lives unamended by us and become so inveterate that we may never be able to introduce the uniformity of law so desirable the making the same persons so directly judges  legislators is more against principle than to make the same persons executive and the elector of the legislative members the former too are placed above all responsibility the latter is under a perpetual control if he goes wrong the judges have to act on   out of  0 of the laws which are made the    governor not on one in  0 but strike it out  insert the judges if you think it better as it was a sudden conceit to which i am not attached and make what alterations you please as i had never had before time to think on the subject or form the outlines of any plan  probably shall not again accept my friendly salutations thomas jefferson dec   0  washington john randolph to john randolph j mss washington dec   0  dear sir —the explanation in your letter of yesterday was quite unnecessary to me i have had too satisfactory proofs of your friendly regard to be disposed to suspect anything of a contrary aspect i understood perfectly the expressions stated in the newspaper to which you allude to mean that tho the proposition came from the republican quarter of the house yet you should not concur with it i am aware that in parts of the union  even with persons to whom mr eppes and mr randolph are unknown  myself little known it will be presumed from their connection that what comes from them comes from me no men on earth are more independent in their sentiments than they are nor any one less disposed than i am to influence the opinions of others we rarely speak of politics or of the proceedings of the house but merely historically and i carefully avoid expressing an opinion on them in their presence that we may all be at our ease with other members i have believed that more unreserved communications would be advantageous to the public    this has been perhaps prevented by mutual delicacy i have been afraid to express opinions unasked lest i should be suspected of wishing to direct the legislative action of members they have avoided asking communications from me probably lest they should be suspected of wishing to fish out executive secrets i see too many proofs of the imperfection of human reason to entertain wonder or intolerance at any difference of opinion on any subject and acquiesce in that difference as easily as on a difference of feature or form experience having long taught me the reasonableness of mutual sacrifices of opinion among those who are to act together for any common object and the expediency of doing what good we can when we cannot do all we would wish accept my friendly salutations and assurances of

a serious misfortune should a change in the administration of your government be hazarded before its present principles be well established through all its parts yet on reflection you will be sensible that the delicacy of my situation considering who may be competitors    forbids my intermeddling even so far as to write the letter you suggest i can therefore only brood in silence over my secret wishes i am less able to give you the proceedings of congress than your correspondents who are of that body more difference of opinion seems to exist as to the manner of disposing of louisiana than i had imagined possible and our leading friends are not yet sufficiently aware of the necessity of accommodation  mutual sacrifice of opinion for conducting a numerous assembly where the opposition too is drilled to act in phalanx on every question altho it is acknoleged that our new fellow citizens are as yet as incapable of self government as children yet some cannot bring themselves to suspend its principles for a single moment the temporary or territorial government of that country therefore will encounter great difficulty the question too whether the settlement of upper louisiana shall be prohibited occasions a great division of our friends some are for prohibiting it till another amendment of the constn shall permit it others for prohibiting by authority of the legislature only a third set for permitting immediate settlement those of the first opinion apprehend that if the legislature may open a land office there it will become the ruling principle of elections  end in a yazoo

jefferson dec    0  washington albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss washington dec    0  the attorney genl having considered and decided that the prescription in the law for establishing a bank that the officers in the subordinate offices of discount  deposit shall be appointed on the same terms and in the same manner practised in the principal bank does not extend to them the principle of rotation established by the legislature in the body of directors in the principal bank it follows that the extension of that principle has been merely a voluntary  prudential act of the principal bank from which they are free to depart i think the extension was wise  proper on their part because the legislature having deemed rotation useful in the principal bank constituted by them there would be the same reason for it in the subordinate banks to be established by the principal it breaks in upon the esprit de corps so apt to prevail in permanent bodies it gives a chance for the public eye penetrating into the sanctuary of those proceedings  practices which the avarice of the directors may introduce for their personal emolument  which the resentments of excluded directors or the honesty of those duly admitted might betray to the public and it gives an opportunity at the end of the year or at other periods of correcting a choice which on trial proves to have been unfortunate an evil of which themselves complain in their distant institutions whether however they have a power to alter this or not the executive has no right to    decide  their consultation with you has been merely an act of complaisance or a desire to shield so important an innovation under the cover of executive sanction but ought we to volunteer our sanction in such a case ought we to disarm ourselves of any fair right of animadversion whenever that institution shall be a legitimate subject of consideration i own i think the most proper answer would be that we do not think ourselves authorized to give an opinion on the question from a passage in the letter of the president i observe an idea of establishing a branch bank of the u s in new orleans this institution is one of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles  form of our constitution the nation is at this time so strong  united in its sentiments that it cannot be shaken at this moment but suppose a series of untoward events should occur sufficient to bring into doubt the competency of a republican government to meet a crisis of great danger or to unhinge the confidence of the people in the public functionaries an institution like this penetrating by its branches every part of the union acting by command  in phalanx may in a critical moment upset the government i deem no government safe which is under the vassalage of any selfconstituted authorities or any other authority than that of the nation or its regular functionaries what an obstruction could not this bank of the u s with all its branch banks be in time of war it might dictate to us the peace we should accept or withdraw its aids ought we then to give further    growth to an institution so powerful so hostile that it is so hostile we know   from a knowledge of the principles of the persons composing the body of directors in every bank principal or branch and those of most of the stockholders   from their opposition to the measures  principles of the government  to the election of those friendly to them and   from the sentiments of the newspapers they support now while we are strong it is the greatest duty we owe to the safety of our constitution to bring this powerful enemy to a perfect subordination under its authorities the first measure would be to reduce them to an equal footing only with other banks as to the favors of the government but in order to be able to meet a general combination of the banks against us in a critical emergency could we not make a beginning towards an independent use of our own money towards holding our own bank in all the deposits where it is received and letting the treasurer give his draft or note for payment at any particular place which in a wellconducted government ought to have as much credit as any private draft or bank note or bill and would give us the same facilities which we derive from the banks i pray you to turn this subject in your mind and to give it the benefit of your knowledge of details whereas i have only very general views of the subject affectionate salutations    thomas jefferson jan     0  washington james monroe

know him personally or any otherwise than by his history of our revolution  of buonaparte a single copy of which he sent me i never heard of any other being sent nor should i have undertaken or he expected me to be the vender of his books here to keep accounts and make remittances for him if he has sent any copies for sale to my care i have never heard of them isaac coles son of colo coles our neighbor is gone to london paris c he asked from me a letter to you i told him i had been obliged to make it a rule to give no letters of introduction while in my present office but that in my first letter to you i would mention to you the reason why i gave him none he is a most worthy young man  one whom i had intended to have asked to be my secretary had mr harvie declined the offer you know the worth of his family i inclose you two letters for mr williams asking you from your knolege of persons and things to use your discretion for me and deliver whichever you think best suppressing the other with respect to my correspondence with literary characters in europe to the great  0 mass of those who send me copies of their works being otherwise unknown to me or perhaps not advantageously known i return them simple notes of thanks sometimes saying i have no doubt i shall have great satisfaction in persuing their works as soon as my occupations will permit and where i have found the work to possess merit saying so in a complimentary way with volney dupont cabanis cepede i had intimate  very friendly intercourse in france  with the two first here with sr john sinclair i had the same in france  england and with mr strickland here to these persons i write freely on subjects of literature and to a certain degree on politics respecting however their personal opinions and their situation so as not to compromit them were a letter intercepted indeed what i write to them in this way are for the most part such truths  sentiments as would do us good if known to their government and as probably as not are communicated to them to the earl buchan i have written one letter in answer to the compliment of a volume of his which he sent me he is an honorable patriotic  virtuous character was in correspondence with dr franklin and general washington  had every title to a respectful answer from me i expressed myself to him in terms which were true  therefore the more satisfactory to him i have received a volume of geology of great merit from faufas de st fond i did not know him personally nor do i know the standing he holds in society or his government but an intimate acquaintance of his here gives me a good account of him as an amiable    and virtuous man my answer to him will be more than a mere compliment of thanks but confined to the branch of science which is the subject of his work an opening has been given me of making a communication which will be acceptable to the emperor alexander either directly or indirectly and as from one private individual to another i have not decided whether to do it or not this is the whole extent of the literary correspondence which i now keep up in europe and i set the more value on it inasmuch as i can make private friendships instrumental to the public good by inspiring a confidence which is denied to public and official communications i expect this evenings post will bring us the account that louisiana was formally delivered to us about the   th of december this acquisition is seen by our constituents in all its importance  they do justice to all those who have been instrumental towards it fortunately the federal leaders have had the imprudence to oppose it pertinaciously which has given an occasion to a great proportion of their quondam honest adherents to abandon them and join the republican standard they feel themselves now irretrievably lost and are ceasing to make further opposition in the states or anywhere but in congress i except however n hampshire mass connect  delaware the  st will be with us in the course of this year connecticut is advancing with a slow but steady step never losing the ground she gains massachusetts has a republicanism of so flaccid a texture and delaware so much affected by    every little topical information that we must wait for them with patience  good humour congress is now engaged in a bill for the government of louisiana it is impossible to foresee in what shape it will come out they talk of giving  000 d to the governor but the bill also proposes to commence at the close of this session i have in private conversations demonstrated to individuals that that is impossible that the necessary officers cannot be mustered there under   months if they give that time for its commencement it may admit our appointing you to that office as i presume you could be in place with a term not much beyond that  in the interval the secretary of the state would govern but the idea of the public as to the importance of that office would not bear a long absence of the principal you are not to calculate that  000 d would place you by any means as much at your ease there as  000 d where you are in that station you cannot avoid expensive hospitality where you are altho it is not pleasant to fall short in returning civilities yet necessity has rendered this so familiar in europe as not to lessen respect for the person whose circumstances do not permit a return of hospitalities i see by your letters the pain which this situation gives you and i can estimate its acuteness from the generosity of your nature but my dear friend calculate with mathematical rigour the pain annexed to each branch of the dilemma  pursue that which brings the least to give up entertainment  to live with the most rigorous economy till you have cleared yourself of every demand is a pain for a    definite time only but to return here with accumulated encumbrances on you will fill your life with torture we wish to do everything for you which law  rule will permit but more than this would injure you as much as us believing that the mission to spain will enable you to suspend expense greatly in london  to apply your salary during your absence to the clearing off your debt you will be instructed to proceed there as soon as you shall have regulated certain points of neutral right for us with england or as soon as you find nothing in that way can be done this you should hurry as much as possible that you may proceed to spain for settling with that court the boundaries of louisiana on this subject mr madison will send you the copy of a memoir of mine written last summer while i was among my books at monticello we scarcely expect any liberal or just settlement with spain and are perfectly determined to obtain or to take our just limits how far you will suffer yourself to be detained there by the procrastinations of artifice or indolence must depend on the prospects which arise and on your own determination to accept the government of louisiana which will admit but of a limited delay it is probable that the inhabitants of louisiana on the left bank of the mississippi and inland eastwardly to a considerable extent will very soon claim to be received under our jurisdiction and that this end of w florida will thus be peaceably got possession of for mobile and the eastern end we shall await favorable conjunctures if they refuse to let our vessels have free ingress  egress in the mobile    to  from the tombiggy settlements and if spain is at war the crisis there will be speedy fulwar skipwith wishes office in louisiana but he should be made sensible of the impossibility of an office remaining vacant till we can import an incumbent from europe that of govr is the only one for which the law has made that sort of provision besides he has been so long absent from america that he cannot have habits and feelings and the tact necessary to be in unison with his countrymen here he is much fitter for any matters of business below that of diplomacy which we may have to do in europe there is here a great sense of the inadequacy of c pinckney to the office he is in his continuance is made a subject of standing reproach to myself personally by whom the appointment was made before i had collected the administration he declared at the time that nothing would induce him to continue so as not to be here at the ensuing presidential election i am persuaded he expected to be proposed at it as v p after he got to europe his letters asked only a continuance of two years but he now does not drop the least hint of a voluntary return pray my dear sir avail yourself of his vanity his expectations his fears and whatever will weigh with him to induce him to ask leave to return and obtain from him to be the bearer of the letter yourself you will render us in this the most acceptable service possible his enemies here are perpetually dragging his character in the dirt and charging it on the administration he does or ought to know this and to feel the necessity of coming home    to vindicate himself if he looks to anything further in the career of honor you ask for small news mr randolph  mr eppes are both of congress and now with me their wives lying in at home trist was appointed collector of natchez and on the removal of that office down to new orleans will be continued there his family still remain in albemarle but will join him in the spring dr bache has been to n orleans as physician to the hospital there he is returned to philadelphia where his wife is and where they will probably remain peachey gilmer has married miss house and will go with the family to n orleans mr short has been to kentucky and will return to europe in the spring the deaths of samuel adams  judge pendleton you will have heard of colo n lewis divers  the carrs are all well and their families sam carr is now living in albemarle j f mercers quarrel with his counsel has carried him over openly to the federalists he is now in the maryland legislature entirely thrown off by the republicans he has never seen or written on these things to mr madison or myself when mentioning your going to n orleans  that the salary there would not increase the ease of your situation i meant to have added that the only considerations which might make it eligible to you were the facility of getting there the richest land in the world the extraordinary profitableness of their culture and that the removal of your slaves there might immediately put you under way you alone however can weigh these things for yourself and after all it may depend    on the time the legislature may give for commencing the new government but let us hear from you as soon as you can determine that we may not incur the blame of waiting for nothing mr merry is with us and we believe him to be personally as desirable a character as could have been sent us but he is unluckily associated with one of an opposite character in every point she has already disturbed our harmony extremely he began by claiming the first visit from the national ministers he corrected himself in this but a pretension to take precedence at dinners c over all others is persevered in we have told him that the principle of society as well as of government with us is the equality of the individuals composing it that no man here would come to a dinner where he was to be marked with inferiority to any other that we might as well attempt to force our principle of equality at st jamess as he his principle of precedent here i had been in the habit when i invited female company having no lady in my family to ask one of the ladies of the   secretaries to come  take care of my company and as she was to do the honors of the table i handed her to dinner myself that mr merry might not construe this as giving them a precedence over mrs merry i have discontinued it and here as well as in private houses the pêlemêle practice is adhered to they have got yrujo to take a zealous part in the claim of precedence it has excited generally emotions of great contempt and indignation in which the members of the legislature participate sensibly that the agents of foreign    nations should assume to dictate to us what shall be the laws of our society the consequence will be that mr  mrs merry will put themselves into coventry  that he will lose the best half of his usefulness to his nation that derived from a perfectly familiar  private intercourse with the secretaries  myself the latter be assured is a virago and in the short course of a few weeks has established a degree of dislike among all classes which one would have thought impossible in so short a time thornton has entered into their ideas at this we wonder because he is a plain man a sensible one  too candid to be suspected of wishing to bring on their recall  his own substitution to counterwork their misrepresentations it would be well their government should understand as much of these things as can be communicated with decency that they may know the spirit in which their letters are written we learn that thornton thinks we are not as friendly now to great britain as before our acquisition of louisiana this is totally without foundation our friendship to that nation is cordial and sincere so is that with france we are anxious to see england maintain her standing only wishing she would use her power on the ocean with justice if she had done this heretofore other nations would not have stood by and looked on with unconcern on a conflict which endangers her existence we are not indifferent to its issue nor should we be so on a conflict on which the existence of france should be in danger we consider each as a necessary instrument to hold in check the disposition of the other to tyrannize    over other nations with respect to merry he appears so reasonable and good a man that i should be sorry to lose him as long as there remains a possibility of reclaiming him to the exercise of his own dispositions if his wife perseveres she must eat her soup at home and we shall endeavor to draw him into society as if she did not exist it is unfortunate that the good understanding of nations should hang on the caprice of an individual who ostensibly has nothing to do with them present my friendly  respectful salutations to mrs monroe  miss eliza and

washington jan      0  dear sir —i have duly received your favor of the  th but the act of ratification which it announces is not yet come to hand no doubt it is on its way that great opposition is and will be made by federalists to this amendment is certain they know that if it prevails neither a presidt or vice president can ever be made but by the fair vote of the majority of the nation of which they are not that either their opposition to the principle of discrimination now or their advocation of it formerly was on party not moral motives they cannot deny consequently they fix for themselves the place in the scale of moral rectitude to which they are entitled i am a friend to    the discriminating principle and for a reason more than others have inasmuch as the discriminated vote of my constituents will express unequivocally the verdict they wish to cast on my conduct the abominable slanders of my political enemies have obliged me to call for that verdict from my country in the only way it can be obtained and if obtained it will be my sufficient voucher to the rest of the world  to posterity and leave me free to seek at a definite time the repose i sincerely wished to have retired to now i suffer myself to make no inquiries as to the persons who are to be placed on the rolls of competition for the public favor respect for myself as well as for the public requires that i should be the silent  passive subject of their consideration we are now at work on a territorial division  government for louisiana it will probably be a small improvement of our former territorial governments or first grade of government the act proposes to give them an assembly of notables selected by the governor from the principal characters of the territory this will i think be

jan      0  washington doctor joseph priestley to doctor joseph priestley j mss washington jan      0  dear sir —your favor of december    came duly to hand as did the  d letter to doctor linn and the treatise of phlogiston for which i pray you to accept  0 my thanks the copy for mr livingston has been delivered together with your letter to him to mr harvie my secretary who departs in a day or two for paris  will deliver them himself to mr livingston whose attention to your matter cannot be doubted i have also to add my thanks to mr priestley your son for the copy of your harmony which i have gone through with great satisfaction it is the first i have been able to meet with which is clear of those long repetitions of the same transaction as if it were a different one because related with some different circumstances i rejoice that you have undertaken the task of comparing the moral doctrines of jesus with those of the ancient philosophers you are so much in possession of the whole subject that you will do it easier  better than any other person living i think you cannot avoid giving as preliminary to the comparison a digest of his moral doctrines extracted in his own words from the evangelists and leaving out everything relative to his personal history and character it would be short and precious with a view to do this for my own satisfaction i had sent to philadelphia to get two testaments greek of the same edition  two english with a design to cut out the morsels of morality and paste them on the leaves of a book in the manner you describe as having been pursued in forming your harmony but i shall now get the thing done by better hands i very early saw that louisiana was indeed a speck in our horizon which was to burst in a tornado and the public are unapprized how near this catastrophe    was nothing but a frank  friendly development of causes  effects on our part and good sense enough in bonaparte to see that the train was unavoidable and would change the face of the world saved us from that storm i did not expect he would yield till a war took place between france and england and my hope was to palliate and endure if messrs ross morris c did not force a premature rupture until that event i believed the event not very distant but acknolege it came on sooner than i had expected whether however the good sense of bonaparte might not see the course predicted to be necessary  unavoidable even before a war should be imminent was a chance which we thought it our duty to try but the immediate prospect of rupture brought the case to immediate decision the dénoument has been happy and i confess i look to this duplication of area for the extending a government so free and economical as ours as a great achievement to the mass of happiness which is to ensue whether we remain in one confederacy or form into atlantic and mississippi confederacies i believe not very important to the happiness of either part those of the western confederacy will be as much our children  descendants as those of the eastern and i feel myself as much identified with that country in future time as with this and did i now foresee a separation at some future day yet i should feel the duty  the desire to promote the western interests as zealously as the eastern doing all the good for both portions of our future family which should fall within my power    have you seen the new work of malthus on population it is one of the ablest i have ever seen altho his main object is to delineate the effects of redundancy of population and to test the poor laws of england  other palliations for that evil several important questions in political economy allied to his subject incidentally are treated with a masterly hand it is a single  to volume and i have been only able to read a borrowed copy the only one i have yet heard of probably our friends in england will think of you  give you an opportunity of reading it accept my affectionate salutations and

lament the necessity which calls for your retirement if that necessity really exists i had looked to you as one of those calculated to give cohesion to our rope of sand you now see the composition of our public bodies and how essential system and plan are for conducting our affairs wisely with so bitter a party in opposition to us who look not at all to what is best for the public but how they may thwart whatever we may propose tho they should thereby sink their country talents in our public councils are at all times important but perhaps there never was a moment when the loss of any would be more injurious than at the present the condition of our affairs is advantageous but it is also true that we are now under a crisis which is not without hazard    from different quarters at home and abroad but all this you understand perfectly and if under such circumstances you withdraw i shall believe that the necessity which occasions it is imperious and shall lament it most sincerely accept

divided character of her citizens if the amendment of the constitution passes r i and we expect to hear in a day or two the election for the ensuing   years seems to present nothing formidable i sincerely regret that the unbounded calumnies of the federal party have obliged me to throw myself on the verdict of my country for trial my great desire having been to retire at the end of the present term to a life of tranquillity and it was my decided purpose when i entered into office    they force my continuance if we can keep the vessel of state as steadily in her course another

inclosing two hundred dollars to you  of asking the favor of you to have it applied in the way you think best for the relief of such description of sufferers as you shall think best i pray not to be named in newspapers on this occasion accept my friendly salutations  assurances of respect thomas jefferson april      0  monticello gideon granger to the postmastergeneral gideon granger j mss monticello april      0  dear sir —in our last conversation you mentioned a federal scheme afloat of forming a coalition between the federalists and republicans of what they called the   eastern states the idea was new to me and after time for reflection i had no opportunity of conversing with you again the    federalists know that eo nominie they are gone forever their object therefore is how to return into power under some other form undoubtedly they have but one means which is to divide the republicans join the minority and barter with them for the cloak of their name i say join the minority because the majority of the republicans not needing them will not buy them the minority having no other means of ruling the majority will give a price for auxiliaries and that price must be principle it is true that the federalists needing their numbers also must also give a price and principle is the coin they must pay in thus a bastard system of federorepublicanism will rise on the ruins of the true principles of our revolution and when this party is formed who will constitute the majority of it which majority is then to dictate certainly the federalists thus their proposition of putting themselves into gear with the republican minority is exactly like roger shermans proposition to add connecticut to rhode island the idea of forming   eastern states is moreover clearly to form the basis of a separation of the union is it possible that real republicans can be gulled by such a bait  for what what do they wish that they have not federal measures that is impossible republican measures have they them not can any one deny that in all important questions of principle republicanism prevails but do they want that their individual will shall govern the majority they may purchase the gratification of this unjust wish for a little time at a great price but the    federalists must not have the passions of other men if after getting thus into the seat of power they suffer themselves to be governed by their minority this minority may say that whenever they relapse into their own principles they will quit them  draw the seat from under them they may quit them indeed but in the meantime all the venal will have become associated with them  will give them a majority sufficient to keep them in place  to enable them to eject the heterogeneous friends by whose aid they get again into power i cannot believe any portion of real republicans will enter into this trap and if they do i do not believe they can carry with them the mass of their states advancing so steadily as we see them to an union of principle with their brethren it will be found in this as in all other similar cases that crooked schemes will end by overwhelming their authors  coadjutors in disgrace and that he alone who walks strait  upright and who in matters of opinion will be contented that others should be as free as himself  acquiesce when his opinion is fairly overruled will attain his object in the end and that this may be the conduct of us all i offer my sincere prayers as well as for your health  happiness thomas jefferson apr    0  monticello james madison to the

merry    on the orders he communicated altho they were merely the correction of an injustice would to god that nation would so far be just in her conduct as that we might with honor give her that friendship it is so much our interest to bear her she is now a living example that no nation however powerful any more than an individual can be unjust with impunity sooner or later public opinion an instrument merely moral in the beginning will find occasion physically to inflict its sentences on the unjust nothing else could have kept the other nations of europe from relieving her under her present crisis the lesson is useful to the weak as well as the strong on the   th instant our hopes  fears here took their ultimate form i had originally intended to have left this towards the end of the present week but a desire to see my family in a state of more composure before we separate will keep me somewhat longer still it is not probable i shall be here to answer any letter which leaves washington after the   th because those of the succeeding post the  0th could not be answered till the  th of may when i may probably be on the road not having occasion to write today to the other heads of departments will you be so good as to mention this to them accept my affectionate salutations thomas jefferson apr    0  monticello robert smith to the secretary of the navy robert smith j mss monticello apr    0  dear sir —i now return you the sentence of the court of inquiry in morriss case what is the next    step i am not military jurist enough to say but if it be a court marshal to try and pass the proper sentence on him pray let it be done without delay while our captains are here this opportunity of having a court should not be lost i have never been so mortified as at the conduct of our foreign functionaries on the loss of the philadelphia they appear to have supposed that we were all lost now  without resource and they have hawked us in forma pauperis begging alms at every court in europe this selfdegradation is the more unpardonable as uninstructed  unauthorized they have taken measures which commit us by moral obligations which cannot be disavowed the most serious of these is with the first consul of france the emperor of russia  grand seigneur the interposition of the two first has been so prompt so cordial so energetic that it is impossible for us to decline the good offices they have done us from the virtuous  warmhearted character of the emperor and the energy he is using with the ottoman porte i am really apprehensive that our squadron will on its arrival find our prisoners all restored if this should be the case it would be ungrateful and insulting to these three great powers to chastise the friend tripoli whom they had induced to do us voluntary justice our expedition will in that case be disarmed and our just desires of vengeance disappointed and our honor prostrated to anticipate these measures and to strike our blow before they shall have had their effect are additional  cogent motives for getting off our squadron without a    moments avoidable delay at the same time it has now become necessary to decide before it goes what is to be the line of conduct of the commodore if he should find our prisoners restored i shall be with you about this day fortnight should the frigates be ready to go before that i must desire you to have a consultation of the heads of departments as to the instructions and to give orders to the commodore in conformity i would wish at the same time a question to be taken whether the commodore should not be instructed immediately on his arrival at his rendezvous in the mediterranean to send off at our expense the presents destined by tripoli for the grand seigneur and intercepted by us with a letter from the secretary of state to their analogous officer who i believe is called the reis effendi i am not without hope preble will have had the good sense to do this of his own accord its effect will now be lessened as it will be considered not as spontaneous but in consequence of what the porte may have done on the interference of the emperor of russia accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of attachment thomas jefferson may    0  washington general john armstrong to general john armstrong j mss washington may    0  dear sir —we find it of advantage to the public to ask of those to whom appointments are proposed if they are not accepted to say nothing of the offer at least for a convenient time the refusal cheapens the estimation of the public appointments and  0 renders them less acceptable to those to whom they are secondarily proposed the occasion of this remark will be found in a letter you will receive from the secretary of state proposing to you the appointment to paris as successor to chancellor livingston i write this private letter to remove some doubts which might perhaps arise in your mind you have doubtless heard of the complaints of our foreign ministers as to the incompetency of their salaries i believe it would be better were they somewhat enlarged yet a moments reflection will satisfy you that a man may live in any country on any scale he pleases and more easily in that than this because there the grades are more distinctly marked from the ambassador there a certain degree of representation is expected but the lower grades of envoy minister resident chargé have been introduced to accommodate both the sovereign  missionary as to the scale of expense i can assure you from my own knowledge of the ground that these latter grades are left free in the opinion of the place to adopt any style they please  that it does not lessen their estimation or their usefulness when i was at paris twothirds of the diplomatic men of the  d and  d orders entertained nobody yet they were as much invited out and honored as those of the same grades who entertained i suspect from what i hear that the chancellor having always stood on a line with those of the first expense here has not had resolution enough to yield place there  that he has taken up the ambassadorial scale of expense this procures one some sunshine friends who like to eat of your good    things but has no effect on the men of real business the only men of real use to you in a place where every man is estimated at what he really is but this subject requires more detail than can be given but in conversation if you accept i think it will be necessary for you to come and pass some days here in reading the correspondence with the courts of paris london  madrid that you may be fully possessed of the state of things on that side the water so far as they concern us the chancellor being extremely urging in his last letters to be immediately relieved we are obliged to ask all the expedition in departure which is practicable the state of affairs between us  france as they respect st domingo is somewhat embarrassing  urgent accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect thomas jefferson may  0 0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss may  0 0  altho i know that it is best generally to assign no reason for a removal from office yet there are also times when the declaration of a principle is advantageous such was the moment at which the new haven letter appeared it explained our principles to our friends and they rallied to them the public sentiment has taken a considerable stride since that and seems to require that they should know again where we stand i suggest therefore for your consideration instead of the following passage in your letter to bowen i think it due to candor at the    same time to inform you that i had for some time been determined to remove you from office although a successor has not yet been appointed by the president nor the precise time fixed for that purpose communicated to me to substitute this i think it due to candor at the same time to inform you that the president considering that the patronage of public office should no longer be confided to one who uses it for active opposition to the national will had some time since determined to place your office in other hands but a successor not being yet fixed on i am not able to name the precise time when it will take place my own opinion is that the declaration of this principle will meet the entire approbation of all moderate republicans and will extort indulgence from the warmer ones seeing that we do not mean to leave arms in the hands of active enemies they will care the less at our tolerance of the inactive nevertheless if you are strongly of opinion against such a declaration let the letter go as you had written it thomas jefferson june    0  washington thomas leiper to thomas leiper j mss washington june    0  dear sir —a mr john hill of philadelphia asks of me whether mr duane senr ever said in my presence that the members of the st patricks society in phila were all federalists i do not know mr hill and the liberties which have been taken in publishing my letters renders it prudent not to commit    them to persons whom i do not know yet a desire never to be wanting to truth and justice makes me wish it to be known that mr duane never did use such an expression or anything like it to me either verbally or in writing or any other way nor utter a sentiment disrespectful of the society i remember a considerable time ago to have had a letter from one of the society stating that such information they heard had been given me but not saying by whom which letter i immediately answered with an assurance that no such suggestion had ever been made to me i cannot now recollect to whom the answer was given and therefore cannot turn to it  our friends in philadelphia seem to have got into such a jumble of subdivision that not knowing how they stand individually i have been at a loss to whom i should address this with a request to repeat verbally the substance of this declaration as on my authority but    not letting the letter go out of his hands i have concluded to ask that favor of you whose justice i am sure will induce you to give the assurance where it may contribute to justice and whose friendship will excuse the trouble of this request accept my friendly salutations  assurances of esteem  respect thomas jefferson june    0  washington mrs john adams to mrs john adams j mss washington june    0  dear madam —the affectionate sentiments which you have had the goodness to express in your letter of may  0 towards my dear departed daughter have awakened in me sensibilities natural to the occasion  recalled your kindnesses to her which i shall ever remember with gratitude  friendship i can assure you with truth they had made an indelible impression on her mind and that to the last on our meetings after long separations whether i had heard lately of you and how you did were among the earliest of her inquiries in giving you this assurance i perform a sacred duty for her  at the same time am thankful for the occasion furnished me of expressing my regret that circumstances should have arisen which have seemed to draw a line of separation between us the friendship with which you honored me has ever been valued and fully reciprocated  altho events have been passing which might be trying to some minds i never believed yours to be of that kind nor felt that my own was neither my estimate of your character nor the esteem founded in that have ever been lessened for a single moment    although doubts whether it would be acceptable may have forbidden manifestations of it mr adamss friendship  mine began at an earlier date it accompanied us thro long  important scenes the different conclusions we had drawn from our political reading  reflections were not permitted to lessen mutual esteem each party being conscious they were the result of an honest conviction in the other like differences of opinion existing among our fellow citizens attached them to one or the other of us and produced a rivalship in their minds which did not exist in ours we never stood in one anothers way for if either had been withdrawn at any time his favorers would not have gone over to the other but would have sought for some one of homogeneous opinions this consideration was sufficient to keep down all jealousy between us  to guard our friendship from any disturbance by sentiments of rivalship and i can say with truth that one act of mr adamss life and one only ever gave me a moments personal displeasure i did consider his last appointments to office as personally unkind they were from among my most ardent political enemies from whom no faithful cooperation could ever be expected and laid me under the embarrassment of acting thro men whose views were to defeat mine or to encounter the odium of putting others in their places it seemed but common justice to leave a successor free to act by instruments of his own choice if my respect for him did not permit me to ascribe the whole blame to the influence of others it left something for friendship to forgive and after    brooding over it for some little time and not always resisting the expression of it i forgave it cordially and returned to the same state of esteem  respect for him which had so long subsisted having come into life a little later than mr adams his career has preceded mine as mine is followed by some other and it will probably be closed at the same distance after him which time originally placed between us i maintain for him  shall carry into private life an uniform  high measure of respect and good will and for yourself a sincere attachment i have thus my dear madam opened myself to you without reserve which i have long wished an opportunity of doing and without knowing how it will be received i feel relief from being unbosomed and i have now only to entreat your forgiveness for this transition from a subject of domestic affliction to one which seems of a different aspect but tho connected with political events it has been viewed by me most strongly in its unfortunate bearings on my private friendships the injury these have sustained has been a heavy price for what has never given me equal pleasure that you may both be favored with health tranquillity and long life is the prayer of one who tenders you the assurance of his highest consideration and esteem     thomas jefferson july   0  james madison to the secretary of the state james madison j mss july   0  we did not collect the sense of our brethren the other day by regular questions but as far as i could    understand from what was said it appeared to be—  that an acknolegment of our right to the perdido is a sine qua non and no price to be given for it   no absolute  perpetual relinquishment of right is to be    made of the country east of the rio bravo del norte even in exchange for florida i am not quite sure that this was the opinion of all it would be better to lengthen the term of years to any definite degree  0 than to cede in perpetuity   that a country may be laid off within which no further settlement shall be made by either party for a given time say thirty years this country to be from the north river eastwardly    towards the rio colorado or even to but not beyond the mexican or sabine river to whatever river it be extended it might from its source run n w as the most eligible direction but a due north line would produce no restraint that we should feel in  0 years this relinquishment    millions of dollars to be the price of all the floridas east of the perdido or to be apportioned to whatever part they will cede but on entering into conferences both parties should agree that during their continuance neither should strengthen their situation between the iberville missipi  perdido nor interrupt the navigation of the rivers therein if they will not give such an order instantly they should be told that we have for peace sake only forborne till they could have time to give such an order but that as soon as we receive notice of their refusal to give the order we shall enter into the exercise of our right of navigating the mobile  protect it and increase our force there pari passu with them  thomas jefferson july    0  james madison to the secretary of state james madison mis mss july    0  the inclosed reclamations of girod  chote against the claims of bapstropp to a monopoly of the indian    commerce supposed to be under the protection of the  d article of the louisiana convention as well as some other claims to abusive grants will probably force us to meet that question the article has been worded with remarkable caution on the part of our negociators it is that the inhabitants shall be admitted as soon as possible according to the principles of our constn to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens and in the mean time en attendant shall be maintained in their liberty property  religion that is that they shall continue under the protection of the treaty until the principles of our constitution can be extended to them when the protection of the treaty is to cease and that of our own principles to take its place but as this could not be done at once it has been provided to be as soon as our rules will admit accordingly congress has begun by extending about  0 particular laws by their titles to louisiana among these is the act concerning intercourse with the indians which establishes a system of commerce with them admitting no monopoly that class of rights therefore are now taken from under the treaty  placed under the principles of our laws i imagine it will be necessary to express an opinion to govr claiborne on this subject after you shall have made up one affectte salutations thomas jefferson aug   0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug   0  dear sir —yours of the  th came to

mr farquhar of malta mr livingstons letters two short ones excepted being all press copies  very bad ones i can make nothing distinct of them when manuscript copies are received i shall be glad to read them the conduct of the commissioners at paris merits examination but what mr livingston means by delays on our part in the execution of the convention is perfectly incomprehensible i do not know that a single day was unnecessarily lost on our part in order however to lessen the causes of appeal to the convention i sincerely wish that congress at the next session may give to the orleans territory a legislature to be chosen by the people as this will be advancing them quite as fast as the rules of our government will admit and the evils which may arise from the irregularities which such a legislature may run into will not be so serious as leaving them the pretext of calling in a foreign umpire between them  us the answer to mr villandry should certainly be what you mention that the objects of his application are only within the competence of congress to whom they must apply by petition if they chuse it perhaps it would be but kind  candid to add that as there has been no example of such measures taken by congress as they ask they should consider whether it would not be wise in them to act for themselves as they would do were no such measures expected i expect daily to receive answers from the principal officers for the orleans government    these received i will proceed to make out the whole arrangement and inclose it to you asking your counsel on it without delay it will not be practicable to submit it to the other members but i have so often conversed with them on the subject as to possess their sentiments as we count on the favor of a family visit could you accommodate that in point of time so as that we might be together at making out the final list affectionate salutations  assurances of friendship thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello james madison to

letter which is of an awful complexion and i do not wonder the communication it contains made some impression on him to a person placed in europe surrounded by the immense resources of the nations there and the greater wickedness of their courts even the limits which nature imposes on their enterprises are scarcely sensible it is impossible that france and england should combine for any purpose their mutual distrust and deadly hatred of each other admit no cooperation it is impossible that england should be willing to see france repossess louisiana or get footing on our continent and that france should willingly see the u s reannexed to the british dominions that the    bourbons should be replaced on their throne and agree to any terms of restitution is possible but that they and england joined could recover us to british dominion is impossible if these things are not so then human reason is of no aid in conjecturing the conduct of nations still however it is our unquestionable interest  duty to conduct ourselves with such sincere friendship  impartiality towards both nations as that each may see unequivocally what is unquestionably true that we may be very possibly driven into her scale by unjust conduct in the other i am so much impressed with the expediency of putting a termination to the right of france to patronize the rights of louisiana which will cease with their complete adoption as citizens of the u s that i hope to see that take place on the meeting of congress i enclosed you a paragraph from a newspaper respecting saint domingo which gives me uneasiness still i conceive the british insults in our harbor as more threatening we cannot be respected by france as a neutral nation nor by the world ourselves as an independent one if we do not take effectual measures to support at every risk our authority in our own harbors i shall write to mr wagner directly that a post may not be lost by passing thro you to send us blank commissions for

divided into parties and it certainly is not the office of the public functionaries to denounce either party as the doctr proposes yet so far as they are called on to act they must form for themselves an opinion to act on in the early history of the disease i did suppose it to be infectious not reading any of the party papers on either side i continued in this supposition until the fever at alexandria brought facts under my own eye as it were proving it could not be communicated but in a local atmosphere pretty exactly circumscribed with the composition of this atmosphere we are unacquainted we know only that it is generated near the water side in close built cities under warm climates according to the rules of philosophizing when one sufficient cause for an effect is known it is not within the economy of nature to employ two if local atmosphere suffices to produce the fever miasmata from a human subject are not necessary and probably do not enter into the cause still it is not within my province to decide the question but as it may be within yours to require the performance of quarantine or not i execute a private duty in submitting doctr rushs letter to your

zealots had prepared me against surprise at the insinuations of this officer against you  myself but what was his view in inclosing the letter to me was it to give greater point to his disrespect or did he imagine i should make him overtures to prevent his publication i would rather he would publish than not for while his writings will let the public see what he is  what are the motives of his discontent a few sentences of plain fact will set everything in them to rights as to our conduct be so good as to return me the written letter the following paragraph which comes to me from a friend

his country no personal service in the field this man is married to thos willings niece willing is presidt of the bank of the u s you may also observe he was chairman at a meeting when they agreed to hoist the black cockade on the left arm in honor of hamilton they also resolved and expected the clergymen would preach in his favor the writer is a most solid republican and who generally expresses the feelings of the republicans in philadelphia pretty faithfully i know not what functions irvine executed for the navy but if any the above sentiments are worthy of attention as the emploiment of harrison has given them heart burnings i know nothing of him whether moderate or    violent but until the party learn a little more moderation  decency no new favors should be conferred on them

urquhart or clouast or guillot or any native frenchman claiborne prefers  00 legislative council morgan watkins clarke jones roman and wikoff certain don or george pollock as claiborne chooses boré poydras and bellechasse certain and any three which claiborne may choose of these five to wit derbigue detrehan dubruys cantarelle sauvé it will be necessary for us to consider of a gradation of peaceable measures which may coerce the belligerent powers into an obedience to the laws within our waters so as to avoid using the gunboats if possible a nonintercourse law may be necessary but would not the power to forbid the admitting to entry any vessel of a belligerent so long as there should be an armed vessel of the nation in our waters in a state of disobedience to the laws or lawful orders of the executive be effectual making it lawful for us at the same time to give admittance to the armed vessels of a belligerent on such terms only as we should prescribe these things should be considered and agreed on among ourselves and suggested to our friends i salute you with affection and respect p s i shall be in washington by the last day of the month thomas jefferson sep   0  monticello albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss monticello sep   0  dear sir —as we shall have to lay before congress the proceedings of the british vessels at n york  0  it will be necessary for us to say to them with certainty which specific aggressions were committed within the common law which within the admiralty jurisdiction  which on the high seas the rule of the common law is that wherever you can see from land to land all the water within the line of sight is in the body of the adjacent county  within common law jurisdiction thus if in this curvature acbwaveimg you can see from a to b all the water within the line of sight is within common law jurisdiction  a murder committed at c is to be tried as at common law our coast is generally visible i believe by the time you get within about    miles i suppose that at n york you must be some miles out of the hook before the opposite shores recede    miles from each other the   miles of maritime jurisdiction is always to be counted from this line of sight it will be necessary we should be furnished with the most accurate chart to be had of the shores  waters in the neighborhood of the hook  that we may be able to ascertain on it the spot of every aggression i presume it would be within the province of mr gelston to procure us such a chart  to ascertain the positions of the offending vessels if i am right in this will you be so good as to instruct him so to do i think the officers of the federal government are meddling too much with the public elections will it be best to admonish them privately or by proclamation this for consideration till we meet i shall be at washington by the last day of the month i salute you with affection  respect  0  thomas jefferson sept    0  monticello marqués de casayrujo to the spanish minister marqués de casayrujo j mss monticello sept    0  sir —your letter of the  th inst came to hand on the   th only by which it seems to have lost a post by the way this therefore cannot be in washington but on the evening of the   th no information has been received from mr pinckney of the character which your letter supposes the latest we have from him inclosed a letter to him from m de cevallos in a tone not as friendly as heretofore used by that minister towards us more suited as we thought to the close of an unsuccessful discussion than the beginning of a friendly one and not calculated to impress a nation whose intentions are just but firm and unyielding to any other motive than justice what followed the reception of that letter is entirely unknown to us  what we have seen in the public papers was so little like what would flow from anything done on our part or expected from yours that we have given no credit to it the state of things between us seems indeed to require unreserved explanations cool  calm discussion to avoid those evils which neither party probably intends yet unfounded jealousies  suspicions may beget these discussions should regularly be between yourself  the secretary of state but a friend to the substance of business  disregarding all forms which obstruct the way to it i agree with readiness to the direct  personal interview you propose and shall receive you here with pleasure at your earliest convenience as i am to leave this place for washington  0  on the   th or   th instant being totally uninformed of what has past i must rely on you to bring any documents or other papers which may be necessary to present a full view of the subject of communication mrs randolph will be happy in the opportunity of paying her respects to the marchioness yrujo at monticello  of contributing her attentions to render the time we may possess her here as agreeable as she can she joins me in respects to the marchioness  i add my friendly salutations to yourself  assurances of great consideration  respect thomas jefferson sept      0  monticello levi lincoln to the attorneygeneral levi lincoln j mss monticello sept      0  dear sir —it will be necessary to lay before congress the aggressions of the british vessels before the harbor of new york for this purpose it will be necessary in the first place to examine all the cases and to class them according to the principle of the aggression and secondly to prepare a succinct statement of them for i believe that would be more proper than to furnish them the documents they are not called on to legislate on each case for then they should inquire into it specifically but are told by the executive that such things have happened in order that they may pass laws to prevent such in future as the american citizen of n y has kept a steady eye on them and stated the cases i have cut them out of the paper and now inclose them to you  0  as they will give you more time to consider the cases and an opportunity perhaps of consulting your own library on questionable points authentic documents  fuller information on every case will be ready for you at washington for which place i set out the   th inst the spanish minister here seems to have found means of exciting his court considerably on the act for establishing a port of entry on the mobile and something serious has passed between pinckney and them of which we are not informed i take for granted that such circumstances as these will be easily allayed by good humor and reason between reasonable men the new administration in england is entirely cordial there has never been a time when our flag was so little molested by them in the european seas or irregularities there so readily  respectfully corrected as the officers here began their insults before the change it is a proof it did not proceed from that change we must expect however unequivocal measures from them to prevent such things in future while congress should enable us to arrest them by our own means and not expose us to pass such another year of insulted jurisdiction accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect thomas jefferson oct     0  washington de witt clinton to de witt clinton j mss washington oct     0  dear sir —your favor of sep    was received on my return to this place certainly the distribution of so atrocious a libel as the pamphlet aristides and  0  still more the affirming its contents to be true as holy writ presents a shade in the morality of mr swartwout of which his character had not before been understood to be susceptible such a rejection of all regard to truth would have been sufficient cause against receiving him into the corps of executive officers at first but whether it is expedient after a person is appointed to be as nice on a question of removal requires great consideration i proposed soon after coming into office to enjoin the executive officers from intermeddling with elections as inconsistent with the true principles of our constitution it was laid over for consideration but late occurrences prove the propriety of it and it is now under consideration in the absence of the secretary of state i desired his chief clerk to inclose you an extract of a letter respecting genl moreau that as private individuals we should receive him with cordiality is just but any public display would be injurious to him and to our harmony with his former government i salute you with friendship  respect thomas jefferson november     0  fourth annual message   november     0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states to a people fellow citizens who sincerely desire the happiness and prosperity of other nations to  0  those who justly calculate that their own wellbeing is advanced by that of the nations with which they have intercourse it will be a satisfaction to observe that the war which was lighted up in europe a little before our last meeting has not yet extended its flames to other nations nor been marked by the  0  calamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war the irregularities too on the ocean which generally harass the commerce of neutral nations have in distinct parts disturbed ours less than on former occasions but in the american seas they have been greater from peculiar causes and even within our  0  harbors and jurisdiction infringements on the authority of the laws have been committed which have called for serious attention the friendly conduct of the governments from whose officers and subjects these acts have proceeded in other respects and in places more under their observation and  0  control gives us confidence that our representations on this subject will have been properly regarded while noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by others those on our own part should not be omitted nor left unprovided for complaints have been received that persons residing within the united   0 states have taken on themselves to arm merchant vessels and to force a commerce into certain ports and countries in defiance of the laws of those countries that individuals should undertake to wage private war independently of the authority of their country cannot be permitted in a wellordered     society its tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations and to endanger the peace of our own is so obvious that i doubt not you will adopt measures for restraining it effectually in future soon after the passage of the act of the last session authorizing the establishment of a district and port of entry on the waters of the mobile we learnt that its object was misunderstood on the part of spain candid explanations were immediately given and assurances that reserving our claims in that quarter as a subject of discussion and arrangement with spain no act was meditated in the meantime inconsistent with the peace and friendship existing between the two nations and that conformably to these intentions would be the execution of the law the government had however thought proper to suspend the ratification of the convention of   0  but the explanations which would reach them soon after and still more the confirmation of them by the tenor of the instrument establishing the port and district may reasonably be expected to replace them in the dispositions and views of the whole subject which originally dictated the convention i have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been urged by that government against the validity of our title to the country of louisiana have been withdrawn its exact limits however remaining still to be settled between us and to this is to be added that having prepared and delivered the stock created in execution of the convention of paris of april  0   0  in consideration     of the cession of that country we have received from the government of france an acknowledgment in due form of the fulfilment of that stipulation with the nations of europe in general our friendship and intercourse are undisturbed and from the governments of the belligerent powers especially we continue to receive those friendly manifestations which are justly due to an honest neutrality and to such good offices consistent with that as we have opportunities of rendering the activity and success of the small force employed in the mediterranean in the early part of the present year the reinforcement sent into that sea and the energy of the officers having command in the several vessels will i trust by the sufferings of war reduce the barbarians of tripoli to the desire of peace on proper terms great injury however ensues to ourselves as well as to others interested from the distance to which prizes must be brought for adjudication and from the impracticability of bringing hither such as are not seaworthy the bey of tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by our treaty their rejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent but to those who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands will not cost us less than a war we must leave as a question of calculation for them also whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them less than a war we can do to each other very sensible injuries by war but the mutual advantages of peace make that the best interest of both     peace and intercourse with the other powers on the same coast continue on the footing on which they are established by treaty in pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government of louisiana the necessary officers for the territory of orleans were appointed in due time to commence the exercise of their functions on the first day of october the distance however of some of them and indispensable previous arrangements may have retarded its commencement in some of its parts the form of government thus provided having been considered but as temporary and open to such improvements as further information of the circumstances of our brethren there might suggest it will of course be subject to your consideration in the district of louisiana it has been thought best to adopt the division into subordinate districts which had been established under its former government these being five in number a commanding officer has been appointed to each according to the provision of the law and so soon as they can be at their station that district will also be in its due state of organization in the meantime their places are supplied by the officers before commanding there the functions of the governor and judges of indiana have commenced the government we presume is proceeding in its new form the lead mines in that district offer so rich a supply of that metal as to merit attention the report now communicated will inform you of their state and of the necessity of immediate inquiry into their occupation and titles     with the indian tribes established within our newlyacquired limits i have deemed it necessary to open conferences for the purpose of establishing a good understanding and neighborly relations between us so far as we have yet learned we have reason to believe that their dispositions are generally favorable and friendly and with these dispositions on their part we have in our own hands means which cannot fail us for preserving their peace and friendship by pursuing a uniform course of justice toward them by aiding them in all the improvements which may better their condition and especially by establishing a commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them and only not losing to us and so regulated as that no incendiaries of our own or any other nation may be permitted to disturb the natural effects of our just and friendly offices we may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort and prosperity that the protection of our citizens from their disorderly members will become their interest and their voluntary care instead therefore of an augmentation of military force proportioned to our extension of frontier i propose a moderate enlargement of the capital employed in that commerce as a more effectual economical and humane instrument for preserving peace and good neighborhood with them on this side of the mississippi an important relinquishment of native title has been received from the delawares that tribe desiring to extinguish in their people the spirit of hunting and to convert superfluous lands into the means of improving what     they retain have ceded to us all the country between the wabash and the ohio south of and including the road from the rapids towards vincennes for which they are to receive annuities in animals and implements for agriculture and in other necessaries this acquisition is important not only for its extent and fertility but as fronting three hundred miles on the ohio and near half that on the wabash the produce of the settled countries descending those rivers will no longer pass in review of the indian frontier but in a small portion and with the cession heretofore made with the kaskaskias nearly consolidates our possessions north of the ohio in a very respectable breadth from lake erie to the mississippi the piankeshaws having some claim to the country ceded by the delawares it has been thought best to quiet that by fair purchase also so soon as the treaties on this subject shall have received their constitutional sanctions they shall be laid before both houses the act of congress of february   th   0  for building and employing a number of gunboats is now in a course of execution to the extent there provided for the obstacle to naval enterprise which vessels of this construction offer for our seaport towns their utility towards supporting within our waters the authority of the laws the promptness with which they will be manned by the seamen and militia of the place the moment they are wanting the facility of their assembling from different parts of the coast to any point where they are required in greater force than ordinary the economy of their     maintenance and preservation from decay when not in actual service and the competence of our finances to this defensive provision without any new burden are considerations which will have due weight with congress in deciding on the expediency of adding to their number from year to year as experience shall test their utility until all our important harbors by these and auxiliary means shall be insured against insult and opposition to the laws no circumstance has arisen since your last session which calls for any augmentation of our regular military force should any improvement occur in the militia system that will be always seasonable accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year with estimates for the ensuing one will as usual be laid before you the state of our finances continues to fulfil our expectations eleven millions and a half of dollars received in the course of the year ending on the  0th of september last have enabled us after meeting all the ordinary expenses of the year to pay upward of   00000 of the public debt exclusive of interest this payment with those of the two preceding years has extinguished upward of twelve millions of the principal and a greater sum of interest within that period and by a proportional diminution of interest renders already sensible the effect of the growing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principal it is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last year exceeds that of the preceding and the probable receipts of the ensuing year may     safely be relied on as sufficient with the sum already in the treasury to meet all the current demands of the year to discharge upward of three millions and a half of the engagements incurred under the british and french conventions and to advance in the farther redemption of the funded debts as rapidly as had been contemplated these fellow citizens are the principal matters which i have thought it necessary at this time to communicate for your consideration and attention some others will be laid before you in the course of the session but in the discharge of the great duties confided to you by our country you will take a broader view of the field of legislation whether the great interests of agriculture manufactures commerce or navigation can within the pale of your constitutional powers be aided in any of their relations whether laws are provided in all cases where they are wanting whether those provided are exactly what they should be whether any abuses take place in their administration or in that of the public revenues whether the organization of the public agents or of the public force is perfect in all its parts in fine whether anything can be done to advance the general good are questions within the limits of your functions which will necessarily occupy your attention in these and other matters which you in your wisdom may propose for the good of our country you may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation and faithful execution     thomas jefferson nov    0  james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss nov    0  i send you   sheets of my commonplace because on the   last pages of them are my abridgments of certain admiralty cases interesting to us with some observations it will be well that we mutually understand how far we go together  what consequently we may propose with joint satisfaction i think the english practice of not requiring a prize to be hazarded further than to the nearest neutral port is so much for the interest of all weak nations that we ought to strengthen it by our example  prevent that change of practice which sr w scott seems to be aiming at evidently swayed by considerations of the interest of his nation thomas jefferson nov    0  washington john randolph to john randolph j mss washington nov    0  dear sir —i mentioned to you in a cursory way the other evening that before the meeting of congress i had conferred with my executive associates on the subject of insults in our harbors and that we had settled in our own minds what we thought it would be best to do on that subject which i had thrown into the form of a bill  i meant to have     communicated this to you but on the reference of that part of the message to a special committee it was thought necessary to communicate it without delay to a member of the committee but the outlines are these in the  st place foreign armed vessels entering our harbors are to report themselves to take such position  conform to such regulations   0 respecting health repairs supplies stay intercourse  departure as shall be prescribed on not conforming to these the vessel may be ordered away and not obeying that order the following gradation of coercive measures is proposed to forbid supplies to be furnished to them to cut off all intercourse between them  the shore or other     vessels not to receive the entry at the custom house at that port of any vessel of the same nation till she removes to extend the prohibition to all customhouses of the u s so long as the refractory vessel remain  lastly to recur to force these were our ideas suggested from practice and a knolege of facts and the communication of them in form of a bill is     merely as a canvass or premiere ebauche for congress to work on  to make of it whatever they please they cannot be the worse for knowing the result of our information  reflection on the subject which has been privately communicated as more respectful than to have recommended these measures in the message in detail as the constitution permits with the same view i state them merely as subjects for your consideration accept affectionate salutations  assurances of respect thomas jefferson nov    0  washington larkin smith to larkin smith j mss washington nov    0  sir —your letter of the  0th came to hand yesterday evening it was written with frankness and independance and will be answered in the same way you complain that i did not answer your letters applying for office but if you will reflect a moment you may judge whether this ought to be expected to the successful applicant for an office the commission is the answer to the unsuccessful multitude am i to go with every one into the reasons for not appointing him besides that this correspondence would literally engross my whole time into what controversies would it lead me sensible of this dilemma from the moment of coming into office i laid it down as a rule to leave the applicants to collect their answer from the facts to entitle myself to the benefit of the rule in any case it must be observed in every one and i never have departed from     it in a single case not even for my bosom friends you observe that you are or probably will be appointed an elector i have no doubt you will do your duty with a conscientious regard to the public good  to that only your decision in favor of another would not excite in my mind the slightest dissatisfaction towards you on the contrary i should honor the integrity of your choice in the nominations i have to make do the same justice to my motives had you hundreds to nominate instead of one be assured they would not compose for you a bed of roses you would find yourself in most cases with one loaf and ten wanting bread nine must be disappointed perhaps become secret if not open enemies the transaction of the great interests of our country costs us little trouble or difficulty there the line is plain to men of some experience but the task of appointment is a heavy one indeed he on whom it falls may envy the lot of a sisyphus or ixion their agonies were of the body this of the mind yet like the office of hangman it must be executed by some one it has been assigned to me and made my duty i make up my mind to it therefore  abandon all regard to consequences accept my salutations  assurances of respect thomas jefferson dec   0  washington wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas j mss washington dec   0  dear sir —i thank you for your description of the state of parties as to one of the extremes i find i have not been mistaken the line     between them and their more moderate brethren i have not so well understood it is of importance for my government from the federalists there i expect nothing on any principle of duty or patriotism but i did suppose they would pay some attentions to the interests of norfolk is it the interest of that place to strengthen the hue and cry against the policy of making the eastern branch our great naval deposit is it their interest that this should be removed to new york or boston to one of which it must go if it leaves this is it their interest to scout a defence by gunboats in which they would share amply in hopes of a navy which will not be built in our day  would be no defence if built or of forts which will never be built or maintained and would be no defence if built yet such are the objects which they patronize in their papers this is worthy of more consideration than they seem to have given it accept affectionate salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect thomas jefferson jan     0  washington john taylor to john taylor j mss washington jan     0  dear sir —your favor of dec   th has been duly received and was received as a proof of your friendly partialities to me of which i have so often had reason to be sensible my opinion originally was that the president of the u s should have been elected for   years  forever ineligible afterwards i have     since become sensible that   years is too long to be irremovable and that there should be a peaceable way of withdrawing a man in midway who is doing wrong the service for   years with a power to remove at the end of the first four comes nearly to my principle as corrected by experience and it is in adherence to that that i determined to withdraw at the end of my second term the danger is that the indulgence  attachments of the people will keep a man in the chair after he becomes a dotard that reelection through life shall become habitual  election for life follow that genl washington set the example of voluntary retirement after   years i shall follow it and a few more precedents will oppose the obstacle of habit to anyone after a while who shall endeavor to extend his term perhaps it may beget a disposition to establish it by an amendment of the constitution i believe i am doing right therefore in pursuing my principle i had determined to declare my intention but i have consented to be silent on the opinion of friends who think it best not to put a continuance out of my power in defiance of all circumstances there is however but one circumstance which could engage my acquiescence in another election to wit such a division about a successor as might bring in a monarchist but this circumstance is impossible while therefore i shall make no formal declarations to the public of my purpose i have freely let it be understood in private conversation in this i am persuaded yourself  my friends generally will approve of my views and should i     at the end of a  d term carry into retirement all the favor which the  st has acquired i shall feel the consolation of having done all the good in my power and expect with more than composure the termination of a life no longer valuable to others or of importance to myself accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect thomas jefferson jan    0  washington william a burwell to william a burwell j mss washington jan    0  dear sir —your letter of the   th has been duly received and mr coles consents to remain here till the  th of march when i shall leave this place for monticello and pass a month there consequently if you can join me here the second week in april it will be as early as your absence could effect my convenience i have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the extinguishment of slavery among us there are many virtuous men who would make any sacrifices to affect it many equally virtuous who persuade themselves either that the thing is not wrong or that it cannot be remedied and very many with whom interest is morality the older we grow the larger we are disposed to believe the last party to be but interest is really going over to the side of morality the value of the slave is every day lessening his burden on his master daily increasing interest is therefore preparing the disposition to be just and this will be goaded from time to time by the insurrectionary     spirit of the slaves this is easily quelled in its first efforts but from being local it will become general and whenever it does it will rise more formidable after every defeat until we shall be forced after dreadful scenes  sufferings to release them in their own way which without such sufferings we might now model after our own convenience accept my affectionate salutations thomas jefferson march     0  second inaugural address   j mss march     0  proceeding fellow citizens to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance     on the charge again conferred upon me it is my duty to express the deep sense i entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations     on taking this station on a former occasion i declared the principles on which i believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth my conscience tells me that i have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind in the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations and especially of those with which we have the most important relations we have done them justice on all occasions favored where favor was lawful and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is taken on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others at home fellow citizens you best know whether we have done well or ill the suppression of unnecessary offices of useless establishments and expenses enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes these covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of produce and property if among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who   0 collected them and because if they had any merit the state authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved the remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid cheerfully by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts being collected on our seaboards and frontiers only and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens it may be the pleasure and pride of an american to ask what farmer what mechanic what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the united states these contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the government to fulfil contracts with foreign nations to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits to extend those limits and to apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their final redemption and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby liberated may by a just repartition among the states and a corresponding amendment of the constitution be applied in time of peace to rivers canals roads arts manufactures education and other great objects within each state in time of war if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war increased as the same revenue will be increased by population and consumption and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burdening them with the debts of the past war will then be but a suspension of useful works and a return to     a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement i have said fellow citizens that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest in all events it will repay the advances we have made i know that the acquisition of louisiana has been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively the larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family with which shall we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse in matters of religion i have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government i have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it but have left them as the constitution found them under the direction and discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies the aboriginal inhabitants of these countries i have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires endowed with the faculties and the rights of men breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence and occupying a country which     left them no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores without power to divert or habits to contend against they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunters state humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of mind and morals we have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity and they are covered with the ægis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves but the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life to induce them to exercise their reason follow its dictates and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter they are combated by the habits of their bodies prejudice of their minds ignorance pride and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other these persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors that whatsoever they did must be done through all time that reason is a false guide and to advance under     its counsel in their physical moral or political condition is perilous innovation that their duty is to remain as their creator made them ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger in short my friends among them is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and bigotry they too have their antiphilosophers who find an interest in keeping things in their present state who dread reformation and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendency of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates in giving these outlines i do not mean fellow citizens to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large who by the weight of public opinion influence and strengthen the public measures it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws the execution of which alone remains for others and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries whose patriotism has associated with me in the executive functions during this course of administration and in order to disturb it the artillery of the press has been levelled against us charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare these abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety     they might indeed have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved and provided by the laws of the several states against falsehood and defamation but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully made whether freedom of discussion unaided by power is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth—whether a government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution with zeal and purity and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness can be written down by falsehood and defamation the experiment has been tried you have witnessed the scene our fellow citizens have looked on cool and collected they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded they gathered around their public functionaries and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage they pronounced their verdict honorable to those who had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes he may be intrusted with his own affairs no inference is here intended that the laws provided by the state against false and defamatory publications should not be enforced he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law but the experiment     is noted to prove that since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts the press confined to truth needs no other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasonings and opinions on a full hearing of all parties and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course i offer to our country sincere congratulations with those too not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them and our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens with whom they cannot yet resolve to act as to principles and measures think as they think and desire what they desire that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good that peace be cultivated civil and religious liberty unassailed law and order preserved equality of rights maintained and that state of property equal or unequal which results to every man from his own industry or that of his fathers when satisfied of these views it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them in the meantime let us cherish them with patient affection let us do them justice and     more than justice in all competitions of interest and we need not doubt that truth reason and their own interests will at length prevail will gather them into the fold of their country and will complete their entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength i shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved i fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray i am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice but the weakness of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests i shall need therefore all the indulgence i have heretofore experienced—the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years i shall need too the favor of that being in whose hands we are who led our forefathers as israel of old from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life who has covered our infancy with his providence and our riper years with his wisdom and power and to whose goodness i ask you to join with me in supplications that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants guide their councils and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good and shall secure to you the peace friendship and approbation of all nations     thomas jefferson mar    0  monticello wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas j mss monticello mar    0  dear sir —your favor of the  0th was received only the last night i now return you the letter to colo newton which i pray you to deliver  use your influence to induce an acceptance it is in truth only asking him to become responsible for his son which he would of course do were the office given to his son directly  it will relieve me from a painful dilemma should he however refuse be so good as to inform me of it and you may at the same time address your letter of resignation to mr gallatin only confining the knolege of the fact as much as you can between colo newton and yourself that the appointment may be made before any solicitations can be forwarded the divisions among the republicans which you speak of are distressing but they are not unexpected to me from the moment i foresaw the entire prostration of federalism i knew that at that epoch more distressing divisions would take its place the opinions of men are as various as their faces and they will always find some rallying principle or point at which those nearest to it will unite reducing themselves to two stations under a common name for each these stations or camps will be formed of very heterogeneous materials combining from very different motives  with very different views i did believe my station in march   0  as painful as could be undertaken having to meet in front all the terrible passions of federalism in the first moment of its defeat  mortification and to grapple with it     until compleatly subdued but i consider that as less painful than to be placed between conflicting friends there my way was clear  my mind made up i never for a moment had to balance between two opinions in the new divisions which are to arise the case will be very different even those who seem to coalesce will be like the image of clay  brass however under difficulties of this kind i have ever found one  only one rule to do what is right  generally we shall disentangle ourselves without almost perceiving how it happens accept my affectionate salutations thomas

portuguese it is possible she would rather see these two last in possession of the southern continent than of any other nation it is really of good augury that taleyrand should have been silent about the western boundary of louisiana  i have no doubt monroe will make the most of it should it end in our getting the navigation of the mobile only we must make our protestation to spain that we reserve our right which neither time nor silence     is to lessen  shall assert it when circumstances call for it in the meantime propose the keeping it in statu quo unsettled i shall be glad that nothing be

loan may be necessary because we know how it will be perverted to throw dust in the eyes of the people however if no other expedient can be used we must meet it i have no expectation that monroe will be able to get any acknowledgement of boundary which we can admit the next best measure will be to obtain a free use of the rivers of either party rising within the limits of the other and that neither party shall either settle or fortify within the disputed country until the limits can be fixed this will give us time to await and avail ourselves of events i presume the appointment of flowers may await my return in the meantime the other may be heard from i have desired the postmastergeneral to forward nothing to me here after the  th instant as i expect to be with you in a

washington apr    0  dear sir —your favor of mar    has been duly received i regret that the state of your health renders a visit to this place unadvisable besides the gratification we should have felt from personal considerations the perusal of the correspondences for some time back with the governments of europe most interesting to us by putting you in possession of the actual state of things between us would have enabled you to act under all emergencies with that satisfaction to yourself which is derived from a full knolege of the ground but i presume you will find this supplied as to the government to which you go by the papers of the office at madrid our relations with that nation are vitally interesting that they should be of a peaceable  friendly character has been our most earnest desire had spain met us with the same dispositions our idea was that her existence in this hemisphere  ours should have rested on the same bottom should have swam or sunk together we want nothing of hers  we want no other nation to possess what is hers but she has met our advances with jealousy secret malice and illfaith our patience under this unworthy return of disposition is now on its last trial and the issue of what is now depending between us will decide whether our relations with her are to be sincerely friendly or permanently hostile i still wish  would cherish the former but have ceased to expect it     i thank you for the sentiments of esteem you are so good as to express towards me and the mark of it you wish me to place at monticello it shall be deposited with the memorials of those worthies whose remembrance i feel a pride  comfort in consecrating there with my best wishes for the restoration of your health  for a pleasant voyage i tender you my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect thomas jefferson may    0  washington dr george logan to dr george logan j mss washington may    0  dear sir —i received last night a letter from mr thomas brannagan     s water st philadelphia asking my subscription to the work announced in the inclosed paper  the cause in which he embarks is so holy the sentiments he expresses in his letter so friendly that it is highly painful to me to hesitate on a compliance which appears so small but that is not its true character and it would be injurious even to his views for me to commit myself on paper by answering his letter i have most carefully avoided every public act or manifestation on that subject should an occasion ever occur in which i can interpose with decisive effect i shall certainly know  do my duty with promptitude  zeal but in the meantime it would only be disarming myself of influence to be taking small means the subscription to a book on this subject is one of those little irritating     measures which without advancing its end at all would by lessening the confidence  good will of a description of friends composing a large body only lessen my powers of doing them good in the other great relations in which i stand to the publick yet i cannot be easy in not answering mr brannagans letter unless he can be made sensible that it is better i should not answer it  i do not know how to effect this unless you would have the goodness the first time you go to philadelphia to see him and to enter into an explanation with him i see with infinite pain the bloody schism which has taken place among our friends in pennsylvania  new york  will probably take place in other states the main body of both sections mean well but their good intentions will produce great public evil the minority whichever section shall be the minority will end in coalition with the federalists and some compromise of principle because these will not sell their aid for nothing republicanism will thus lose and royalism gain some portion of that ground which we thought we had rescued to good government i do not express my sense of our misfortunes from any idea that they are remediable i know that the passions of men will take their course that they are not to be controulled but by despotism  that this melancholy truth is the pretext for despotism the duty of an upright administration is to pursue its course steadily to know nothing of these family dissensions and to cherish the good principles of both parties the war ad internecionem which we have waged against federalism has filled our latter     ties with strife and unhappiness we have met it with pain indeed but with firmness because we believed it the last convulsive effort of that hydra which in earlier times we had conquered in the field but if any degeneracy of principle should ever render it necessary to give ascendancy to one of the rising sections over the other i thank my god it will fall to some other to perform that operation the only cordial i wish to carry into my retirement is the undivided good will of all those with whom i have acted present me affectionately to mrs logan and accept my

your state  i cannot but congratulate you on the advance it manifests  the certain prospect it offers that another year restores massachusetts to the general body of the nation you have indeed received the federal unction of lying  slandering but who has not who will ever again come into eminent office unanointed with this chrism it seems to be fixed that falsehood  calumny are to be their ordinary engines of opposition engines which will not be entirely without effect the circle of characters equal to the first stations is not too large  will be lessened by the voluntary retreat of those whose sensibilities are stronger than their confidence in the justice of public opinion i certainly have known      still know characters eminently qualified for the most exalted trusts who could not bear up against the brutal hackings  hewings of these heroes of billingsgate i may say from intimate knolege that we should have lost the services of the greatest character of our country had he been assailed with the degree of abandoned licentiousness now practised the torture he felt under rare  slight attacks proved that under those of which the federal bands have shewn themselves capable he would have thrown up the helm in a burst of indignation yet this effect of sensibility must not be yielded to if we suffer ourselves to be frightened from our post by mere lying surely the enemy will use that weapon for what one so cheap to those of whose system of politics morality makes no part the patriot like the christian must learn that to bear revilings  persecutions is a part of his duty and in proportion as the trial is severe firmness under it becomes more requisite  praiseworthy it requires indeed selfcommand but that will be fortified in proportion as the calls for its exercise are repeated in this i am persuaded we shall have the benefit of your good example to the other falsehoods they have brought forward should they add as you expect insinuations of any want of confidence in you from the administration generally or myself particularly it will like their other falsehoods produce in the public mind a contrary inference no evidence however of that confidence which i could furnish should be wanting an appointment to office would be such but at present there is no     opening for it no vacancy exists in your own state and the only office here unfulfilled has been otherwise tendered  indeed would be incompatible with the views of your state which destines you for the most distinguished mark of their affection  confidence requiring your residence there to the nation in general your election will be as gratifying as to that particular state for never can we consider our union as solid while so important a member as massachusetts is disaffected that we may not fail to obtain this accession to our harmony  prosperity nor you so honorable a testimony of the esteem  approbation of a respectable state no one prays more sincerely than i do and with this assurance i tender you my friendly and respectful salutations thomas jefferson may      0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss may      0  th j to mr gallatin i

form one proper district and the residuary country another or the waters of the red river and the country above and between that and the mississippi for one and the residuary country the other the financial part of your letter is highly pleasing there must be something more in this increase of     revenue than the natural and war increase depreciation to a small degree in other countries a sensible one in this and a great one in england must make a part of it and is a lesson to us to prefer ad valorem to fixed duties the latter require often retouching or they become delusive as to the orleans revenue i presume we may consider it as the consumption of  0000 people and their increase added to that of  000000 and their increase for though the former will increase faster than the latter it will only be by drawing off numbers from them but from whatever cause the increase of revenue is a pleasing circumstance as it hastens the moment of liberating our revenue and of permitting us to begin upon canals roads college c i presume you will locate on your map the indians from sibleys statement my maps being in the hands of the binder i cannot do it but when you shall have done it

perfectly disposed to communicate to you the collections i possess as far as their condition will admit what this is will need explanation     i have a collection nearly compleat of the laws from

once i reserve that to the moment when the legislature shall decide to have an authentic copy taken in the meantime i have sewed them up in oil cloth and seared the joints to preserve them from the air these being antecedent to bacons rebellion are not within the period of your desires the printed collection of laws in my possession which comprehend the period you mention to wit from bacons rebellion to      are   vol   purviss collection     –         revisal of          –         revisal of          –         revisal of          –         fugitive sheets published each session     –      th  th and  th volumes are of subsequent dates the  st  d  d   th vols above mentioned are in every lawyers hands therefore you will easily obtain them in your neighborhood the  th volume is the only one of which there exists probably no other collection this fact being generally known the courts in the different parts of the state are in the practice of resorting to this volume for copies of particular acts called for in the cases before them for this reason i have always refused to let it go from monticello not only because it might be lost but because     while it was gone out in the service of one person many might have occasion to recur to it but as the depositing it with governor page at the seat of government will keep it within the access of others and you mention that that deposit will be perfectly convenient for you it shall be deposited there my collection of newspapers is from      downwards the vols preceding      shall be sent with the other to richmond to be used by you either there or at petersburg according to your convenience these also being the only collection probably in existence i purchased  cherish it with a view to public utility it is answering one of its principal objects when i put it into your hands  the same public principle will insure your care of it and its restoration to its deposit when you shall have taken what you desire from it i will immediately write to mr randolph to take these books from the library at monticello of which he has the key  to have them safely conveyed by water to govr page at richmond to whom also i will write on the subject altho i have not yet had time to peruse the volume you have published for indeed my occupations permit me to read almost nothing yet occasional recurrence to parts of it  the opinions of others who have read it occasion me to regret that i am not in a situation to give you the benefit of all my materials were i residing at home i could do it and would with pleasure and should a second edition be called for after my return to live at monticello i am persuaded it will be in my power as it is certainly in my wish to furnish you with some useful matter not perhaps to be

doubt whether the open room on your  d story will answer your expectations there will be a few days in the year in which it will be delightful but not many nothing but trees or venetian blinds can protect it from the sun the semicylindrical roof you propose will have advantages you know it has been practised on the cloth market at paris de lorme the inventor shews many forms of roofs in his book to which it is applicable i have used it at home for a dome being   0° of an oblong octagon and in the capitol we unite two quadrants of a sphere by a semicylinder all framed in de lormes manner how has your planing machine answered has it been tried  persevered in by any workmen france has become so jealous of our conduct as to st domingo which in truth is only the conduct of our merchants that the offer to become a mediator would only confirm her suspicions bonaparte however expressed satisfaction at the paragraph in my message to congress on the subject of that commerce with respect to the german redemptioners you know     i can do nothing unless authorized by law it would be made a question in congress whether any of the enumerated objects to which the constitution authorizes the money of the union to be applied would cover an expenditure for importing settlers to orleans the letter of the revolutionary sergeant which you enclosed to me was attended to by gen dearborne who wrote to him informing him how to proceed to obtain his land doctr eustiss observation to you that certain paragraphs in the national intelligencer respecting my letter to you supposed to be under mr jeffersons direction had embarrassed mr jeffersons friends in massachusetts that they appeared like a half denial of the letter or as if there was something in it not proper to be owned or that needed an apology is one of those mysterious halfconfidences difficult to be understood that tory printers should think it advantageous to identify me with that paper the aurora c in order to obtain ground for abusing me is perhaps fair warfare but that any one who knows me personally should listen one moment to such an insinuation is what i did not expect i neither have nor ever had any more connection with those papers than our antipodes have nor know what is to be in them until i see it in them except proclamations  other documents sent for publication the friends in massachusetts who could be embarrassed by so weak a weapon as this must be feeble friends indeed with respect to the letter i never hesitated to avow and to justify it in conversation in no other way do i trouble myself to     contradict anything which is said at that time however there were certain anomalies in the motions of some of our friends which events have at length reduced to regularity it seems very difficult to find out what turns things are to take in europe i suppose it depends on austria which knowing it is to stand in the way of receiving the first hard blows is cautious of entering into a coalition as

 mile below westham ordered capts brush      irish  mr hylton to continue all night waggoning to westham the arms  stores still at the foundry to be drawn across the river at westham then proceeded to westham to urge the pressing the transportation there across the river and thence went to     tuckahoe   miles above  on the same side of the river to see after his family which he had sent that far in the course of the day he arrived there at   oclock in the night jan   early in the morning he carried his family across the river there and sending them to fine creek   miles higher up went himself to brittons on the s side of the river opposite to westham finding the arms c in a heap near the shore  exposed to be destroyed by cannon from the north bank he had them removed under cover of a point of land near by he proceeded to manchester opposite to richmond the enemy had arrived at richmond at   pm having found that nearly the whole arms had been got there from richmond he set out for chetwoods to meet with baron steuben who had appointed that place as a rendezvous  headquarters but not finding him there  understanding he would be at colo flemings six miles above brittons he proceeded thither the enemy had now a detachment at westham and sent a deputation from the city of richmond to the governor at colo flemings to propose terms for ransoming the safety of the city which terms he rejected jan   the governor returned to brittons had measures taken more effectually to secure the books  papers there the enemy having burnt some houses  stores left richmond after    hours

in the movements of the governor may lay their finger on the point and say when  where it was hereafter less detail will suffice soon after this general phillips having joined arnold with a reinforcement of  000 men they advanced again up to petersburg  about the last of april to manchester the governor had remained constantly in and about richmond exerting all his     powers for collecting militia and providing such means for the defence of the state as its exhausted resources admitted never assuming a guard  with only the river between him  the enemy his lodgings were frequently within     or   miles of them m de lafayette about this time arrived at richmond with some continental troops with which  the militia collected he continued to occupy that place and the north bank of the river while phillips  arnold held manchester  the south bank but lord cornwallis about the middle of may joining them with the main southern army m de lafayette was obliged to retire the enemy crossed the river  advanced up into the country about  0 miles  within  0 miles of charlottesville at which place the legislature being to meet in june the governor proceeded to his seat at monticello   or   miles from it his office was now near expiring the country under invasion by a powerful army no services but military of any avail unprepared by his line of life  education for the command of armies he believed it right not to stand in the way of talents better fitted than his own to the circumstances under which the country was placed he therefore himself proposed to his friends in the legislature that gen nelson who commanded the militia of the state should be appointed governor as he was sensible that the union of the civil  military power in the same hands at this time would greatly facilitate military measures this appointment accordingly took place on the   th of june          this was the state of things when his office having actually expired  no successor not yet in place colo tarleton with his regiment of horse was detached by ld cornwallis to surprise mr jefferson whom they thought still in office and the legislature now sitting in charlottesville the speakers of the two houses  some other members of the legislature were lodging with mr jefferson at monticello tarleton early in the morning june         when within  0 miles of that place detached a company of horse to secure him  his guests and proceeded himself rapidly with his main body to charlottesville where he hoped to find the legislature unapprised of his movement notice of it however had been brought both to monticello  charlottesville about sunrise the speakers with their colleagues returned to charlottesville and with the other members of the legislature had barely time to get out of his way mr jefferson sent off his family to secure them from danger and was himself still at monticello making arrangements for his own departure when lieutt hudson arrived there at half speed  informed him the enemy were then ascending the hill of monticello he departed immediately  knowing that he would be pursued if he took the high road he plunged into the woods of the adjoining mountain where being at once safe he proceeded to overtake his family this is the famous adventure of carters mountain which has been so often resounded through the slanderous chronicles of federalism but they have taken care never to detail the facts lest these should shew that     this favorite charge amounted to nothing more than that he did not remain in his house and there singly fight a whole troop of horse or suffer himself to be taken prisoner having accompanied his family one days journey he returned to monticello tarleton had retired after    hours stay in charlottesville mr jefferson then rejoined his family and proceeded with them to an estate he had in bedford about  0 miles sw where riding in his farm some time after he was thrown from his horse  disabled from riding on horseback for a considerable time but mr turner finds it more convenient to give him this fall in his retreat before tarleton which had happened some weeks before as a proof that he withdrew from a troop of horse with a precipitancy which don quixot would not have practised the facts here stated most particularly with date of time and place are taken from the notes made by the writer hereof for his own satisfaction at the time the others are from memory but so well recollected that he is satisfied there is no material fact misstated should any person undertake to contradict any particular on evidence which may at all merit the public respect the writer will take the trouble tho not at all in the best situation for it to produce the proofs in support of it he finds indeed that of the persons whom he recollects to have been present on these occasions few have survived the intermediate lapse of four and twenty years yet he trusts that some as well as himself are yet among the living and he is positively certain that no man can falsify any material fact here stated     he well remembers indeed that there were then as there are at all times some who blamed everything done contrary to their own opinion althou their opinions were formed on a very partial knowledge of facts the censures which have been hazarded by such men as mr turner are nothing but revivals of these half informed opinions mr george nicholas then a very young man but always a very honest one was prompted by these persons to bring specific charges against mr jefferson the heads of these in writing were communicated thro a mutual friend to mr jefferson who committed to writing also the heads of justification on each of them i well remember this paper  believe the original of it still exists and tho framed when every real fact was fresh in the knolege of everyone this fabricated flight from richmond was not among the charges stated in this paper nor any charge against mr jefferson for not fighting singly the troop of horse mr nicholas candidly relinquished further proceeding the house of representatives of virginia pronounced an honorable sentence of entire approbation of mr jeffersons conduct and so much the more honorable as themselves had been witnesses to it and mr george nicholas took a conspicuous occasion afterwards of his own free will  when the matter was entirely at rest to retract publicly the erroneous opinions he had been led into on that occasion  to make just reparation by a candid acknolegement of them     thomas jefferson aug   0  monticello james madison to

before the season passes over a letter from charles pinckney of may    informs me that spain refuses to settle a limit  perseveres in withholding the rectification of the convention he says not a word of the status quo from which i conclude it has not been proposed i observe by the papers that dalton is arrived with the public dispatches from which we shall know the particulars i think the status quo if not already proposed should be immediately offered through bowdoin should it even be refused the refusal to settle a limit is not of itself a sufficient cause of war nor is the withholding a ratification worthy of such a redress yet these acts shew a purpose both in spain  france against which we ought to provide before the conclusion of a peace i think therefore we should take into consideration whether we ought not immediately to propose to england an eventual treaty of alliance to come into force whenever within years a war shall take place with spain or france it may be proper for the ensuing congress to make some preparations for such an event and it     should be in our power to shew we have done the same this for your consideration mr wagner writes me that two black convicts from surinam are landed at philadelphia being on the spot you will have a better opportunity of judging what should be done with them to me it seems best that we should send them to england with a proper representation against such a measure if the transportation is not within any of the regular appropriations it will come properly on the contingent fund if the law does not stand in the way of such an act  you think as i do it may be immediately carried into execution accept for mrs madison  yourself my affectionate salutations  assurances of constant esteem  respect    0 thomas jefferson aug     0  monticello albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss monticello aug     0  dear sir —you have probably learnt through other channels that our commissioners to spain have terminated their mission without success in a single point i have desired mr madison to send you the papers and when you shall have perused them i will ask a communication of your general view of what is expedient for us to do i ask the same of the other gentlemen when i shall have received them it will enable me to form precise points on which to ask their ultimate judgment this will employ some time but the case is serious and is entitled to time and mature consideration p s it seems essential to our success with england that we should not be understood as absolutely committed to war with spain thomas jefferson aug      0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug      0  dear sir —i confess that the enclosed letter from general turreau excites in me both jealousy  offence in undertaking  without apology to say in what manner we are to receive and treat moreau within our own country had turreau been here longer he would have known that the national     authority pays honors to no foreigners that the state authorities municipalities and individuals are free to render whatever they please voluntarily  free from restraint by us  he ought to know that no part of the criminal sentence of another country can have any effect here the style of that government in the spanish business was calculated to excite indignation but it was a case in which that might have done injury but the present is a case which would justify some notice in order to let them understand we are not of those powers who will receive  execute mandates i think the answer should shew independence as well as friendship i am anxious to receive the opinions of our brethren after their review  consideration of the spanish papers i am strongly impressed with a belief of hostile  treacherous intentions against us on the part of france and that we should lose no time in securing something more than a mutual friendship with england not having heard from you for some posts i have had a hope you were on the road  consequently that mrs madison was reestablished we are now in want of rain having had none in the last ten days in your quarter i am afraid they have been much longer without it we hear great complaints from f walkers lindsays maurys c of drought accept affectionate salutations  assurances of constant friendship p s i suppose kuhn at genoa should have new credentials     thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug    0  dear sir —yours of the  0th has been received and in that a letter from casinove and another from mrs ciracchi but those from turreau and to yrujo were not enclosed probably the former was what came to me by the preceding post respecting moreau if so you have my opinion on it in my last considering the character of bonaparte i think it material at once to let him see that we are not one of the powers who will receive his orders i think you have misconceived the nature of the treaty i thought we should propose to england i have no idea of committing ourselves immediately or independently of our further will to the war the treaty should be provisional only to come into force on the event of our being engaged in war with either france or spain during the present war in europe in that event we should make common cause  england should stipulate not to make peace without our obtaining the objects for which we go to war to wit the acknolegment by spain of the rightful boundaries of louisiana which we should reduce to our minimum by a secret article and   indemnification for spoliations for which purpose we should be allowed to make reprisal on the floridas  retain them as an indemnification our cooperation in the war if we should actually enter into it would be a sufficient consideration for great britain to engage for its object and it being generally known to france  spain that we had entered into treaty with     england would probably ensure us a peaceable  immediate settlement of both points but another motive much more powerful would indubitably induce england to go much further whatever illhumor may at times have been expressed against us by individuals of that country the first wish of every englishmans heart is to see us once more fighting by their sides against france nor could the king or his ministers do an act so popular as to enter into an alliance with us the nation would not weigh the consideration by grains  scruples they would consider it as the price  pledge of an indissoluble course of friendship i think it possible that for such a provisional treaty they would give us their general guarantee of louisiana  the floridas at any rate we might try them a failure would not make our situation worse if such a one could be obtained we might await our own convenience for calling up the casus fœderis i think it important that england should receive an overture as early as possible as it might prevent her listening to terms of peace if i recollect rightly we had instructed monroe when he went to paris to settle the deposit if he failed in that object to propose a treaty to england immediately we could not be more engaged to secure the deposit then than we are the country now after paying    millions for it i do expect therefore that considering the present state of things as analogous to that  virtually within his instructions he will very likely make the proposition to england i write my thoughts freely wishing the same from the other gentlemen that seeing      considering the ground of each others opinions we may come as soon as possible to a result i propose to be in washington on the  d of october by that time i hope we shall be ripe for some conclusion i have desired mr barnes to pay my quota of expenses relating to the marseilles cargo whatever you will be so good as to notify him that it is i wish i could have heard that mrs madisons course of recovery were more speedy i now fear we shall not see you but in washington accept for her  yourself my affectionate salutations  assurances of constant esteem  respect thomas jefferson sep      0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello sep      0  dear sir —the enclosed letter from general armstrong furnishes matter for consideration you know the french considered themselves entitled to the rio bravo  that laussat declared his orders to be to receive possession to that limit but not to perdido  that france has to us been always silent as to the western boundary while she spoke decisively as to the eastern you know turreau agreed with us that neither party should strengthen themselves in the disputed country during negociation and armstrong who says monroe concurs with him is of opinion from the character of the emperor that were we to restrict ourselves to taking the posts on the west side of the missipi  threaten a cessation of intercourse with spain bonaparte     would interpose efficiently to prevent the quarrel going further add to these things the fact that spain has sent  00 colonists to st antonio   00 troops to nacogdoches  probably has fixed or prepared a post at the bay of st bernard at matagordo supposing then a previous alliance with england to guard us in the worst event i should suppose that congress should pass acts   authorizing the exve to suspend intercourse with spain at discretion   to dislodge the new establishments of spain between the missipi  bravo and   to appoint commrs to examine  ascertain all claims for spoliation that they might be preserved for future indemnification i commit these ideas merely for consideration  that the subject may be matured by the time of our meeting at washington where i shall be myself on the  d of october i have for some time feared i should not have the pleasure of seeing you either in albemarle or orange from a general observation of the slowness of surgical cases however should mrs madison be well enough for you to come to orange i will call on you on my way to washington if i learn you are at home genl dearborne is here his motions depend on the stage accept for mrs m  yourself affectionate salutations p s i am afraid bowdoins journey to england will furnish a ground for pinckneys remaining at madrid i think he should be instructed to leave it immediately  bowdoin might as well perhaps delay going there till circumstances render it more necessary     thomas jefferson oct    0  washington james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss washington oct    0  dear sir —the only questions which press on the executive for decision are whether we shall enter into a provisional alliance with england to come into force only in the event that during the present war we become engaged in war with france leaving the declaration of the casus federis ultimately to us whether we shall send away yrujo casacalvo morales whether we shall instruct bowdoin not to go to madrid until further orders but we are all of opinion that the first of these questions is too important  too difficult to be decided but on the fullest consideration in which your aid and council should be waited for i sincerely regret the cause of your absence from this place and hope it will soon be removed but it is one of those contingencies from the effects of which even the march of public affairs cannot be exempt perhaps it would not be amiss to instruct bowdoin to await at london further orders because if we conclude afterwards that he should proceed this may follow the other instruction without delay      i am glad we did not intermeddle with armstrongs decision against the insurance companies i am told these companies have a great mixture of english subscribers if so the question becomes affected by the partnership what is become of our hermitage as you are in the neighborhood of butler i presume the claim upon us could be easily settled  apportioned present my respects to mrs madison  my prayers for her speedy  perfect reestablishment and accept yourself affectionate salutations     thomas jefferson october      0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss october      0  th j to mr gallatin i send for your perusal another letter of mr madison which i will ask the favor of you to return immediately with the one sent on saturday and on which it is necessary to act the war on the continent of europe appears now so certain and that peace is at least one year off that we are now placed at our ease in point of time we may make another effort for a peaceable accommodation with spain without the danger of being left alone to cope with both france and spain and even if we are driven to war it is now much more questionable than it was whether we had not better enter     into it without fettering ourselves with an alliance that we may be free to retire whenever our terms can be obtained peace cannot now be made in europe but by a general convention and that will take best part of a twelvemonth to arrange our question now is in what way to give spain another opportunity of arrangement is not paris the place france the agent the purchase of the floridas the means affectionate salutations thomas jefferson oct      0  washington wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas j mss washington oct      0  dear sir —immediately on my arrival here i examined my papers  found that i had delivered up to the treasury the copy of the judgment against robinsons administrators i took the first opportunity therefore of speaking to mr gallatin  desiring him to transmit it to you he did not recollect the receipt of it but promised to have it searched for from him therefore you will receive it it seems now certain there will be an extensive war on the continent of europe we shall avail ourselves of the time which this event gives us to bring spain peaceably to reason  i believe there is a way of doing it with dignity  effect should it even fail we shall still be in time to do ourselves justice if the case shall call for it this new state of things is the more fortunate in proportion as it would have been disagreeable to have proposed closer connections with england at a moment when so much just clamour exists against her for her

the senate  house of representatives of the u s of america at a moment when the nations of europe are in commotion  arming against each other when those     with whom we have principal intercourse are engaged in the general contest and when the countenance of some of them towards our peaceable country     threatens that even that may not be unaffected by what is passing on the general theatre a meeting of the representatives of the nation in both houses of     congress has become more than usually desirable coming from every section of our country they bring with them the sentiments  the information of the whole  will be enabled to give a direction to the     public affairs which the will  the wisdom of the whole will approve  support in taking a view of the state of our country we in the first place notice the late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times has     occasionally visited our shores providence in his goodness gave it an early termination on this occasion  lessened the number of victims which have usually fallen before it in the course of the several visitations by this disease it has appeared that it is strictly local incident to cities  on the tide waters only incommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease or by goods carried from diseased places that its access is with the autumn and it disappears with the early frosts these restrictions within narrow limits of time  space give security even to our maritime cities during three fourths of the year  to the country always altho from these facts it appears unnecessary yet to satisfy the fears of foreign nations  cautions on their part not to be complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them i have strictly enjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to certify with exact truth for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of health respecting this fever which prevailed at the place from which she sailed under every motive from character  duty to certify the truth i have no doubt they have faithfully executed this injunction much real injury has however been sustained from a propensity to identify with this endemic  to call by the same name fevers of very different kinds which have always been known at all times and in almost all countries  never have been placed among those deemed infectious contagious as we advance in our knolege of this disease as facts develop the source from which individuals receive it the state authorities charged     with the care of the public health  congress with that of the general commerce will become able to regulate with effect their respective functions in these departments the burthen of quarantines is at home as well as abroad the efficacy merits examination altho the health laws of the states should be found to need no present revisal by congress yet commerce claims that their attention be ever awake to them since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has considerably changed our coasts have been infested and our harbors blockaded watched by private armed vessels some of them without commissions some with legal commissions others with those of legal form but committing piratical acts beyond the authority of their commissions they have captured in the very entrance of our harbors as well as on the high seas not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade with us but our own also they have carried them off under pretence of legal adjudication but not daring to approach a court of justice they have plundered  sunk them by the way or in obscure places where no evidence could arise against them maltreating the crews  abandoning them in boats in the open sea or on desert shores without food or covering these enormities not appearing to be under the unreached by any control of their sovereigns i found it necessary to equip a force to cruise within our own seas to arrest all vessels of these descriptions found hovering on our coasts within the limits of the gulf stream and to bring the offenders in for trial as     pirates the rumor of such an armament most of them they disappeared from our coasts but they still carry on the same predatory practices in the neighboring seas the subsequent disappearance has relieved the navigation on our coasts the same system of hovering on our coasts  beleaguering our harbors under color of seeking enemies has been also carried on by public armed ships to the great annoyance and oppression of our commerce new principles too have been interpolated into the law of nations founded neither in justice nor the usage or acknolegement of nations which if pursued in practice prostrate the navigation of the neutral and make him merely subservient to the purposes of a belligerent according to these a belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its own enemy which it denies to a neutral on the ground of its aiding that enemy to carry on in the war but reason revolts at such an inconsistency and the neutral having equal right with the belligerent to decide the question the interest of our constituents and the duty of maintaining the authority of reason the only umpire between just nations impose on us the obligation of providing an effectual  determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to peaceable nations injurious to the rights of peaceable nations indeed the confidence we ought to have in the justice of others still countenances the hope we ought still to hope that the respect for justice which all people profess to entertain that a sounder view of those rights will of itself induce from every belligerent a more correct observance of them     with spain our negotiations for the settlement of differences have not had a satisfactory issue spoliations during the former war for which she had formally acknoleged herself responsible have been refused to be compensated but on conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them similar aggressions are now renewed  multiplied both in europe  america yet the same practices are renewed in the present war and are already of great amount on the mobile our commerce passing through that river continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties  vexatious searches propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries of louisiana have not been acceded to while however the right is unsettled we have avoided changing the state of things by taking new coasts or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories in the hope that the other power would not by a contrary conduct oblige us to meet their example and endanger conflicts of authority the issue of which may not be easily entirely controulled but in this hope too we have been disappointed now reason to lessen our confidence inroads have been recently made into the territories of orleans  the mississippi our citizens have been seized and their property plundered in the very parts of the former which had been actually delivered up by spain the imprisonment of our citizens  plundering their property and all this by the regular officers  souldiers of that government i have obliged me therefore found it necessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be in readiness to   0 give aid for the protection protect our citizens and to repel by arms any similar aggressions in future other particulars details necessary for your information of the state of things between this country  that shall be the subject of another communication in reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers the moderation the firmness  the wisdom of the legislature will all be called into action we ought still to hope that time  a more correct estimate of interests as well as of character will produce the justice we are bound to expect but should any nation deceive itself by false calculations and disappoint that expectation we must join in the unprofitable contest as unprofitable as it is immoral of trying which party can do the other the most harm some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy where that is competent it is always the most desirable we may suspend intercourse with nations which harass it by stem we may tax the commerce of the wrong doers to relieve the individuals wronged we may pass a navigation act adapted to our position  circumstances only avoiding to confound the just with the unjust but some of them are of a nature to be met by force only  all of them may lead to it i cannot therefore but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for the first object is to place our seaport towns out of the danger of insult i have already given orders measures have been already taken for furnishing them with a sufficient number of heavy cannon on travelling carriages for the service of such land batteries as may prevent     armed vessels from approaching or injuring them make a part of their defence against armed vessels approaching them in aid of these will be requisite it is desirable we should have a competent number of gunboats  the number to be competent must be considerable experience has proved their utility no longer doubtful and if immediately begun they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season whether it will be necessary to augment our land forces will probably be decided by occurrences probably in the course of your session in the meantime you will consider whether it would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as of war so to organize or class or marshall the militia as would enable us on any sudden emergency to call for the services of the younger portions unencumbered with the old and those burthened with having families upwards of three hundred thousand able bodied men between the ages of eighteen  twentysix years which the last census shews we may now count within our limits will furnish a competent number for offence or defence in any point where they may be wanted and will give time for raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall become certain and the reducing to the early period of life all its active service cannot but be desirable to our younger citizens of all times of the present an to come as well as future times inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced life age a quiet and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their families i cannot then but earnestly exhort you recommend to take under your earliest early     consideration the expediency of so modifying our militia system as by a separation of the more active from the inactive part from that which is less so we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for real and active service  to be called to it in regular rotation considerable provision has been made under former authorities from congress of materials for the construction of ships of war of    guns these materials are on hand subject to the further will of the legislature an immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms  ammunition is also submitted to your determination turning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong i congratulate you on the liberation of our fellow citizens who were stranded on the coast of tripoli  made prisoners of war in a government bottomed on the will of all the life  liberty of every individual citizen becomes interesting to all in the treaty therefore which has concluded our warfare with that state an article for the ransom of our citizens has been agreed to an operation by land in conjunction with the exbasha of an operation by land by a small band of our countrymen  others engaged for the occasion in conjunction with the troops of the exbasha of that country gallantly conducted by our late consul eaton and their successful enterprise on the important city of derne contributed doubtless to the impression which produced peace and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities of which the officers and men of our     squadron destined for tripoli would have availed themselves to emulate the acts of valour exhibited by their brethren in the attack of the last year reflecting with high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions permitted in the late mediterranean service i think it would be an useful encouragement to make an opening for some present promotion by enlarging our peace establishment of captains and lieutenants to the number of frigates which were retained for service by the act of   0  with tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently explained understood here but friendly explanations discussions with their ambassador recently arrived and a mutual disposition to do whatever is just  reasonable cannot fail of dissipating these so that we may consider our peace on that coast generally to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time still it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that sea the law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the number of frigates which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace and prescribes that they shall be manned by not more than twothirds of their complement of seamen  ordinary seamen whether a frigate may be trusted to twothirds only of its proper complement of men must depend on the nature of the service on which she is ordered she may sometimes for her safety so as to insure her object require her fullest complement in adverting to this subject congress will     perhaps consider whether the best limits on the executive discretion in this case would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the whole service rather than the number of vessels occasions oftener arise for the emploiment of small rather than of large vessels and it would lessen risk as well as expense to be authorized to employ them of preference the limits suggested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of vessels best adapted to the service our indian neighbors are advancing many of them with spirit  others beginning to engage in the pursuits of agriculture  household manufacture they are becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labor  more of certainty than the forest and find it their interest from time to time to dispose of parts of their surplus  waste lands for the means of improving those they occupy and of subsisting their families while they are preparing their farms since your last session the northern tribes have sold to us the lands between the connecticut reserve  the former indian boundary and those on the ohio from the same boundary to the rapids  for a considerable depth inland the chickasaws  cherokees have sold us their rights north of the tennessee from the ohio to the natchez road country between the two districts of and adjacent to the two districts of tennessee and the creeks the residue of their lands in the fork of ocmulgee up to the ulcofauhatche the three former purchases are important inasmuch as they consolidate disjoined parts of our settled country     and render their intercourse secure and the second particularly so as with the small point on the river which we expect is by this time ceded by the piankeshaws it completes our possession of the whole of both banks of the ohio from its source to near its mouth and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered forever safe in all its parts to our citizens settled  settling on its extensive waters the purchase from the creeks too has been for some time peculiarly interesting to the state of georgia the several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both houses of congress for the exercise of their respective functions deputations now on their way to the seat of government from various nations of indians inhabiting the missouri  other parts beyond the mississippi bring us come charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which they are placed with us of their dispositions to cultivate our peace  friendship  their desire to enter into commercial intercourse with us a state of our progress in exploring the principal rivers of that country  of the information respecting them hitherto received obtained will be communicated so soon as we shall receive some further particulars relations which we have reason shortly to expect the receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the  0th day of sep last have exceeded the sum of thirteen millions of dollars which with not quite five millions in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting other     demands to pay nearly two millions of the debt contracted under the british treaty and convention upwards of four millions of principal of the public debt  four millions of interest these paiments with those which had been made in three years and an half preceding have extinguished of the funded debt nearly eighteen millions of principal congress by their act of nov  0   0  authorized us to borrow    0000 dollars towards meeting the claims of our citizens assumed by the convention with france we have not however made use of this authority because the sum of four millions and an half which remained in the treasury on the same  0th day of sep last with the receipts which we may calculate on for the ensuing year besides paying the annual sum of eight millions of dollars appropriated to redeem the funded debt as fast as the original contracts permit  meeting all the current demands which may be expected will enable us to pay the whole sum of three millions seven hundred  fifty thousand dollars assumed by the french convention  still leave us a surplus of nearly a million of dollars at our free disposal should you concur in the provisions of arms  armed vessels recommended by the circumstances of the times this surplus will furnish the means of doing so  the duties composing the mediterranean fund will cease by the law which established them three     months after the ratification of a treaty of peace with the regency of tripoli the surplus already yielded by our permanent revenue renders unnecessary this addition to it it might perhaps be thought improvident to discontinue taxes at a moment when we may want these  more for the purposes of war but if we never discontinue taxes while there is a cloud of war visible in our horizon all taxes will become perpetual if war is to come upon us we must meet it with system into which this fragment of duty could enter for little or nothing whenever war supervenes it will be the war of our constituents which forced on them by the injustice of other nations we need not fear they will be wanting to their own interests  safety considering however that the mediterranean fund is levied on luxuries used chiefly by the rich and that we have an impost on salt which falls more heavily on the poor  especially on the farmer i recommend to your consideration whether it would not be better to commute these duties not materially different in amount by consolidating the mediterranean with the general fund  suppressing instead of that the duty on salt on this first occasion of addressing congress since by the choice of my constituents i have entered on a second term of administration i embrace the opportunity to give this public assurance that i will exert my best endeavours to administer faithfully the executive department  will zealously cooperate with you in every measure which may tend to secure the liberty property  personal safety of our fellowcitizens      to consolidate the republican forms  principles of our government in the course of your session you shall receive all the aid which i can give for the despatch of the public business and all the information necessary for your deliberations of which the interests of our own country  the confidence reposed in us by others will admit a communication thomas jefferson dec     0  confidential message on spain   j mss dec     0  to the senate  house of representatives of the u s the depredations which had been committed on the commerce of the u s during a preceding war by persons under the authority of spain are sufficiently known to all these made it a duty to require from that government indemnifications for our injured citizens a convention was accordingly     entered into between the minister of the u s at madrid  the minister of that government for foreign affairs by which it was agreed that spoliations  00 committed by spanish subjects  carried into ports of spain should be paid for by that nation  that those committed by french subjects  carried into  0  spanish ports should remain for further discussion before this convention was returned to spain with our ratification the transfer of louisiana by france  0  to the u s took place an event as unexpected as disagreeable to spain from that moment she seemed to change her conduct  dispositions towards us it was first manifested by her protest against the right of france to alienate louisiana to us which however was soon retracted and the right confirmed then high offence was manifested at the act of congress establishing a collection district on the mobile altho by an authentic declaration immediately made it was expressly confined to our acknoleged limits and she now refused to ratify the convention signed by her own minister under the eye of his sovereign unless we would relinquish all consent to alterations of its terms which would have affected our claims against her for the spoliations by french subjects carried into spanish ports to obtain justice as well as to restore friendship i thought a special mission advisable  accordingly appointed james monroe minister extraordinary  plenipotentiary to repair to madrid  in conjunction with our minister resident there to endeavour to procure a ratification of the former convention  to come to an understanding with spain as to the boundaries of louisiana it appeared at once that her policy was to reserve herself for events  in the meantime to avoid all explanations and engagements to keep our differences in an undetermined state this will be evident from the papers now communicated to you after yielding to their delays until their object could no longer be doubted nearly five months of fruitless endeavor to bring them to some definite accommodation and satisfactory result  0  our ministers ended the conferences without having been able to obtain indemnity for spoliations of any description or any satisfaction as to the boundaries of louisiana other than a declaration on their part that we had no rights eastward of the iberville and that our line to the west was one which would have left us but a string of land on that bank of the river mississippi our injured citizens were thus left without any prospect of retribution from the wrongdoer  as to the boundary each party was to take its own course that which they have chosen to pursue will appear from the documents now communicated they authorize the inference that it is their intention to advance on our possessions until they shall be repressed by an opposing force considering that congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war i have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any degree which could be avoided i have barely instructed the officers stationed in the neighborhood of the aggressions to protect our citizens from violence to patrol within the borders actually delivered to us  not to go out of them but when necessary to repel an inroad or to rescue a citizen or his property and the spanish officers remaining at new orleans are required to depart without further delay it ought to be noted here that since the late change in the state of affairs in europe spain has ordered her cruisers  courts to respect our treaty with her the conduct of france  the part she may take  0  in the misunderstandings between the u s  spain are too important to be unconsidered she was prompt and decided in her declarations that our demands on spain for french spoliations carried into spanish ports were included in the settlement between the u s and france she took at once the ground that she had acquired no right from spain  had meant to deliver us none eastward of the iberville her silence as to the western boundary leaving us to infer her opinion in favor of our claims to the rio bravo  we know that her commissary had orders to require possession to that river might be against spain in that quarter whatever direction she might mean to give to these differences it does not appear that is sufficient reason to believe i am satisfied she has not contemplated their proceeding to actual rupture or that at the date of our last advices from paris her government had any suspicion of a hostile attitude spain had taken here on the contrary we are without a doubt have reason to believe that she was disposed to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what our ministers had proposed  so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the grounds of future misunderstanding collision  controversy on the eastern as well as western side of the mississippi the present crisis in europe is favorable for pressing such a settlement  not a moment should be lost in availing ourselves of it should it pass unimproved our situation would become much more difficult formal war is not necessary it is not probable it will follow but the protection of our  0  citizens the spirit and honor of our country require that force should be interposed to a certain degree it will probably contribute to advance the object of peace but the course to be pursued will require the command of means which it belongs to congress exclusively to yield or to deny to them i communicate every fact material for their information  the documents necessary to enable them to judge for themselves to their wisdom then i look for the course i am to take and will pursue with sincere zeal that which they shall approve thomas jefferson dec    0  washington j p reibelt to j p reibelt j mss washington dec    0  sir —during the sitting of the legislature  especially at its commencement it is rare that i can find a moment for my private correspondence hence my tardiness in acknoleging the receipt of your favors of the  d   th    th i had often thought on the subject you propose as to the mode of procuring german emigrants to take the place of our blacks to this however the state legislatures are alone competent the general government possessing no powers but those enumerated in the constitution and that of obtaining emigrants at the general expense not being one of the enumerated powers with respect to the state governments i not only doubt but despair of their taking up this operation till some strong pressure of circumstance shall force it on them the same may be said as to  0  the merino sheep congress could not by our constitution give one dollar for all in spain because that kind of

received your letter of dec    wherein on behalf of a committee of the senate charged to inquire concerning the characters and     qualifications of peter walsh joseph deville bellechasse  others for the offices to which they are nominated you desire that i will cause to be laid before them the proper information on the subject it is with real pain that i feel a difficulty in complying with the desires of a committee for whom i have the most unqualified respect my nominations are sometimes made on my own knolege of the persons sometimes on the information of others given either voluntarily or at my request  in personal confidence to me this i could not communicate without a breach of confidence not i am sure under the contemplation of the committee they are sensible the constitution has made it my duty to nominate and has not made it my duty to lay before them the evidences or reasons whereon my nominations are founded  of the correctness of this opinion the established usage in the intercourse between the senate  president is a proof during nearly the whole of the time this constitution has been in operation i have been in situations of intimacy with this part of it  may observe from my own knolege that it has not been the usage for the president to lay before the senate or a committee the information on which he makes his nominations in a single instance lately i did make a communication of papers but there were circumstances so peculiar in that case as to distinguish it from all others to this i must further add that a just solicitude to cover from all hazard that cordial good will which it is so vitally interesting to our country should ever     subsist between its highest functionaries has led the two houses as far as can be collected from their practice to reserve to their own discretion alone to decide what official applications on their part shall be made to the president directly it does not appear that that authority has been yielded to a committee thomas jefferson jan     0  henry a dearborn to the secretary at war henry a dearborn j mss jan     0  dear sir —colo hawkins has just put into my hands the papers respecting the claim of the creek nation on behalf of emantlau thlucco from whom two horses were stolen within the indian limits by harris  allen citizens of the u s the former of whom has fled out of the u s leaving no property  the other is dead insolvent he communicated to me also the attorney generals opinion on the case this case being of importance as a precedent i have considered it maturely under the law the treaty  the principles which prevail between independent nations the creeks being in law as well as in fact an independent nation the opinion of the atty genl is unquestionable considering the case as it relates to the offending individuals the laws have reserved to all our citizens charged within our jurisdiction with any crime or misdemeanor wheresoever committed a right of being tried by a jury before a court of competent authority before they can be punished   0 whether prosecuted capitally or for the penalty of double value the sentence of a court could alone subject them to evil accordingly the   th § of the act of congress provides explicitly how where the offender may be tried convicted  punished and evidently confines its views to the proceedings against the citizen solely but when death flight insolvency or other accident puts the offender out of the way it then becomes a question between nation  nation between whom the municipal laws of evidence of either can have no bearing on the other the same law therefore in its  th § only declares that if the offender be unable to pay for the property he has taken from an indian the u s shall pay without saying where the fact shall be tried or on what evidence and in its   th § enacts that if an indian shall take property within our limits the superintendent being furnished with the necessary documents  proofs shall demand satisfaction from the indian nation without specifying that these must be such documents  proofs as would be required by our municipal law to which the indian nation is not at all subject the proofs then of course are to be such as are usually resorted to between nation  nation that is to say public documents depositions affidavits certificates letters parol evidence or even common report all of these are freely adduced between nations each of them is weighed in the scales of reason  experience and according to the aggregate impression they make on the common sense of mankind they are estimated in determining the belief or disbelief of the fact     neither party thinks of calling the other to a trial of the fact in a court of its own where it would be both party and judge the constitutional organs for foreign relations of the two nations compose jointly the competent tribunal the instruction therefore given originally by a preceding executive to the agent for indian affairs appears to have been well weighed when it directs him to ascertain by the best evidence in his power the value of the property taken and of course authorizes him to receive as well the testimony of red men given in what they deem the most solemn manner as such other evidence as can be obtained and may be of any weight in the common judgment of mankind towards producing a belief or disbelief of the fact in question this is the only practical construction which can be given of the act of congress which never could be carried into execution in this part if a strict conformity with our municipal laws were requisite because such evidence as is required by our courts of justice between citizen and citizen could never be had in the cases now under consideration the law therefore wisely and justly avoids specifying the evidence and leaves the fact to be settled agreeably to the usage of nations here then the creeks affirm that property has been taken from one of their nation that this cannot be recovered in our courts of justice by the individual injured because one offender is dead the other fled  no property of either existing  the law says if the offender is unable paiment shall be made out of the treasury of the u s the superintendent therefore according     to his instructions is to ascertain the fact affirmed by the creeks by the best evidence in his power and make report of the same  of the case to the department of war that justice may be done i do not see any cause for changing the course of proceeding so established but on the contrary i believe it to be right  lawful  that it ought to be pursued in this instance thomas jefferson jan      0  washington william a burwell to william a burwell j mss washington jan      0  dear sir —your favor of

send one to each of you in separate packages by this post you will have seen an account in all the papers with so many details as to make one forget for a moment that they never utter a truth of our affairs being entirely made up with spain there is not one word of truth in it if we may judge from mr pinckneys silence in a letter dated the day before he left madrid i may say further it is impossible it should be true congress are not unanimous in the spanish business they act in it however by a strong majority when our affairs with england come on there will be much greater  more irreconcilable differences of opinion the classification of the militia has been reported against by a committee but if any judgment can be     formed from individual conversations it will be established if it is we need never raise a regular in expectation of war a militia of young men will hold on until regulars can be raised  will be the nursery which will furnish them i had rather have that classification established than any number of regulars which could be voted at this time we are told you are to come to congress in the meantime your berth here stands in statu quo i shall always be glad to hear from you and to give you every assurance of my constant affection accept with it that of my respect  esteem thomas jefferson january      0  special message on neutral commerce january      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— in my message to both houses of congress at the opening of their present session i submitted to their attention among other subjects the oppression of our commerce and navigation by the irregular practices of armed vessels public and private and by the introduction of new principles derogatory of the rights of neutrals and unacknowledged by the usage of nations the memorials of several bodies of merchants of the united states are now communicated and will develop these principles and practices which are producing the most ruinous effects on our lawful commerce and navigation     the rights of a neutral to carry on a commercial intercourse with every part of the dominions of a belligerent permitted by the laws of the country with the exception of blockaded ports and contraband of war was believed to have been decided between great britain and the united states by the sentence of the commissioners mutually appointed to decide on that and other questions of difference between the two nations and by the actual payment of damages awarded by them against great britain for the infractions of that right when therefore it was perceived that the same principle was revived with others more novel and extending the injury instructions were given to the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at the court of london and remonstrances duly made by him on this subject as will appear by documents transmitted herewith these were followed by a partial and temporary suspension only without any disavowal of the principle he has therefore been instructed to urge this subject anew to bring it more fully to the bar of reason and to insist on the rights too evident and too important to be surrendered in the meantime the evil is proceeding under adjudications founded on the principle which is denied under these circumstances the subject presents itself for the consideration of congress on the impressment of our seamen our remonstrances have never been intermitted a hope existed at one moment of an arrangement which might have been submitted to but it soon passed away and the practice though relaxed at times in the     distant seas has been constantly pursued in those in our neighborhood the grounds on which the reclamations on this subject have been urged will appear in an extract from instructions to our minister at london now communicated thomas jefferson jan    0  washington james ogilvie to james ogilvie j mss washington jan    0  dear sir —your favor of the   th came to hand yesterday i had

goes round that room the presses not having sufficed to contain the whole the latter part of polygraphics was put into the kind of closet at the first entrance of the bookroom as after using a book you may be at a loss in returning it to its exact place  they cannot be found again when misplaced it will be better to leave them on a table in the room my familiarity with their places will enable

and it seems most imminent you probably could take no part as before the receipt of your powers on the subject of your lands i had ordered a survey of the vacant parcel adjoining to new orleans i have continued to press that part of the location because it is under a peculiar difficulty the law requires your locations to be in parcels of not less than  000 acres each the survey sent to me made but

establishment of a national academy  university at the city of washington with such alterations as we talked over the last night they are chiefly verbal i have often wished we could have a philosophical society or academy so organized as that while the central academy should be at the seat of government its members dispersed over the states should constitute filiated academies in each state publish their communications from which the central academy should select unpublished what should be most choice in this way all the members wheresoever dispersed might be brought into action and an     useful emulation might arise between the filiated societies perhaps the great societies now existing might incorporate themselves in this way with the national one but time does not allow me to pursue this idea nor perhaps had we time at all to get it into the present bill i procured an agricultural society to be established voluntarily on this plan but it has done nothing friendly

agreed i the ready money as a  st proposition not to be paid till possession of the whole country ceded is delivered  evacuated but in ultimato to be paid on putting into our hands orders for an absolute delivery of the government to us on sight of the order an evacuation of the country by all troops in the same instant  the departure of all officers  agents within   months after ii the residuary sum to be a fund for paying claimants under the convention either to be settled by a commission in which case any surplus will belong to spain  any defect be supplied by her or which would be far preferable that residuum to     be left with us for the sufferers we exonerating spain from all further demands on their part but in ultimato the residuary sum to be paid to spain by bills on the treasury in annual instalments if that can be obtained or by stock to be created if insisted on  a fixed sum of     or   millions to be immediately paid by colonial bills to the u s who on receipt of the money exonerates spain from all further demands from the claimants under the convention if the sum to be allowed by spain for spoliations be retained by us out of the residuary price  be less than that residuum the difference to be paid to her by bills on our treasury at the end of one year perhaps the above ideas may aid you in framing your instructions they are hazarded with that view

considered as a decision of the main question when they come to details the votes will vary ad libitum i have never seen a h of representatives more solidly united in doing what they believed to be the best for the public     interest there can be no better proof than the fact that so eminent a leader should at once  almost unanimously be abandoned health  affection p s on further inquiry i find that all nicholsons resolutions were passed yesterday were reported  confirmed by the house  referred to a commee to bring in a bill it will be during the progress of the bill that the details will be discussed do not wonder if a third person be added to your commission thomas jefferson march  0   0  special message on spanish boundaries   j mss march  0   0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states it was reasonably expected that while the limits between the territories of the united states and of     spain were unsettled neither party would have innovated on the existing state of their respective positions some time since however we learned that the spanish authorities were advancing into the disputed country to occupy new posts and make new settlements unwilling to take any measures which might preclude a peaceable accommodation of differences the officers of the united states were ordered to confine themselves within the country on this side of the sabine river which by the delivery of its principal post natchitoches was understood to have been itself delivered up by spain and at the same time to permit no adverse post to be taken nor armed men to remain within it in consequence of these orders the commanding officer of natchitoches learning that a party of spanish troops had crossed the sabine river and were posting themselves on this side the adais sent a detachment of his force to require them to withdraw to the other side of the sabine which they accordingly did   0 i have thought it proper to communicate to congress the letters detailing this incident that they may fully understand the state of things in that quarter and be enabled to make such provision for its security as in their wisdom they shall deem sufficient thomas jefferson march    0  washington william duane to william duane j mss washington march    0  i thank you my good sir cordially for your letter of the    which however i did not receive till the  0th it is a proof of sincerity which i value above all things as between those who practise it falsehood  malice work their efforts in vain there is an enemy somewhere endeavoring to sow discord among us instead of listening first then doubting  lastly believing anile tales handed round without an atom of evidence if my friends will address themselves to me directly as you have done they shall be informed with frankness and thankfulness there is not a truth on earth which i fear or would disguise but secret slanders cannot be disarmed because they are secret although you desire no answer i shall give you one to those articles admitting a short answer reserving those which require more explanation than the compass of a letter admits to conversation on your arrival here and as i write this for your personal satisfaction i rely that my letter will under no circumstances be communicated to any mortal because you well know how every syllable from me is distorted by the ingenuity of my political enemies     in the  st place then i have had less communication directly or indirectly with the republicans of the east this session than i ever had before this has proceeded from accidental circumstances not from design and if there be any coolness between those of the south  myself it has not been from me towards them certainly there has been no other reserve than to avoid taking part in the divisions among our friends that mr r has openly attacked the administration is sufficiently known we were not disposed to join in league with britain under any belief that she is fighting for the liberties of mankind  to enter into war with spain  consequently france the h of repr were in the same sentiment when they rejected mr rs resolutions for raising a body of regular troops for the western service we are for a peaceable accommodation with all those nations if it can be effected honorably this perhaps is not the only ground of his alienation but which side retains its orthodoxy the vote of    to    republicans may satisfy you but you will better satisfy yourself on coming here where alone the true state of things can be known and where you will see republicanism as solidly embodied on all essential points as you ever saw it on any occasion that there is only one minister who is not opposed to me is totally unfounded there never was a more harmonious a more cordial administration nor ever a moment when it has been otherwise and while differences of opinion have been always rare among us i can affirm that as to present matters     there was not a single paragraph in my message to congress or those supplementary to it in which there was not an unanimity of concurrence in the members of the administration the fact is that in ordinary affairs every head of a department consults me on those of his department  where anything arises too difficult or important to be decided between us the consultation becomes general that there is an ostensible cabinet and a concealed one a public profession  concealed counteraction is false that i have denounced republicans by the epithet of jacobins and declared i would appoint none but those called moderates of both parties  that i have avowed or entertain any predilection for those called the third party or quids is in every tittle of it false that the expedition of miranda was countenanced by me is an absolute falsehood let it have gone from whom it might  i am satisfied it is equally so as to mr madison to know as much of it as we could was our duty but not to encourage it our situation is difficult  whatever we do is liable to the criticisms of those who wish to represent it awry if we recommend measures in a public message it may be said that members are not sent here to obey the mandates of the president or to register the edicts of a sovereign if we express opinions in conversation we have then our charles jenkinsons  backdoor counsellors if we say nothing we have no opinions no plans no cabinet in truth it is the fable of the old man his son  ass over again     these are short facts which may suffice to inspire you with caution until you can come here  examine for yourself no other information can give you a true insight into the state of things but you will have no difficulty in understanding them when on the spot in the meantime accept my friendly salutations  cordial good wishes thomas jefferson mar      0  washington wilson cary nicholas to wilson cary nicholas confidential j mss washington mar      0  dear sir —a last effort at friendly settlement with spain is proposed to be made at paris and under the auspices of france for this purpose genl armstrong  mr bowdoin both now at paris have been appointed joint comrs but such a cloud of dissatisfaction rests on genl armstrong in the minds of many persons on account of a late occurrence stated in all the public papers that we have in contemplation to add a  d commissioner in order to give the necessary measure of public confidence to the commission of these two gentlemen one being of massachusetts  one of n york it is thought the  d should be a southern man  the rather as the interests to be negociated are almost entirely southern  western this addition is not yet ultimately decided on but i am inclined to believe it will be adopted under this expectation  my wish that you may be willing to undertake it i give you the earliest possible intimation of it that you may be preparing both your mind  your measures     for the mission the departure would be required to be very prompt tho the absence i think will not be long bonaparte not being in the practice of procrastination this particular considern will i hope reconcile the voyage to your affairs  your feelings the allowance to an extra mission is salary from the day of leaving home  expenses to the place of destination or in lieu of the latter  to avoid settlements a competent fixed sum may be given for the return a continuance of the salary for three months after fulfilment of the commission be so good as to make up your mind as quickly as possible  to answer me as early as possible consider the measure as

on their way to natchez the  00 horse were really but  0 who retired without opposition on capt turners requisition the official reports of majr porter  capt turner assured us of these facts some unexpected occurrences have lately taken place here the separation of a member of great talents  weight from the present course of things scattered dismay for a     time among those who had been used to see him with them a little time however enabled them to rally to their own principles  to resume their track under the guidance of their own good sense as long as we pursue without deviation the principles we have always professed i have no fear of deviation from them in the main body of republicans here everything is understood  nothing apprehended but protraction of debate it will take more time for the public mind to understand the true state of things but i have no fear that in a little time they will settle down with a correct view of them accept my affectionate salutations

your favor of mar    with france we have no difference no subject of negotiation our differences are with spain  england with the former we are making a last effort at peaceable accommodation the subject is merely a settlement of the limits of louisiana  our right of passing down the rivers of florida this negotiation is to be held at paris where we may have the benefit of the good offices of france but she will be no party to the contract mr bowdoin our minister to spain being now at paris  armstrong there of course the full powers have been sent to them for that reason it has not been in contemplation to look for any other     hand lately indeed it has been pressed that these gentlemen being from the middle  northern divisions of the country  the interest to be arranged being merely a geographical one exclusively concerning the southern  western states some person of that geographical position ought to be added whose knowledge of the subject  interest in it would give security  confidence to the southern  western states that it will be pursued with knowledge  zeal should this opinion prevail the  d commissioner must of course be selected geographically with respect to the rights of neutrality we have certainly a great interest in their settlement but this depends exclusively on the will of two characters buonaparte  alexander the dispositions of the former to have them placed on liberal grounds are known the interest of the latter should insure the same disposition the only thing to be done is to bring the two characters together to treat on the subject all the minor maritime powers of europe will of course concur with them we have not failed to use such means as we possess to induce these two sovereigns to avail the world of its present situation to declare and enforce the laws of nature  convenience on the seas but the organization of the treaty making power by our constitution is too particular for us to commit the nation in so great an operation with all the european powers with such a federal phalanx in the senate compact  vigilant for opportunities to do mischief the addition of a very few other votes misled by accidental or imperfect views of the subject would suffice to commit us most     dangerously all we can do therefore is to encourage others to declare  guarantee neutral rights by excluding all intercourse with any nation which infringes them  so leave a niche in their compact for us if our treaty making power shall chuse to occupy it from these views you will perceive that geographical  accidental circumstances have designated our commissioners and that we cannot derive from your agency on this occasion the benefits you have heretofore rendered in a different line with england i flatter myself our difficulties will be dissipated by the disasters of her allies the change of her ministry and the measures which congress are likely to adopt to furnish motives for her becoming just to us and on the whole i cannot but hope that in the general settlement of the affairs of nations now on the tapis ours also will be satisfactorily settled so as to ensure to us those years of peace  prosperity which will place us beyond the reach of european wrongdoers accept my friendly salutations  assurances of esteem  respect thomas jefferson mar    0  washington nathaniel macon to nathaniel macon j mss washington

satisfaction i have received from your letter of aug  0   0  and embrace the opportunity it affords of giving expression to the sincere respect and veneration i entertain for your character it will be among the latest and most soothing comforts of my life to have seen advanced to the government of so extensive a portion of the earth and at so early a period of his life a sovereign whose ruling passion is the advancement of the happiness and prosperity of his people and not of his own people only but who can extend his eye and his good will to a distant and infant nation unoffending in its course unambitious in its views the events of europe come to us so late and so suspiciously that observations on them would certainly be stale and possibly wide of their actual state from their general aspect however i collect that your majestys interposition in them has been   0 disinterested and generous and having in view only the general good of the great european family when you shall proceed to the pacification which is to reestablish peace and commerce the same dispositions of mind will lead you to think of the general intercourse of nations and to make that provision for its future maintenance which in times past it has so much needed the northern nations of europe at the head of which your majesty is distinguished are habitually peaceable the united states of america like them are attached to peace we have then with them a common interest in the neutral rights every nation indeed on the continent of europe belligerent as well as neutral is interested in maintaining these rights in liberalizing them progressively with the progress of science and refinement of morality and in relieving them from restrictions which the extension of the arts has long since rendered unreasonable and vexatious two personages in europe of which your majesty is one have it in their power at the approaching pacification to render eminent service to nations in general by incorporating into the act of pacification a correct definition of the rights of neutrals on the high seas such a definition declared by all the powers lately or still belligerent would give to those rights a precision and notoriety and cover them with an authority which would protect them in an important degree against future violation and should any further sanction be necessary that of an exclusion of the violating nation from commercial intercourse with all the others would be preferred to     war as more analogous to the offence more easy and likely to be executed with good faith the essential articles of these rights too are so few and simple as easily to be defined having taken no part in the past or existing troubles of europe we have no part to act in its pacification but as principles may then be settled in which we have a deep interest it is a great happiness for us that they are placed under the protection of an umpire who looking beyond the narrow bounds of an individual nation will take under the cover of his equity the rights of the absent and unrepresented it is only by a happy concurrence of good characters and good occasions that a step can now and then be taken to advance the wellbeing of nations if the present occasion be good i am sure your majestys character will not be wanting to avail the world of it by monuments of such good offices may your life become an epoch in the history of the condition of man and may he who called it into being for the good of the human family give it length of days and success and have it always in his holy

secretary of the navy who will give it just consideration whenever a vacancy in the body of midshipmen     occurs if anything can be done he will give notice of it congress have just closed a long  uneasy session in which they had great difficulties external  internal to encounter with respect to the exbasha of tripoli  many other more important matters such a spirit of dissension existed  such misrepresentations of fact that it will be difficult for the public to come at truth the change in the british ministry  the events of europe will i think insure a friendly settlement with her whether we shall obtain the same from france  spain is more doubtful at the beginning of the session it was in our power but if passion should there be opposed to passion here the issue may become serious and if peace takes place in europe immediately a great obstacle to the indulgence of passion will be withdrawn should the war however continue another year cool sober sense on both sides may befriend both unexpected  strange phænomena in the early part of the session produced a momentary dismay within the walls of the house of r however the body of republicans soon discovered their true situation rallied to their own principles and moved on towards their object in a solid phalanx in so much that the session did most of the good which was in their power  did it well republicanism may perhaps have lost a few of its anomalous members but the steadiness of its great mass has considerably increased on the whole my confidence in the solidity  permanence of our government accept my friendly salutations  assurances of constant esteem  respect     thomas jefferson ap    0  washington william charles coles claiborne to william charles coles claiborne j mss washington ap    0  dear sir —this letter is confidential but not official it is meant to give you a general idea of our views as to n orleans of which you will receive the particulars from the secretary at war whose instructions nothing here said is meant to controul should they vary in any particular at the meeting of congress i recommended an arrangement of our militia which by giving us a selection of the younger part of it would have enabled us if necessary to have sent a very efficient support to n orleans a diversity of ideas however among the members arising from partialities to local systems defeated that then we endeavored to encourage settlers west of the missipi by a bounty of land conditioned to serve there   years as regulars if called on this also failed congress having closed their session the means furnished for the support of n o have at length assumed their definitive shape and i believe are adequate to the present state  prospect of things according to our last dispatches from spain that government shews such pacific dispositions that if any hostilities take place in your quarter they will certainly not be by order of that government but will be merely the effect of the passions  interests of her officers were spain disposed she could send no troops across the atlantic at havanna she is so far from having any to spare that she is obliged to use militia for ordinary garrison duty at pensacola  mobille she has about  00 men at baton rouge about   0 these are all we know of which     she could bring to attack you what force she has in mexico we know not the means of defence to be immediately furnished you will be as follows   three gunboats will immediately proceed from the atlantic border to lake pontchartrain   bombvessels being the only vessels we have in readiness here at this moment will proceed to the missipi to remain until relieved by   gunboats either of those directly expected from the mediterranean or of those built on the ohio whichever shall first be in place these   gunboats we consider as sufficient to secure all the water approaches to n orleans against any force we have a right to suppose can be brought against it under present circumstances   we propose immediately to prepare block houses pickets c on the defiles leading by land to the city particularly on the road from mashac  on the approaches from the lakes it is thought best on account of their health not to bring the troops into the island but to keep them in the nearest healthy situations from which they can repair to the city on very short notice   00 including those now in the city will be so placed we presume you can raise about   00 of militia and seamen on an emergency to be depended on and that these behind their defensive works while the gunboats guard the water communications will secure the city effectually   the militia of tombigbee  natchez will be ordered to be immediately put into a state of organization  readiness so that should the garrisons of pensacola mobile  baton rouge be drawn off to attack you the respective militias may seize     on these posts  close in the rear of the attackers to cut off their retreat i have said that this letter is confidential because our means ought not to be known to the spaniards until they are seen it will therefore be proper to prepare your militia with diligence yet under the profession of ordinary precaution only an engineer will be immediately sent forward to plan  execute the works congress has voted a sufficient sum of money for our postal but to avoid giving new irritation to spain it has confined its expenditure to within the   st degree we are therefore obliged to relinquish for the present the road from fort stoddert direct to the mouth of pearl  to go from fort stoddert to pinckneyville keeping above the line this is sorely against my will  will continue no longer than necessity requires as the road thus proposed will soon strike the pascagola we think to use that river for the present in our communications between n o and fort stoddert we expect that one of the gunboats of the lakes can ascend above the line this is done because we wish to avoid collision with the spanish authorities as much as possible till we can hear from paris  judge of the turn things will take there i have lately seen a letter from mr duplantier to mr madison and am much pleased with his zeal in the interest of m de lafayette congress has permitted lots to be taken for him as low as  00 acres this secures to us the parcel on the canal of carondelet but at the same time cuts off those smaller locations proposed by mr duplantier indeed it would not be for the interest of the general to let his     claim get into collision with any public interest were it to lose its popularity it might excite an opposition neither agreeable to his feelings nor interests i promised a mr reibelt to speak to you of him he is a swiss by birth a strong republican in principle was in favor of the french directory and is i think a very honest man and certainly a man of great literary information having a family  under some difficulties as to property which he says he has in europe he has accepted the care of the indian factory at natchitoches where i think his philanthropy will recommend him to the attachment of the indians it is in compliance with his request to be made known to you that i mention these things i thank you for a bag of peccans lately received from you if you could think of me in the autumn when they are fresh they will always be very acceptable partly to plant partly for table use i observe a motion in your legislature to desire me to chuse a fifth counsellor out of the  0 before nominated this being against law cannot be done i hope therefore they will have nominated two as the law requires accept my friendly salutations  assurances of esteem  respect thomas jefferson may     0  draft of proclamation concerning leander j mss may     0  whereas

pursuing his lawful vocations within the same waters  jurisdiction of the u s and near to their shores  that the sd henry whitby cannot be brought to justice by the ordinary process of law and whereas it does further appear that both before  after the said day sundry trespasses wrongs  unlawful interruptions  vexations on trading vessels coming to the u s and within their waters  vicinity were committed by the sd armed vessel the leander her officers  people by one other armed vessel called the cambrian commanded by her officers and people and by one other armed vessel called the driver commanded by her officers  people which vessels being all of the same nation were aiding  assisting to each other in the trespasses interruptions  vexations aforesaid now therefore to the end that the sd henry whitby may be brought to justice  due punishment inflicted for the sd murder i do hereby especially enjoin  require all officers having authority civil or military and all other persons within the limits or jurisdiction of the u s wheresoever the said henry whitby may be found now or hereafter to apprehend  secure the said henry whitby  him safely  diligently to deliver to the civil

  0  dear sir —i wrote you on the   th of march by a common vessel  then expected to have had on the rising of congress an opportunity of peculiar confidence to you mr beckley then supposed he should take a flying trip to london on private business but i believe he does not find it convenient he could have let you into the arcana rerum which you have interests in knowing mr pinckneys pursuits having been confined to his peculiar line he has only that general knowledge of what has passed here which the public possess he has a just view of things so far as known to him our old friend mercer broke off from us some time ago at first professing to disdain joining the federalists yet from the habit of voting together becoming soon   0 identified with them without carrying over with him one single person he is now in a state of as perfect obscurity as if his name had never been known mr j randolph is in the same track and will end in the same way his course has excited considerable alarm timid men consider it as a proof of the weakness of our government  that it is to be rent into pieces by demagogues  to end in anarchy i survey the scene with a different eye and draw a different augury from it in a house of representatives of a great mass of good sense mr rs popular eloquence gave him such advantages as to place him unrivalled as the leader of the house and altho not conciliatory to those whom he led principles of duty  patriotism induced many of them to swallow the humiliations he subjected them to and to vote as was right as long as he kept the path of right himself the sudden defection of such a man could not but produce a momentary astonishment  even dismay but for a moment only the good sense of the house rallied around its principles  without any leader pursued steadily the business of the session did it well  by a strength of vote which has never before been seen upon all trying questions exclusive of the federalists the minority of republicans voting with him has been from   to   or   against from  0 to  00 and altho he yet treats the federalists with ineffable contempt yet having declared eternal opposition to this administration  consequently associated with them in his votes he will like mercer end with them the augury i draw from this is that there is a steady good sense     in the legislature and in the body of the nation joined with good intentions which will lead them to discern  to pursue the public good under all circumstances which can arise and that no ignis fatuus will be able to lead them long astray in the present case the public sentiment as far as declarations of it have yet come in is without a single exception in firm adherence to the administration one popular paper is endeavoring to maintain equivocal ground approving the administration in all its proceedings  mr r in all those which have heretofore merited approbation carefully avoiding to mention his late aberrations the ultimate view of this paper is friendly to you  the editor with more judgement than him who assumes to be at the head of your friends sees that the ground of opposition to the administration is not that on which it would be advantageous to you to be planted the great body of your friends are among the firmest adherents to the administration and in their support of you will suffer mr r to have no communications with them my former letter told you the line which both duty  inclination would lead me sacredly to pursue but it is unfortunate for you to be embarrassed with such a soidisant friend you must not commit yourself to him these views may assist you to understand such details as mr pinckney will give you if you are here at any time before the fall it will be in time for any object you may have and by that time the public sentiment will be more decisively declared i wish you were here at present to take your choice of the two     governments of orleans  louisiana in either of which i could now place you and i verily believe it would be to your advantage to be just that much withdrawn from the focus of the ensuing contest until its event should be known the one has a salary of  000 d the other of  000 d both with excellent hotels for the governor the latter at st louis where there is good society both french  american a healthy climate  the finest field in the u s for acquiring property the former not unhealthy if you begin a residence there in the month of november the mrs trists  their connections are established there as i think you can within   months inform me what you say to this i will keep things in their present state till the last day of august for your answer the late change in the ministry i consider as insuring us a just settlement of our differences and we ask no more in mr fox personally i have more confidence than in any man in england  it is founded in what through unquestionable channels i have had opportunities of knowing of his honesty  his good sense while he shall be in the administration my reliance on that government will be solid we had committed ourselves in a line of proceedings adapted to meet mr pitts policy  hostility before we heard of his death which selfrespect did not permit us to abandon afterwards and the late unparalleled outrage on us at new york excited such sentiments in the public at large as did not permit us to do less than has been done it ought not to be viewed by the ministry as looking towards them at     all but merely as the consequences of the measures of their predecessors which their nation has called on them to correct i hope therefore they will come to just arrangements no two countries upon earth have so many points of common interest  friendship  their rulers must be great bunglers indeed if with such dispositions they break them asunder the only rivality that can arise is on the ocean england may by petty larceny thwartings check us on that element a little but nothing she can do will retard us there one years growth we shall be supported there by other nations  thrown into their scale to make a part of the great counterpoise to her navy if on the other hand she is just to us conciliatory and encourages the sentiment of family feelings  conduct it cannot fail to befriend the security of both we have the seamen  materials for  0 ships of the line  half that number of frigates and were france to give us the money  england the dispositions to equip them they would give to england serious proofs of the stock from which they are sprung  the school in which they have been taught and added to the effects of the immensity of sea coast lately united under one power would leave the state of the ocean no longer problematical were on the other hand

scenes we ask for peace  justice from all nations  we will remain uprightly neutral in fact tho leaning in     belief to the opinion that an english ascendancy on the ocean is safer for us than that

consent or force will permit us we shall never permit another privateer to cruise within it and shall forbid our harbors to national cruisers this is essential for our tranquility  commerce be so good

thomas jefferson may   0  washington samuel smith to samuel smith j mss washington may   0  dear sir —i received your favor covering some papers from genl wilkinson i have repented but of one appointment there that of lucas whose temper i see overrules every good quality  every qualification he has not a single fact has appeared which occasions me to doubt that i could have made a fitter appointment than genl wilkinson one qualm of principle i acknowledge i do feel i mean the union of the civil  military authority you remember that when i came into office while we were lodging together at conrads he was pressed on me to be made governor of the missipi territory  that i refused it on that very principle when therefore     the h of r took that ground i was not insensible to its having some weight but in the appointment to louisiana i did not think myself departing from my principle because i consider it not as a civil government but merely a military station the legislature had sanctioned that idea by the establishment of the office of commandant in which were compleatly blended the civil  military powers it seemed therefore that the governor should be in suit with them i observed too that the h of r on the very day they passed the stricture on this union of authorities passed a bill making the govr of michigan commander of the regular troops which should at any time be within his government however on the subject of genl wilkinson nothing is in contemplation at this time we shall see what turn things take at home  abroad in the course of the summer monroe has had a  d conversation with mr fox which gives us hopes that we shall have an amicable arrangement with that government accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem

three weeks to unbend as much as the current business will permit with the aid of the country recreations a little before my departure the incident took place at new york on the subject of which i saw letters from     yourself  general barnham who were witnesses of the effect produced altho the scenes which were acted on shore were overdone with electioneering views yet the act of the british officer was an atrocious violation of our territorial rights the question what should be done was a difficult one the sending three frigates was one suggestion our peace establishment allows the emploiment of     men which might man   frigates  i think the construction sound that the force in the mediterranean might be considered as our war establishment making no part of the     men but as having been sent there under another law but if no part of our peace establishment the war being over they must be called home if considered under the war statute and if kept there it could be only as a part of the peace establishment we had in fact ordered home one frigate and directed one to remain there with two brigs the chesapeake was under repair destined for the mediterranean on account of the tunisian threats but would not be ready within a month while we were thus unable to present a force of that kind at n york we received from mr merry the most solemn assurances that the meeting of the three british vessels at new york was entirely accidental from different quarters  that they were not to remain there we concluded therefore that it was best to do what you have seen in the proclamation and to make a proper use of the outrage and of our forbearance at st jamess to obtain better provisions for the future we expect daily to hear of the return of our mediterranean gunboats to charleston which     with those expected to descend the ohio  some from commodore preble will enable us to put n orleans  n york our most vulnerable points the former in a state of good security the latter out of danger of having the city assaulted by a small force and the boats to be constructed this year with landbatteries will give to n york also good security but the building some ships of the line instead of our most indifferent frigates is not to be lost sight of that we should have a squadron properly composed to prevent the blockading our ports is indispensable the atlantic frontier from numbers wealth  exposure to potent enemies have a proportionate right to be defended with the western frontier for whom we keep up  000 men bringing forward the measure therefore in a moderate form placing it on the ground of comparative right our nation which is a just one will come into it notwithstanding the repugnance of some on the subject being first presented a second conference between monroe and fox gives us confident hope that our matters there will be properly settled the measures we have taken were necessary even to alarm the british merchants  to give the

considering their mutual relation to a common center burr i send you also a letter from mr gallatin on account of the last paragraph tho as far as i can trust my memory every article suggested has

gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss june      0  on the   th of april i wrote to governor claiborne in these words congress has permitted lots to be taken for m de la fayette as low as  00 acres this secures to us the parcel on the canal of carondelet but at the same time cuts off those similar locations proposed by m duplantier indeed it would not be for the interest of the general to let his claim get into collision with any public interest were it to lose its popularity it might excite an opposition neither agreeable to his feelings or interest this may already have produced some effect towards abating the expectations of m duplantier and the fears of the city still i think it better that mr madison should write explicitly to him indeed i think we had better have a consultation and determine on the proper limits of the public reservation for however justifiably desirous we may be to relieve a man who stands so high in the public affection as la fayette still it should be only by granting to him such lands as would be granted to others if not located by him the idea of consolidating   0 by getting suarezs land was to satisfy the limit of  000 acres then imposed on him while others would have been free to have taken these smaller parcels that idea may now be waived with respect to colonel newtons inquiries what measures are to be taken with armed vessels coming into that harbor i think he may be told to go on as we have done until further orders these ought not to be given till we have gunboats there to enforce them then i shall be for an exact police over these vessels should we not by special letters keep the collectors on the alert as to the three proscribed vessels and commanders it is very desirable to get hold of whitby affectionate salutations thomas jefferson june      0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss june      0  i have had a consultation with mr madison on the application of the british vessel of war for stores we are both of opinion that if by this term be meant seastores only or even munitions de bouche or provisions generally there can be no objection to their taking them or indeed anything except contraband of war but what should be deemed contraband of war in this case we are not agreed he thinks that as the english deem naval stores to be contraband and as such take them from our vessels at sea we ought to retaliate their own definition on them i think we ought to act on the opinion that they are not contraband because by treaties between all the     nations i think having treaties with another they are agreed not to be contraband even england herself with every nation but ours makes them noncontraband and the only treaty making them contraband jays is now expired we ought then at once to rally with all the other nations on the ground that they are noncontraband and if england treats them as contraband in our ships instead of admitting it by retaliation let us contest it on its true ground mr m thinks france might complain of this but i think not as we shall permit both nations equally to take naval stores or at least such articles of them as may be used for peaceable as well as warlike purposes this being the true line this therefore becomes a question on which it will be advisable for us soon to come to a fixed determination in the mean time it will be better to leave the construction of the term to mr gelston by not defining the term to him because any error of his will be easily got over affectionate salutations thomas

your new post  the newspapers tell us that dr eustis has qualified mr gerry i presume  genl heath must have reasons of justification for declining unknown to us at a distance otherwise we should say that a good souldier does not retire on     carrying the town merely while the citadel is still in the enemys hands i presume however it will be surrendered at the end of this campaign as all hopes of relief will then be desperate every communication from mr monroe strengthens our expectation that the new pretence of the british to controul our commerce with belligerent colonies will be properly restricted and the outrages on our seamen brought to an end i had apprehended that the attempts of a little party of seceders in congress to assassinate our negotiations for peace  justice from spain and france by proclaiming views communicated to them in confidence and using a language of irritation calculated to indispose those powers to listen to us would have effected their views and forced us into what they deemed necessary for the liberties of mankind war with spain  france  consequently alliance with britain but the course which things are taking in europe  some symptoms at madrid  paris induce me now to hope we may obtain the same ground which was put in our power last autumn on the whole i do hope that at the next session of congress we may inform the nation that we have brought to an end the wrongs they have been suffering from one people and obtained from another justice peace  perhaps an arrondissement of empire which may promise us long years of tranquility there will be some gratification too personally in proving to our constituents that their old servants have done nothing either in the way of wickedness or folly to forfeit their confidence nor their new  unfledged friends anything to merit it     as our measures will have resulted in peace the inference is that the contrary measures pressed on us would have resulted in contrary effects the proposition respecting the marshallship mentioned in your letter was as you supposed not the first another had been weightily patronized  had produced such a degree of commitment as cannot but have influenced our final determination certainly every act would give me superior pleasure inasmuch as it would be pleasing to you but my knowledge of you also placed me at my ease in giving to all considerations the

registered vessel or in other words whether he is a citizen of the united states i hold the right of expatriation to be inherent in every man by the laws of nature and incapable of being rightfully taken from him even by the united will of every other person in the nation if the laws have provided no particular mode by which the right of expatriation may be exercised the individual may do it by any effectual and unequivocal act or declaration     the laws of virginia have provided a mode mr cooper is said to have exercised his right solemnly and exactly according to that mode and to have departed from the commonwealth whereupon the law declares that he shall thenceforth be deemed no citizen returning afterwards he returns an alien and must proceed to make himself a citizen if he desires it as every other alien does at present he can hold no lands receive nor transmit any inheritance nor enjoy any other right peculiar to a citizen the general government has nothing to do with this question congress may by the constitution establish an uniform rule of naturalization that is by what rule an alien may become a citizen but they cannot take from a citizen his natural right of divesting himself of the character of a citizen by expatriation thomas jefferson july    0  washington thomas mann randolph to thomas mann randolph  washington july    0  dear sir —your letter of the  th came to hand on the  th  at the same time the enquirer of the  th from the two together i derived inexpressible consolation because while the enquirer contained a piece which shews that the other party did not propose for any thing which had yet past to remove the question from before the tribunal of the public your letter gave me confidence that if that piece contained any fact necessary to be set to rights it     would be done by a simple statement of the fact without commentary of reflection but indeed whatever that piece might contain of error its contradiction is rendered unnecessary by general opinion i find but one sentiment prevailing and i have that from very many that the thing may stop where it now is with entire honour to yourself and with no other diminution of it by the other party than shewing that he has not that ravenous appetite for unnecessary risk which some had ascribed to him and which indeed is the falsest of honour as a mere compound of crime  folly i hope therefore that the matter is at an end and that great care will be taken not to revive it i believe that will be the case on his side for i think you have been mistaken in supposing he meant to try any experiment on your sensibility of this he is acquitted i find by all who had opportunities of observing his selection of characters to be the subjects of his sarcasms this termination however restores peace of mind and happiness to us all the young ones indeed would have got over it but to two persons at least it would have ended but with life this period might have been long with one with the other short but unceasingly bitter a sincere affection for you personally a reliance on you for succeeding to cares which age is unfitting me for sympathies with a beloved survivor and tender anxieties for those who would have had to embark in the world without guide or protection would have filled with gloom my remaining time god bless you  give you a long life     thomas jefferson july      0  james bowdoin to the u s minister to spain  james bowdoin j mss july      0  dear sir —i wrote you a long letter on the  0th inst since which your favor of may  0 has come to hand by this i perceive  with the deepest affliction not only that a misunderstanding has taken place between yourself  genl armstrong but that it has occasioned a misconstruction of your powers likely to defeat the object of your mission a mission on the result of which the eyes of all our citizens are anxiously fixed as that which can alone give them a convenient  certain boundary with the prospect of long peace the commission sent you is in the precise words as to its formal parts of that under which messrs monroe  c pinckney acted at madrid in the same business  the same also as that formerly given to mr livingston  monroe  the one lately given to monroe  w pinckney its purport is indeed joint or several its intention that if found together the ministers shall act jointly but if the death sickness or absence of either should happen then the other should have authority to proceed separately never before has this form met with any objections  never before was it constructed to give to either the power to do a single act relative to its object but in conjunction with the other in the instructions indeed a small variation in form only happened from this circumstance they were prepared before we were certain that you would be at paris when they should arrive and as     we had determined no more to address ourselves to madrid but thro the medium of france where genl armstrong was accredited the instructions were at first addressed to him singly when it was afterwards determined to join you in a negotiation the caption was made to declare that they were common to you both and the address on the back was joint this change in the caption  superscription completely changed the effect of every paragraph in the instrns  addressed its contents to both of you i cannot see how it could be inferred that these instructions were not to have operation until the authority at paris shall be ready on the part of spain on the contrary they were in operation from the moment they were received and from that moment neither had a right to take a single step formal or informal but with the concurrence of the other as france had neither right nor interest in the provinces coterminous with louisiana either on the east or west which were to be the subject of negotiation she could not become a party to the treaty no diploma was necessary therefore to be addressed to her formally the friendly dispositions which dictated our requests of her good offices would induce her to yield them on being informally satisfied that you had full powers to conclude with spain this she would have been by a sight of your fullpowers or of a letter or another less formal manifestation of your authority and on this she would naturally invite spain to meet us in negotiation at paris where her good offices could be rendered to both this was the course we supposed     the business would take if genl armstrong has written to you that you are to have nothing to do with the negotiation until spanish agents are upon the ground it is wrong because you had equal authority with him to take the measures properly necessary to bring them on the ground no greater authority was given or intended for the one than the other i hardly suppose this explanation can reach paris in time to remedy— i have much higher hopes that gentlemen so selected for the superiority of their characters  understanding will have had so much greatness of mind as to silence their individual passions in the presence of such great public interests and to have exerted all the powers of their mind to bring them to the result so much desired this disposition would of course be inforced by the consideration that the evil arises at such a distance from us as to admit of no remedy till too late that private indisposns towd each other should sometimes exist in difft agents of the same govmt is what is to be found in all govmnt with these the public have no concern but were these indisposns to prevent them from executing dispassionately  faithfully any public duties which brought them together would be a ground of serious blame my estimation of you both must be obvious from my selection of you from the whole body of our country for the discharge of its highest trusts my confidence in you has kept me without pain  without a fear that everything would be done to accomplish the great object committed to you which     patriotism  talents could affect and i will not believe yet that  thomas jefferson aug   0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug   0  dear sir —yours of the  th is received i think the course which has been taken for sending mellimenni home is the best and i concur with you in the expediency of giving no answer to turreau indeed his letter does not seem to call for one in the present state of our affairs it will certainly be better not to appoint a consul at st thomass we must not risk great things for small a consul merely to patronize a commerce which the laws forbid would be a measure in opposition to the law  not for its execution i have received an impression from some cause or other that we had a convention with spain for the mutual surrender of fugitives from justice in cases of murder and forgery but on examining my collection of the laws here which however is imperfect i do not find such an one if we have such a convention the murderer of his negro must certainly be given up if we have not he as certainly cannot of this i imagine you can satisfy yourself if he is to be given up our constitution secures to him a previous trial by jury he should be regularly indicted for having committed a certain crime within the territories of spain and the jury finding him guilty the judgment of the court should be that he be delivered up to the spanish authority   0 the case is of new creation by the convention and should therefore take the course of analogous cases already known to the law the fact mentioned by govr lewis that the british have a fort on the isthmus near carleton or buck island is equally unknown  astonishing to me certainly we are bound to look into it immediately the first step to be taken i think is to ascertain the fact for which purpose i should suppose it best that genl dearborn should send a discreet judicious officer to the place with orders to do nothing more than to satisfy himself of the fact and report it to him i think a new marshall should now be appointed for n york  will thank you to order a blank commission for this purpose to be forwarded to mr gallatin as was settled before we parted i now return you the letters of p edwards cathcart govr lewis turreau  govr claiborne and i inclose to you for your office mellimennis letter to me browns with an official

marshal has been furnished for which good though less evident cause existed before and we have shown our tenderness towards judicial proceedings in delaying his removal till these were ended we have done our duty and i have no fear the world will do us justice all is well therefore i approve of the appointment of thos fowler to command the cutter at savannah and wish you to direct the commission accordingly there was a recommendation of a mr newell under favorable circumstances but that of fowler is more weighty mr r s has had a commission given to eli williams as commissioner of the western road i am sorry he has gone out of baltimore for the appointment and also out of the ranks of republicanism it will furnish new matter for clamor i set out to my possessions in bedford in a day or two

floridas not one word further than is known to you has been received you shall immediately know when anything is received as to the proposition for employing the hornet to transport money for certain merchants from a belligerent port to the united states mr miller seems to have viewed one side of the question only the other would not withstand a moments reflection every neutral vessel armed or unarmed transporting merchandise of money or other goods is rightfully liable to search by the ships of war of a belligerent private vessels even armed are accordingly searched the public armed ships are not because no nation uses them but for the protection of private commerce not for carrying it on the honor of the nation is relied on that they are not so employed and the nation who lend them to such purposes must give up their exemption from search should a british frigate having intimation of the hornets cargo demand and make a search he would find on board the proofs that our public ships abuse their privilege and of course must be denied it the license to four british vessels to sail to lima proves that belligerents may either by compact or force conduct themselves towards one another as they please but not that a neutral may unless by express permission of the belligerent if the money said to have been brought from jamaica     by murray  mullony was private property the act was wrong and ought not to be repeated there are other insuperable reasons in this case but this one is sufficient i must take a little more time to consider and answer as to the western roads and louisiana instructions affectionate salutations thomas jefferson august      0  monticello albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss monticello august      0  dear sir —i now return you the papers respecting the louisiana board of commissioners with only the alteration of omitting the words in the xth instruction about which you had doubted yourself at the same time it is without confidence i give any opinion on this subject having always considered your knowledge on it so exact as to supersede the necessity of my studying it minutely if any opinion in aid of yours be necessary i am sorry we could not call in that of the attorney general who is acquainted with the subject i return also the papers on the western roads i have not here a complete copy of the laws of the last session and particularly no copy of that respecting the road from the mississippi to the ohio if i recollect it rightly it authorized us to open but one road if so the branchings proposed by mr badollet may be beyond our powers at any rate they should be secondary and not attempted till we know there will be money left after accomplishing the     principal one i submit to you therefore whether we should not suspend all measures respecting the branching roads with respect to the great and important road which is the principal object   why should not the guideline from st louis to vincennes be direct instead of bending to b   i like your idea of straightening the guideline from vincennes although it may pass through a corner of the indian lands but if necessary to cross the river at a on account of the ford should not the guideline go thence direct to cincinnati as i have pencilled it or to dayton if that be the shortest way to chillicothe and even in that case the fork to cincinnati might be transferred to c   but the postoffice map the only one i have here must be egregiously wrong if dayton is not much out of the direct road from vincennes to chillicothe according to that cincinnati is in the direct line but perhaps the deviation by dayton is from economy and to spare our fund the expense of opening the road from cincinnati to chillicothe and marietta but i doubt whether for a temporary reason we ought to do a permanent injury especially as we may with certainty expect that congress will enlarge the appropriation as to the branches of the roads if it be lawful and advisable to extend our operations to them i presume that to louisville c h will be the most important but should the fund hold out that to kaskaskia may be taken in ultimately i think mr badollet is right in proposing that the road shall not be opened more than a rod wide accept     affectionate salutations and assurances of constant esteem and respect thomas jefferson sept    0

about the same time i received the enquirer in which decius was so judiciously answered the writer of that     paper observed that the matter of decius  consisted  st of facts  dly of inferences from these facts that he was not well enough informed to affirm or deny his facts  he therefore examines his inferences and in a very masterly manner shews that even were his facts true the reasonable inferences from them are very different from those drawn by decius but his facts are far from truth and should be corrected it happened that mr madison  genl dearborne were here when i received your letter i therefore with them took up decius  read him deliberately  our memories aided one another in correcting his bold  unauthorized assertions i shall note the most material of these in the order of the paper   it is grossly false that our ministers as it is said in a note had proposed to surrender our claims to compensation for spanish spoliations or even for french their instructions were to make no treaty in which spanish spoliations were not provided for and altho they were permitted to be silent as to french spoliations carried into spanish ports they were not expressly to abandon even them   it is not true that our ministers in agreeing to establish the colorado as our western boundary had been obliged to exceed the authority of their instructions altho we considered our title good as far as the rio bravo yet in proportion to what they could obtain east of the missipi they were to relinquish to the westward  successive sacrifices were marked out     of which even the colorado was not the last   it is not true that the louisiana treaty was antedated lest great britain should consider our supplying her enemies with money as a breach of neutrality after the very words of the treaty were finally agreed to it took some time perhaps some days to make out all the copies in the very splendid manner of bonapartes treaties whether the  0th of apr   0  the date expressed was the day of the actual compact or that on which it was signed our memories do not enable us to say if the former then it is strictly conformable to the day of the compact if the latter then it was postdated instead of being antedated the motive assigned too is as incorrect as the fact it was so far from being thought by any party a breach of neutrality that the british minister congratulated mr king on the acquisition  declared that the king had learned it with great pleasure  when baring the british banker asked leave of the minister to purchase the debt  furnish the money to france the minister declared to him that so far from throwing obstacles in the way if there were any difficulty in the paiment of the money it was the interest of great britain to aid it   he speaks of a double set of opinions  principles the one ostensible to go on the journals  before the public the other efficient and the real motives to action but where are these double opinions and principles the executive informed the legislature of the wrongs of spain  that preparation should be made to repel them by force if necessary but as it might still be possible to     negotiate a settlement they asked such means as might enable them to meet the negociation whatever form it might take the  st part of this system was communicated publicly the  d privately but both were equally official equally involved the responsibility of the executive and were equally to go on the journals   that the purchase of the floridas was in direct opposition to the views of the executive as expressed in the presidents official communication it was not in opposition even to the public part of the communication which did not recommend war but only to be prepared for it it perfectly harmonized with the private part which asked the means of negociation in such terms as covered the purchase of florida as evidently as it was proper to speak it out he speaks of secret communications between the executive and members of backstairs influence c but he never spoke of this while he and mr nicholson enjoyed it almost solely but when he differed from the executive in a leading measure  the executive not submitting to him expressed its sentiments to others the very sentiments to wit the purchase of florida which he acknoleges they expressed to him then he roars out upon backstairs influence   the committee he sais forbore to recommend offensive measures is this true did not they recommend the raising — regiments besides if it was proper for the comee to forbear recommending offensive measures was it not proper for the executive  legislature to exercise the same forbearance   he sais monroes letter had a most important bearing on   0 our spanish relations monroes letter related almost entirely to our british relations of those with spain he knew nothing particular since he left that country accordingly in his letter he simply expressed an opinion on our affairs with spain of which he knew we had better information than he could possess his opinion was no more than that of any other sensible man  his letter was proper to be communicated with the english papers  with them only that the executive did not hold it up on account of any bearing on spanish affairs is evident from the fact that it was communicated when the senate had not yet entered on the spanish affairs  had not yet received the papers relating to them from the other house the moment the representatives were ready to enter on the british affairs monroes letter which peculiarly related to them and was official solely as to them was communicated to both houses the senate being then about entering on spanish affairs it remains now to consider on what authority these corrections of fact can be advanced without compromitting the executive it would seem to be best that the writer should assume the mask of a member of the legislature as to the  st   d articles it might be said that although the instructions to the ministers for the spanish negociation were never officially made known yet that they were often the subject of conversation during the sessions at washington where it was understood that they were as above stated however that if decius pretends to know that they were not let him bring forward his     proofs or avow the backstairs information he received to the contrary as to the  d all the circumstances were freely mentioned by the different members of the administrn in conversations during the session which confirmed the louisiana treaty no secret was made of them the  th  th   th require no proofs but what are public the  th may be affirmed in the assumed character of a member without any danger of its being denied these my dear sir are the principal facts worth correction make any use of them you think best without letting your source of information be known can you send me some cones or seeds of the cucumber tree accept affectionate salutations

the information which     claims the more attention as it coincides with what has been learned from other quarters your situation and the knowledge you already possess would probably put it in your power to trace the footsteps of this enterprise on the public peace with more effect than any other with whom i could communicate whatever zeal you might think proper to use in this pursuit would be used in fulfilment of the duties of a good citizen and any communications you may be so good as to make to me on the subject shall be thankfully received and so made use of as not to commit you any further than yourself may     think proper to express a knowledge of the persons who may reject as well as of those who may accept parricide propositions will be peculiarly useful accept my

has been received and i now return you the letters of yznardi wilkinson cathcart clinton toulman  turreau in the answer to the latter i think it would be better to lay more stress on the constitutional bar to our furnishing the money because it would apply in an occasion of peace as well as war i submit to you therefore the striking out the words it is not c within crotchets  in your draught  inserting but in indulging these dispositions the president is bound to stop at the limits prescribed by our constitution  law to the authorities placed in his hands one of the limits is that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law  no law having made any appropriation of money for any purpose similar to that expressed in your letter it lies of course beyond his constitutional powers this insuperable bar renders it unnecessary to inquire whether the aid you request could be reconciled to c but both as to the matter and form of this alteration you will decide i do not think the loan of our navy yard any more     contrary to neutrality than that of our ports it is merely admitting a ship to a proper station in our waters but this may be a subject of future consultation i send for your persual two letters from yznardi and an anonymous one the postmark on this last was philadelphia  you will be at no loss to conjecture its spanish source i still count on being with you on the  st of oct  certainly feel no dispositions to be punctilious in the case you allude to doctr thornton  his family are here  will be with you the

misunderstanding between mr madison  myself these failed compleatly a like attempt was afterwards made through other channels to effect a similar purpose between genl dearborne  myself but with no more success the machinations of the last session to put you at cross questions with us all were so obvious as to be seen at the first glance of every eye in order to destroy one member of the administration the whole were to be set to loggerheads to destroy one another i     observe in the papers lately new attempts to revive this stale artifice  that they squint more directly towards you  myself i cannot therefore be satisfied till i declare to you explicitly that my affections  confidence in you are nothing impaired  that they cannot be impaired by means so unworthy the notice of candid  honorable minds i make the declaration that no doubts or jealousies which often beget the facts they fear may find a moments harbor in either of our minds i have so much reliance on the superior good sense  candor of all those associated with me as to be satisfied that they will not suffer either friend or foe to sow tares among us our administration now drawing towards a close i have a sublime pleasure in believing it will be distinguished as much by having placed itself above all the passions which could disturb its harmony as by the great operations by which it will have advanced the wellbeing of the nation accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of my constant  unalterable respect  attachment thomas jefferson oct  0 0  washington meriwether lewis to meriwether

think it safe to lodge it at charlottesville its only object is to assure you of what you already know my constant affection for you  the joy with which all your friends here will receive you tell my friend of mandane also that i have already opened my arms to receive him perhaps while in our neighborhood it may be gratifying to him  not otherwise to yourself to take a ride to monticello and see in what manner i have arranged the tokens of friendship i have received from his country particularly as well as from other indian friends that i am in fact preparing a kind of indian hall mr dinsmore my principal workman will shew you everything there had you not better bring him by richmond fredericksburg  alexandria he will thus see what none of the others have visited  the conveniences of the

washington oct    0  dear sir —i see with great concern that unavoidable delays are likely still to procrastinate your negotiations beyond what had been expected  i sincerely regret the particular circumstance to which this is owing the illness probably the death of mr fox his sound judgment saw that political interest could never be separated in the long run from     moral right  his frank  great mind would have made a short business of a just treaty with you i fear that one of those appointed to negotiate with you is too much wedded to the antient maritime code  navigation principles of england too much practised in the tactics of diplomacy to expect either an early or just result if it is not concluded early in december from the known length of passages in that season it cannot be here before congress will be over march   and then it cannot be ratified till december twelve months because it will probably contain articles which will bring it within the constitutional rights of the h of r in that case the nonimportation law and the extensions of it which cannot be avoided at the ensuing session will have a long run and an unfavorable influence on the popular temper of both countries you know the interregnum after the  th of march till the elections are compleated the utter repugnance of members to be here in the sickly months from july to sep and that moreover the public expense  private inconvenience of the members absolutely forbid any special convocation of them you may therefore proceed on the fact that if a treaty be not ratified before the  th of march it will not be until december twelve month believing that this letter will still find you in england  having occasion for some mathematical instruments i take the liberty of troubling you with the inclosed commission to mr jones an instrument maker in holborn what the cost of them will be is unknown to me and having no money correspondent in london i have ventured     to say to him you will pay his bill it will be somewhere between  0     guineas but whatever it be it shall be repaid you on your landing in the u s and may be therefore considered as so much brought over in your pocket for use in the first moments of your return i would wish you to bring the packet with the seed from jones with you on your return if you would prefer drawing on me for the amount in favor of any person here it shall be paid at sight to prevent that depression of spirits which experience has taught me to expect on returning after a long absence from ones home and that you may be prepared  fortified for a discouraging view i will just observe to you that our neighborhood considers your manager mr lewis as one of the honestest  best men in the world but the poorest manager they think he has not made your estate maintain itself  that you will find it unprovided with present subsistence nobody has made this season half a years provision of corn  your estate less than most others  it is said there is no stock of any kind remaining on the farm for your immediate subsistence to restock the farm with bread requires a year  with animals   or   years a previous communication of these circumstances if you have received them from no other will enable you to come prepared to meet them you will have heard of the death of chancellor wythe i recollect no other personal incident which may interest you present my friendly respects to mrs monroe and your daughter and be assured yourself of my constant  affectionate esteem  attachment     thomas jefferson nov     0  washington andrew ellicott to andrew ellicott j mss washington nov     0  dear sir —your letter of aug    with the account of the eclipse you were so kind as to inclose found me at monticello  i meant to have acknoledged it immediately on my arrival here but i found on my return such an accumulation of business that altho your letter has continued on my file of those to be answered i have not been able to get to it till now i thank you for the communication of your observations of the eclipse fortune seems to have favored every other place but this with a fair view of it this spot was covered by a dense cloud through the whole of its duration  for some time before  after i hope the great extent of the path of this eclipse round the globe  especially thro our states will furnish many useful corrections of our longitudes capt lewis will bring us a treasure in this way your opinions of intolerance are mine when i entered on office after giving a very small participation in office to republicans by removal of a very few federalists selected on the very principle of their own intolerance while in office i never meant to have touched another but to leave to the ordinary accidents to make openings for republicans but the vindictive indecent  active opposition of some individuals has obliged me from time to time to disarm them of the influence of office but that such a spirit of intolerance should arise between the different sections of republicans furnishes a poor presage of future tranquility of the unhappy effects  00 of the schisms in pennsylva and n york you see the fruit in the state lying between them where the federalists have recovered a majority in one branch of the legislature are very near it in the other  as soon as they shall reach it they place the executive  every office under it in federal hands if the two sections of republicans were irreconcileable still the minor one should not have coalesced with and voted for federalists if on the contrary they would keep themselves independent  set up their own ticket their whole body would come forward  vote which would give them the benefit of that part of their force which kept back because it could not support federalists and the federalists themselves having no hope of bringing in men of their own would have to chuse between the two republican tickets that least disagreeable to themselves this would only bring into the public councils the different shades of republicans so that the whole body should be represented for my part i determined from the first dawn of the first schism never to take part in any schism of republicans nor in distributing the public trusts ever to ask of which section a party was the port of retirement is now within sight it is viewed with longing eyes and my greatest consolation in it will be the undivided approbation of those with whom  for whom i have labored accept my friendly salutations  the assurances of my respect  0  thomas jefferson nov      0  proclamation against burrs plot j mss nov      0  whereas information has been received that sundry persons citizens of the u s or resident within the same are conspiring  confederating together to

the u s that for this purpose they are fitting out  arming vessels in the western waters of the u s collecting provisions arms military stores  other means are deceiving  seducing honest  well meaning citizens under various pretences to engage in their criminal enterprises are organizing officering  arming themselves for the same contrary to the laws in such cases made  provided i have therefore thought fit to issue this my proclamation warning and enjoining all faithful citizens who have been led to participate in the sd unlawful enterprises without due knolege or consideration to withdraw from the same without delay  commanding all persons whatsoever engaged or concerned in the same to cease all further proceedings therein as they will answer the contrary at their peril and will incur prosecution with all the rigors of the law and i hereby enjoin and require all officers civil or military of the u s or of any of the states or territories  especially all governors  other executive authorities all judges justices and other officers of the peace all military officers of the army or navy of the u s  officers of the militia to be vigilant  0  each within his respective department

vessels arms military stores or other means provided or providing for the same  in general in preventing the carrying on such expedition or enterprise by all the lawful means within their power and i require all good  faithful citizens and others within the u s to be aiding  assisting herein  especially in the discovery apprehension  bringing to justice of all such offenders and in the giving information against them to the proper authorities in testimony whereof i have caused the seal of the u s to be affixed to these presents  have signed the same with my hand given at the city of washington on the   th day of november   0  and of the sovereignty  independence of the u s the   st thomas jefferson december     0  sixth annual message   december     0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states in congress assembled it would have given me fellow citizens great satisfaction to announce in the moment of your meeting  0  that the difficulties in our foreign relations existing at the time of your last separation had been amicably and justly terminated i lost no time in taking  0  those measures which were most likely to bring them to such a termination by special missions charged with such powers and instructions as in the event of failure could leave no imputation on either our moderation or forbearance the delays which have since taken place in our negotiations with the british government appear to have proceeded from causes  0  which do not forbid the expectation that during the course of the session i may be enabled to lay before you their final issue what will be that of the negotiations  0  for settling our differences with spain nothing which had taken place at the date of the last despatches enables us to pronounce on the  0  western side of the mississippi she advanced in considerable force and took post at the settlement of bayou pierre on the red river this village was  0  originally settled by france was held by her as long as she held louisiana and was delivered to spain only as a part of louisiana being small insulated and distant it was not observed at the moment of  0  redelivery to france and the united states that she continued a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed there a proposition however having been lately made by our commanderinchief to   0 assume the sabine river as a temporary line of separation between the troops of the two nations until the issue of our negotiations shall be known this has been referred by the spanish commandant to his superior and in the meantime he has withdrawn his force to the western side of the sabine river the correspondence on this subject now communicated will exhibit more particularly the present state of things in that quarter the nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted infantry in     order therefore that the commanding officer might be enabled to act with effect i had authorized him to call on the governors of orleans and mississippi for a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry the temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary but i inform you with great pleasure of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of those territories have tendered their services in defence of their country it has done honor to themselves entitled them to the confidence of their fellowcitizens in every part of the union and must strengthen the general determination to protect them efficaciously under all circumstances which may occur having received information that in another part of the united states a great number of private individuals were combining together arming and organizing themselves contrary to law to carry on military expeditions against the territories of spain i thought it necessary by proclamations as well as by special orders to take measures for preventing and suppressing this enterprise for seizing the vessels arms and other means provided for it and for arresting and bringing to justice its authors and abettors it was due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transactions it was due to good order and regular government that while the public force was acting strictly on the defensive and merely to protect our citizens from aggression the criminal attempts of private individuals to decide for their country the question of peace or war by     commencing active and unauthorized hostilities should be promptly and efficaciously suppressed whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will depend on the result of our negotiation with spain but as it is uncertain when that result will be known the provisional measures requisite for that and to meet any pressure intervening in that quarter will be a subject for your early consideration the possession of both banks of the mississippi reducing to a single point the defence of that river its waters and the country adjacent it becomes highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security some position above its mouth commanding the passage of the river should be rendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessels which may be stationed there for defence and in conjunction with them to present an insuperable obstacle to any force attempting to pass the approaches to the city of new orleans from the eastern quarter also will require to be examined and more effectually guarded for the internal support of the country the encouragement of a strong settlement on the western side of the mississippi within reach of new orleans will be worthy the consideration of the legislature the gunboats authorized by an act of the last session are so advanced that they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring circumstances permitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction as a much larger number will still be wanting to place our seaport towns and waters in that state of defence to which we are competent     and they entitled a similar appropriation for a further provision for them is recommended for the ensuing year a further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications already established and the erection of such works as may have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our seaport towns or their remaining before them in a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people directly expressed by their free suffrages where the principal executive functionaries and those of the legislature are renewed by them at short periods where under the characters of jurors they exercise in person the greatest portion of the judiciary powers where the laws are consequently so formed and administered as to bear with equal weight and favor on all restraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry and securing to every one the property which that acquires it would not be supposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection or enterprise on the public peace or authority the laws however aware that these should not be trusted to moral restraints only have wisely provided punishments for these crimes when committed but would it not be salutary to give also the means of preventing their commission where an enterprise is meditated by private individuals against a foreign nation in amity with the united states powers of prevention to a certain extent are given by the laws would they not be as reasonable and useful were the enterprise preparing against the united states while     adverting to this branch of the law it is proper to observe that in enterprises meditated against foreign nations the ordinary process of binding to the observance of the peace and good behavior could it be extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction of the united states would be effectual in some cases where the offender is able to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could draw on him the exercise of the powers now given by law the states on the coast of barbary seem generally disposed at present to respect our peace and friendship with tunis alone some uncertainty remains persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on equal terms or not at all i propose to send in due time a reinforcement into the mediterranean unless previous information shall show it to be unnecessary we continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our indian neighbors and of their disposition to place all their interests under the patronage of the united states these dispositions are inspired by their confidence in our justice and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare and as long as we discharge these high and honorable functions with the integrity and good faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance we may expect to reap the just reward in their peace and friendship the expedition of messrs lewis and clarke for exploring the river missouri and the best communication from that to the pacific ocean has had all the success which could have been expected they have     traced the missouri nearly to its source descended the columbia to the pacific ocean ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across our continent learned the character of the country of its commerce and inhabitants and it is but justice to say that messrs lewis and clarke and their brave companions have by this arduous service deserved well of their country the attempt to explore the red river under the direction of mr freeman though conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation has not been equally successful after proceeding up it about six hundred miles nearly as far as the french settlements had extended while the country was in their possession our geographers were obliged to return without completing their work very useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the mississippi by lieutenant pike who has ascended to its source and whose journal and map giving the details of the journey will shortly be ready for communication to both houses of congress those of messrs lewis and clarke and freeman will require further time to be digested and prepared these important surveys in addition to those before possessed furnish materials for commencing an accurate map of the mississippi and its western waters some principal rivers however remain still to be explored toward which the authorization of congress by moderate appropriations will be requisite i congratulate you fellowcitizens on the approach of the period at which you may interpose     your authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizens of the united states from all further participation in those violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of africa and which the morality the reputation and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe although no law you may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent by timely notice expeditions which cannot be completed before that day the receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the  0th of september last have amounted to near fifteen millions of dollars which have enabled us after meeting the current demands to pay two millions seven hundred thousand dollars of the american claims in part of the price of louisiana to pay of the funded debt upward of three millions of principal and nearly four of interest and in addition to reimburse in the course of the present month near two millions of five and a half per cent stock these payments and reimbursements of the funded debt with those which have been made in the four years and a half preceding will at the close of the present year have extinguished upwards of twentythree millions of principal the duties composing the mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of the present season considering however that they are levied chiefly on luxuries and that we have an impost on salt a necessary of life the free use of which otherwise is so     important i recommend to your consideration the suppression of the duties on salt and the continuation of the mediterranean fund instead thereof for a short time after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation when both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be relinquished there will still ere long be an accumulation of moneys in the treasury beyond the instalments of public debt which we are permitted by contract to pay they cannot then without a modification assented to by the public creditors be applied to the extinguishment of this debt and the complete liberation of our revenues—the most desirable of all objects nor if our peace continues will they be wanting for any other existing purpose the question therefore now comes forward—to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated and the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures on a few articles of more general and necessary use the suppression in due season will doubtless be right but the great mass of the articles on which impost is paid is foreign luxuries purchased by those only who are rich enough to afford themselves the use of them their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education roads rivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional     enumeration of federal powers by these operations new channels of communication will be opened between the states the lines of separation will disappear their interests will be identified and their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties education is here placed among the articles of public care not that it would be proposed to take its ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprise which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal but a public institution can alone supply those sciences which though rarely called for are yet necessary to complete the circle all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the country and some of them to its preservation the subject is now proposed for the consideration of congress because if approved by the time the state legislatures shall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts and the laws shall be passed and other arrangements made for their execution the necessary funds will be on hand and without employment i suppose an amendment to the constitution by consent of the states necessary because the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution and to which it permits the public moneys to be applied the present consideration of a national establishment for education particularly is rendered proper by this circumstance also that if congress approving the proposition shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income     this foundation would have the advantage of being independent on war which may suspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes the resources destined for them this fellow citizens is the state of the public interest at the present moment and according to the information now possessed but such is the situation of the nations of europe and such too the predicament in which we stand with some of them that we cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affairs that may change from moment to moment during the course of your session or after you shall have separated our duty is therefore to act upon things as they are and to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be were armies to be raised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon we never should have been without them our resources would have been exhausted on dangers which have never happened instead of being reserved for what is really to take place a steady perhaps a quickened pace in preparations for the defence of our seaport towns and waters an early settlement of the most exposed and vulnerable parts of our country a militia so organized that its effective portions can be called to any point in the union or volunteers instead of them to serve a sufficient time are means which may always be ready yet never preying on our resources until actually called into use they will maintain the public interests while a more permanent force shall be in course of preparation but much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be   0 brought into activity if war be forced upon us in spite of our long and vain appeals to the justice of nations rapid and vigorous movements in its outset will go far toward securing us in its course and issue and toward throwing its burdens on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force the result of our negotiations or such incidents in their course as may enable us to infer their probable issue such further movements also on our western frontiers as may show whether war is to be pressed there while negotiation is protracted elsewhere shall be communicated to you from time to time as they become known to me with whatever other information i possess or may receive which may aid your deliberations on the great national interests committed to your charge thomas jefferson december     0  special message on great britain   december     0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states i have the satisfaction to inform you that the negotiation depending between the united states     and the government of great britain is proceeding in a spirit of friendship and accommodation which promises a result of mutual advantage delays indeed have taken place occasioned by the long illness and subsequent death of the british minister charged with that duty but the commissioners appointed by that government to resume the negotiation have shown every disposition to hasten its progress it is however a work of time as many arrangements are necessary to place our future harmony on stable grounds in the meantime we find by the communications of our plenipotentiaries that a temporary suspension of the act of the last session prohibiting certain importations would as a mark of candid disposition on our part and of confidence in the temper and views with which they have been met have a happy effect on its course a step so friendly will afford further evidence that all our proceedings have flowed from views of justice and conciliation and that we give them willingly that     form which may best meet corresponding dispositions add to this that the same motives which produced the postponement of the act till the fifteenth of november last are in favor of its further suspension and as we have reason to hope that it may soon yield to arrangements of mutual consent and convenience justice seems to require that the same measure may be dealt out to the few cases which may fall within its short course as to all others preceding and following it i cannot therefore but recommend the suspension of this act for a reasonable time on considerations of justice amity and the public interests thomas jefferson dec   0  washington cæsar a rodney to cæsar a rodney j mss washington dec   0  dear sir —i have not sooner been able to acknolege the receipt of your favors of the   st    th ult and to thank you for the communication of the letters they covered  which are now reinclosed the designs of our catèline are as real as they are romantic but the parallel he has selected from history for the model of his own course corresponds but by halves it is true in its principal character but the materials to be employed are totally different from the scourings of rome i am confidant he will be compleatly deserted on the appearance of the proclamation because his strength was to consist of people who had been persuaded that the government connived at the enterprise however we have not trusted to this     weapon alone altho we shall possibly come to blows with spain it will accelerate the treaty instead of preventing it the appointment of a successor to judge patterson was bound up by rule the last judiciary system requiring a judge for each district rendered it proper that he should be of the district this has been observed in both the appointments to the supreme bench made by me where an office is local we never go out of the limits for the officer accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect thomas jefferson dec    0  henry dearborn to the secretary of war henry dearborn j mss dec    0  th jefferson returned to general dearborn yesterday the letter of mr john randolph to which he thinks some of the following ideas might enter into the answer to wit that the military establishment of the u s being known it is only necessary to observe that it is nearly full that a considerable portion of it is necessarily retained at the several forts  posts of the u s to preserve them  the property at them that all the residue were on the line of frontier between the u s  the spanish dominions under the command of genl wilkinson who has also authority to call on the territories of orleans  mississippi for militia that the force which spain has on the sabine has been represented as amounting to   00 men but it is believed to be considerably below that that it is impossible to say what force she can bring from her extensive     dominions west  south of us or from beyond sea probably the less on account of the war in which she is engaged  which endangers other parts of her possessions that the president in his message of dec   expressed his ideas of the means of protecting our citizens in the commencement of a war  until time could be given for raising regulars but that the right of deciding on these being with the legislature he will rely on those means which they shall think it most expedient to provide c c thomas jefferson december      0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss december      0  although i have the most perfect confidence in the integrity of briggs and very little in davies his accuser yet where a charge is so specific and direct our duty calls for investigation the distance is too great to wait for preliminary explanation i think with you that mr williams the former register will be a proper person to inquire into the charge but that he would probably be less willing to undertake it alone than joined with another and i would propose to join with him mr dunbar who deserves entire confidence in the case of the removal proposed by the collector of baltimore i consider it as entirely out of my sphere and resting solely with yourself were i to give an opinion on the subject it would only be by observing that in the cases under my immediate care i have never considered the length of time a person has continued in office nor     the money

entrance of the harbors  the waters under the jurisdiction of the u s and in case of any of them reentering the harbors or waters aforesaid all intercourse with them was forbidden all supplies and aid prohibited from being furnished them under the penalties of law provided and whereas one of the said armed vessels the cambrian has lately entered into the waters of the chesapeake within which with

mss washington dec  0 0  dear sir —you will receive your formal instructions from genl dearborn this is private of course  merely for your more full information you already have a general knowledge of the insurrection prepared by colo burr his object is to take possession of n orleans as a station from whence to make an expedition against vera cruz  mexico his party began their formation at the mouth beaver from whence they started the  st or  d of this month and would collect all the way down the     ohio we trust that the opposition we have provided at marietta cincinnati louisville  massac will be sufficient to stop him but we are not certain because we do not know his strength it is therefore possible he may escape  then his great rendezvous is to be at natchez you can judge as well as i when he can be there leaving pittsburg or beaver dec   we send our present orders by both the tennessee  athens routes in expectation they will reach natchez  n orleans in time for the whole force of both countries to be collected  to take the best point for opposition the orders are to the governor of missipi to bring forward the whole force of his militia instantly to act in conjunction with the force at fort adams to the commanding officer of the gunboats c to move with his whole force immediately up the river  to take the station which shall be thought best we presume it will be a little above fort adams or fort coupee but within reach of them that he may fall back under the protection of their guns if in danger from superior numbers we expect you will collect all your force of militia act in conjunction with colo freeman  take such a stand as shall be concluded best these orders are given to the several officers distinctly because genl wilkinson is believed to be kept at bay on the west side of the misipi by the spanish force under advice from yrujo who has been duped by burr to believe he means only the capture of n orleans  the separation of the western country this is a summary of the orders given but if they vary in any point from what the secretaries of war and of the     navy direct you are to suppose that i recite them incorrectly  that theirs are the real orders which it is my intention should be followed do not suffer yourself to be lulled into a moments delay by any information which shall not come to you in the most unquestionable form should he get possession of n orleans measures are now taking for its immediate recovery and for calling forth such a force as will be sufficient he has been able to decoy a great proportion of his people by making them believe the government secretly approves of this expedition against the spanish territories we are looking with anxiety to see what exertions the western country will make in the first instance for their own defence and i confess that my confidence in them is entire  thomas jefferson dec    0  washington thomas leiper to thomas leiper j mss washington dec    0  dear sir —this is merely a private letter intended for yourself individually if i have not answered the very friendly  flattering address i received through you and the many others i have received it is not from an insensibility to their kind and gratifying contents no man feels them more powerfully than i do no breast ever felt more consolation from such testimonies of good will and the having given no answer to them has been the   0 hardest act of self denial i have been called upon to perform but on consultation with friends here there is but one opinion that the question presented by these addresses cannot be touched without endangering the harmony of the present session of congress and disturbing the tranquility of the nation itself prematurely  injuriously i express these sentiments to you privately because they will enable you to give in conversation a true solution to the fact of my giving no answer the present session is important as having new  great questions to decide  in the decision of which no schismatic view should take any part it may become still more important should the measures we have taken fail to suppress the insurrectionary expedition now going on under colo burr a few days will let us know whether the western states suppress that enterprise or whether it is to require from us a serious national armament our little band in congress has as yet been quiet but some think it is from a sense of importance not a conviction of error or motives of good will but all these schisms small or great only accumulate truths of the solid qualifications of our citizens for self government accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great  constant esteem thomas jefferson dec    0  washington robert smith to the secretary of the navy robert smith j mss washington dec    0  dear sir —yours of yesterday has been duly considered what i had myself in contemplation     was to wait until we got news from louisville of dec    the day of burrs proposed general rendezvous the post comes from thence in    days the mail next expected will be of that date if we then find that his force has had no effectual opposition at either mariette or cincinnati  will not be stopped at louisville then without depending on the opposition at fort adams tho i have more dependence on that than on any other i should propose to lay the whole matter before congress ask an immediate appropriation for a naval equipment and at the same time order  0000 militia or volunteers from the western states to proceed down the river to retake n o presuming our naval equipment would be there before them in the meantime i would recommend to you to be getting ready  giving orders of preparation to the officers and vessels which we can get speedily ready that is to say the   sloops at washington the   gunboats and ketch at n york the   gunboats not including no   and ketch at norfolk  the   gunboats at charleston all this on the supposition that the officers are of opinion that the gunboats can be safely sent at this season we now see what would be the value of strong vessels of little draught for the shoaly coasts of the gulf of mexico at any rate we should have some as powerful as a    feet draught of water could be made to bear affectionate salutations     thomas jefferson january     0  washington james wilkinson to the governor of new orleans james wilkinson j mss washington january     0  dear sir —i had intended yesterday to recommend to general dearborne the writing to you weekly by post to convey information of our western affairs so long as they are interesting because it is possible though not probable you might sometimes get the information quicker this way than down the river but the general received yesterday information of the death of his son in the east indies and of course cannot now attend to business i therefore write you a hasty line for the present week and send it in duplicate by the athens and the nashville routes the information in the enclosed paper as to proceedings in the state of ohio is correct blennerhassets flotilla of fifteen boats and two hundred barrels of provisions is seized and there can be no doubt that tylers flotilla is also taken because on the   th of december we know there was a sufficient force assembled at cincinnati to intercept it there and another party was in pursuit of it on the river above we are assured that these two flotillas composed the whole of the boats provided blennerhasset and tyler had fled down the river i do not believe that the number of persons engaged for burr has ever amounted to five hundred though some have carried them to one thousand or fifteen hundred a part of these were engaged as settlers of bastrops land but the greater part of these were engaged under the express assurance that the projected     enterprise was against mexico and secretly authorized by this government many were expressly enlisted in the name of the united states the proclamation which reached pittsburgh december  d and the other parts of the river successively undeceived both these classes and of course drew them off and i have never seen any proof of their having assembled more than forty men in two boats from beaver fifty in tylers flotilla and the boatmen of blennerhassets i believe therefore that the enterprise may be considered as crushed but we are not to relax in our attentions until we hear what has passed at louisville if everything from that place upwards be successfully arrested there is nothing from below that is to be feared be assured that tennessee and particularly general jackson are faithful the orders lodged at massac and the chickasaw bluffs will probably secure the interception of such fugitives from justice as may escape from louisville so that i think you will never see one of them still i would not wish till we hear from louisville that you should relax your preparations in the least except so far as to dispense with the militia of mississippi and orleans leaving their homes under our order of november   th only let them consider themselves under requisition and be in a state of readiness should any force too great for your regulars escape down the river you will have been sensible that those orders were given while we supposed you were on the sabine and the supposed crisis did not admit the formality of their being passed through you we had considered fort     adams as the place to make a stand because it covered the mouth of the red river you have preferred new orleans on the apprehension of a fleet from the west indies be assured there is not any foundation for such an expectation but the lying exaggerations of those traitors to impose on others and swell their pretended means the very man whom they represented to you as gone to jamaica and to bring the fleet has never been from home and has regularly communicated to me everything which had passed between burr and him no such proposition was ever hazarded to him france or spain would not send a fleet to take vera cruz and though one of the expeditions now near arriving from england is probably for vera cruz and perhaps already there yet the state of things between us renders it impossible they should countenance an enterprise unauthorized by us still i repeat that these grounds of security must not stop our proceedings or preparations until they are further confirmed go on therefore with your works for the defence of new orleans because they will always be useful only looking to what should be permanent rather than means merely temporary you may expect further information as we receive it and though i expect it will be such as will place us at our ease yet we must not place ourselves so until it be certain but act on the possibility that the resources of our enemy may be greater and deeper than we are yet informed your two confidential messengers delivered their charges safely one arrived yesterday only with     your letter of november   th the oral communications he made me are truly important i beseech you to take the most special care of the two letters which he mentioned to me the one in cypher the other from another of the conspirators of high standing and to send them to me by the first conveyance you can trust it is necessary that all important testimony should be brought to one centre in order that the guilty may be convicted and the innocent left untroubled accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great esteem and respect      thomas jefferson january     0  albert gallatin

thank you for your friendly attention to the offer of lands adjoining me for sale it is true that i have always wished to purchase a part of what was murrays tract which would straiten the lines of the poplar forest but i really am not able to make a purchase i had hoped to keep the expences of my office within the limits of its salary so as apply my private income entirely to the improvement  enlargement of my estate but i have not been able to do it our affairs with spain after which you     enquire do not promise the result we wish not that war will take place immediately but they may go off without a settlement and leave us in constant bickering about indemnification for spoliations the navigation of the mobille and the limits of louisiana burrs enterprise is the most extraordinary since the days of don quixot it is so extravagant that those who know his understanding would not believe it if the proofs admitted doubt he has meant to place himself on the throne of montezuma and extend his empire to the allegany seizing on n orleans as the instrument of compulsion for our western states i think his undertaking effectually crippled by the activity of ohio whether kentucky will give him the coup de grâce is doubtful but if he is able to descend the river with any means we are sufficiently prepared at new orleans i hope however kentucky will do its duty  finish the matter for

inst and am ever thankful for communications which may guide me in the duties which i wish to perform as well as i am able it is but too true that great discontents exist in the territory of orleans those of the french inhabitants have for their sources   the prohibition of importing slaves this may be partly removed by congress permitting them to receive slaves from the other states which by dividing that evil would lessen its danger   the administration of justice in our forms principles  language with all of which they are unacquainted  are the more abhorrent because of the enormous expense greatly exaggerated by the corruption of bankrupt  greedy lawyers who have gone there from the ud s  engrossed the practice   the call on them by the land commissioners to produce the titles of their lands the object of this is really to record  secure their rights but as many of them hold on rights so ancient that the title papers are lost they expect the land is to be taken from them wherever they cannot produce a regular deduction of title in writing in this they will be undeceived by the final result which will evince to them a liberal disposition of the government towards them among     the american inhabitants it is the old division of federalists  republicans the former are as hostile there as they are everywhere  are the most numerous  wealthy they have been long endeavoring to batter down the governor who has always been a firm republican there were characters superior to him whom i wished to appoint but they refused the office i know no better man who would accept of it and it would not be right to turn him out for one not better but it is the  d cause above mentioned which is deepseated  permanent the french members of the legislature being the majority in both houses lately passed an act declaring that the civil or french laws should be the laws of their land and enumerated about  0 folio volumes in latin as the depositories of these laws the governor negatived the act one of the houses thereupon passed a vote for selfdissolution of the legislature as a useless body which failed in the other house by a single vote only they separated however  have disseminated all the discontent they could i propose to the members of congress in conversation the enlisting  0000 volunteers americans by birth to be carried at the public expense  settled immediately on a bounty of   0 acres of land each on the west side of the mississippi on the condition of giving two years of military service if that country should be attacked within   years the defence of the country would thus be placed on the spot and the additional number would entitle the territory to become a state would make the majority american  make it an american instead of a french state this would not     sweeten the pill to the french but in making that acquisition we had some view to our own good as well as theirs and i believe the greatest good of both will be promoted by whatever will amalgamate us together i have tired you my friend with a long letter but your tedium will end in a few lines more mine has yet two years to endure i am tired of an office where i can do no more good than many others who would be glad to be employed in it to myself personally it brings nothing but unceasing drudgery  daily loss of friends every office becoming vacant every appointment made me donne un ingrat et cent ennemis my only consolation is in the belief that my fellow citizens at large give me credit for good intentions i will certainly endeavor to merit the continuance of that goodwill which follows wellintended actions and their approbation will be the dearest reward i can carry into retirement god bless you my excellent friend and give you yet many

republished whether this be by public or private enterprise my end will be equally answered the work divides itself into two very distinct parts to wit the printed and the unprinted laws the former begin in      purvis collection my collection of these is in strong volumes well bound and therefore may safely be transported anywhere any of these volumes which you do not possess are at your service for the purpose of republication but the unprinted laws are dispersed through many msvolumes several of them so decayed that the leaf can never be opened but once without falling into powder these can never bear removal further than from their shelf to a table they are as well as i recollect from      downwards i formerly made such a digest of their order and the     volumes where they are to be found that under my own superintendence they could be copied with once handling more they would not bear hence the impracticability of their being copied but at monticello but independent of them the printed laws beginning in      with all our former printed collections will be a most valuable publication  sufficiently distinct i shall have no doubt of the exactness of your part of the work but i hope you will take measures for having the typography  paper worthy of the work i am lead to this caution by the scandalous volume of our laws printed by pleasants in   0   those by davis

copy of a letter from colo burr to the general affirming that mr alston his soninlaw is engaged in the unlawful enterprises he is carrying on and is to be an actor in them i am to add also that i have received information from another source that mr alston while returning from kentucky last autumn through the upper part of your state proposed to a mr butler of that part of the country to join in colo burrs enterprise which he represented as of a nature to make his fortune  is understood to have been explained as against mexico as well as for separating the union of these states that butler communicated this to a person of the same part of the country called span who communicated it to a mr horan the clerk of a court in that quarter that butler  span agreed to join in the enterprise but horan refused     nobody is a better judge than yourself whether any  what measures can be taken on this information as to genl wilkinsons affidavit it will be laid before the legislature in a few days and of course will be publick but as to the other part if no use can be made of it your own discretion  candor would lead you to keep it secret it is further well known here that mr alston is an endorser to a considerable amount of the bills which have enabled colo burr to prepare his treasons a message which i shall send into the legislature two days hence will give a development of them i avail myself with pleasure of this opportunity of recalling myself to your recollection  of assuring you of my constant esteem  high consideration  thomas jefferson january      0  special message on burr   january      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states agreeably to the request of the house of representatives communicated in their resolution of the     sixteenth instant i proceed to state under the reserve therein expressed information received touching an illegal combination of private individuals against the peace and safety of the union and a military expedition planned by them against the territories of a power in amity with the united states with the measures i have pursued for suppressing the same i had for some time been in constant expectation of receiving such further information as would have enabled me to lay before the legislature the termination as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity so far it has been acted on the ohio and its waters from this the state and safety of the lower country might have been estimated on     probable grounds and the delay was indulged the rather because no circumstance had yet made it necessary to call in the aid of the legislative functions information now recently communicated has brought us nearly to the period contemplated the mass of what i have received in the course of these transactions is voluminous but little has been given under the sanction of an oath so as to constitute formal and legal evidence it is chiefly in the form of letters often containing such a mixture of rumors conjectures and suspicions as render it difficult to sift out the real facts and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines strengthened by concurrent information or the particular credibility of the relater in this state of the evidence delivered sometimes too under the restriction of private confidence neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names except that of the principal actor whose guilt is placed beyond question some time in the latter part of september i received intimations that designs were in agitation in the western country unlawful and unfriendly to the peace of the union and that the prime mover in these was aaron burr heretofore distinguished by the favor of his country the grounds of these intimations being inconclusive the objects uncertain and the fidelity of that country known to be firm the only measure taken was to urge the informants to use their best endeavors to get further insight into the designs and proceedings of the suspected persons and to communicate them to me it was not until the latter part of october that the     objects of the conspiracy began to be perceived but still so blended and involved in mystery that nothing distinct could be singled out for pursuit in this state of uncertainty as to the crime contemplated the acts done and the legal course to be pursued i thought it best to send to the scene where these things were principally in transaction a person in whose integrity understanding and discretion entire confidence could be reposed with instructions to investigate the plots going on to enter into conference for which he had sufficient credentials with the governors and all other officers civil and military and with their aid to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the designs of the conspirators arrest their means bring their persons to punishment and to call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which it should be found they were engaged by this time it was known that many boats were under preparation stores of provisions collecting and an unusual number of suspicious characters in motion on the ohio and its waters besides despatching the confidential agent to that quarter orders were at the same time sent to the governors of the orleans and mississippi territories and to the commanders of the land and naval forces there to be on their guard against surprise and in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which might be attempted on the vessels posts or other objects under their care and on the  th of november instructions were forwarded to general wilkinson to hasten an accommodation with the spanish commander on the sabine and as   0 soon as that was effected to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the mississippi for the defence of the intersecting points on that river by a letter received from that officer on the   th of november but dated october   st we learn that a confidential agent of aaron burr had been deputed to him with communications partly written in cipher and partly oral explaining his designs exaggerating his resources and making such offers of emolument and command to engage him and the army in his unlawful enterprise as he had flattered himself would be successful the general with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a good citizen immediately despatched a trusty officer to me with information of what had passed proceeding to establish such an understanding with the spanish commandant on the sabine as permitted him to withdraw his force across the mississippi and to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise the generals letter which came to hand on the   th of november as has been mentioned and some other information received a few days earlier when brought together developed burrs general designs different parts of which only had been revealed to different informants it appeared that he contemplated two distinct objects which might be carried on either jointly or separately and either the one or the other first as circumstances should direct one of these was the severance of the union of these states by the alleghany mountains the other an attack on mexico a third object was provided merely ostensible to wit the settlement of     a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the washita claimed by a baron bastrop this was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations an allurement for such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country and a cover under which to retreat in the event of final discomfiture of both branches of his real design he found at once that the attachment of the western country to the present union was not to be shaken that its dissolution could not be effected with the consent of its inhabitants and that his resources were inadequate as yet to effect it by force he took his course then at once determined to seize on new orleans plunder the bank there possess himself of the military and naval stores and proceed on his expedition to mexico and to this object all his means and preparations were now directed he collected from all the quarters where himself or his agents possessed influence all the ardent restless desperate and disaffected persons who were ready for any enterprise analogous to their characters he seduced good and wellmeaning citizens some by assurances that he possessed the confidence of the government and was acting under its secret patronage a pretence which obtained some credit from the state of our differences with spain and others by offers of land in bastrops claim on the washita this was the state of my information of his proceedings about the last of november at which time therefore it was first possible to take specific measures to meet them the proclamation of november   th two days after the receipt of general     wilkinsons information was now issued orders were despatched to every intersecting point on the ohio and mississippi from pittsburg to new orleans for the employment of such force either of the regulars or of the militia and of such proceedings also of the civil authorities as might enable them to seize on all the boats and stores provided for the enterprise to arrest the persons concerned and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise a little before the receipt of these orders in the state of ohio our confidential agent who had been diligently employed in investigating the conspiracy had acquired sufficient information to open himself to the governor of that state and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the state to crush the combination governor tiffin and the legislature with a promptitude an energy and patriotic zeal which entitle them to a distinguished place in the affection of their sister states effected the seizure of all the boats provisions and other preparations within their reach and thus gave a first blow materially disabling the enterprise in its outset in kentucky a premature attempt to bring burr to justice without sufficient evidence for his conviction had produced a popular impression in his favor and a general disbelief of his guilt this gave him an unfortunate opportunity of hastening his equipments the arrival of the proclamation and orders and the application and information of our confidential agent at length awakened the authorities of that state to the truth and then produced the same     promptitude and energy of which the neighboring state had set the example under an act of their legislature of december   d militia was instantly ordered to different important points and measures taken for doing whatever could yet be done some boats accounts vary from five to double or treble that number and persons differently estimated from one to three hundred had in the meantime passed the falls of the ohio to rendezvous at the mouth of the cumberland with others expected down that river not apprized till very late that any boats were building on cumberland the effect of the proclamation had been trusted to for some time in the state of tennessee but on the   th of december similar communications and instructions with those of the neighboring states were despatched by express to the governor and a general officer of the western division of the state and on the   d of december our confidential agent left frankfort for nashville to put into activity the means of that state also but by information received yesterday i learn that on the   d of december mr burr descended the cumberland with two boats merely of accommodation carrying with him from that state no quota toward his unlawful enterprise whether after the arrival of the proclamation of the orders or of our agent any exertion which could be made by that state or the orders of the governor of kentucky for calling out the militia at the mouth of cumberland would be in time to arrest these boats and those from the falls of the ohio is still doubtful     on the whole the fugitives from ohio with their associates from cumberland or any other place in that quarter cannot threaten serious danger to the city of new orleans by the same express of december nineteenth orders were sent to the governors of new orleans and mississippi supplementary to those which had been given on the twentyfifth of november to hold the militia of their territories in readiness to cooperate for their defence with the regular troops and armed vessels then under command of general wilkinson great alarm indeed was excited at new orleans by the exaggerated accounts of mr burr disseminated through his emissaries of the armies and navies he was to assemble there general wilkinson had arrived there himself on the   th of november and had immediately put into activity the resources of the place for the purpose of its defence and on the tenth of december he was joined by his troops from the sabine great zeal was shown by the inhabitants generally the merchants of the place readily agreeing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for manning the armed vessels with their seamen and the other citizens manifesting unequivocal fidelity to the union and a spirit of determined resistance to their expected assailants surmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive aid from certain foreign powers but these surmises are without proof or probability the wisdom of the measures sanctioned by congress at its last session had placed us in the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with whom we had     any differences and nothing has happened since which makes it either their interest or ours to pursue another course no change of measures has taken place on our part none ought to take place at this time with the one friendly arrangement was then proposed and the law deemed necessary on the failure of that was suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue with the same power negotiation is still preferred and provisional measures only are necessary to meet the event of rupture while therefore we do not deflect in the slightest degree from the course we then assumed and are still pursuing with mutual consent to restore a good understanding we are not to impute to them practices as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith and changing necessarily the relations of peace and justice between us to those of war these surmises are therefore to be imputed to the vauntings of the author of this enterprise to multiply his partisans by magnifying the belief of his prospects and support by letters from general wilkinson of the   th and   th of september which came to hand two days after date of the resolution of the house of representatives that is to say on the morning of the   th instant i received the important affidavit a copy of which i now communicate with extracts of so much of the letters as come within the scope of the resolution by these it will be seen that of three of the principal emissaries of mr burr whom the general had caused to be apprehended one had been liberated by habeas corpus and the two others being those particularly employed in the endeavor to     corrupt the general and army of the united states have been embarked by him for our ports in the atlantic states probably on the consideration that an impartial trial could not be expected during the present agitations of new orleans and that that city was not as yet a safe place of confinement as soon as these persons shall arrive they will be delivered to the custody of the law and left to such course of trial both as to place and process as its functionaries may direct the presence of the highest judicial authorities to be assembled at this place within a few days the means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere and the aid of the executive means should the judges have occasion to use them render it equally desirable for the criminals as for the public that being already removed from the place where they were first apprehended the first regular arrest should take place here and the course of proceedings receive here its proper direction thomas jefferson january      0  special message on burr january      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— by the letters of captain bissel who commands at fort massac and of mr murrell to general jackson of tennessee copies of which are now communicated to congress it will be seen that aaron burr passed fort massac on the   st december with about ten boats navigated by about six hands each without     any military appearance and that three boats with ammunition were said to have been arrested by the militia at louisville as the guards of militia posted on various points on the ohio will be able to prevent any further aids passing through that channel should any be attempted we may now estimate with tolerable certainty the means derived from the ohio and its waters toward the accomplishment of the purposes of mr burr thomas jefferson february  d   0  washington h d tiffin to the governor of ohio h d tiffin j mss washington february  d   0  sir —the pressure of business during a session of the legislature has rendered me more tardy in addressing you than it was my wish to have been that our fellow citizens of the west would need only to be informed of criminal machinations against the public safety to crush them at once i never entertained a doubt i have seen with the greatest satisfaction that among those who have distinguished themselves by their fidelity to their country on the occasion of the enterprise of mr burr yourself  the legislature of ohio have been the most eminent the promptitude  energy displayed by your state has been as honorable to itself as salutary to its sister states and in declaring that you have deserved well of your country i do but express the grateful sentiment of every faithful citizen in it the hand of the people has given the mortal blow to a conspiracy     which in other countries would have called for an appeal to armies and has proved that government to be the strongest of which every man feels himself a part it is a happy illustration too of the importance of preserving to the state authorities all that vigor which the constitution foresaw would be necessary not only for their own safety but for that of the whole in making these acknowledgments of the merit of having set this illustrious example of exertion for the common safety i pray that they may be considered as addressed to yourself  the legislature particularly  generally to every citizen who has availed himself of the opportunity given of proving his devotion to his country accept my salutations  assurances of great consideration  esteem      dearborn smith february  0   0  special message on gunboats   february  0   0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— in compliance with the request of the house of representatives expressed in their resolution of the  th instant i proceed to give such information as is possessed of the effect of gunboats in the protection and defence of harbors of the numbers thought necessary and of the proposed distribution of them among the ports and harbors of the united states under the present circumstances and governed   0 by the intentions of the legislature as manifested by their annual appropriations of money for the purposes of defence it has been concluded to combine— st land batteries furnished with heavy cannon and mortars and established on all the points around the place favorable for preventing vessels from lying before it  d movable artillery which may be carried as an occasion may require to points unprovided with fixed batteries  d floating batteries and  th gunboats which may oppose an enemy at its entrance and cooperate with the batteries for his expulsion on this subject professional men were consulted as far as we had opportunity general wilkinson and the late general gates gave their opinions in writing in favor of the system as will be seen by their letters now communicated the higher officers of the navy gave the same opinions in separate conferences as their presence at the seat of government offered occasions of consulting them and no difference of judgment appeared on the subjects those of commodore barron and captain tingey now here are recently furnished in writing and transmitted herewith to the legislature the efficacy of gunboats for the defence of harbors and of other smooth and enclosed waters may be estimated in part from that of galleys formerly much used but less powerful more costly in their construction and maintenance and requiring more men but the gunboat itself is believed to be in use with every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defence in the mediterranean on which     are several small powers whose system like ours is peace and defence few harbors are without this article of protection our own experience there of the effect of gunboats for harbor service is recent algiers is particularly known to have owed to a great provision of these vessels the safety of its city since the epoch of their construction before that it had been repeatedly insulted and injured the effect of gunboats at present in the neighborhood of gibraltar is well known and how much they were used both in the attack and defence of that place during a former war the extensive resort to them by the two greatest naval powers in the world on an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect shows their confidence in their efficacy for the purposes for which they are suited by the northern powers of europe whose seas are particularly adapted to them they are still more used the remarkable action between the russian flotilla of gunboats and galleys and a turkish fleet of shipsoftheline and frigates in the liman sea      will be readily recollected the latter commanded by their most celebrated admiral were completely defeated and several of their shipsoftheline destroyed      from the opinions given as to the number of gunboats necessary for some of the principal seaports and from a view of all the towns and ports from orleans to maine inclusive entitled to protection in proportion to their situation and circumstances it is     concluded that to give them a due measure of protection in time of war about two hundred gunboats will be requisite according to first ideas the following would be their general distribution liable to be varied on more mature examination and as circumstances shall vary that is to say— to the mississippi and its neighboring waters forty gunboats to savannah and charleston and the harbors on each side from st marys to currituck twentyfive to the chesapeake and its waters twenty to delaware bay and river fifteen to new york the sound and waters as far as cape cod fifty to boston and the harbors north of cape cod fifty the flotilla assigned to these several stations might each be under the care of a particular commandant and the vessels composing them would in ordinary be distributed among the harbors within the station in proportion to their importance of these boats a proper proportion would be of the larger size such as those heretofore built capable of navigating any seas and of reinforcing occasionally the strength of even the most distant port when menaced with danger the residue would be confined to their own or the neighboring harbors would be smaller less furnished for accommodation and consequently less costly of the number supposed necessary seventythree are built or building and the hundred and twentyseven still to be provided would cost from five to six hundred thousand dollars     having regard to the convenience of the treasury as well as to the resources of building it has been thought that one half of these might be built in the present year and the other half the next with the legislature however it will rest to stop where we are or at any further point when they shall be of opinion that the number provided shall be sufficient for the object at times when europe as well as the united states shall be at peace it would not be proposed that more than six or eight of these vessels should be kept afloat when europe is in war treble that number might be necessary to be distributed among those particular harbors which foreign vessels of war are in the habit of frequenting for the purpose of preserving order therein but they would be manned in ordinary with only their complement for navigation relying on the seamen and militia of the port if called into action on sudden emergency it would be only when the united states should themselves be at war that the whole number would be brought into actual service and would be ready in the first moments of the war to cooperate with other means for covering at once the line of our seaports at all times those unemployed would be withdrawn into places not exposed to sudden enterprise hauled up under sheds from the sun and weather and kept in preservation with little expense for repairs or maintenance it must be superfluous to observe that this species of naval armament is proposed merely for defensive operation that it can have but little effect toward     protecting our commerce in the open seas even on our coast and still less can it become an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war toward which it would furnish no means      thomas jefferson february      0  washington thomas seymour to thomas seymour j mss washington february      0  sir —the mass of business which occurs during a session of the legislature renders me necessarily unpunctual in acknowledging the receipt of letters and in answering those which will admit of delay this must be my apology for being so late in noticing the receipt of the letter of december  0th addressed to me by yourself and several other republican characters of your state of high respectability i have seen with deep concern the afflicting oppression under     which the republican citizens of connecticut suffer from an unjust majority the truths expressed in your letter have been long exposed to the nation through the channel of the public papers and are the more readily believed because most of the states during the momentary ascendancy of kindred majorities in them have seen the same spirit of oppression prevail with respect to the countervailing prosecutions now instituted in the court of the u s in connecticut i had heard but little  certainly i believe     never expressed a sentiment on them that a spirit of indignation and retaliation should arise when an opportunity should present itself was too much within the human constitution to excite either surprise or censure and confined to an appeal to truth only it cannot lessen the useful freedom of the press as to myself conscious that there was not a truth on earth which i feared should be known i have lent myself willingly as the subject of a great experiment which was to prove that an administration conducting itself with integrity and common understanding cannot be battered down even by the falsehoods of a licentious press and consequently still less by the press as restrained within the legal  wholesome limits of truth this experiment was wanting for the world to demonstrate the falsehood of the pretext that freedom of the press is incompatible with orderly government i have never therefore even contradicted the thousands of calumnies so industriously propagated against myself but the fact being once established that the press is impotent when it abandons itself to falsehood i leave to others to restore it to its strength by recalling it within the pale of truth within that it is a noble institution equally the friend of science  of civil liberty if this can once be effected in your state i trust we shall soon see its citizens rally to the republican principles of our constitution which unite their sisterstates into one family it would seem impossible that an intelligent people with the faculty of reading  right of thinking should     continue much longer to slumber under the pupilage of an interested aristocracy of priests  lawyers persuading them to distrust themselves  to let them think for them i sincerely wish that your efforts may awaken them from this voluntary degradation of mind restore them to a due estimate of themselves  their fellowcitizens and a just abhorrence of the falsehoods  artifices which have seduced them experience of the use made by federalism of whatever comes from me obliges me to suggest the caution of considering my letter as private i pray you to present me respectfully to the other gentlemen who joined in the letter to me  to whom this is equally addressed and to accept yourself my

beyond the extent of a letter and as i hope to see you ere long at monticello it can then be more effectually done verbally let me observe however generally that it is impossible for my friends to render me ever so acceptable a favor as by communicating to me without reserve facts  opinions i have none of that sort of selflove which winces at it indeed both selflove  the desire to do what is best strongly invite unreserved communication there is one subject which will not admit a delay till i see you mr t m randolph is i believe determined to retire from congress and it is strongly his wish  that of all here that you should take his place never did the calls of patriotism more loudly assail you than at this moment after excepting the federalists who will be    and the little band of schismatics who will be   or   all tongue     the residue of the h of r is as well disposed a body of men as i ever saw collected but there is no one whose talents  standing taken together have weight enough to give him the lead the consequence is that there is no one who will undertake to do the public business and it remains undone were you here the whole would rally round you in an instant and willingly cooperate in whatever is for the public good nor would it require you to undertake drudgery in the house there are enough able  willing to do that a rallying point is all that is wanting let

washington robert brent to robert brent  j mss washington mar  0   0  sir —i have received your letter of yesterday asking the application of a part of a late appropriation of congress to certain avenues and roads in this place the only appropriation ever before made by congress to an object of this nature was to the public buildings  the highways between them this ground was deliberately taken and i accordingly restrained the application of the money to the avenue between the capitol  the executive buildings and the roads round the two squares     the last appropriation was in terms much more lax to wit for avenues  roads in the district of columbia this indeed would take in a large field but besides that we cannot suppose congress intended to tax the people of the u s at large for all the avenues in washington  roads in columbia we know the fact to have been that the expression was strongly objected to and was saved merely from a want of time to discuss the last day of the session and the fear of losing the whole bill but the sum appropriated  000 d shews they did not mean it for so large a field for by the time the pennsylva avenue between the two houses is widened newly gravelled planted brick tunnels instead of wood the roads round the squares put in order  that in the south front of the war office dug down to its proper level there will be no more of the  000 d left than will be wanting for constant repairs with this view of the just and probable intention of the legislature i shall not think myself authorized to take advantage of a lax expression forced on by circumstances to carry the execution of the law into a region of expense which would merit great consideration before they should embark in it accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great esteem and respect thomas jefferson march      0  washington circular letter to the governors of kentucky tennessee ohio and mississippi j mss washington march      0  sir —altho the present state of things on the western side of the mississippi does not threaten     any immediate collision with our neighbors in that quarter and it is our wish they should remain undisturbed until an amicable adjustment may take place yet as this does not depend on ourselves alone it has been thought prudent to be prepared to meet any movements which may occur the law of a former session of congress for keeping a body of  00000 militia in readiness for service at a moments warning is still in force but by an act of the last session a copy of which i now enclose the executive is authorized to accept the services of such volunteers as shall offer themselves on the conditions of the act which may render a resort to the former act unnecessary it is for the execution of this act that i am now to solicit your zealous endeavors the persons who shall engage will not be called from their homes until some aggression committed or intended shall render it necessary when called into action it will not be for a lounging but for an active  perhaps distant service i know the effect of this consideration in kindling that ardour which prevails for this service  i count on it for filling up the numbers requisite without delay to yourself i am sure it must be as desirable as it is to me to transfer this service from the great mass of our militia to that portion of them to whose habits and enterprise active  distant service is most congenial in using therefore your best exertions towards accomplishing the object of this act you will render to your constituents as well as to the nation a most acceptable service with respect to the organizing and officering those     who shall be engaged within your state the act itself will be your guide and as it is desirable that we should be kept informed of the progress in this business i must pray you to report the same from time to time to the secretary at war who will correspond with you on all the details arising out of it i salute you with great consideration and respect thomas jefferson march      0  washington james monroe to the united states minister to great britain  james monroe j mss washington march      0  dear sir —a copy of the treaty with gr britain came to mr erskines hands on the last day of the session of congress which he immediately communicated to us and since that mr purviance has arrived with an original on the subject of it you will receive a letter from the secretary of state of about this date and one more in detail hereafter i should not have written but that i perceive uncommon efforts and with uncommon wickedness are making by the federal papers to produce mischief between myself personally  our negociators and also to irritate the british government by putting a     thousand speeches into my mouth not one word of which i ever uttered i have therefore thought it safe to guard you by stating the view which we have given out on the subject of the treaty in conversation  otherwise for ours as you know is a government which will not tolerate the being kept entirely in the dark and especially on a subject so interesting as this treaty we immediately stated in conversation to the members of the legislature  others that having by a letter received in january perceived that our ministers might sign a treaty not providing satisfactorily against the impressment of our seamen we had on the  d of feb informed you that should such an one have been forwarded it could not be ratified  recommending therefore that you should resume negociations for inserting an article to that effect that we should hold the treaty in suspense until we could learn from you the result of our instructions which probably would not be till summer  then decide on the question of calling the senate we observed too that a written declaration of the british commissioners given in at the time of signature would of itself unless withdrawn prevent the acceptance of any treaty because its effect was to leave us bound by the treaty and themselves totally unbound this is the statement we have given out and nothing more of the contents of the treaty has ever been made known but depend on it my dear sir that it will be considered as a hard treaty when it is known the british commisrs appear to have screwed every article as far as it would bear to have taken everything      yielded nothing take out the   th article and the evil of all the others so much overweighs the good that we should be glad to expunge the whole and even the   th article admits only that we may enjoy our right to the indirect colonial trade during the present hostilities if peace is made this year and war resumed the next the benefit of this stipulation is gone and yet we are bound for  0 years to pass no nonimportation or nonintercourse laws nor take any other measures to restrain the unjust pretensions  practices of the british but on this you will hear from the secretary of state if the treaty cannot be put into acceptable form then the next best thing is to back out of the negotiation as well as we can letting that die away insensibly but in the meantime agreeing informally that both parties shall act on the principles of the treaty so as to preserve that friendly understanding which we sincerely desire until the one or the other may be deposed to yield the points which divide us this will leave you to follow your desire of coming home as soon as you see the amendment of the treaty is desperate the power of continuing the negociations will pass over to mr pinckney who by procrastinations can let it die away and give us time the most precious of all things to us the government of new orleans is still without such a head as i wish the salary of  000 d is too small but i am assured the orleans legislature would make it adequate would you accept it it is the  d office in the u s in importance and i am still in hopes you will accept it it is impossible to let you stay     at home while the public has so much need of talents i am writing under a severe indisposition of periodical headache with scarcely command enough of my mind to know what i write as a part of this letter concerns mr pinckney as well as yourself be so good as to communicate so much of it to him and with my best respects to him to mrs monroe and your daughter be assured yourself in all cases of my constant  affectionate friendship  attachment      thomas jefferson march      0  henry dearborn to the secretary of war henry dearborn j mss march      0  many officers of the army being involved in the offence of intending a military enterprise against a nation at peace with the united states to remove the whole without trial by the paramount authority of the executive would be a proceeding of unusual severity some line must therefore be drawn to separate the more from the less guilty the only sound one which occurs to me is between those who     believe the enterprise was with the approbation of the government open or secret  those who meant to proceed in defiance of the government concealment would be no line at all because all concealed it applying the line of defiance to the case of l mead it does not appear by any testimony i have seen that he meant to proceed in defiance of the government but on the contrary that he was made to believe the government approved of the expedition if it be objected that he concealed a part of what had taken place in his communications to the secretary at war yet if a concealment of the whole would not furnish a proper line of distinction still less would the concealment of a part this too would be a removal for prevarication not for unauthorized enterprise  could not be a proper ground for exercising the extraordinary power of removal by the president on the whole i think lieutn meades is not a case for its exercise affectionate salutations thomas jefferson apr   0  washington james

invaluable secretary doing its work with correctness facility  secrecy i repeat my request of your acceptance of it as a mark of my esteem  respect you heard in due time from london of the signature of a treaty there between gr br  the u s by a letter we received in january from our minister at london we found they were making up their minds to sign a treaty in which no provision was made against the impressment of our seamen contenting themselves with a note received in the course of their correspondence from the british negociators assuring them of the discretion with which impressments should be conducted which could be construed into a covenant only by inferences against which its omission in the treaty was a strong inference and its terms totally unsatisfactory by a letter of feb   they were immediately informed that no treaty not containing a satisfactory article on that head would be ratified and desiring them to resume the negociations on that point the treaty having come to us actually in the inadmissible shape apprehended we of course hold it up until we know the result of the instructions of feb   i have but little expectation that the british government     will retire from their habitual wrongs in the impressment of our seamen and a certainty that without that we will never tie up our hands by treaty from the right of passing a nonimportation or nonintercourse act to make it her interest to become just this may bring on a war of commercial restrictions to shew however the sincerity or our desire for conciliation i have suspended the importation act this state of things should be understood at paris and every effort used on your part to accommodate our differences with spain under the auspices of france with whom it is all important that we should stand in terms of the strictest cordiality in fact we are to depend on her  russia for the establishment of neutral rights by the treaty of peace among which should be that of taking no person by a belligerent out of a neutral ship unless they be the souldiers of an enemy never did a nation act towards another with more perfidy and injustice than spain has constantly practised against us and if we have kept our hands off her till now it has been purely out of respect for france  from the value we set on the friendship of france we expect therefore from the friendship of the emperor that he will either compel spain to do us justice or abandon her to us we ask but one month to be in possession of the city of mexico no better proof of the good faith of the u s could have been given than the vigour with which we have acted  the expence incurred in suppressing the enterprise meditated lately by burr against mexico altho at first he proposed a separation of the western country      on that ground received encouragement  aid from yrujo according to the usual spirit of his government towards us yet he very early saw that the fidelity of the western country was not to be shaken and turned himself wholly towards mexico and so popular is an enterprise on that country in this that we had only to be still  he could have had followers enough to have been in the city of mexico in   weeks you have doubtless seen my several messages to congress which give a faithful narrative of that conspiracy burr himself after being disarmed by our endeavours of all his followers escaped from the custody of the court of missipi but was taken near fort stoddert making his way to mobile by some country people who brought him on as a prisoner to richmond where he is now under a course for trial hitherto we have believed our law to be that suspicion on probable grounds was sufficient cause to commit a person for trial allowing time to collect witnesses till the trial but the judges here have decided that conclusive evidence of guilt must be ready in the moment of arrest or they will discharge the malefactor if this is still insisted on burr will be discharged because his crimes having been sown from maine thro the whole line of the western waters to n orleans we cannot bring the witnesses here under   months the fact is that the federalists make burrs cause their own and exert their whole influence to shield him from punishment as they did the adherents of miranda and it is unfortunate that federalism is still predominant in our judiciary

to take the necessary measures to enable these men to come on thomas jefferson april  0 0  monticello william branch giles to william branch giles j mss monticello april  0 0  dear sir —your favor of the  th on the subject of burrs offences was received only   days ago that there should be anxiety  doubt in the public mind in the present defective state of the proof is not wonderful and this has been sedulously encouraged by the tricks of the judges to force trials before it is possible to collect the evidence dispersed through     a line of  000 miles from maine to orleans the federalists too give all their aid making burrs cause their own mortified only that he did not separate the union or overturn the government  proving that had he had a little dawn of success they would have joined him to introduce his object their favorite monarchy as they would any other enemy foreign or domestic who could rid them of this hateful republic for any other government in exchange the first ground of complaint was the supine inattention of the administration to a treason stalking through the land in open day the present one that they have crushed it before it was ripe for execution so that no overt acts can be produced this last may be true tho i believe it is not our information having been chiefly by way of letter we do not know of a certainty yet what will be proved we have set on foot an inquiry through the whole of the country which has been the scene of these transactions to be able to prove to the courts if they will give time or to the public by way of communication to congress what the real facts have been for obtaining this we are obliged to appeal to the patriotism of particular persons in different places of whom we have requested to make the inquiry in their neighborhood and on such information as shall be voluntarily offered aided by no process or facilities from the federal courts but frowned on by their new born zeal for the liberty of those whom we would not permit to overthrow the liberties of their country we can expect no revealments from the accomplices of the chief offender of treasonable     intentions the judges have been obliged to confess there is probable appearance what loophole they will find in it when it comes to trial we cannot foresee eaton stoddart wilkinson and two others whom i must not name will satisfy the world if not the judges on that head and i do suppose the following overt acts will be proved   the enlistment of men in a regular way   the regular mounting of guard round blennerhassets island when they expected governor tiffins men to be on them modo guerrino arraiali   the rendezvous of burr with his men at the mouth of the cumberland   his letter to the acting governor of mississippi holding up the prospect of civil war   his capitulation regularly signed with the aids of the governor as between two independent  hostile commanders but a moments calculation will shew that this evidence cannot be collected under   months probably   from the moment of deciding when  where the trial shall be i desired mr rodney expressly to inform the chief justice of this inofficially but mr marshall says more than   weeks have elapsed since the opinion of the supreme court has declared the necessity of proving the overt acts if they exist why are they not proved in what terms of decency can we speak of this as if an express could go to natchez or the mouth of cumberland  return in   weeks to do which has never taken less than twelve again if in nov or dec last a body of troops had been assembled on the ohio it is impossible to suppose the affidavits establishing the     fact could not have been obtained by the last of march but i ask the judge where they should have been lodged at frankfort at cincinnati at nashville st louis natchez new orleans these were the probable places of apprehension  examination it was not known at washington till the   th of march that burr would escape from the western tribunals be retaken  brought to an eastern one and in   days after neither   months nor   weeks as the judge calculated he says it is impossible to suppose the affidavits could not have been obtained where at richmond he certainly meant or meant only to throw dust in the eyes of his audience but all the principles of law are to be perverted which would bear on the favorite offenders who endeavor to overrun this odious republic i understand sais the judge probable cause of guilt to be a case made out by proof furnishing good reason to believe c speaking as a lawyer he must mean legal proof i e proof on oath at least but this is confounding probability and proof we had always before understood that where there was reasonable ground to believe guilt the offender must be put on his trial that guilty intentions were probable the judge believed and as to the overt acts were not the bundle of letters of information in mr rodneys hands the letters and facts published in the local newspapers burrs flight  the universal belief or rumor of his guilt probable ground for presuming the facts of enlistment military guard rendezvous threats of civil war or capitulation so as to put him on trial is there a candid man in     the u s who does not believe some one if not all of these overt acts to have taken place if there ever had been an instance in this or the preceding administrations of federal judges so applying principles of law as to condemn a federal or acquit a republican offender i should have judged them in the present case with more charity all this however will work well the nation will judge both the offender  judges for themselves if a member of the executive or legislature does wrong the day is never far distant when the people will remove him they will see then  amend the error in our constitution which makes any branch independent of the nation they will see that one of the great coordinate branches of the government setting itself in opposition to the other two and to the common sense of the nation proclaims impunity to that class of offenders which endeavors to overturn the constitution and are themselves protected in it by the constitution itself for impeachment is a farce which will not be tried again if their protection of burr produces this amendment it will do more good than his condemnation would have done against burr personally i never had one hostile sentiment i never indeed thought him an honest frankdealing man but considered him as a crooked gun or other perverted machine whose aim or stroke you could never be sure of still while he possessed the confidence of the nation i thought it my duty to respect in him their confidence  to treat him as if he deserved it and if this punishment can be commuted now for any useful amendment of the     constitution i shall rejoice in it my sheet being full i perceive it is high time to offer you my friendly salutations and assure you of my constant and affectionate

yesterday and i now return you the letters of turreau yrujo and woodward and mr gallatins paper on foreign seamen i retain monroe  pinckneys letters to give them a more deliberate perusal than i can now before the departure of the post by the next they shall be returned i should think it best to answer turreau at once as he will ascribe delay to a supposed difficulty  will be sure to force an answer at last i take the true principle to be that for violations of jurisdiction with the consent of the sovereign or his voluntary sufferance indemnification is due but that for others he is bound only to use all reasonable means to obtain indemnification from the aggressor which must be calculated on his circumstances and these endeavors bonâ fide made  failing he is no further responsible it would be extraordinary indeed if we were to be answerable for the conduct of belligerents through our whole coasts whether inhabited or not will you be so good as to send a passport to julian v neimcewicz an american citizen of new jersey     going to europe on his private affairs i have known him intimately for  0 years the last    of which he has resided in the u s of which he has a certificate of citizenship he was the companion of kosciusko be so good as to direct it to him at elizabethtown and without delay as he is on his departure mr gallatins estimate of the number of foreign seamen in our employ renders it prudent i think to suspend all propositions respecting our nonemploiment of them as on a consultation when we were all together we had made up our minds on every article of the british treaty and this of not employing their seamen was only mentioned for further inquiry  consideration we had better let the negociations go on on the ground then agreed on  take time to consider this supplementary proposition such an addition as this to a treaty already so bad would fill up the measure of public condemnation it would indeed be making bad worse i am more  more convinced that our best course is to let the negociation take a friendly nap  endeavor in the meantime to practice on such of its principles as are mutually acceptable perhaps we may hereafter barter the stipulation not to employ their seamen for some equivalent to our flag by way of convention or perhaps the general treaty of peace may do better for us if we shall not in the meantime have done worse for ourselves at any rate it will not be the worse for lying three weeks longer i salute you with sincere affection p s will you be so good as to have me furnished with a copy of mr gallatins estimate of the   0 number of foreign seamen i think he overrates the number of officers greatly thomas jefferson apr    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j

burrs case for circulation under another cover is a letter from governor williams confidential  for yourself alone as yet i expect we shall have to remove meade under still a different cover you will receive monroes  pinckneys letters detained at the last post i wrote you then on the subject of the british treaty which the more it is developed the worse it appears mr rodney being supposed absent i enclose you a letter from mr reed advising the summoning rufus easton as a witness but if he is at st louis he cannot be here by the   d of may you will observe that governor williams asks immediate instructions what he shall do with blennerhasset tyler floyd  ralston i do not know that we can do anything but direct general wilkinson to receive  send them to any place where the judge shall decide they ought to be tried i suppose blennerhasset should come to richmond on consulting with the other gentlemen be so good as to write to williams immediately as a letter will barely get there by the

country mentioned by armstrong to have been made at paris is important but what is the declaration he speaks of for none accompanies his letter unless he means harry grants proposition i wish our ministers at paris london  madrid could find out burrs propositions  agents there i know few of the characters of the new british administration the few i know are true pittites  antiamerican from them we have nothing to hope but that they will readily let us back out whether they can hold their places will depend on the question whether the irish propositions be popular or unpopular in england dr sibley in a letter to gen dearborne corrects an error of fact in my message to congress of december he says the spaniards never had a single soldier at bayou pierre till apr   0  consequently it was not a keeping but a taking of a     military possession of that post i think gen dearborne would do well to desire sibley to send us affidavits of that fact our weather continues extremely

selected corps for a years distant service at least the classification of our militia is now the most essential thing the u s have to do whether on bonapartes plan of making a class for every year between certain periods or that recommended in my message i do not know but i rather incline to his the idea is not new as you may remember we adopted it once in virginia during the revolution but abandoned it too soon it is the real secret of bonapartes success could s h smith put better matter into his paper than the    pages above mentioned  will you suggest it to him no effort should be     spared to bring the public mind to this great point i salute you with sincere affection thomas jefferson may      0  william short to william short  may      0  my determination to retire is the result of mature reflections and on various considerations not the least weighty of these is that a consciousness that a decline of physical faculties can not leave those mental entirely unimpaired and it will be happy for me if i am the first who shall become sensible of it as to a successor there never will be a time when it will not produce some difficulty and never less i believe than at present that some of the federalists should prefer my continuance to the uncertainty of a successor i can readily believe there are among them men of candor who do not join in the clamor and condemnation of every thing nor pretend that even chance never throws us on a right measure there are some who know me personally and who give a credit to my intentions which they deny my understanding some who may fear a successor preferring a military glory of a nation to the prosperity and happiness of its individuals but to the mass of that political sect it is not the less true the  th of march   0  will be a day of jubilee but it will be a day of greater joy to me i never did them an act of injustice nor failed in any duty to them imposed by my office out of about six hundred offices named by the president     there were six republicans only when i came into office and these were chiefly halfbreeds out of upwards of three hundred holding during pleasure i removed about fifteen or those who had signalized themselves by their own intolerance in office because the public voice called for it imperiously and it was just that the republicans should at length have some participation in the government there never was another removal but for such delinquencies as removed the republicans equally in this horrid drudgery i always felt myself as a public executioner an office which no one who knows me i hope supposes very grateful to my feelings it was considerably alleviated however by the industry of their newspapers in endeavoring to excite resentment enough to enable me to meet the operation however i hail the day which is to relieve me from being viewed as an official enemy in private life i never had above one or two to the friendship of that situation

in custody in jan voluntarily offered to make communications     to me which he accordingly did mr madison also being present i previously  subsequently assured him without however his having requested it that they should never be used against himself mr madison on the same evening     committed to writing by memory what he had said  i moreover asked of bollman to do it himself which he did  i now enclose it to you the object is as he is to be a witness that you may know how to examine him  draw everything from him i wish     the paper to be seen  known only to yourself and the gentlemen who aid you  to be returned to me if he should prevaricate i should be willing you should go so far as to ask him whether he did not say so  so to mr madison  myself in order to let     him see that his prevarications will be marked mr madison will forward you a pardon for him which we mean should be delivered previously it is suspected by some he does not intend to appear if he does not i hope you will take effectual measures     to have him immediately taken into custody some other blank pardons are sent on to be filled up at your discretion if you should find a defect of evidence  believe that this would supply it by avoiding to give them to the gross offenders unless it be  00 visible that the principal will otherwise escape i send you an affidavit of importance received last

of inclination nor that i do nothing but that having too much to do i leave  0  undone that which admits delay with least injury your letter of nov    is just now received and it gives me great pleasure that a person so well acquainted with the localities as m pitot has been able to give you so favorable an account of your  0  lands that his estimates will become just with a little time i believe but i am also afraid his esteem for you may have misled his judgment into some little anticipation of value but i speak from ignorance and he from knolege i have no doubt mr duplantier will make the best location possible indeed his zeal had in one instance led us to fear you would be injured by it he had comprehended in his location not only the grounds vacant of all title in the vicinity of n orleans which had been a principal object in my eye to enable you speedily to  0  raise a sum of money but also grounds which had been reserved and were necessary for the range of the forts which had been left open as a common for the citizens knowing this would excite reclamations dangerous to your interests and threatening their popularity both there  here i wrote immediately to govr claiborne to get him to withdraw to a certain extent about point blank shot from the fort the grounds within that being necessary for the public but in the meantime an alarm was excited in the town and they   0 instructed their representative in congress to claim for the use of the town  public the whole of the vacant lands in its vicinity mr gallatin however effected a compromise with him by ceding the grounds next to the fort so as to leave your claim clear to all the lands we originally contemplated for you as formerly explained to you i very much wished your presence there during the late conspiracy of burr the native inhabitants were unshaken in their fidelity but there was a small band of american adventurers who had fled from their debts and who were longing to dip their hands into the mines of mexico enlisted in burrs double project of attacking that country  severing our union had burr had a little success in the upper country these parricides would have joined him however the whole business has shewn that neither he nor they knew anything of the people of this country a simple proclamation informing the people of these combinations and calling on them to suppress them produced an instantaneous levee en masse of our citizens wherever there appeared anything to lay hold of  the whole was crushed in one instant it is certain that he never had one hundred men engaged in his enterprise  most of these were made to believe the government patronized it which artifice had been practised by miranda a short time before and had decoyed about  0 americans to engage in his unauthorized projects burr is now under trial for a misdemeanor that is for his projected mexican enterprise and will be put on his trial for treason as soon as the witnesses can be collected     for his attempt to sever the union and unless his federal patrons give him an opportunity of running away he will unquestionably be convicted on both prosecutions the enterprise has done good by proving that the attachment of the people in the west is as firm as that in the east to the union of our country and by establishing a mutual  universal confidence your presence at new orleans would have been of value as a point of union  confidence for the ancient inhabitants american as well as creole new orleans itself is said to be unhealthy for strangers but on the western side of the river is as healthy  fine a country as in the universe your emperor has done more splendid things but he has never done one which will give happiness to so great a number of human beings as the ceding

letter from the bey of tunis and good reason to believe that mellimelli carried to his government favorable  friendly impressions the news is now all with you we have heard as yet only the proceedings of the  st day of burrs trial which from the favor of the marshal  judge promises him all which can depend on them a grand jury of   feds   quids   0 republicans does not seem to be a fair representation of the state of virginia but all this     will show the original error of establishing a judiciary independent of the nation and which from the citadel of the law can turn its guns on those they were meant to defend  controul  fashion their proceedings to its own will i have always entertained a high opinion of the marshals integrity  political correctness but in a state where there are not more than   quids how   of them should have been summoned on one jury is difficult to explain from accident affectionate salutations  constant esteem to you all thomas jefferson june   0  albert gallatin to the secretary of treasury albert gallatin j mss june   0  i gave you some time ago a project of a more equal tariff on wines than that which now exists but in that i yielded considerably to the faulty classification of them in our law i have now formed one with attention and according to the best information i possess classing them more rigorously i am persuaded that were the duty on cheap wines put on the same ratio with the dear it would wonderfully enlarge the field of those who use wine to the expulsion of whiskey the introduction of a very cheap wine st george into my neighborhood within two years past has quadrupled in that time the number of those who keep wine and will ere long increase them tenfold this would be a great gain to the treasury  to the sobriety of our country i will here add my tariff wherein you will     be able to chuse any rate of duty you please and to decide whether it will not on a fit occasion be proper for legislative attention affectn salutns thomas jefferson june      0  william short to william short  june      0  the proposition in your letter of may   th as adding an umpire to our discordant negotiators at paris struck me favorably on reading it and reflection afterward strengthened my first impressions i made it therefore a subject of consultation with my coadjutors as is our usage for our government although in theory subject to be directed by the unadvised will of the president is and from its origin has been a very different thing in practice the minor business in each department is done by the head of the department on consultation with the president alone but all matters of importance or difficulty are submitted to all the heads of departments composing the cabinet sometimes by the presidents consulting them separately and successively as they happen to call on him but in the gravest cases calling them together discussing the subject maturely and finally taking the vote on which the president counts himself but as one so that in all important cases the executive is in fact a directory which certainly the president might control but of this there was never an example either in the first or the present administration i have heard indeed that my predecessor sometimes     decided things against his counsel by dashing and trampling his wig on the floor this only proves what you and i know that he had a better heart than head i see with extreme concern that you have received an impression that my attachment to you has become lessened and that you have drawn this inference from circumstances taking place while you were in washington what these circumstances could be is to me incomprehensible but one thing i certainly know that they have been misconstrued that this change could not be previous to my retirement from the government in      your appointments to france to holland to spain are proofs and if during my present place in the government i have not met your desires the public motives which have been frankly declared have given the real grounds you think them not founded in fact but if the testimony we receive is of different complexions neither should wonder at the difference of conclusion drawn by the other and i do trust that you will become sensible that there is no necessity at least for supposing a change in affections which are the same now as they have ever been certainly i shall not on my part permit a difference of view on a single subject to efface the recollections and attachments of a whole life thomas jefferson june      0  washington john norvell to john norvell j mss washington june      0  sir —your letter of may   has been duly received the subject it proposes would require time  space     for even moderate development my occupations limit me to a very short notice of them i think there does not exist a good elementary work on the organization of society into civil government i mean a work which presents in one full  comprehensive view the system of principles on which such an organization should be founded according to the rights of nature for want of a single work of that character i should recommend locke on government sidney priestleys essay on the first principles of government chipmans principles of government  the federalist adding perhaps beccaria on crimes  punishments because of the demonstrative manner in which he has treated that branch of the subject if your views of political inquiry go further to the subjects of money  commerce smiths wealth of nations is the best book to be read unless says political economy can be had which treats the same subject on the same principles but in a shorter compass  more lucid manner but i believe this work has not been translated into our language history in general only informs us what bad government is but as we have employed some of the best materials of the british constitution in the construction of our own government a knolege of british history becomes useful to the american politician there is however no general history of that country which can be recommended the elegant one of hume seems intended to disguise  discredit the good principles of the government and is so plausible  pleasing in its style  manner as to instil its errors  heresies insensibly into the minds of     unwary readers baxter has performed a good operation on it he has taken the text of hume as his ground work abridging it by the omission of some details of little interest and wherever he has found him endeavoring to mislead by either the suppression of a truth or by giving it a false coloring he has changed the text to what it should be so that we may properly call it humes history republicanised he has moreover continued the history but indifferently from where hume left it to the year   00 the work is not popular in england because it is republican and but a few copies have ever reached america it is a single  to volume adding to this ludlows memoirs mrs mcauleys  belknaps histories a sufficient view will be presented of the free principles of the english constitution to your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted so as to be most useful i should answer by restraining it to true facts  sound principles only yet i fear such a paper would find few subscribers it is a melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of its benefits than is done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle the real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day i really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens who reading newspapers live      die in the belief that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables general facts may indeed be collected from them such as that europe is now at war that bonaparte has been a successful warrior that he has subjected a great portion of europe to his will c c but no details can be relied on i will add that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods  errors he who reads nothing will still learn the great facts and the details are all false perhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this divide his paper into   chapters heading the  st truths  d probabilities  d possibilities  th lies the first chapter would be very short as it would contain little more than authentic papers and information from such sources as the editor would be willing to risk his own reputation for their truth the  d would contain what from a mature consideration of all circumstances his judgment should conclude to be probably true this however should rather contain too little than too much the  d   th should be professedly for those readers who would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would occupy     such an editor too would have to set his face against the demoralising practice of feeding the public mind habitually on slander  the depravity of taste which this nauseous aliment induces defamation is becoming a necessary of life insomuch that a dish of tea in the morning or evening cannot be digested without this stimulant even those who do not believe these abominations still read them with complaisance to their auditors and instead of the abhorrence  indignation which should fill a virtuous mind betray a secret pleasure in the possibility that some may believe them tho they do not themselves it seems to escape them that it is not he who prints but he who pays for printing a slander who is its real author these thoughts on the subjects of your letter are hazarded at your request repeated instances of the publication of what has not been intended for the public eye and the malignity with which political enemies torture every sentence from me into meanings imagined by their own wickedness only justify my expressing a solicitude that this hasty communication may in nowise be permitted to find its way into the public papers not fearing these political bulldogs i yet avoid putting myself in the way of being baited by them and do not wish to volunteer away that portion of tranquillity which a firm execution of my duties will permit me to enjoy i tender you my salutations and best wishes for your success   0 thomas jefferson june    0  washington james sullivan to james sullivan governor of massachusetts j mss washington june    0  dear sir —in acknowleging the receipt of your favor of the  d instant i avail myself of the occasion it offers of tendering to yourself to mr lincoln  to your state my sincere congratulations on the late happy event of the election of a republican executive to preside over its councils the harmony it has introduced between the legislative  executive branches between the people  both of them  between all  the general government are so many steps towards securing that union of action  effort in all its parts without which no nation can be happy or safe the just respect with which all the states have ever looked to massachusetts could leave none of them without anxiety while she was in a state of alienation from her family and friends your opinion of the propriety  advantage of a more intimate correspondence between the executives of the several states  that of the union as a central point is precisely that which i have ever entertained and on coming into office i felt the advantages which would result from that harmony i had it even in contemplation after the annual recommendation to congress of those measures called for by the times which the constitution had placed under their power to make communications in like manner to the executives of the states as to any parts of them to which the legislatures might be alone competent for many are the exercises of power reserved to the states wherein an     uniformity of proceeding would be advantageous to all such are quarantines health laws regulations of the press banking institutions training militia c c but you know what was the state of the several governments when i came into office that a great proportion of them were federal  would have been delighted with such opportunities of proclaiming their contempt  of opposing republican men  measures opportunities so furnished  used by some of the state governments would have produced an ill effect  would have insured the failure of the object of uniform proceeding if it could be ventured even now connecticut  delaware being still hostile it must be on some greater occasion than is likely to arise within my time i look to it therefore as a course which will probably be left to the consideration of my successor i consider with you the federalists as compleately vanquished and never more to take the field under their own banners they will now reserve themselves to profit by the schisms among republicans and to earn favors from minorities whom they will enable to triumph over their more numerous antagonists so long as republican minorities barely accept their votes no great harm will be done because it will only place in power one shade of republicanism instead of another but when they purchase the votes of the federalists by giving them a participation of office trust  power it is a proof that antimonarchism is not their strongest passion i do not think that the republican minority in pennsylvania has fallen into this heresy nor that there are in your     state materials of which a minority can be made who will fall into it with respect to the tour my friends to the north have proposed that i should make in that quarter i have not made up a final opinion the course of life which gen washington had run civil  military the services he had rendered and the space he therefore occupied in the affections of his fellow citizens take from his examples the weight of precedents for others because no others can arrogate to themselves the claims which he had on the public homage to myself therefore it comes as a new question to be viewed under all the phases it may present i confess that i am not reconciled to the idea of a chief magistrate parading himself through the several states as an object of public gaze  in quest of an applause which to be valuable should be purely voluntary i had rather acquire silent good will by a faithful discharge of my duties than owe expressions of it to my putting myself in the way of receiving them were i to make such a tour to portsmouth or portland i must do it to savannah perhaps to orleans  frankfort as i have never yet seen the time when the public business would have permitted me to be so long in a situation in which i could not carry it on so i have no reason to expect that such a time will come while i remain in office a journey to boston or portsmouth after i shall be a private citizen would much better harmonize with my feelings as well as duties and founded in curiosity would give no claims to an extension of it i should see my friends too more at our mutual ease and be     left more exclusively to their society however i end as i began by declaring i have made up no opinion on the subject  that i reserve it as a question for further consideration  advice in the meantime and at all times i salute you with great respect and esteem thomas jefferson june    0  washington doctor caspar wistar to doctor caspar wistar j mss washington june    0  dear sir —i have a grandson the son of mr randolph now about    years of age in whose education i take a lively interest his time has not hitherto been employed to the greatest advantage a frequent change of tutors having prevented the steady pursuit of any one plan whether he possesses that lively imagination usually called genius i have not had opportunities of knowing but i think he has an observing mind  sound judgment he is assiduous orderly  of the most amiable temper  dispositions as he will be at ease in point of property his education is not directed to any particular possession but will embrace those sciences which give to retired life usefulness ornament or amusement i am not a friend to placing growing men in populous cities because they acquire there habits  partialities which do not contribute to the happiness of their after life but there are particular branches of science which are not so advantageously taught anywhere else in the u s as in philadelphia the garden at the woodlands for botany mr peales museum for     natural history your medical school for anatomy and the able professors in all of them give advantages not to be found elsewhere we propose therefore to send him to philadelphia to attend the schools of botany natural history anatomy  perhaps surgery but not of medicine and why not of medicine you will ask being led to the subject i will avail myself of the occasion to express my opinions on that science and the extent of my medical creed but to finish first with respect to my grandson i will state the favor i ask of you which is the object of this letter having been born  brought up in a mountainous  healthy country we should be unwilling he should go to philadelphia until the autumnal diseases cease it is important therefore for us to know at what period after that the courses of lectures in natural history botany chemistry anatomy  surgery begin and end and what days or hours they occupy the object of this is that we may be able so to marshal his pursuits as to bring their accomplishment within the shortest space practicable i shall write to doctor barton for information as to the courses of natural history  botany but not having a sufficient acquaintance with professors of chemistry  surgery if you can add the information respecting their school to that of your own i shall be much obliged to you what too are the usual terms of boarding what the compensations to professors and can you give me a conjectural estimate of other necessary expenses in these we do not propose to indulge him beyond what is necessary decent  usual because     all beyond that leads to dissipation  idleness to which at present he has no propensities i think mr peale has not been in the habit of receiving a boarder his house  family would of themselves be a school of virtue  instruction  hours of leisure there would be as improving as busy ones elsewhere but i say this only on the possibility of so desirable a location for him and not with the wish that the thought should become known to mr peale unless some former precedent should justify its suggestion to him i am laying a heavy tax on your busy time but i think your goodness will pardon it in consideration of its bearing on my happiness this subject dismissed i may now take up that which it led to and further tax your patience with unlearned views of medicine which as in most cases are perhaps the more confident in proportion as they are less enlightened we know from what we see  feel that the animal body in its organs and functions is subject to derangement inducing pain  tending to its destruction in this disordered state we observe nature providing for the reestablishment of order by exciting some salutary evacuation of the morbific matter or by some other operation which escapes our imperfect senses and researches she brings on a crisis by stools vomiting sweat urine expectoration bleeding c which for the most part ends in the restoration of healthy action experience has taught us also that there are certain substances by which applied to the living body internally or externally we can at will produce     these same evacuations and thus do in a short time what nature would do but slowly and do effectually what perhaps she would not have strength to accomplish where then we have seen a disease characterized by specific signs or phenomena and relieved by a certain natural evacuation or process whenever that disease recurs under the same appearances we may reasonably count on producing a solution of it by the use of such substances as we have found produce the same evacuations or movement thus fulness of the stomach we can relieve by emetics diseases of the bowels by purgatives inflammatory cases by bleeding intermittents by the peruvian bark syphilis by mercury watchfulness by opium c so far i bow to the utility of medicine it goes to the welldefined forms of disease  happily to those the most frequent but the disorders of the animal body  the symptoms indicating them are as various as the elements of which the body is composed the combinations too of these symptoms are so infinitely diversified that many associations of them appear too rarely to establish a definite disease and to an unknown disease there cannot be a known remedy here then the judicious the moral the humane physician should stop having been so often a witness to the salutary efforts which nature makes to reestablish the disordered functions he should rather trust to their action than hazard the interruption of that and a greater derangement of the system by conjectural experiments on a machine so complicated  so unknown as the human body  a subject so sacred as human     life or if the appearance of doing something be necessary to keep alive the hope  spirits of the patient it should be of the most innocent character one of the most successful physicians i have ever known has assured me that he used more bread pills drops of colored water  powders of hickory ashes than of all other medicines put together it was certainly a pious fraud but the adventurous physician goes on  substitutes presumption for knolege from the scanty field of what is known he launches into the boundless region of what is unknown he establishes for his guide some fanciful theory of corpuscular attraction of chemical agency of mechanical powers of stimuli of irritability accumulated or exhausted of depletion by the lancet  repletion by mercury or some other ingenious dream which lets him into all natures secrets at short hand on the principle which he thus assumes he forms his table of nosology arrays his diseases into families and extends his curative treatment by analogy to all the cases he has thus arbitrarily marshalled together i have lived myself to see the disciples of hoffman boerhaave stalh cullen brown succeed one another like the shifting figures of a magic lantern  their fancies like the dresses of the annual dollbabies from paris becoming from their novelty the vogue of the day and yielding to the next novelty their ephemeral favor the patient treated on the fashionable theory sometimes gets well in spite of the medicine the medicine therefore restored him  the young doctor receives new courage to proceed in his bold experiments on the lives of his     fellow creatures i believe we may safely affirm that the inexperienced  presumptuous band of medical tyros let loose upon the world destroys more of human life in one year than all the robinhoods cartouches  macheaths do in a century it is in this part of medicine that i wish to see a reform an abandonment of hypothesis for sober facts the first degree of value set on clinical observation and the lowest on visionary theories i would wish the young practitioner especially to have deeply impressed on his mind the real limits of his art  that when the state of his patient gets beyond these his office is to be a watchful but quiet spectator of the operations of nature giving them fair play by a wellregulated regimen  by all the aid they can derive from the excitement of good spirits  hope in the patient i have no doubt that some diseases not yet understood may in time be transferred to the table of those known but were i a physician i would rather leave the transfer to the slow hand of accident than hasten it by guilty experiments on those who put their lives into my hands the only sure foundations of medicine are an intimate knolege of the human body and observation on the effects of medicinal substances on that the anatomical  clinical schools therefore are those in which the young physician should be formed if he enters with innocence that of the theory of medicine it is scarcely possible he should come out untainted with error his mind must be strong indeed if rising above juvenile credulity it can maintain a wise infidelity against the authority of his instructors  the bewitching delusions of their     theories you see that i estimate justly that portion of instruction which our medical students derive from your labors  associating with it one of the chairs which my old  able friend doctor rush so honorably fills i consider them as the two fundamental pillars of the edifice indeed i have such an opinion of the talents of the professors in the other branches which constitute the school of medicine with you as to hope  believe that it is from this side of the atlantic that europe which has taught us so many other things will at length be led into sound principles in this branch of science the most important of all others being that to which we commit the care of health  life i dare say that by this time you are sufficiently sensible that old heads as well as young may sometimes be charged with ignorance and presumption the natural course of the human mind is certainly from credulity to scepticism and this is perhaps the most favorable apology i can make for venturing so far out of my depth  to one too to whom the strong as well as the weak points of this science are so familiar but having stumbled on the subject in my way i wished to give a confession of my faith to a friend  the rather as i had perhaps at times to him as well as others expressed my scepticism in medicine without defining its extent or foundation at any rate it has permitted me for a moment to abstract myself from the dry  dreary waste of politics into which i have been impressed by the times on which i happened and to indulge in the rich fields of nature where alone i should have served as a   0 volunteer if left to my natural inclinations  partialities i salute you at all times with affection  respect thomas jefferson june      0  henry dearborn to the secretary of war henry dearborn j mss june      0  i suggest to you the following as some of the ideas which might be expressed by genl wilkinson in answering govr saludos letter the introductory and concluding sentiments will best flow from the generals own feelings of the personal standing between him  govr saludo on the transfer of louisiana by france to the u s according to its boundaries when possessed by france the government of the u s considered itself entitled as far west as the rio norte but understanding soon after that spain on the contrary claimed eastwardly to the river sabine it has carefully abstained from doing any act in the intermediate country which might disturb the existing state of things until these opposing claims should be explained and accommodated amicably but that the red river and all its waters belonged to france that she made several settlements on that river and held them as a part of louisiana until she delivered that country to spain  that spain on the contrary had never made a single settlement on the river are circumstances so well known  so susceptible of proof that it was not supposed that spain would seriously contest the facts or the right established by     them hence our government took measures for exploring that river as it did that of the missouri by sending mr freeman to proceed from the mouth upwards and lieutenant pike from the source downwards merely to acquire its geography and so far enlarge the boundaries of science for the day must be very distant when it will be either the interest or the wish of the u s to extend settlements into the interior of that country lt pikes orders were accordingly strictly confined to the waters of the red river  from his known observance of orders i am persuaded that it must have been as he himself declares by missing his way that he got on the waters of the rio norte instead of those of the red river that your excellency should excuse this involuntary error  indeed misfortune was expected from the liberality of your character  the kindnesses you have shewn him are an honorable example of those offices of good neighborhood on your part which it will be so agreeable to us to cultivate accept my thanks for them  be assured they shall on all occasions meet a like return to the same liberal sentiment l pike must appeal for the restoration of his papers you must have seen in them no trace of unfriendly views towards your nation no symptoms of any other design than of extending geographical knolege and it is not in the nineteenth century nor through the agency of your excellency that science expects to encounter obstacles the field of knolege is the common property of all mankind and any discoveries we can make in it will be for the benefit of yours and of every other nation as well as our own     thomas jefferson june      0  washington albert gallatin to the secretary of the

exercises of our duty captn gordon  d in command of the chesapeake has arrived here with the details of that affair yet as the precaution you took of securing us against the     accident of wanting information was entirely proper  the expense of the express justly a national one i have directed him to be paid here so that he is enabled to refund any money you may have advanced him mr gallatin  genl dearborne happening to be absent i have asked their immediate attendance here and i expect them this day we shall then determine on the course which the exigency and our constitutional powers call for whether the outrage is a proper cause of war belonging exclusively to congress it is our duty not to commit them by doing anything which would have to be retracted we may however exercise the powers entrusted to us for preventing future insults within our harbors  claim firmly satisfaction for the past this will leave congress free to decide whether war is the most efficacious mode of redress in our case or whether having taught so many other useful lessons to europe we may not add that of showing them that there are peaceable means of repressing injustice by making it the interest of the aggressor to do what is just and abstain from future wrong it is probable you will hear from us in the course of the week i salute you with great esteem and respect      thomas jefferson july     0  chesapeake proclamation j mss july     0  during the wars which for some time have unhappily prevailed among the powers of europe the us of america firm in their principles of peace have     endeavored by justice by a regular discharge of all their national  social duties and by every friendly office their situation admitted to maintain with all the belligerents their accustomed relations of friendship hospitality  commercial intercourse taking     no part in the questions which animate these powers against each other nor permitting themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed  they believe that no     instance of departure from its duties can be justly imputed to them by any nation a free use of their harbours and waters the means of refitting  of refreshment of succour to their sick  suffering have at all times and on equal principles been     extended to all and this too while the officers of one of the belligerents received among us have been in a continued course of insubordination to the laws of violence to the persons  of trespasses on the property of our citizens these abuses of the laws of     hospitality have become habitual to the commanders of the british armed vessels hovering on our coasts  frequenting our harbours they have been the subject of repeated representations to their government assurances have been given that proper orders should   0 restrain them within the limit of the rights  of the respect belonging to a friendly nation but those orders  assurances have been without effect nor has a single instance of punishment for past wrongs taken place even the murder of a citizen peaceably     pursuing his occupations within the limits of our jurisdiction and at length a deed transcending all we have suffered brings the public sensibility to a serious crisis and forbearance to a necessary pause a frigate of the us trusting to a state of peace and     leaving her harbor on a distant service has been surprised and attacked by a british vessel of superior force one of a squadron then lying in our waters to cover the transaction  has been disabled from     service with the loss of a number of men killed  wounded this enormity was not only without provocation or justifiable cause but was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force from a     ship of war of the us a part of her crew and that no circumstance might be wanting to make its character the commander was apprised that the seamen thus forcibly were native citizens of the us his purpose effected he returned to anchor with his squadron within our jurisdiction hospitality     under such circumstances ceases to be a duty and a continuance of it with such uncontroulled abuses would tend only by multiplying injuries  irritations to bring on a rupture equally opposed to the interests of both nations as to assurances of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the british government in the midst of which this outrage has been committed the subject cannot but present itself to that government  strengthen the motives to an honorable reparation of the wrong which has been done and that effectual controul of its naval commanders which alone can justify the government of the us in the exercise of those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue in consideration of these circumstances and of the right of every nation to regulate its own police to provide for its peace  for the safety of its citizens  consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessels into its harbors or waters either in such numbers or of such descriptions as are inconsistent with these or with the maintenance of the authority of the laws i have thought proper in pursuance of the authority specially given by law to issue this my proclamation hereby requiring all armed vessels bearing commissions under the government of great britain now within the harbors or waters of the us immediately  without any delay to depart from the same and interdicting the entrance of all the said harbors  waters to the said armed vessels  to all others bearing commissions under the authority of the british government and if the sd vessels or any of them shall fail to     depart as aforesaid or if they or any others so interdicted shall hereafter enter the harbors or waters aforesaid i do in that case forbid all intercourse with either or any of them their officers or crews  do prohibit all supplies  aid from being furnished to them or any of them and i do declare  make known that if any person from or within the jurisdictional limits of the us shall afford any aid to any such vessel contrary to the prohibition contained in this proclamation either in repairing any such vessel or in furnishing her her officers or crew with supplies of any kind or in any manner whatever or if any pilot shall assist in navigating any of the said armed vessels

dispatches as hereinafter provided for such person or persons shall on conviction suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided for such offences and i do hereby enjoin  require all persons bearing office civil or military within or under the authority of the us and all others citizens or inhabitants thereof or being within the same with vigilance  promptitude to exert their respective authorities  to be aiding  assisting to the carrying this proclamation  every part thereof into full effect provided nevertheless that if any such vessel shall be forced into the harbors or waters of the us by distress by the dangers of the sea or by the pursuit     of an enemy or shall enter them charged with dispatches or business from their government or shall be a public packet for the

j mss washington july   0  dear sir —i congratulate you on your safe arrival with miss clinton at new york  especially on your escape from british violence this aggression is a of character so distinct from that on the chesapeake and of so aggravated a nature that i consider it as a very material one to be presented with that to the british government i pray you therefore to write me a letter stating the transaction  in such a form as that it may go to that government at the same time i must request you to instruct mr gelston from me to take the affidavits of the captain of the revenue cutter  of such other persons as you shall direct stating the same affair      to be forwarded in like manner to our minister in london you will have seen by the proclamation the measures adopted we act on these principles   that the usage of nations requires that we shall give the offender an opportunity of making reparation  avoiding war   that we should give time to our merchants to get in their property  vessels  our seamen now afloat and   that the power of declaring war being with the legislature the executive should do nothing necessarily committing them to decide for war in preference of nonintercourse which will be preferred by a great many they will be called in time to receive the answer from great britain unless new occurrences should render it necessary to call them sooner i salute you with friendship  respect thomas jefferson july     0  washington henry dearborn to the secretary at war henry dearborn j mss washington july     0  dear sir —i enclose you copies of   letters sent by express from capt decatur by these you will perceive that the british commanders have their foot on the threshold of war they have begun the blockade of norfolk have sounded the passage to the town which appears practicable for three of their vessels  menace an attack on the chesapeake and cybele these with   gunboats form the present defence  there are   more gunboats in norfolk nearly ready the   gunboats at hampton are   0 hauled up  in danger   in mopjack bay are on the stocks blows may be hourly possible in this state of things i am sure your own feelings will anticipate the public judgment that your presence here cannot be dispensed with there is nobody here who can supply your knowledge of the resources for land cooperation  the means for bringing them into activity still i would wish you would stay long enough at n york to settle with the v p  colo williams the plan of defence for that place  i am in hopes you will also see fultons experiments tried  see how far his means may enter into your plan but as soon as that is done should matters remain in their present critical state i think the public interest and safety would suffer by your absence from us indeed if the present state of things continues i begin to fear we shall not be justifiable in separating this autumn  that even an earlier meeting of congress than we had contemplated may be requisite i salute you affectionately thomas jefferson july   0  washington thomas cooper to thomas cooper j mss washington july   0  dear sir —your favor of june    is received i had not before learned that a life of dr priestley had been published or i should certainly have procured it for no man living had a more affectionate respect for him in religion in politics in physics no man has rendered more service i had always expected that when the republicans should have put down all things under their feet they     would schismatize among themselves i always expected too that whatever names the parties might bear the real division would be into moderate  ardent republicanism in this division there is no great evil—not even if the minority obtain the ascendency by the accession of federal votes to their candidate because this gives us one shade only instead of another of republicanism it is to be considered as apostasy only when they purchase the votes of federalists with a participation in honor  power the gross insult lately received from the english has forced the latter into a momentary coalition with the mass of republicans but the moment we begin to act in the very line they have joined in approving all will be wrong and every act the reverse of what it should have been still it is better to admit their coalescence  leave to themselves their shortlived existence both reason  the usage of nations required we should give gr britain an opportunity of disavowing  repairing the insult of their officers it gives us at the same time an opportunity of getting home our vessels our property  our seamen—the only means of carrying on the kind of war we should attempt the only difference i believe between your opinion  mine as to the protection of commerce is the forcing the nation to take the best road  the letting them take the worse if such is their will i salute you with great esteem  respect      thomas jefferson july  0   0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss july  0   0  something now occurs almost every day on which it is desirable to have the opinions of the heads of departments yet to have a formal meeting every day would consume so much of their time as to seriously obstruct their regular business i have proposed to them as most convenient for them  wasting less of their time to call on me at any moment of the day which suits their separate convenience when besides any other business they may have to do i can learn their opinions separately on any matter which has occurred  also communicate the information received daily perhaps you could find it more convenient sometimes to make your call at the hour of     dinner instead of going so much further to dine alone you will always find a plate  a sincere welcome in this way that is successively i have today consulted the other gentlemen on the question whether letters of marque were to be considered as within our interdict we are unanimously of opinion they are not we consider them as essentially merchant vessels that commerce is their main object and arms merely incidental  defensive affectionate salutations

acknoleging the receipt     of the letter that it had miscarried i sent a duplicate with my subsequent one of apr   these having gone by the wasp you will doubtless have received them since that yours of may   has come to hand you will see by the despatches from the department of state carried by the armed vessel the revenge into what a critical state our peace with gr britain is suddenly brought by their armed vessels in our waters four vessels of war   of them two deckers closely blockade norfolk at this instant of the authority under which this aggression is committed their minister here is unapprised you will see by the proclamation of july   that while we are not omitting such measures of force as are immediately necessary we propose to give gr br an opportunity of disavowal  reparation and to leave the question of war nonintercourse or other measures uncommitted to the legislature this country has never been in such a state of excitement since the battle of lexington in this state of things cordial friendship with france  peace at least with spain become more interesting you know the circumstances respecting this last power which have rendered it ineligible that you should have proceeded heretofore to your destination but this obstacle is now removed by their recall of yrujo  appointment of another minister  in the meantime of a chargé des affaires who has been received the way being now open for taking your station at madrid it is certainly our wish you should do so and that this may be more agreeable to you than your return home as is solicited in yours of may   it is with real     unwillingness we should relinquish the benefit of your services nevertheless if your mind is decidedly bent on that we shall regret but not oppose your return the choice therefore remains with yourself in the meantime your place in the joint commission being vacated by either event we shall take the measures rendered necessary by that we have seen with real grief the misunderstanding which has taken place between yourself  gen armstrong we are neither qualified nor disposed to form an opinion between you we regret the pain which must have been felt by persons both of whom hold so high a place in our esteem and we have not been without fear that the public interest might suffer by it it has seemed however that the state of europe has been such as to admit little to be done in matters so distant from them the present alarm has had the effect of suspending our foreign commerce no merchant ventures to send out a single vessel and i think it probable this will continue very much the case till we get an answer from england our crops are uncommonly plentiful that of small grain is now secured south of this and the harvest is advancing here accept my salutations  assurances of affectionate esteem  respect thomas jefferson july    0  washington barnabas bidwell to barnabas bidwell j mss washington july    0  dear sir —yours of june    has been duly received and altho wishing your happiness always i     cannot be altogether unpleased with a transfer of your services to a department more pleasing to yourself yet i cannot but lament your loss in congress you know that talents cannot be more useful anywhere than there and the times seem to portend that we may have occasion there for all we possess you have long ago learnt the atrocious acts committed by the british armed vessels in the chesapeake  its neighborhood they cannot be easily accommodated altho it is believed that they cannot be justified by orders from their government we have acted on these principles   to give that government an opportunity to disavow  make reparation   to give ourselves time to get in the vessels property  seamen now spread over the ocean   to do no act which might compromit congress in their choice between war nonintercourse or any other measure we shall probably call them some time in october having regard to the return of the healthy season and to the receipt of an answer from great britain before which they could only act in the dark in the meantime we shall make all the preparations which time will permit so as to be ready for any alternative the officers of the british ships in a conference with a gentleman sent to them by the mayor of norfolk have solemnly protested they mean no further proceeding without further orders but the question is whether they will obey the proclamation if they do not acts of force will probably ensue still these may lead to nothing further if their government is just i salute you with great affection

many points as can be obtained my happiness at monticello if i am able to go there will be lessened by not having yourself  francis there but the circumstance which prevents it is among the most painful that have happened to me in life thus comfort after comfort drops off from us till nothing is left but what is proper food for the grave i trust however we shall have yourself  francis the ensuing winter  the one following that and we must let the aftertime provide for itself he will ever be to me one of the dearest objects in life the affair of the chesapeake seems to have come in as an interlude during the suspension of burrs trial i suspect it will turn out that the order barclay received from his government was in equivocal terms implying force or not as should suit them to say and  the construction would be governed by bonapartes successes or misfortunes i know that barclays order to the ships under him was of that character however their orders are to be nothing in our eye the fact is what they have to settle with us reason  the usage of civilized nations require that we should give them an opportunity of disavowal  reparation our own interest too the     very means of making war requires that we should give time to our merchants to gather in their vessels  property  our seamen now afloat and our duty requires that we do no act which shall commit congress in their choice between war nonintercourse  other measures you will be called as early as the circumstances of health  of an answer from england will recommend probably some time in october should that country have the good sense to do us ample justice it will be a war saved but i do not expect it and every preparation therefore is going on  will continue which is within our power a war need cost us very little and we can take from them what would be an indemnification for a great deal for this everything shall be in readiness at the moment it is declared i have not yet heard how commodore douglass has taken the proclamation that he will obey it i doubt should he not the moment our    gunboats in that quarter are ready they will be able to take off all his small vessels  to oblige his large ones to keep together i count on their being all ready before the end of this month  by that time we shall have    in new york and a good provision of batteries along the shores of the city for to waste labor in defending the approaches to it would be idle the only practicable object is to prevent ships coming to before it we have nothing interesting to us from either london paris or madrid except that yrujo leaves us and a successor is to come in the mean time we have received foronda as charge des affaires a most able and amiable man in consequence of this     bowdoin will probably go on to madrid we shall thus avoid the mischief which the dissensions between him  armstrong were likely to produce present my warm affections to mr  mrs eppes  to the family  accept the same for yourself

remaining in hampton road the other two vessels have returned to the capes of chesapeake where they have been reinforced by another frigate and a sloop of war we know not from whence this induces us to suppose they do not mean an immediate attack on norfolk but to retain their present position till further orders from their admiral i am inclined to think that the body of militia now in the field in virginia would need to be regulated according to these views they are in great want of artillery the state possessing none their subsistence also  other necessary expenses require immediate attention from us the finances of the state not being at all in a condition to meet these calls we have some applications for the loan of fieldpieces the transportation of heavy cannon to norfolk  hampton is rendered difficult by the blockade of those ports these things are of necessity reserved for your direction on your return as nobody here is qualified to act in them it gives me sincere concern that events should thus have   0 thwarted your wishes should the bellona and leopard retire  a disposition be shown by the british commanders to restore things to a state of peace until they hear from their government we may go into summer quarters without injury to the public safety having previously made all necessary arrangements but if the present hostile conduct is pursued i fear we shall be obliged to keep together or at least within consulting distance i salute you with sincere affection  respect thomas jefferson july      0  washington dupont de nemours to dupont de nemours j

exhortation to make a provision of arms is undoubtedly wise and we have not been inattentive to it our internal resources for cannon are great and those for small arms considerable  in full emploiment we shall not suffer from that want should we have war and of the possibility of that you will judge by the enclosed proclamation  by what you know of the character of the english government never since the battle of lexington have i seen this country in such a state of exasperation as at present and even that did not produce such unanimity the federalists themselves coalesce with us as to the object tho they will return to their trade of censuring every measure taken to obtain it reparation for the past and security for the future is     our motto but whether they will yield it freely or will require resort to nonintercourse or to war is yet to be seen we prepare for the last we have actually  000 men in the field employed chiefly in covering the exposed coast  cutting off all supply to the british vessels we think our gunboats at new york    with heavy batteries along shore  bombs will put that city hors d insulte if you could procure  send me a good description  drawing of one of your prames you would do me a most acceptable service i suppose them to be in fact a floating battery rendered very manageable by oars burrs conspiracy has been one of the most flagitious of which history will ever furnish an example he had combined the objects of separating the western states from us of adding mexico to them and of placing himself at their head but he who could expect to effect such objects by the aid of american citizens must be perfectly ripe for bedlam yet altho there is not a man in the u s who is not satisfied of the depth of his guilt such are the jealous provisions of our laws in favor of the accused  against the accuser that i question if he can be convicted out of    jurors who are to be summoned he has a right to choose the    who are to try him and if any one of the    refuses to concur in finding him guilty he escapes this affair has been a great confirmation in my mind of the innate strength of the form of our government he had probably induced near a thousand men to engage with him by making them believe the government connived at it a proclamation alone by undeceiving them so compleatly     disarmed him that he had not above  0 men left ready to go all lengths with him the first enterprise was to have been the seizure of n orleans which he supposed would powerfully bridle the country above  place him at the door of mexico it has given me infinite satisfaction that not a single native creole of louisiana and but one american settled there before the delivery of the country to us were in his interest his partisans there were made up of fugitives from justice or from their debts who had flocked there from other parts of the u s after the delivery of the country and of adventurers  speculators of all descriptions i thank

subject for bedlam the seriousness of the crime however demands more serious punishment yet altho there is not a man in the u s who doubts his guilt such are the jealous provisions of our laws in favor of the accused against the accuser that i question if he is convicted out of    jurors to be summoned he is to select the    who are to try him and if there be any     who will not concur in finding him guilty he is discharged of course i am sorry to tell you that bollman was burrs right hand man in all his guilty schemes on being brought to prison here he communicated to mr madison  myself the whole of the plans always however apologetically for burr as far as they would bear but his subsequent tergiversations have proved him conspicuously base i gave him a pardon however which covers him from everything but infamy i was the more astonished at his engaging in this business from the peculiar motives he should have felt for fidelity when i came into the government i sought him out on account of the services he had rendered you cherished him offered him two different appointments of value which after keeping them long under consideration he declined for commercial views and would have given him anything for which he was fit be assured he is unworthy of ever occupying again the care of any honest man nothing has ever so strongly proved the innate force of our form of government as this conspiracy burr had probably engaged  000 men to follow his fortunes without letting them know his projects otherwise than by assuring them the government approved of them the moment a proclamation was issued undeceiving them he found himself left with about  0 desperadoes only the people rose in mass wherever he was or was suspected to be and by their own energy the thing was crushed in one instant without its having been necessary to employ a man of the military but to take care of their respective     stations his first enterprise was to have been to seize n orleans which he supposed would powerfully bridle the upper country  place him at the door of mexico it is with pleasure i inform you that not a single native creole and but one american of those settled there before we received the place took any part with him his partisans were the new emigrants from the u s and elsewhere fugitives from justice or debt and adventurers and speculators of all descriptions i enclose you a proclamation which will show you the critical footing on which we stand at present with england never since the battle of lexington have i seen this country in such a state of exasperation as at present and even that did not produce such unanimity the federalists themselves coalesce with us as to the object altho they will return to their old trade of condemning every step we take towards obtaining it reparation for the past and security for the future is our motto whether these will be yielded freely or will require resort to nonintercourse or to war is yet to be seen we have actually near  000 men in the field covering the exposed parts of the coast and cutting off supplies from the british vessels i am afraid i have been very unsuccessful in my endeavors to serve mde de tessé in her taste for planting a box of seeds c which i sent her in the close of   0  was carried with the vessel into england and discharged so late that i fear she lost their benefit for that season another box which i prepared in the autumn of   0  has i fear been     equally delayed from other accidents however i will persevere in my endeavors present me

in paris or not i do not know if they are not i will pray you to procure them a safe delivery you will receive through the department of state information of the critical situation in which we are with england an outrage not to be borne has obliged us to fly to arms and has produced such a state of exasperation  that so unanimous as never has been seen in this country since the battle of lexington we have between     000 men on the     shores of the chesapeake patrolling them for the protection of the country  for preventing supplies of any kind being furnished to the british and the moment our gunboats are ready we shall endeavor by force to expel them from our waters we now send a vessel to call upon the british government for reparation for the past outrage  security for the future nor will anything be deemed security but a renunciation of the practice of taking persons out of our vessels under the pretence of their being english congress will be called some time in october by which time we may have an answer from england in the meantime we are preparing for a state of things which will take that course which either the pride or the justice of england shall give it this will occasion a modification of your instructions as you will learn from the sec of state england will immediately seize on the floridas as a point d appui to annoy us what are we to do in that case i think she will find that there is no nation on the globe which can gall her so much as we can i salute you with great affection  respect thomas jefferson july 0  washington henry dearborn to the secretary at war henry dearborn j mss washington july 0  my dear sir —i have this moment received certain information that the british vessels have retired from hampton road whether they will only join their companions in the bay  remain there or go off is yet to be seen it gives me real pain to     believe that circumstances still require your presence here i have had a consultation this day with our colleagues on that subject and we have all but one opinion on that point indeed if i regarded yourself alone i should deem it necessary to satisfy public opinion that you should not be out of place at such a moment the arrangements for the militia now much called for can be properly made only by yourself several other details are also at a stand i shall therefore hope to see you in a very few days an important question will be to be decided on the arrival of decatur here about this day senight whether as the retirement of the british ships from hampton road enables us to get our    gunboats together we shall authorize them to use actual force against the british vessels present to mrs dearborne  accept yourself my affectionate  respectful salutations thomas jefferson july    0  washington john page to john page j mss washington july    0  my dear friend —yours of the   th is received in appointments to public offices of mere profit i have ever considered faithful service in either our first or second revolution as giving preference of claim and that appointments on that principle would gratify the public and strengthen that confidence so necessary to enable the executive to direct the whole public force to the best advantage of the nation of mr bolling robensons talents  integrity i have long been apprized and would gladly use them     where talents  integrity are wanting i had thought of him for the vacant place of secretary of the orleans territory but supposing the salary of  000 d not more than he makes by his profession  while remaining with his friends i have in despair not proposed it to him if he would accept it i should name him instantly with the greatest satisfaction perhaps you could inform me on this point with respect to majr gibbons i do indeed recollect that in some casual conversation it was said that the most conspicuous accomplices of burr were at home at his house but it made so little impression on me that neither the occasion nor the person is now recollected on this subject i have often expressed the principles on which i act with a wish they might be understood by the federalists in office i have never removed a man merely because he was a federalist i have never wished them to give a vote at an election but according to their own wishes but as no government could discharge its duties to the best advantage of its citizens if its agents were in a regular course of thwarting instead of executing all its measures and were employing the patronage  influence of their offices against the government  its measures i have only requested they would be quiet  they should be safe that if their conscience urges them to take an active  zealous part in opposition it ought also to urge them to retire from a post which they could not conscientiously conduct with fidelity to the trust reposed in them  on failure to retire i have removed them that is to say those who maintained an active    0 zealous opposition to the government nothing which i have yet heard of major gibbons places him in danger from these principles i am much pleased with the ardor displayed by our countrymen on the late british outrage it gives us the more confidence of support in the demand of reparation for the past  security for the future that is to say an end of impressments if motives of either justice or interest should produce this from great britain it will save a war but if they are refused we shall have gained time for getting in our ships  property  at least  0000 seamen now afloat on the ocean and who may man   0 privateers the loss of these to us would be worth to great britain many victories of the nile  trafalgar the meantime may also be importantly employed in preparations to enable us to give quick and deep blows present to mrs page  receive yourself my affectionate  respectful salutations thomas jefferson july  0 0  washington william duane to william duane j mss washington july  0 0  sir

others will be considered the time is coming when our friends must enable us to hear everything  expect us to say nothing when we shall need all their confidence that everything is doing which can be     done and when our greatest praise shall be that we appear to be doing nothing the law for detaching  00000 militia  the appropriation for it  that for fortifications enable us to do everything for land service as well as if congress were here  as to naval matters their opinion is known the course we have pursued has gained for our merchants a precious interval to call in their property  our seamen  the postponing the summons of congress will aid in avoiding to give too quick an alarm to the adversary they will be called however in good time altho we demand of england what is merely of right reparation for the past security for the future yet as their pride will possibly nay probably prevent their yielding them to the extent we shall require my opinion is that the public mind which i believe is made up for war should maintain itself at that point they have often enough god knows given us cause of war before but it has been on points which would not have united the nation but now they have touched a chord which vibrates in every heart now then is the time to settle the old and the new i have often wished for an occasion of saying a word to you on the subject of the emperor of russia of whose character  value to us i suspect you are not apprized correctly a more virtuous man i believe does not exist nor one who is more enthusiastically devoted to better the condition of mankind he will probably one day fall a victim to it as a monarch of that principle does not suit a russian noblesse he is not of the very first order of     understanding but he is of a high one he has taken a peculiar affection to this country  its government of which he has given me public as well as personal proofs our nation being like his habitually neutral our interests as to neutral rights and our sentiments agree and whenever conferences for peace shall take place we are assured of a friend in him in fact altho in questions of restitution he will be with england in those of neutral rights he will be with bonaparte  with every other power in the world except england  i do presume that england will never have peace until she subscribes to a just code of marine law i have gone into this subject because i am confident that russia while her present monarch lives is the most cordially friendly to us of any power on earth will go furthest to serve us  is most worthy of conciliation and altho the source of this information must be a matter of confidence with you yet it is desirable that the sentiments should become those of the nation i salute you with esteem

which tho jefferson asks the favor of him now to repeat   that he arrested colo burr militarily   that the arrest of colo b was military has been disproved but had it been so every honest man  good citizen is bound by any means in his power to arrest the author of projects so daring  dangerous   that mr small gave evidence against colo burr   this complaint as well as the preceding one would imply a partiality for colo burr of which he hopes the petitioners were not guilty   that he mr small refused a passport to a mr few   on this subject also he asks any information mr gaines can give for tho it is a matter of discretion it should be exercised without partiality or passion he salutes mr gaines with esteem  respect   that he levies duties on indian goods   the levy of duty on indian goods is required by the law of congress   that the people of that settlement have not the free use of the mobille   there has been a constant hope of reobtaining the navigation by negociation  no endeavors have been spared congress has not thought it expedient as yet to plunge the nation into a war against spain  france or to obtain an exemption from the duty levied on the use of that river

arrival i will always discharge him the moment he arrives instead of keeping him till   oclock as the postmaster proposes taking for myself the forenoon of the succeeding day to answer every mail i do not exactly recollect who of the heads of departments were present but i think every one except mr gallatin when conversing on the bungling conduct of our officers with respect to erskines letters  the more bungling conduct to be expected when the command should devolve on a militia major mr smith proposed that the whole regulation of flags should be confined to decatur which appeared to obtain the immediate assent of all however the remedy is easy  perhaps more proper on the whole that is to let the commanding officer by land as well as the one by water have equal authority to send  receive flags i will write accordingly to governor cabell this is the safer as i believe t newton of congress is the major genl dearborne has sent me a plan of a war establishment for   000 regulars for garrisons  instead of   000 others as a disposable force to substitute   000 twelvemonth volunteers to be exercised  paid   months in the year and consequently costing no     more than  000 permanent giving us the benefit of   000 for any expedition who would be themselves nearly equal to regulars but could on occasion be put into the garrisons  the regulars employed in the expedition primâ facie

from spain could add to my contempt of that government it would be the demand of satisfaction now made by foronda however respect to ourselves requires that the answer should be decent and i think it fortunate that this opportunity is given to make a strong declaration of facts to wit how far our knolege of mirandas objects went what measures we took to prevent anything further the negligence of the spanish agents to give us earlier notice the measures we took for punishing those guilty  our quiet abandonment of those taken by the spaniards but i would not say a word in recrimination as to the western intrigues of spain i think that is the snare intended by this protest to make it a setoff for the other as soon as we have all the proofs of the western intrigues let us make a remonstrance  demand of satisfaction and if congress approves we may in the same instant make reprisals on the floridas until satisfaction for that  for spoliations and until a settlemt of boundary i had rather have war against spain than not if we go to war against england our southern defensive force can take the floridas volunteers for a mexican army will flock to our standard and rich pabulum will     be offered to our privateers in the plunder of their commerce  coasts probably cuba would add itself to our confederation the paper in answer to foronda should i think be drawn with a view to its being laid before congress  published to the world as our justification against the imputation of participation in mirandas projects thomas jefferson august      0  monticello robert fulton to

torpedoes as very valuable means of defence of harbors  have no doubt that we should adopt them to a considerable degree not that i go the whole length as i believe you do of considering them as solely to be relied on neither a nation nor those entrusted with its affairs could be justifiable however sanguine their expectations in trusting solely to an engine not yet sufficiently tried under all the circumstances which may occur  against which we know not as yet what means of parrying may be devised if indeed the mode of attaching them to the cable of a ship be the only one proposed modes of prevention cannot be difficult but i have ever looked to the submarine boat as most to be depended on for attaching them  tho i see no mention of it in your letter or your publications i am in hopes it is not abandoned as impracticable i should wish to     see a corps of young men trained to this service it would belong to the engineers if at land but being nautical i suppose we must have a corps of naval engineers to practise  use them i do not know whether we have authority to put any part of our existing naval establishment in a course of training but it shall be the subject of a consultation with the secretary of the navy genl dearborne has informed you of the urgency of our want of you at n orleans for the locks there i salute you with great respect  esteem thomas jefferson

considered it with a sincere disposition to administer every relief from unnecessary suffering which lies within the limits of my regular authority but when a person charged with an offence is placed in the possession of the judiciary authority the laws commit to that solely the whole direction of the case and any interference with it on the part of the executive would be an encroachment on their independence and open to just censure and still more censurable would this be in a case originating as yours does not with the executive but an independent authority i am persuaded therefore that on reconsideration you will be sensible that in declining to interpose in the present case i do but obey the vigorous prescriptions of duty i do it however     with the less regret as i presume that the same provisions of the law which have given to the principal defendant the accommodation of common apartments give the same right to yourself and every other defendant in a country where the application of equal law to every condition of man is a fundamental principle  i salute you with every wish that the appearances which may have excited the attentions of one inquest towards you may be so explained as to establish your innocence to the satisfaction of another p s the delay of the mails by the late rains have prevented an earlier transmission of this answer  thomas jefferson august      0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello august      0  dear sir —i return you the papers received yesterday mr erskine complains of a want of communication between the british armed vessels in the chesapeake or off the coast if by off the coast he means those which being generally in our waters go occasionally out of them to cruize or to acquire a title to communicate with their consul it is too poor an evasion for him to expect us to be the dupes of if vessels off the coast  having never   0 violated the proclamation wish to communicate with their consul they may send in by any vessel without a flag he gives a proof of their readiness to restore deserters from an instance of the chichester lying alongside a wharf at norfolk it would have been as applicable if capt stopfield and his men had been in a tavern at norfolk all this too a british sergeant is ready to swear to  further that he saw british deserters enlisted in their british uniform by our officer as this fact is probably false  can easily be inquired into names being given and as the story of the chichester can be ascertained by capt saunders suppose you send a copy of the paper to the secy of the navy and recommend to him having an inquiry made we ought gladly to procure evidence to hang the pirates if no objection or difficulty occur from the place of trial if the driver is the scene of trial where is she if in our waters we can have no communication with her if out of them it may be inconvenient to send the witnesses altho there is neither candor nor dignity in soliciting the victualling the columbine for   months for a voyage of  0 days yet i think you had better give the permission it is not by these huckstering manœuvres that the great national question is to be settled i salute you affectionately      thomas jefferson aug  0 0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug  0 0  your letter to dayton i think perfectly right unless perhaps the expression of personal sympathy in the  st page might be misconstrued  coupled with the circumstance that we had not yet instituted a prosecution against him altho possessed of evidence poor yznardi seems to have been worked up into distraction by the persecutions of meade i enclose you a letter i have received from him also one from warden attested by armstrong by which you will see that the feuds there are not subsiding by yesterdays or this days mails you will have received the information that bonaparte has annihilated the allied armies the result will doubtless be peace on the continent an army despatched through persia to india  the main army brought back to their former position on the channel this will oblige england to withdraw everything home  leave us an open field an account apparently worthy of credit in the albany paper is that the british authorities are withdrawing all their cannon  magazines from upper canada to quebec considering the former not tenable  the latter their only fasthold i salute you with sincere affection p s i had forgotten to express my opinion that     deserters ought never to be enlisted but i think you may go further  say to erskine that if ever such a practise has prevailed it has been without the knolege of the government and would have been forbidden if known  if any examples of it have existed which is doubted they must have been few or they would have become known the case presented from the chichester if true does not prove the contrary as the persons there said to have been enlisted are believed to have been american citizens who whether impressed or enlisted into the british service were equally right in returning to the duties they owed to their own country thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello thomas leiper to thomas leiper j mss monticello aug    0  dear sir —i pray you to consider this letter so confidential as not to be hinted even to your most intimate friends you propose general steele as the successor to the present collector the following circumstances are to be considered it is indispensable that the head of the indian department reside at the seat of government general shee was apprised of this at the time of his appointment it was soon perceived that this was so ineligible to him as to countervail the benefits of the appointment  place him in doubt whether he would not rather relinquish it we gave him time for his removal accommodated to his own views and this has gone over without being noticed because i had reason to expect a vacancy in the collectorship and had made up my mind     to give him that  the indian agency to a person residing in washington as i suppose genl shee the person whom it is most material to take care of i wish your candid opinion whether the arrangement i propose is not more desirable than that which would oblige shee to remove or resign  i never expected to be under the necessity of wishing success to buonaparte but the english being equally tyrannical at sea as he is on land  that tyranny bearing on us in every point of either honor or interest i say down with england and as for what buonaparte is then to do to us let us trust to the chapter of accidents i cannot with the anglomen     prefer a certain present evil to a future hypothetical one i salute with friendship  respect thomas jefferson aug      0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello aug      0  dear sir —colo newtons inquiries are easily solved i think by application of the principles we have assumed   the interdicted ships are enemies should they be forced by stress of weather to run up into safer harbors we are to act towards them as we would towards enemies in regular war in a like case permit no intercourse no supplies  if they land kill or capture them as enemies if they lie still decatur has orders not to attack them without stating the case to me  awaiting instructions but if they attempt to enter elizabeth river he is to attack them without waiting for instructions   other armed vessels putting in from sea in distress are friends they must report themselves to the collector he assigns them their station  regulates their repairs supplies intercourse  stay not needing flags they are under the direction of the collector alone who should be reasonably liberal as to their repairs  supplies furnishing them for a voyage to any of their american ports but i think with him their crews should be kept on board  that they should not enter elizabeth river i remember mr gallatin expressed an opinion that our negociations with england should not be laid before congress at their meeting but reserved     to be communicated all together with the answer they should send us whenever received i am not of this opinion i think on the meeting of congress we should lay before them everything that has passed to that day  place them on the same ground of information we are on ourselves they will then have time to bring their minds to the same state of things with ours  when the answer arrives we shall all view it from the same position i think therefore you should order the whole of the negociation to be prepared in two copies i salute you affectionately thomas jefferson august    0  monticello henry dearborn to the secretary at war henry dearborn j mss monticello august    0  dear sir —i had had the letter of mr jouett of july  th from chicago  that from governor hull of july    from detroit under consideration some days when the day before yesterday i received that of the governor of july    while it appeared that the workings among the indians of that neighborhood proceeded from their prophet chiefly  that his endeavors were directed to the restoring them to their antient mode of life to the feeding  clothing themselves with the produce of the chace  refusing all those articles of meat drink  clothing which they can only obtain from the whites and are now rendered necessary by habit i thought it a transient enthusiasm which if let alone would evaporate innocently of itself altho     visibly tinctured with a partiality against the u s but the letters  documents now enclosed give to the state of things there a more serious aspect and the visit of the governor of upper canada  assembling of the indians by him indicate the object to which these movements are to point i think therefore we can no longer leave them to their own course but that we should immediately prepare for war in that quarter  at the same time redouble our efforts for peace i propose therefore that the governors of michigan ohio  indiana be instructed immediately to have designated according to law such proportions of their militia as you shall think advisable to be ready for service at a moments warning recommending to them to prefer volunteers as far as they can be obtained  of that description fitted for indian service that sufficient stores of arms ammunition  provision be deposited in convenient places for any expedition which it may be necessary to undertake in that quarter and for the defence of the posts  settlements there  that the object of these preparations be openly declared as well to let the indians understand the danger they are bringing on themselves as to lull the suspicion of any other object that at the same time and while these preparations for war are openly going on governors hull  harrison be instructed to have interviews by themselves or wellchosen agents with the chiefs of the several tribes in that quarter to recall to their minds the paternal policy pursued towards them by the     u s and still meant to be pursued that we never wished to do them an injury but on the contrary to give them all the assistance in our power towards improving their condition  enabling them to support themselves  their families that a misunderstanding having arisen between the u s and the english war may possibly ensue that in this war it is our wish the indians should be quiet spectators not wasting their blood in quarrels which do not concern them that we are strong enough to fight our own battles  therefore ask no help and if the english should ask theirs it should convince them that it proceeds from a sense of their own weakness which would not augur success in the end that at the same time as we have learnt that some tribes are already expressing intentions hostile to the u s we think it proper to apprize them of the ground on which they now stand  that on which they will stand for which purpose we make to them this solemn declaration of our unalterable determination that we wish them to live in peace with all nations as well as with us and we have no intention ever to strike them or to do them an injury of any sort unless first attacked or threatened but that learning that some of them meditate war on us we too are preparing for war against those  those only who shall seek it and that if ever we are constrained to life the hatchet against any tribe we will never lay it down till that tribe is exterminated or driven beyond the mississippi adjuring them therefore if they wish to remain on the land which covers the bones of their fathers to keep the peace with a people     who ask their friendship without needing it who wish to avoid war without fearing it in war they will kill some of us we shall destroy all of them let them then continue quiet at home take care of their women  children  remove from among them the agents of any nation persuading them to war and let them declare to us explicitly  categorically that they will do this in which case they will have nothing to fear from the preparations we are now unwillingly making to secure our own safety these ideas may form the substance of speeches to be made to them only varying therein according to the particular circumstances and dispositions of particular tribes softening them to some and strengthening them as to others i presume too that such presents as would show a friendly liberality should at the same time be made to those who unequivocally manifest intentions to remain friends and as to those who indicate contrary intentions the preparations made should immediately look towards them and it will be a subject for consideration whether on satisfactory evidence that any tribe means to strike us we shall not anticipate by giving them the first blow before matters between us  england are so far advanced as that their troops or subjects should dare to join the indians against us it will make a powerful impression on the indians if those who spur them on to war see them destroyed without yielding them any aid to decide on this the governors of michigan  indiana should give us weekly information  the postmaster general should immediately put the line of posts to detroit into the     most rapid motion attention too is requisite to the safety of the post at michillimacinac i send this letter open to the secretary of state with a desire that with the documents it may be forwarded to the secretary of the navy at baltimore the attorney general at wilmington the secretary of the treasury at n york  finally to yourself that it may be considered only as the origination of a proposition to which i wish each of them to propose such amendments as their judgment shall approve to be addressed to yourself  that from all our opinions you will make up a general one  act on it without waiting to refer it

think with you we had better send to algiers some of the losing articles in order to secure peace there while it is uncertain elsewhere while war with england is probable everything leading to it with other nations should be avoided except with spain as to her i think it the precise moment when we should declare to the french government that we will instantly seize on the floridas as reprisal for the spoliations denied us and that if by a given day they are paid to us we will restore all east of the perdido  hold the rest subject to amicable decision otherwise we will   0 hold them forever as compensation for the spoliations this to be a subject of consideration when we assemble one reason for suggesting a discontinuance of the daily post was that it is not kept up by contract but at the expense of the u s but the principal reason was to avoid giving ground for clamor the general idea is that those who receive annual compensations should be constantly at their posts our constituents might not in the first moment consider   that we all have property to take care of which we cannot abandon for temporary salaries   that we have health to take care of which at this season cannot be preserved at washington  d that while at our separate homes our public duties are fully executed and at much greater personal labor than while we are together when a short conference saves a long letter i am aware that in the present crisis some incident might turn up where a days delay might infinitely overweigh a months expense of the daily post affectionate salutations thomas jefferson

i observe that the merchants of new york  philadelphia think that notice of our present crisis with england should be sent to the streights of sunda by     a public ship but that such a vessel going to calcutta or into the bay of bengal would give injurious alarm while those of baltimore think such a vessel going to the streights of sunda would have the same effect your proposition very happily in my opinion avoids the objections of all parties will do what some think useful  none think injurious i therefore approve of it to wit that by some of the private vessels now going instructions from the department of state be sent to our consul at the isle of france to take proper measures to advise all our returning vessels as far as he can to be on their guard against the english and that we now appoint  send a consul to batavia to give the same notice to our vessels returning through the streights of sunda for this purpose i sign a blank sheet of paper over which signature the secretary of state will have a consular commission written leaving a blank for the name to be filled up by yourself with the name of such discreet  proper person as shall be willing to go if he does not mean to reside there as consul we must bear his expenses out  in  compensate his time i presume you will receive this commission  the papers you sent me through the secretary of state on the  th i approve of the orders you gave for intercepting the pirates  that they were given as the occasion required without waiting to consult me which would have defeated the object i am very glad indeed that the piratical vessel and some of the crew have been taken  hope the whole will be taken  that this has been done by the militia it will     contribute to show the expediency of an organized naval militia i send you the extract of a letter i lately wrote to genl dearborne on the defence of the chesapeake your situation will better enable you to make inquiries into the practicability of the plan than he can if practicable it is allimportant i do not see the probability of receiving from gr britain reparation for the wrong committed on the chesapeake and future security for our seamen in the same favorable light with mr gallatin  yourself if indeed the consequence of the battle of friedland can be to exclude her from the baltic she may temporize with us but if peace among the continental powers of europe should leave her free in her intercourse with the powers who will then be neutral the present ministry perhaps no ministry which can now be formed will not in my opinion give us the necessary assurance respecting our flag in that case it must bring on a war soon and if so it can never be in a better time for us i look to this therefore as most probably now to take place altho i do most sincerely wish that a just  sufficient security may be given us  such an interruption of our prosperity avoided i salute you with affection and respect thomas jefferson september     0  monticello thomas paine to thomas paine j mss monticello september     0  dear sir —i received last night your favor of aug    and with it a model of a contrivance for     making one gunboat do nearly double execution it has all the ingenuity and simplicity which generally mark your inventions i am not nautical enough to judge whether two guns may be too heavy for the bow of a gunboat or whether any other objection will countervail the advantage it offers and which i see visibly enough i send it this day to the secretary of the navy within whose department it lies to try  to judge it believing myself that gunboats are the only water defence which can be useful to us  protect us from the ruinous folly of a navy i am pleased with everything which promises to improve them the battle of friedland armistice with russia conquest of prussia will be working on the british stomach when they will receive information of the outrage they have committed on us yet having entered on the policy proposed by their champion war in disguise of making the property of all nations lawful plunder to support a navy which their own resources cannot support i doubt if they will readily relinquish it that war with us had been predetermined may be fairly inferred from the diction of berkleys order the jesuitism of which proves it ministerial from its being so timed as to find us in the midst of burrs rebellion as they expected from the contemporaneousness of the indian excitements and of the wide  sudden spread of their maritime spoliations i salute you with great esteem  respect      thomas jefferson sept   0  monticello robert smith to the secretary of the navy robert smith j mss monticello sept   0  dear sir —mr madison who is with me suggests the expediency of immediately taking up the case of capt porter against whom you know mr erskine lodged a very serious complaint for an act of violence committed on a british seaman in the mediterranean while mr erskine was reminded of the mass of complaints we had against his government for similar violences he was assured that contending against such irregularities ourselves and requiring satisfaction for them we did not mean to follow the example and that on captain porters return it should be properly inquired into the sooner this is done the better because if great britain settles with us satisfactorily all our subsisting differences      should require in return to have an appearance of reciprocity of wrong as well as redress a marked condemnation of capt porter it would be embarrassing were that the only obstacle to a peaceable settlement and the more so as we cannot but disavow his act on the contrary if we immediately look into it we shall be more at liberty to be moderate in the censure of it on the very ground of british example and the case being once passed upon we can more easily avoid the passing on it a second time as against a settled principle it is therefore to put it in our power to let capt porter off as easily as possible as a valuable officer whom we all wish to favor that i suggest to you the earliest attention to the inquiry and the promptest settlement of it i set out tomorrow on a journey of  00 miles  shall be absent   or   days i salute you affectionately thomas jefferson sept    0  monticello james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss monticello sept    0  i returned here yesterday afternoon  found as i might expect an immense mass of business with the papers received from you i enclose you some others which will need no explanation i am desired by the secy of the navy to say what must be the conduct of com rodgers at new york on the late or any similar entry of that harbor by the british armed vessels i refer him to the orders to decatur as to what he was to do if the vessels in the chesapeake   remain quiet in the bay   come to     hampton road   enter eliz river and recommend an application of the same rules to n york accommodated to the localities of the place should the british government give us reparation of the past  security for the future yet the continuance of their vessels in our harbors in defiance constitutes a new injury which will not be included in any settlement with our ministers  will furnish good ground for declaring their future exclusion from our waters in addition with the other reasonable ground before existing our indian affairs in the n w on the missouri  at the natchitoches wear a very unpleasant aspect as to the first all i think is done which is necessary but for this  other causes i am anxious to be again assembled i have a letter from connecticut the prosecution there will be dismissed this term on the ground that the case is not cognisable by the courts of the u s perhaps you can intimate this where it will give tranquillity affectionate salutations the commission to the secy of orleans having another mistake robinson instead of robertson has been returned to me for correction i have corrected it but it will be necessary the record should also be corrected thomas jefferson sept      0  monticello robert smith to the secretary of the navy robert smith j mss monticello sept      0  dear sir —on my return yesterday i found yours of the  0th and now reenclose you com     rodgers letter you remember that the orders to decatur were to leave the british ships unmolested so long as they laid quiet in the bay but if they should attempt to enter eliz river to attack them with all his force the spirit of these orders should i think be applied to new york so long as the british vessels merely enter the hook or remain quiet there i would not precipitate hostilities i do not sufficiently know the geography of the harbor to draw the line which they should not pass perhaps the narrows perhaps some other place which yourself or commodore rogers can fix with the aid of the advice he can get in n york but a line should be drawn which if they attempt to pass he should attack them with all his force perhaps he would do well to have his boats ordinarily a little without the line to let them see they are not to approach it but whether he can lay there in safety ordinarily he must judge but if the british vessels continue at the hook great attention should be paid to prevent their receiving supplies or their landing or having any intercourse with the shore or other vessels i left mr nicholass yesterday morning he is indisposed with his annual influenza mrs nicholas is well i shall be at washington the  d proximo affectionate salutations thomas jefferson september  0   0  james madison to the secretary of state james madison j mss september  0   0  i return all the papers received in yours of the   th

any articles except slaves from being carried up the mississippi to baton rouge so we do not mean to prohibit them  that we only ask a perfect  equal reciprocity to be observed on the rivers which pass thro the territories of both nations must we not denounce to congress the spanish decree as well as the british regulation pretending to be the countervail of the french one of our first consultations on meeting must be on the question whether we shall not order all the militia  volunteers destined for the canadas to be embodied on the   th of octr  to march immediately to such points on the way to their destination as shall be pointed out there to await the decision of congress i approve of the letter to erskine in answering his last should he not be reminded how strange it is he should consider as a hostility our refusing to receive but under a flag persons from vessels remaining  acting in our waters in defiance of the authority of the country the postrider of the day before yesterday has behaved much amiss in not calling on you when i found your mail in the valise  that they had not called on you i replaced the mail in it  expressly directed him to return by you

favors of the       th on my return to this place on the   th and such was the mass of business accumulated in my absence that i have not till now been able to take up your letters you are certainly free to make use of any of the papers we put into mr hays hands  with a single reservation to wit some of them are expressed to be confidential and others are of that kind which i always consider as confidential conveying censure on particular individuals  therefore never communicate them beyond the immediate executive circle i accordingly write to this effect to mr hay the scenes which have been acted at richmond are such as have never before been exhibited in any country where all regard to public character has not yet been thrown off they are equivalent to a proclamation of impunity to every  00 traitorous combination which may be formed to destroy the union and they preserve a head for all such combinations as may be formed within and a centre for all the intrigues  machinations which foreign governments may nourish to disturb us however they will produce an amendment to the constitution which keeping the judges independent of the executive will not leave them so of the nation i shall leave this place on the  0th for washington it is with pleasure that i perceive from all the expressions of public sentiment that the virulence of those whose treasons you have defeated only place you on higher ground in the opinion of the nation i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson sep    0  monticello tench coxe to tench coxe j mss monticello sep    0  sir —i have read with great satisfaction your observations on the principles for equalizing the power of the different nations on the sea and think them perfectly sound certainly it will be better to produce a balance on that element by reducing the means of its great monopoliser than by endeavoring to raise our own to an equality with theirs i have ever wished that all nations would adopt a navigation law against those who have one which perhaps would be better than against all indiscriminately and while in france i proposed it there probably that country is now ripe for it i see no reason why your paper  0  should not be published as it would have effect towards bringing the public mind to proper principles i do not know whether you kept a copy if you did not i will return it otherwise i retain it for the perusal of my coadjutors and perhaps to suggest the measure abroad i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson sep    0  monticello william thomson to william thomson j mss

whole subject as well digested from this specimen of your writing i have no doubt you will do justice to any subject you undertake and think you cannot find a better than the one you have fixed on the history of the western country we have been too long permitting its facts to go into oblivion colo boon the first emigrant to it is i believe still living on the missouri the scenes which have been acting at richmond are sufficient to fill us with alarm we had supposed we possessed fixed laws to guard us equally against treason  oppression but it now appears we have no law but the will of the judge never will chicanery have a more difficult task than has been now accomplished to warp the text of the law to the will of him who is to construe it our case too is the more desperate as to attempt to make the law plainer  0  by amendment is only throwing out new materials for sophistry i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson octr   0  washington cæsar a rodney to the

the last the good old book speaking of children says happy is the man who hath his quiver full of them i hope mrs rodney is doing well in which case  when ever her situation will admit your coming on without uneasiness the approaching convention of congress would render your assistance here desirable besides the varieties of general matter we have to lay before them on which we should be glad of your aid and counsel there are two subjects of magnitude in which your agency will be peculiarly necessary   the selection  digestion of the documents respecting burrs treason which must be laid before congress in two copies or perhaps printed which would take  0 days   a statement of the conduct of gr brit towards this country so far as respects the violations of the maritime law of nations here it would be necessary to state each distinct principle violated  to quote the cases of violation  to conclude with a view of her viceadmiralty courts their venality  rascality in order to shew that however for conveniences  not of right the court of the  0  captor is admitted to exercise the jurisdiction yet that in so palpable an abuse of that trust some remedy must be applied everything we see  hear leads in my opinion to war we have therefore much to consult  determine on preparatory to that event i salute you with affectionate respect seventh annual message   oct    first rough draught   england circumstances f c which seriously threaten the peace  prosperity of our  0  country have made it a duty to convene you at an earlier period than usual that love of peace so much cherished in the bosoms of our citizens which has so long guided the  0  proceedings of their public functionaries councils and induced forbearance under so many wrongs has not been sufficient to secure us in the paths of peace quiet pursuits  0  of industry and the moment is possibly near at hand seems to be approaching when we shall may owe it to mankind as well as to ourselves to restrain wrong by resistance  0  and to assist in maintaining among nations the authority of most right by defeating all interests calculated on a violation of them it defeat those calculations of which interest  0  is the sole principle you well know that the long train of injuries  depredns under which our commerce  navigation have been afflicted on the high seas for years past the successive innovations on those rules of public law established by the reason  usage of nations to regulate  0  their intercourse  constituting the sole supplying the office of to be the umpire  guardian of their rights  peace  safety among them these violations we met with friendly remonstrances only always indulging the hope that reason would at length prevail over the dictates of   0 mistaken calculations of a mistaken interest and that voluntary justice redress would spare save us the mutual calamities of war in this train were our affairs with england when the patience of our citizens was brought to severe proof trial by the wanton murder of a fellow citizen     in the waters of ny following his ordinary occupations in the waters of n y by a shot from a british armed vessel it became now this added to other occurrences rendering it apparent that unless the points of difference between that nation  ours could be immediately settled by mutual agreement brought to early settlement a recurrence to force would be the only alternative certain unavoidable an extraordinary mission for the purpose therefore took place after long and earnest efforts by our ministers to obtain conditions of some equality  within the limits of their instructions pressed reduced on every article to the to the minimum on nearly every article framed in the truest spirit of amity  moderation they our ministers at length signed an instrument with a frank avowal however to the british other negociators that they did it against their instructions and could not authorize an expectation that it would be ratified pledge their government for its ratification it was entirely in truth inadmissible still anxious however to     relating with that nation placed on a certain  peaceable footing even to provide for peace even by greater sacrifices of right than could before have been thought necessary new instructions were sent to our ministers to try whether even on these conditions an establishment of certain other rights could be obtained which were indispensable our ministers were authorized to make further efforts for accommodation on this new reference of our rights to to amicable discussion was made here on the and was presumed existing in full force we were reposing in confidence when on the   d day of june last by a solemn formal order from a british admiral the frigate chesapeake leaving her port for a distant service was attacked by one of those vessels which had been lying in our harbours enjoying under the indulgences of hospitality was disabled from further proceeding had several of her crew killed two taken out who have been unquestionably proved to have been native citizens of the us one other born in s america but     domieiled here from his in faney and a fourth of whom satisfactory information has not yet been received but who may be admitted to have been a british subject without at all impairing the unqualified character of this atrocious outrage and four taken away on this outrage no temperate commentaries can be made nor or can any be necessary its character has been pronounced by general acclamation in which in no instant of our history has the nation declared such unanimity the indignant voice of our citizens who with an unanimity and emphasis never exceeded in any period of our history i immediately by proclamation interdicted our harbors  waters to all british armed vessels forbade intercourse with them and uncertain to what lengths how far hostilities were intended to be carried and the town of norfolk indeed being threatened with an immediate attacked a sufficient force was ordered for the protection of that place and such other preparations immediately commenced and pursued as the prospect rendered proper     an armed vessel of the us was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at london to call on that govmt for proper satisfaction for the outrage which had been committed and effectual security assurance against the practice which led to it a very short interval ought now to bring us the answer which shall be communicated to you as soon as it is received as well as shall also be then also or as soon after the public interests shall be found to admit the unratified treaty with the reasons for rejecting it and proceedings relative to it shall be made known to you under the fullest assurance that there will not be two opinions on the subject the aggression thus begun has been continued on the part of the british armed vessels commanders by remaining within our waters in defiance of the authority of the country  by daily habitual violations of its jurisdiction and at length by putting to death one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on board the chesapeake these aggravations having taken place since the communications     forwarded to our ministers must of course be a subject of after reckoning with furnished serious demands of additional reparation on that government and necessarily lead to the policy of either never admitting an armed vessel into our harbors or of maintaining in every harbor such an armed force as may constrain armed vessels their obedience to the laws  protect the lives and property of our citizens against their armed guests the expense of such a standing force and its inconsistence with our principles dispense with all obligations of hospitality which would necessarily induce that call for it  leave us equally free to exclude the navy as we are the army of a foreign power from commorance within our limits until a redress of with these aggressions in view we can scarcely bring our minds to notice any addition to the catalogue new violation of maritime rights violated to wards us by that nation their government however which has been added to the catalogue of former unlawful practices one however is of such     extent as cannot be overlooked the government of that nation has issued an order interdicting all trade by neutrals not only from one port to another of the same nation at war with her but of different nations also at war with her between ports not in amity with them and being now at war with every nation on the atlantic  mediterranean seas our vessels are now forbidden to pass from any one port to any other of those seas without first returning home so that unless their whole cargo must be sold in the first port they touch at or brought back the object of these successive protensions cannot be cloacked it is that there shall be no vessel on the ocean which does not belong to great britain and required to sacrifice their cargo at the first port they touch or to bring it home return home without the benefit of trying going to any other market under this new law of the ocean our trade on the mediterranean has been swept away by seizures  condemnations and that in other seas places has been more recently     attacked also not a little vexed assailed is likely to share threatened with the same fate spain our differences with spain remain still unsettled no measure having been taken on her part since my last communications to congress to bring them to a close but the present under a state of things in europe admitting their being resumed under better expectations which may favor reconsideration they have been recently pressed and may be expected without further delay to be brought to an issue of some sort to our former grounds of complaint has been added a very serious one as you will see by the decree a copy of which is now communicated proper representations have been made on the occasion and i have reason to expect they have not been without effect no new collisions have taken place with their subjects on our borders have taken place or seem to be apprehended during the short period now to intervene before an answer which shall decide our course     other nations with the other nations of europe our harmony has been uninterrupted  commerce  friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual footing barbary our peace with the several states on the coast of barbary appears as firm as at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other nation indians among our indian neighbors in the north western quarter some fermentation was observed soon after the late occurrences threatening the continuance of our peace messages were said to be interchanged and tokens to be passing which usually denote a state of restlessness     among them and the character of the agitators pointed to the source of excitement measures were immediately taken for providing against that danger instructions were given to require explanations and with assurances of our continued friendship to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home taking no part in quarrels not belonging to them as far as we are yet informed the tribes in our vicinity who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with us  to their peace with all others while those more remote  more frequented by foreign agents do not shew that present appearances sufficiently quiet aspect which would permit an to justify the intermission of military preparation precaution on our part the great tribes on our south western quarter much advanced beyond the others in agriculture  household arts appear tranquil  identifying with us in their views with ours in proportion to their advancements with the whole of these people in   0 every quarter i shall continue to inculcate peace  friendship with all their neighbors  perseverance in those occupations  pursuits which will best promote their own wellbeing fortifications the appropriations of the last session for defence of our sea port towns  harbors were made under the expectation that a continuance of our peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience it has been thought better to employ apply the sums then given chiefly to the defence of new york charleston  new orleans as most open  most likely first to need protection and to leave places less immediately in danger to the provisions of the present session gunboats the gunboats too already provided have on the same a like principle been chiefly assigned to new york new orleans  the mouth of the chesapeake whether our moveable force on the water so material in aid of the defensive works on land should be augmented in this or what any other form is left to your the wisdom of     the legislature for the purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attack of on our harbors it becomes difficulties too are likely to occur in manning these vessels even for harbor defence it is is a matter therefore for consideration therefore whether the seamen of the us may not justly be formed into a special militia to be called on for tours of duty in defence of the harbors where they shall happen to be magazines the moment our peace was threatened i deemed it indispensable to secure ample provision of every article of military stores of with which our magazines were not sufficiently provided furnished to have awaited a previous  special sanction by law would have lost occasions which might never be retrieved i did not hesitate therefore to authorize engagements for such supplements to our existing stock as would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us these contracts are considerable and depend for their execution on provisions to be made by yourselves the legislature who feeling the same     anxiety for the safety of our country so materially ensured by this precaution will i trust approve when done what if then assembled you they would have seen so important to be done if then assembled accounts of these contracts shall be laid before you army whether a regular army is to be raised  to what extent must depend on the information so shortly expected in the meantime i have called on the states for quotas of militia to be in readiness for present defence  have moreover encouraged the acceptance of volunteers  am happy to inform you that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in every part of the union and in greater numbers than they were required they are ordered to be organized and ready at a moments warning to proceed on any service to which they may be called and every preparation within the executive powers has been made to ensure us the benefit of early exertions i informed congress at their last session of the enterprises against the public peace which     were believed to be in preparation by aaron burr  his associates of the measures taken to defeat them  to bring the offenders to justice their enterprises were happily defeated by the patriotic exertions of the militia wherever called into action  by the fidelity of the army and energy of the commander in chief of the army of the us in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves on the sabine repairing to meet those arising on the mississippi  dissipating before their explosion plots engendering there and truth  duty alone extort the observation that wherever the laws were appealed to in aid of the public safety their operations were was on behalf of those only against whom they were invoked as a part of the public you have learned the arraignment of the principal offenders in the district court of virginia i have thought it my duty to lay before you the proceedings  the evidence publicly exhibited there together with some which was not publicly heard this you will be enabled you to judge whether the defect     was in the testimony or in the laws or whether there is not a radical defect in the administration of the law and wherever it shall be found the legislature alone can apply or originate the remedy the framers of our constitution certainly supposed they had guarded as well their government against destruction by treason as their citizens against oppression under pretence of it and if the pliability of the law as construed in the case of fries and its wonderful refractoriness as construed in that of burr shew that neither end has been attained and induce an awful doubt whether we all live under the same law the right of the jury too to decide law as well as fact seems nugatory without the evidence portinent to their sense of the law if these ends are not attained it becomes worthy of enquiry by what means more effectual they may be secured finance the receipts of the treasury during the year ending the day of have exceeded the sum of millions of dollars which with millions in the treasury at the beginning of     the year have enabled us after meeting the current demands to pay millions of the principal of our public debt  millions of interest these paiments with those of the preceding  ½ years have extinguished of the funded debt millions of d being the whole which can could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law  of our contracts and have left us in the treasury millions of dollars this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumulatn of the surpluses of revenue which after paying the instalments of debt as they shall become payable will remain without any specific object a part indeed may be advantageously applied towards providing defence for the exposed points of our country on such a scale as shall be adapted to our principles  circumstances this object is doubtless among the first which claims entitled to attention in such a state of our finances  it is one which whether we have peace or war will give a state of security always desirable where it is due whether what will remain     of this with the future surplusses may be usefully applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully to others requiring new authorities or how otherwise they shall be disposed of are questions calling for early the notice from congress unless indeed they shall be superceded by a change in the our state of things public relations now depending on awaiting the decision determination of others whatever be that determination it is a great consoln that it will be read become known at a moment when the supreme council of the nation is assembled at its post and ready to give the aids of its wisdom  authority to whatever course the good of our country shall then call us to pursue some matters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications  nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give informn or dispatch to the proceedings of the legislature in the exercise of their high duties and at a moment

last communications these however gave reason to expect that it would with the other nations of europe our harmony has been uninterrupted  commerce  friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual footing our peace with the several states on the coast of barbary appears as firm as at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other nation among our indian neighbors in the north western quarter some fermentation was observed soon after the late occurrences threatening the continuance of our peace messages were said to be interchanged and tokens to be passing which usually denote a state of restlessness among     them  the character of the agitators pointed to the source of excitement measures were immediately taken for providing against that danger instructions were given to require explanations and with assurances of our continued friendship to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home taking no part in quarrels not belonging to them as far as we are yet informed the tribes in our vicinity who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with us  to their peace to adhere to their friendship with us and to their peace with all others while those more remote do not present appearances sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military precaution on our part the great tribes on our south western quarter much advanced beyond the others in agriculture and household arts appear tranquil and identifying their views with ours in proportion to their advancements with the whole of these people in   0 every quarter i shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship with all their neighbors  perseverance in those occupations and pursuits which will best promote their own well being the appropriations of the last session for the defence of our seaboard towns  harbors were made under expectation that a continuance of our peace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience it has been thought better to apply the sums then given chiefly towards the defence of new york charleston  new orleans chiefly as most open and most likely first to need protection and to leave places less immediately in danger to the provisions of the present session the gunboats too already provided have on a like principle been chiefly assigned to new york new orleans  the chesapeake whether our moveable force on the water so material in aid of the defensive works on the land should be augmented in this or any other form is left to the wisdom of the legislature for the purpose of manning     these vessels in sudden attacks on our harbours it is a matter for consideration whether the seamen of the us may not justly be formed into a special militia to be called on for tours of duty in defence of the harbours where they shall happen to be the ordinary militia of the place furnishing that portion which may consist of landsmen the moment our peace was threatened i deemed it indispensable to secure ample a greater provision of every article of military stores with which our magazines were not sufficiently furnished to have awaited a previous and special sanction by law would have lost occasions which might never be retrieved i did not hesitate therefore to authorize engagements for such supplements to our existing stock as would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us these contracts are considerable and depend for their execution on provisions to be made by the legislature which feeling the same anxiety for the     safety of our country so materially ensured by the precaution will i trust approve when done what they would have seen so important to be done if then assembled accounts of these contracts shall be laid before you whether a regular army is to be raised  to what extent must depend on the information so shortly expected in the meantime i have called on the states for quotas of militia to be in readiness for present defence and have moreover encouraged the acceptance of volunteers and i am happy to inform you that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in every part of the union they are ordered to be organized and ready at a moments warning to proceed on any service to which they may be called and every preparation within the executive powers has been made to ensure us the benefit of early exertions i informed congress at their last session of the enterprises against the public peace which     were believed to be in preparation by aaron burr and his associates of the measures taken to defeat them  to bring the offenders to justice their enterprises were have been happily defeated by the patriotic exertions of the militia wherever called into action by the fidelity of the army and energy of the commander in chief in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves on the sabine repairing to meet those arising on the mississippi and dissipating before their explosion plots engendering there and truth  duty alone extort the observation that whenever the laws were appealed to in aid of the public safety their operation was on behalf of those only against whom they were invoked as a part of the public you have learned the arraignment of the principal offenders in the district court of virginia i have thought it shall consider it my duty to lay before you the proceedings  the evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the principal offenders before the district court of virginia there     together with some evidence which was not publicly there heard from the whole you will be enabled to judge whether the defect was in the testimony in the law or in the administration of the law and wherever itshall be found the legislature alone can apply or originate the remedy the framers of our constitution certainly supposed they had guarded as well their government against destruction by treason as their citizens against oppression under pretence of it and if these ends are not obtained it becomes worthy of enquiry is of importance to enquire by what means more effectual they may be secured finance the accounts of the receipts of revenue during the present year being not yet all made up received a correct statement will be hereafter transmitted from the treasury in the meantime     it is ascertained that the receipts have dollars which with millions in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting the current demands and interest incurred to pay millions of the principal of our funded debt these paiments with those of the preceding five  a half years have extinguished of the funded debt millions of dollars being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and of our contract and have left us in the treasury millions of dollars a portion of this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumulation of the surpluses of revenue which after paying the instalments of debt as they shall become payable will remain without specific object a part indeed may be advantageously applied towards providing defence for the exposed points of our country on such a scale as shall be adapted to our principles  circumstances this object is doubtless among the first entitled to attention in such a state of our finances and it is     one which whether we have peace or war will give security where it is due whether what shall remain of this with the future surpluses may be usefully applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully to others requiring new authorities or how otherwise they shall be disposed of are questions calling for the notice of congress unless indeed they shall be superceded by a change in in our public relations now awaiting the determination of others whatever be that determination it is a great consolation that it will become known at a moment when the supreme council of the nation is assembled at its post and ready to give the aids of its wisdom  authority to whatever course the good of our country shall then call us to pursue matters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications and nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give information or dispatch to the proceedings of the legislature in the exercise of their high functions and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare     thomas jefferson november     0  washington robert williams to the governor of the mississippi territory robert williams washington november     0  sir —i have duly received your letter of august   th in which you express a wish that the letters received from you may be acknoledged in order to ascertain their safe transmission those received the present year have been of mar    may      0 june   july   august    and    they have not been before acknoleged in conformity with a practice which the constant pressure of business has forced me to follow of not answering letters which do not necessarily require it i have seen with regret the violence of the dissensions in your quarter we have the same in the territories of louisiana  michigan it seems that the smaller the society the bitterer the dissensions into which it breaks perhaps this observation answers all the objections drawn by mr adams from the small republics of italy i believe ours is to owe its permanence to its great extent and the smaller portion comparatively which can ever be convulsed at one time by local passions we expect shortly now to hear from england and to know how the present cloud is to terminate we are all pacifically inclined here if anything comes from thence which will permit us to follow our inclinations i salute you with esteem  respect     thomas jefferson nov    0  albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss nov    0  the defence of orleans against a land army can never be provided for according to the principles of the constitution till we can get a sufficient militia there i think therefore to get the enclosed bill brought forward again will you be so good as to make any alterations in it which the present state of the surveys may have rendered necessary  any others you shall think for the better thomas jefferson dec     0  confidential message   dec     0  to the senate  house of representatives of the united states having recently received from our late minister plenipotentiary at the court of london a duplicate     of dispatches the original of which has been sent by the revenge schooner not yet arrived i hasten to lay them before both houses of congress they contain the whole of what has passed between the two governments on the subject of the outrage committed by the british ship leopard on the frigate chesapeake congress will learn from these papers the present state of the discussion on that transaction and that it is to be transferred to this place by the mission of a special minister while this information will have its proper effect on their deliberations  proceedings respecting the relations between the two countries they will be sensible that the negociation being still depending it is proper for me to request that the communications may be considered as confidential thomas jefferson dec  0 0  washington joel barlow to joel barlow washington dec  0 0  dear sir —i return you mr laws letter with thanks for the communication i wish he may be a true prophet as to peace in   months it is impossible that any other man should wish it as much as i do altho duty may controul that wish the desire of peace is very much strengthened in me by that which i feel in favor of the great subjects of yours  mr fultons letters i had fondly hoped to set those enterprizes into motion with the last legislature i shall meet but the chance of war is an unfortunate check i do not however despair that the proposition of amendment may be sent   0 down this session to the legislatures but it is not certain there is a snailpaced gait for the advance of new ideas on the general mind under which we must acquiesce a  0 years experience of popular assemblies has taught me that you must give them time for every step you take if too hard pushed they baulk  the machine retrogrades i doubt whether precedence will be given to your part of the plan before mr fultons people generally have more feeling for canals  roads than education however i hope we can advance them with equal pace if the amendment is sent out this session returned to the next and no war takes place we may offer the plan to the next session in the form of a bill the preparation of which should be the work of the ensuing summer i salute you affectionately thomas jefferson december      0  gallatin special message on commercial depredations   december      0  to the senate and house of representatives of the united states— the communications now made showing the great and increasing dangers with which our vessels our     seamen and merchandise are threatened on the high seas and elsewhere from the belligerent powers of europe and it being of great importance to keep in safety these essential resources i deem it my duty to recommend the subject to the consideration of congress who will doubtless perceive all the advantages which may be expected from an inhibition of the departure of our vessels from the ports of the united states their wisdom will also see the necessity of making every preparation for whatever events may grow out of the present crisis thomas jefferson dec      0  washington albert gallatin to the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin j mss washington dec      0  it is impossible to detest more than i do the fraudulent  injurious practice of covering foreign vessels  cargoes under the american flag and i sincerely wish a systematic  severe course of punishment could be established it is only as a punishment of this fraud that we could deny to the portuguese vessel the liberty of departing but i do not know that a solitary  accidental instance of punishment would have any effect the vessel is bonâ fide portuguese the crew portuguese loaded with provisions for portugal an unoffending  friendly country to whom we wish no ill i have not sufficiently considered the embargo act to say how far the executive is at liberty to decide on these cases but     if we are free to do it i should be much disposed to take back her american papers  let her go especially on giving bond  security to land the cargo in portugal dangers of the sea  superior force excepted perhaps it would be proper to require the captain to give up also his certificate of citizenship which is also merely fraudulent has been the ground of fraudulent conversion and may be used on the voyage as a fraudulent cover to the cargo affect salutations end of volume x   as early as january of   0  jefferson had written to gallatin    you are right in my opinion as to mr ls proposition there is no constitutional difficulty as to the acquisition of territory and whether when acquired it may be taken into the union by the constitution as it now stands will become a question of expediency i think it will be safer not to permit the enlargement of the union but by amendment of the constitution in pursuance of this view upon receiving news of the cession he drew up the first of the amendments in above printed papers and sent it to the secretary of the navy in reply smith wrote him smith july   0  jefferson july   0  sir —i am greatly pleased with the ideas suggested in the proposed amendment of the constitution and i sincerely hope that they will be adopted by the legislature of the union but i am rather inclined to think that they ought not all to be ingrafted upon the constitution your great object is to prevent emigrations excepting to a certain portion of the ceded territory this could be effectually accomplished by a constitutional prohibition that congress should not erect or establish in that portion of the ceded territory situated north of lat    degrees any new state or territorial government and that they should not grant to any people excepting indians any right or title relative to any part of the said portion of the said territory all other powers of making exchanges working mines etc would then remain in congress to be exercised at discretion and in the exercise of this discretion subject as it would be to the three aforementioned restrictions i do not perceive that any thing could be done which would counteract your present intentions the rights of occupancy in the soil ought to be secured to the indians and government ought in my opinion to endeavour to obtain for them the exclusive occupation of the northern portion of louisiana excepting such posts as may be necessary to our trade and intercourse with them but ought not this to be a subject of legislative provision if the indian rights of occupancy be a part of the constitution might not the government be hereafter thereby much entangled under such a constitutional guarantee the indians might harass our military posts or our settlements in the southern portion or elsewhere in the most wanton manner and we could not disturb their rights of occupancy without a formal alteration of the constitution under the idea that so many  such undefined restrictions as you have proposed to be engrafted upon the constitution might in process of time embarress the government and might probably not be acceptable to congress i have respectfully submitted to your consideration the enclosed sketch the paper enclosed by smith is as follows amendment proposed to the constitution to be added to s   art   louisiana being in virtue of the treaty c incorporated with the united states and being thereby a part of the territory thereof congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the same as fully and effectually as if the same had been at the time of the establishment of the constitution a part of the territory of the u states provided nevertheless that congress shall not have power to erect or establish in that portion of louisiana which is situated north of the latitude of    degrees any new state or territorial government nor to grant to any citizen or citizens or other individual or individuals excepting indians any right or title whatever to any part of the said portion of louisiana until a new amendment of the constitution shall give that authority jefferson further wrote to john c breckenridge thomas jefferson aug    0  monticello john c breckenridge monticello aug    0  dear sir —the enclosed letter tho directed to you was intended to me also and was left open with a request that when perused i would forward it to you it gives me occasion to write a word to you on the subject of louisiana which being a new one an interchange of sentiments may produce correct ideas before we are to act on them our information as to the country is very incompleat we have taken measures to obtain it in full as to the settled part which i hope to receive in time for congress the boundaries which i deem not admitting question are the high lands on the western side of the missisipi enclosing all its waters the missouri of course and terminating in the line drawn from the northwestern point of the lake of the woods to the nearest source of the missipi as lately settled between gr britain and the u s we have some claims to extend on the sea coast westwardly to the rio norte or bravo and better to go eastwardly to the rio perdido between mobile  pensacola the antient boundary of louisiana these claims will be a subject of negociation with spain and if as soon as she is at war we push them strongly with one hand holding out a price in the other we shall certainly obtain the floridas and all in good time in the meanwhile without waiting for permission we shall enter into the exercise of the natural right we have always insisted on with spain to wit that of a nation holding the upper part of streams having a right of innocent passage thro them to the ocean we shall prepare her to see us practise on this  she will not oppose it by force objections are raising to the eastward against the vast extent of our boundaries and propositions are made to exchange louisiana or a part of it for the floridas but as i have said we shall get the floridas without and i would not give one inch of the waters of the mississippi to any nation because i see in a light very important to our peace the exclusive right to its navigation  the admission of no nation into it but as into the potomak or delaware with our consent  under our police these federalists see in this acquisition the formation of a new confederacy embracing all the waters of the missipi on both sides of it and a separation of its eastern waters from us these combinations depend on so many circumstances which we cannot foresee that i place little reliance on them we have seldom seen neighborhood produce affection among nations the reverse is almost the universal truth besides if it should become the great interest of those nations to separate from this if their happiness should depend on it so strongly as to induce them to go through that convulsion why should the atlantic states dread it but especially why should we their present inhabitants take side in such a question when i view the atlantic states procuring for those on the eastern waters of the missipi friendly instead of hostile neighbors on its western waters i do not view it as an englishman would the procuring future blessings for the french nation with whom he has no relations of blood or affection the future inhabitants of the atlantic  missipi states will be our sons we leave them in distinct but bordering establishments we think we see their happiness in their union  we wish it events may prove it otherwise and if they see their interest in separation why should we take side with our atlantic rather than our missipi descendants it is the elder and the younger son differing god bless them both  keep them in union if it be for their good but separate them if it be better the inhabited part of louisiana from point coupée to the sea will of course be immediately a territorial government and soon a state but above that the best use we can make of the country for some time will be to give establishments in it to the indians on the east side of the missipi in exchange for their present country and open land offices in the last  thus make this acquisition the means of filling up the eastern side instead of drawing off its population when we shall be full on this side we may lay off a range of states on the western bank from the head to the mouth  so range after range advancing compactly as we multiply this treaty must of course be laid before both houses because both have important functions to exercise respecting it they i presume will see their duty to their country in ratifying  paying for it so as to secure a good which would otherwise probably be never again in their power but i suppose they must then appeal to the nation for an additional article to the constitution approving  confirming an act which the nation had not previously authorized the constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory still less for incorporating foreign nations into our union the executive in seizing the fugitive occurrence which so much advances the good of their country have done an act beyond the constitution the legislature in casting behind them metaphysical subtleties and risking themselves like faithful servants must ratify  pay for it and throw themselves on their country for doing for them unauthorized what we know they would have done for themselves had they been in a situation to do it it is the case of a guardian investing the money of his ward in purchasing an important adjacent territory  saying to him when of age i did this for your good i pretend to no right to bind you you may disavow me and i must get out of the scrape as i can i thought it my duty to risk myself for you but we shall not be disavowed by the nation and their act of indemnity will confirm  not weaken the constitution by more strongly marking out its lines we have nothing later from europe than the public papers give i hope yourself and all the western members will make a sacred point of being at the first day of the meeting of congress for vestra res agitur accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of esteem  respect after writing thus jefferson thought it wise to change his views and under date of aug   th he again wrote to breckenridge thomas jefferson breckenridge dear sir —i wrote you on the   th inst on the subject of louisiana and the constitutional provision which might be necessary for it a letter received yesterday shews that nothing must be said on that subject which may give a pretext for retracting but that we should do subsilentio what shall be found necessary be so good therefore as to consider that part of my letter as confidential it strengthens the reasons for desiring the presence of every friend to the treaty on the first day of the session perhaps you can impress this necessity on the senators of the western states by private letter accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great respect  esteem on the same day he wrote to thomas paine thomas jefferson thomas paine dear sir —on the  0th inst i wrote you on the subject of louisiana and mentioned the question of a supplement to the constitution on that account a letter received yesterday renders it prudent to say nothing on that subject but to do subsilentio what shall be found necessary that part of my letter therefore be so good as to consider as confidential accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect the reason for this change is given in a letter to the secretary of state thomas jefferson aug      0  monticello monticello aug      0  dear sir —i enclose you two letters from rob r livingston that of the  d of june is just intelligible enough in the unciphered parts to create anxieties which perhaps the cipher may remove i communicate them for your information  shall be glad to receive them deciphered i infer that the less we say about constitutional difficulties respecting louisiana the better and that what is necessary for surmounting them must be done subsilentio    mr king said to mr gallatin that the idea of selling louisiana was   weeks before the treaty assimilated at paris with the sale of dunkirk by charles the  d and that mr livingston had not at that time the least expectation of success accept my affectionate salutations and assurances of constant esteem to the same correspondent he wrote on august   th saying i suppose monroe will touch on the limits of louisiana only incidentally inasmuch as its extension to perdido curtails florida  renders it of less worth i have used my spare moments to investigate by the help of my books here the subject of the limits of louisiana i am satisfied our right to the perdido is substantial  can be opposed by a quibble on form only and our right westwardly to the bay of st bernard may be strongly maintained i will use the first leisure to make a statement of the facts  principles on which this depends further reflection on the amendmt to the constitution necessary in the case of louisiana satisfies me it will be better to give general powers with specified exceptions somewhat in the way stated below the paper so enclosed is the second one above printed a copy of this same paper was sent to the attorneygeneral with the following paper thomas jefferson aug  0   0  monticello monticello aug  0   0  dear sir —the enclosed letter came to hand by yesterdays post you will be sensible of the circumstances which make it improper that i should hazard a formal answer as well as of the desire its friendly aspect naturally excites that those concerned in it should understand that the spirit they express is friendly viewed you can judge also from your knolege of the ground whether it may be usefully encouraged i take the liberty therefore of availing myself of your neighborhood to boston and of your friendship to me to request you to say to the capt and others verbally whatever you think would be proper as expressive of my sentiments on the subject with respect to the day on which they wish to fix their anniversary they may be told that disapproving myself of transferring the honors and veneration for the great birthday of our republic to any individual or of dividing them with individuals i have declined letting my own birthday be known  have engaged my family not to communicate it this has been the uniform answer to every application of the kind on further consideration as to the amendment to our constitution respecting louisiana i have thought it better instead of enumerating the powers which congress may exercise to give them the same powers they have as to other portions of the union generally and to enumerate the special exceptions in some such form as the following    i quote this for your consideration observing that the less that is said about any constitutional difficulty the better and that it will be desirable for congress to do what is necessary in silence i find but one opinion as to the necessity of shutting up the country for some time we meet in washington the   th proximo to prepare for congress accept my affectionate salutations  great esteem  respect in addition jefferson wrote to wilson cary nicholas thomas jefferson sep     0  monticello wilson cary nicholas monticello sep     0  dear sir —your favor of the  d was delivered me at court but we were much disappointed at not seeing you here mr madison  the gov being here at the time i enclose you a letter from monroe on the subject of the late treaty you will observe a hint in it to do without delay what we are bound to do there is reason in the opinion of our ministers to believe that if the thing were to do over again it could not be obtained  that if we give the least opening they will declare the treaty void a warning amounting to that has been given to them  an unusual kind of letter written by their minister to our secretary of state direct whatever congress shall think it necessary to do should be done with as little debate as possible  particularly so far as respects the constitutional difficulty i am aware of the force of the observations you make on the power given by the constn to congress to admit new states into the union without restraining the subject to the territory then constituting the u s but when i consider that the limits of the u s are precisely fixed by the treaty of      that the constitution expressly declares itself to be made for the u s i cannot help believing the intention was to permit congress to admit into the union new states which should be formed out of the territory for which  under whose authority alone they were then acting i do not believe it was meant that they might receive england ireland holland c into it which would be the case on your construction when an instrument admits two constructions the one safe the other dangerous the one precise the other indefinite i prefer that which is safe  precise i had rather ask an enlargement of power from the nation where it is found necessary than to assume it by a construction which would make our powers boundless our peculiar security is in possession of a written constitution let us not make it a blank paper by construction i say the same as to the opinion of those who consider the grant of the treaty making power as boundless if it is then we have no constitution if it has bounds they can be no others than the definitions of the powers which that instrument gives it specifies  delineates the operations permitted to the federal government and gives all the powers necessary to carry these into execution whatever of these enumerated objects is proper for a law congress may make the law whatever is proper to be executed by way of a treaty the president  senate may enter into the treaty whatever is to be done by a judicial sentence the judges may pass the sentence nothing is more likely than that their enumeration of powers is defective this is the ordinary case of all human works let us go on then perfecting it by adding by way of amendment to the constitution those powers which time  trial show are still wanting but it has been taken too much for granted that by this rigorous construction the treaty power would be reduced to nothing i had occasion once to examine its effect on the french treaty made by the old congress  found that out of thirty odd articles which that contained there were one two or three only which could not now be stipulated under our present constitution i confess then i think it important in the present case to set an example against broad construction by appealing for new power to the people if however our friends shall think differently certainly i shall acquiesce with satisfaction confiding that the good sense of our country will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill effects no apologies for writing or speaking to me freely are necessary on the contrary nothing my friends can do is so dear to me  proves to me their friendship so clearly as the information they give me of their sentiments  those of others on interesting points where i am to act and where information  warning is so essential to excite in me that due reflection which ought to precede action i leave this about the   st and shall hope the district court will give me an opportunity of seeing you accept my affectionate salutations  assurances of cordial esteem  respect   the following is on a separate slip immediately following the above but it is not in jeffersons handwriting together with such tract or tracts elsewhere within the province not exceeding in the whole one million acres as particular circumstances may in the opinion of congress render it expedient to dispose of   from the original in the possession of dr thomas addis emmet of new york   queries   what are the settlements of citizens on the east side of pearl river stating their geographical position extent  numbers   are there good lands adjoining them to render them capable of enlargement   have they encroached on the indians   are the settlements in a course of enlargement by persons setting down on lands without title   the general character of the inhabitants  from whence they are   a special list by name of all such individuals worthy of appointment to such offices as may be necessary among them and characters so particularized as that we may know for what each is fit   a general account of the spanish settlements in the adjacent country stating all material circumstances relative to them particularly their geographical position  numbers those on the chatahouchy excambier mobile  pascagoula rivers especially   their military posts the position  strength of each and especially on the mobile   the purpose of these queries is told by jefferson in a letter to william dunbar thomas jefferson july   th   0  washington william dunbar washington july   th   0  dear sir —before you receive this you will have heard through the channel of the public papers of the cession of louisiana by france to the united states the terms as stated in the national intelligencer are accurate that the treaty may be ratified in time i have found it necessary to convene congress on the   th of october and it is very important for the happiness of the country that they should possess all the information which can be obtained respecting it that they make the best arrangement practicable for its good government it is the most necessary because they will be obliged to ask from the people an amendment of the constitution authorizing their receiving the province into the union and providing for its government and the limitations of power which shall be given by that amendment will be unalterable but by the same authority i have therefore sent some queries to mr clark of new orleans to be answered by such person as he shall think best qualified and to be returned to me before the meeting of congress and knowing that you have turned your attention to many of the subjects i enclose you a copy of them and ask the favor of you to give me what information you can in answer to such of them as you shall select as lying within the scope of your information i am encouraged to propose thus to trouble you by a thorough persuasion of your readiness and desire to serve the public cause by whatever shall be in your power and by the belief that you are one of those who will sincerely rejoice at our success in relieving you by peaceable means from a powerful and enterprising neighbor and establishing on a permanent basis the tranquility security and prosperity of that interesting country i tender you my friendly salutations and assurances of great esteem and respect p s july   —since writing the preceding your favor of june  0th has been received the exchange of a peaceable for a warring neighbor at new orleans was undoubtedly ground of just and great disquietude on our part and the necessity of acquiring the country could not be unperceived by any the question which divided our legislature but not the nation was whether we should take it at once and enter single handed into war with the most powerful nation on the earth or place things on the best footing practicable for the present and avail ourselves of the first war in europe which it was clear was at no great distance to obtain the country as the price of our neutrality or as a reprisal for wrongs which we were sure enough to receive the war happened somewhat sooner than was expected but our measures were previously taken and the thing took the best turn for both parties those who were honest in their reasons for preferring immediate war will in their candor rejoice that their opinion was not followed they may indeed still believe it was the best opinion according to the probabilities we however believed otherwise and they i am sure will be glad that we did the letter of yesterday will show you my desire of receiving information from you and i shall be always thankful for it my wish is to have everything compare all together and to do what on the whole i conscientiously think for the best i repeat my satisfaction and esteem a second letter to dunbar on this matter was as follows thomas jefferson sep      0  monticello dunbar monticello sep      0  dear sir —your favor in answer to my queries came to hand a few days ago and i thank you for the matter it contains  the promptness with which it has been furnished just on my departure from this place where i habitually pass the sickly months of aug  sep i have time only to ask information on a particular point it has been affirmed by respectable authority that spain on receiving the east  west florida of the english did not continue that distinction but restored louisiana to its antient boundary the perdido and that the country from the perdido to the iberville has been ever since considered as a part of louisiana  governed by the governor of louisiana residing at new orleans while the country from the perdido eastwardly to the atlantic has been called as antiently by the simple name of florida  governed by the governor of florida residing at staugustine the terms of the treaty render this fact very interesting if true inasmuch as it fills up the measure of reasoning which fixes the extent of the cession eastwardly to the perdido i write the present to ask of you to ascertain this fact  to give the information as quickly as possible as it may yet be received in time to determine our proceedings accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect   endorsed answer written but not sent on the subject of this letter jefferson wrote to gallatin thomas jefferson july      0  monticello gallatin monticello july      0  dear sir —we agreed that the address of the ward committees ought not to be formally answered but on further reflection i think it would be better to write a private letter to one of the members in order that he may understand the true grounds on which the subject rests and may state them informally to his colleagues i think these grounds so solid that they cannot fail to remove this cause of division among our friends and perhaps to cure the incipient schism of the signers of the address i know only duane and scott sufficiently to address such a letter to them and of these i am much more acquainted with the first than the last and think him on that ground more entitled to this mark of confidence some apprehensions may perhaps be entertained that if the schism goes on he may be in a different section from us if there be no danger in this he is the one i should prefer give me your opinion on it if you please and consider and make any alterations in the letter you think best and return it to me as soon as you can i am strongly of opinion it will do good accept my affectionate salutations and assurances of respect probably in connection with this intended explanation of his course in reference to office holding jefferson drew up the following table of removals and appointments    a draft of this message was submitted to madison who on oct  st returned the following notes to the president 0 for before is suggested without the former seeming to imply that after the suspension an assignt had been made   after or for friendly insert proper omit without difficulty or delay there was perhaps somewhat of both and it may become expedient to say so to spain   the enlightened mind of the first consul of france saw in its true point of view the importance of an arrangement on this subject which might contribute most towards perpetuating the peace and friendship and promoting the interest of both nations and the property and sovereignty of all louisiana as it had been ceded to france by spain was conveyed to the u states by instruments bearing date on the  0th day of april last these stipulations instruments will be immediately laid before the senate and if sanctioned by its concurrence will without delay be communicated to the house of reps for the exercise of its constitutional functions thereon such a modification of the paragraph is meant to avoid the implication that the transfer made by france was covered by the terms territory adjacent to ours which describe our proposition it will also avoid what the theory of our constitution does not seem to have met the influence of deliberations and anticipations of the h of reps on a treaty depending in the senate it is not conceived that the course here suggested can produce much delay since the tenor of the treaty being sufficiently known the mind of the house can be preparing itself for the requisite provisions delay would be more likely to arise from the novelty and doubtfulness of a communication in the first instance of a treaty negotiated by the executive to both houses for their respective deliberations   after assure are proposed in due season and under prudent arrangements important aids to our treasury as well as an ample c query if the two or three succeeding ps be not more adapted to the separate and subsequent communication if adopted as above suggested   for the first sentence may be substituted in the territory between the mississippi and the ohio another valuable acquisition has been made by a treaty c as it stands it does not sufficiently distinguish the nature of the one acquisition from that of the other and seems to imply that the acquisition from france was wholly on the other side of the mississippi may it not be as well to omit the detail of the stipulated considerations and particularly that of the roman catholic pastor the jealousy of some may see in it a principle not according with the exemption of religion from civil power in the indian treaty it will be less noticed than in a presidents message tho not so indispensable since the acquisition of the other bank conveys an idea that an immediate settlement of the other bank is in view and may thence strengthen objections in certain quarters to the treaty with france with a tacit allusion to profit is yet well may be struck out and may be the more worthy inserted the last sentence in this p may be omitted if the reason applied to a former one be thought good   must also be expected better perhaps are also to be apprehended for both all or the belligerent c holland already makes more than two after cover of our flag substitute for vessels not entitled to infecting thereby with suspicion the property of the real american and committing us to the risk of war to redress wrongs not our own instead of to expect from every nation which does not follow well the antecedent endeavor may be inserted to exact to draw this member of the sentence may indeed be dispensed with being comprehended in the ensuing member viz maintain the character of an independent one c maintain being repeated several times within a small compass pursue this course may be preferable   for this conclusion is offered for consideration the following for the possibility of failure in these reasonable expectations it will rest with the wisdom of congress to consider how far and in what form provision may be properly made for suspensions of intercourse when it cannot be maintained on principles of justice and selfrespect or and therewith prevented the necessity of remedial provisions on the part of the u states   for unconcerned in—and from on oct  d the president wrote to gallatin th jefferson asks the favor of mr gallatin to examine with rigor the enclosed project of the message to congress and to note on a separate paper the alterations he thinks advantageous as it is to go through the hands of the other gentlemen of the cabinet his immediate attention to it is desirable he also asks the favor of mr gallatin to meet the heads of department here tomorrow at ten oclock he further wrote him on oct   th will you be so good as to enable me this morning to fill up the blank in the following passage of the message an account of the receipts  expenditures of the year ending the  0th of sep last with the estimates for the ensuing year will be laid before you by the secy of the treasy so soon as the receipts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more distant states it is already ascertained that the amount paid into the treasury for that year will exceed  that the revenue accrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on as sufficient for our current expenses and to extinguish the public debt within the period heretofore proposed   on the subject of louisiana jefferson further wrote to gallatin thomas jefferson nov     0  gallatin nov     0  the memoranda you inclosed me from mr clarke deserve great attention such articles of them as depend on the executive shall be arranged for the next post the following articles belong to the legislature the administration of justice to be prompt perhaps the judges should be obliged to hold their courts weekly at least for some time to come the ships of resident owners to be naturalized and in general the laws of the u s respecting navigation importation exportation c to be extended to the ports of the ceded territory the hospital to be provided for slaves not to be imported except from such of the u s as prohibit importation without looking at the old territorial ordinance i had imagined it best to found a government for the territory or territories of lower louisiana on that basis but on examining it i find it will not do at all that it would turn all their laws topsy turvy still i believe it best to appoint a governor  three judges with legislative powers only providing that the judges shall form the laws  the governor have a negative only subject further to the negative of a national legislature the existing laws of the country being now in force the new legislature will of course introduce the trial by jury in criminal cases first the habeas corpus the freedom of the press freedom of religion c as soon as can be and in general draw their laws and organization to the mould of ours by degrees as they find practicable without exciting too much discontent in proportion as we find the people there riper for receiving these first principles of freedom congress may from session to session confirm their enjoyment of them as you have so many more opportunities than i have of free confidence with individual members perhaps you may be able to give them these hints to make what use of them they please affectionate salutations p s my idea that upper louisiana should be continued under its present form of government only making it subordinate to the national government and independent of lower louisiana no other government can protect it from intruders   endorsed in jeffersons hand this rough paper contains what was agreed upon   november   it is now said that it did not take place on the  d but will this day—t j   jefferson had already written to joseph scott thomas jefferson mar   0  washington joseph scott washington mar   0  sir —i have duly received your favor of the  th inst and i hasten to assure you that neither doctr leib nor mr duane have ever given the least hint to me that yourself or your associates of the st patricks society meditated joining a third party or schismatizing in any way from the great body of republicans that the rudiments of such a  d party were formed in pennsylvania  new york has been said in the newspapers but not proved altho i shall learn it with concern whenever it does happen and think it possibly may happen that we shall divide among ourselves whenever federalism is compleatly eradicated yet i think it the duty of every republican to make great sacrifices of opinion to put off the evil day and that yourself and associates have as much disposition to do this as any portion of our body i have never seen reason to doubt recommending therefore sincerely a mutual indulgence and candor among brethren and that we be content to obtain the best measures we can get if we cannot get all we would wish i tender you my salutations and respects   this letter as it shows was written in reply to one of condolence upon the death of jeffersons daughter mrs eppes in answer to the writers reference to adams midnight appointments mrs adams replied with a tu quoque by mentioning jeffersons patronage of callender this called forth the following letter from jefferson thomas jefferson july    0  washington mrs adams washington july    0  dear madam —your favor of the  st inst was duly received and i would not have again intruded on you but to rectify certain facts which seem not to have been presented to you under their true aspect my charities to callender are considered as rewards for his calumnies as early i think as      i was told in philadelphia that callender the author of the political progress of britain was in that city a fugitive from persecution for having written that book and in distress i had read and approved the book i considered him as a man of genius unjustly persecuted i knew nothing of his private character and immediately expressed my readiness to contribute to his relief  to serve him it was a considerable time after that on application from a person who thought of him as i did i contributed to his relief and afterwards repeated the contribution himself i did not see till long after nor ever more than two or three times when he first began to write he told some useful truths in his coarse way but nobody sooner disapproved of his writing than i did or wished more that he would be silent my charities to him were no more meant as encouragements to his scurrilities than those i give to the beggar at my door are meant as rewards for the vices of his life  to make them chargeable to myself in truth they would have been greater to him had he never written a word after the work for which he fled from britain with respect to the calumnies and falsehoods which writers and printers at large published against mr adams i was as far from stooping to any concern or approbation of them as mr adams was respecting those of porcupine fenno or russell who published volumes against me for every sentence vended by their opponents against mr adams but i never supposed mr adams had any participation in the atrocities of these editors or their writers i knew myself incapable of that base warfare  believed him to be so on the contrary whatever i may have thought of the acts of the administration of that day i have ever borne testimony to mr adams personal worth nor was it ever impeached in my presence without a just vindication of it on my part i never supposed that any person who knew either of us could believe that either of us meddled in that dirty work but another fact is that i liberated a wretch who was suffering for a libel against mr adams i do not know who was the particular wretch alluded to but i discharged every person under punishment or prosecution under the sedition law because i considered  now consider that law to be a nullity as absolute and as palpable as if congress had ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image and that it was as much my duty to arrest its execution in every stage as it would have been to have rescued from the fiery furnace those who should have been cast into it for refusing to worship their image it was accordingly done in every instance without asking what the offenders had done or against whom they had offended but whether the pains they were suffering were inflicted under the pretended sedition law it was certainly possible that my motives for contributing to the relief of callender and liberating sufferers under the sedition law might have been to protect encourage and reward slander but they may also have been those which inspire ordinary charities to objects of distress meritorious or not or the obligations of an oath to protect the constitution violated by an unauthorized act of congress which of these were my motives must be decided by a regard to the general tenor of my life on this i am not afraid to appeal to the nation at large to posterity and still less to that being who sees himself our motives who will judge us from his own knolege of them and not on the testimony of porcupine or fenno you observe there has been one other act of my administration personally unkind and suppose it will readily suggest itself to me i declare on my honor madam i have not the least conception what act is alluded to i never did a single one with an unkind intention my sole object in this letter being to place before your attention that the acts imputed to me are either such as are falsely imputed or as might flow from good as well as bad motives i shall make no other addition than the assurance of my continued wishes for the health and happiness of yourself and mr adams once again mrs adams answered and to this jefferson replied thomas jefferson sep    0  monticello mrs adams monticello sep    0  your letter madam of the   th of aug has been some days received but a press of business has prevented the acknolegment of it perhaps indeed i may have already trespassed too far on your attention with those who wish to think amiss of me i have learned to be perfectly indifferent but where i know a mind to be ingenuous  to need only truth to set it to rights i cannot be as passive the act of personal unkindness alluded to in your former letter is said in your last to have been the removal of your eldest son from some office to which the judges had appointed him i conclude then he must have been a commissioner of bankruptcy but i declare to you on my honor that this is the first knolege i have ever had that he was so it may be thought perhaps that i ought to have inquired who were such before i appointed others but it is to be observed that the former law permitted the judges to name commissioners occasionally only for every case as it arose  not to make them permanent officers nobody therefore being in office there could be no removal the judges you well know have been considered as highly federal and it was noted that they confined their nominations exclusively to federalists the legislature dissatisfied with this transferred the nomination to the president and made the officers permanent the very object in passing the law was that he should correct not confirm what was deemed the partiality of the judges i thought it therefore proper to inquire not whom they had employed but whom i ought to appoint to fulfil the intentions of the law in making these appointments i put in a proportion of federalists equal i believe to the proportion they bear in numbers through the union generally had i known that your son had acted it would have been a real pleasure to me to have preferred him to some who were named in boston in what was deemed the same line of politics to this i should have been led by my knolege of his integrity as well as my sincere dispositions towards yourself  mr adams you seem to think it devolved on the judges to decide on the validity of the sedition law but nothing in the constitution has given them a right to decide for the executive more than to the executive to decide for them both magistracies are equally independent in the sphere of action assigned to them the judges believing the law constitutional had a right to pass a sentence of fine and imprisonment because that power was placed in their hands by the constitution but the executive believing the law to be unconstitutional was bound to remit the execution of it because that power has been confided to him by the constitution that instrument meant that its coordinate branches should be checks on each other but the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the legislature  executive also in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch nor does the opinion of the unconstitutionality  consequent nullity of that law remove all restraint from the overwhelming torrent of slander which is confounding all vice and virtue all truth  falsehood in the u s the power to do that is fully possessed by the several state legislatures it was reserved to them  was denied to the general government by the constitution according to our construction of it while we deny that congress have a right to control the freedom of the press we have ever asserted the right of the states and their exclusive right to do so they have accordingly all of them made provisions for punishing slander which those who have time and inclination resort to for the vindication of their characters in general the state laws appear to have made the presses responsible for slander as far as is consistent with its useful freedom in those states where they do not admit even the truth of allegations to protect the printer they have gone too far the candor manifested in your letter  which i ever believed you to possess has alone inspired the desire of calling your attention once more to those circumstances of fact and motive by which i claim to be judged i hope you will see these intrusions on your time to be what they really are proofs of my great respect for you i tolerate with the utmost latitude the right of others to differ from me in opinion without imputing to them criminality i know too well the weakness  uncertainty of human reason to wonder at its different results both of our political parties at least the honest portion of them agree conscientiously in the same object—the public good but they differ essentially in what they deem the means of promoting that good one side believes it best done by one composition of the governing powers the other by a different one one fears most the ignorance of the people the other the selfishness of rulers independent of them which is right time and experience will prove we think that one side of this experiment has been long enough tried and proved not to promote the good of the many  that the other has not been fairly and sufficiently tried our opponents think the reverse with whichever opinion the body of the nation concurs that must prevail my anxieties on the subject will never carry me beyond the use of fair  honorable means of truth and reason nor have they ever lessened my esteem for moral worth nor alienated my affections from a single friend who did not first withdraw himself whenever this has happened i confess i have not been insensible to it yet have ever kept myself open to a return of their justice i conclude with sincere prayers for your health  happiness that yourself  mr adams may long enjoy the tranquillity you desire and merit and see in the prosperity of your family what is the consummation of the last and warmest of human wishes   on the following day jefferson wrote to madison in conversation with mr gallatin yesterday as to what might be deemed the result of our tuesdays conferences he seemed to have understood the former opinion as not changed to wit that for the floridas east of the perdido might be given not only the   millions of dollars and a margin to remain unsettled but an absolute relinquishment from the north river to the bay of st bernard and colorado river this however i think should be the last part of the price yielded and only for an entire cession of the floridas not for a part only   relative to this message gallatin wrote to jefferson on oct      0  gallatin thomas jefferson dear sir —i return your message with such remarks as occurred it was not received till saturday which must be my apology for not returning it sooner the register being absent i have been obliged to go myself through all the minutiæ of calculations instead of only marking the outlines and revising the work the complete materials for your financial paragraph will not for that reason be completed till tomorrow in the meanwhile the following sketch is correct except for the amount of principal public debt redeemed which is not yet ascertained balance in treasury  0th septr   0      0      receipts during the year vizt impost  0    0     lands repayments arrears taxes  excise c     0  0         0               expended during the year vizt   current expenses civil  military foreign  domestic     0      instalment to great britain    000  payments for intr  principal pub debt a                      balance in treasury  0th septr   0                          a of which payments about   00000 for principal gallatins remarks on the message were as follows irregularities in american seas  in our harbours as it is wished that congress would make provision on two points immediately connected with the captures near s domingo and with the aggressions at new york by restraining the arming of our vessels and by enabling the executive to enforce the jurisdiction of the u states in our ports against foreign vessels and as the expression of that wish would evince the disposition of the executive equally to restrain the irregularities of our own people and to repel the insulting aggressions of the belligerent powers on our coast would there be any objection to introduce at the end of this paragraph a recommendation to that effect spanish objections to the ratification of the convention   the public mind is altogether unprepared for a declaration that the terms  object of the mobile act had been misunderstood by spain for every writer without a single exception who has written on the subject seems to have understood the act as spain did it has been justified by our friends on that ground and the declaration in the message without some short explanation may be distorted into an avowal of some humiliating concession to spain by the executive might not to obviate this some words be introduced where speaking of the misconceptions of spain which would state that spain had erroneously supposed that it was intended to organize a custom house within territories still in her possession and claimed by her before possession had been obtained by ourselves   this may lead to say something of the yet unascertained boundaries of louisiana a subject of sufficient importance to excite animadversion if it was altogether omitted in the message especially as the ensuing paragraph announces in an unqualified manner the acquiescence of spain in the validity of our title to louisiana perhaps the ensuing paragraph might be transposed so as to precede that entitled spanish differences qualifying it by adding that spain however does not yet acknowledge our title to the full extent of our rightful claim and then the subject of the misconception of the mobile act would follow of course  the intention of the executive not to abandon the claim in any degree but to abstain from exercising jurisdiction or taking forcible possession till all other means were exhausted be fully understood   the total omission of the other impediment to the ratification of the convention vizt what relates to the  th article appears perfectly proper as it relates to spain itself inasmuch as it avoids commitment on our part and leaves them free without wounding their pride to receive  ratify whilst they may understand the tunis paragraph as perfectly applicable to themselves but that omission as it relates to congress may be animadverted as a concealment from that body of an important part of the whole ground perhaps without expressly mentioning the whole article some general expressions might be introduced at the same time alluding to other objections of spain and stating the expectation that the explanation on the mobile act would also remove them delivery of stock the words discharge of our obligations seem too strong  general as they might be construed to imply a discharge of our obligation to pay the obligation from which we are discharged is that of delivering the stock within three months after the ratification of the convention as had been provided by that instrument a provision which embarrassed us at the time on account of the proposed bien entendu which pichon wanted to insert in the exchange of ratification  on account of the delays in taking possession of new orleans which delayed the delivery of the stock till the last week of the three months the legal delivery of the stock consisted in delivering it to lieut leonard whose receipt together with a letter from mr pichon acknowledging that act to be a full execution of the convention are filed in the registers office as the evidence of the delivery and that letter of pichon is the only discharge which we have received at the treasury from the government of france mr livingston says however that he has sent to the department of state receipts for the delivery of the stock in france these i have not seen and as we consider the transaction so far as there was any obligation on our part closed by the delivery here i have never applied for them indeed i believe that they are merely personal  so far as they come from the french government must be a receipt not for the stock but for the bills of hope  baring which had been deposited with him  which he delivered to the french government the whole transaction is so complex that i think the best way will be generally to say that the stock was timely delivered in conformity to the provisions of the convention without giving copies of the documents which are numerous lengthy and uninteresting add to this that it is not convenient unless necessary to bring into view the contract of baring  hope with the french govt for the louisiana stock as they gave but    in the pound for it which may excite animadversions on the state of our credit  on the conduct of the negotiators of the treaty barbary powers quere whether the late accounts from the mediterranean fully justify the expectations arising from the energy of all the officers upper louisiana i do not understand what is meant by the appointment of commandants in the forms of the constitution the expressions in the   th sect of the act of   th march   0  are except the commanding officer who shall be appointed by the president the same words precisely are used in the  d   d sect of the act to provide for the erecting and repairing of arsenals and magazines and for other purposes past april  d      in relation to the appointment of superintendant  master armorer of the armories and of superintendant of military stores and in these cases the power to appoint has uniformly been considered  exercised as vested in the president alone from which i infer that the authority to appoint commandants in upper louisiana is also vested in the president alone but if it was not it is perhaps as well not to allude to the principle because there have been some instances of newly created offices which the president has from the necessity of the case filled during the recess of the senate though no special authority had been given to that effect i remember the first collectors of bristol r i  michillimakinac being appointed in that way in   0  gunboats the object of these vessels as a substitute to fortification agt naval enterprise and for supporting the authority of the laws within harbours is correctly defined nor provided that the expenditure shall be kept within due bounds is there any plausible objection except that after providing such as are wanted for the last mentioned purpose those which are wanted for the first may in the case of war be so speedily built that it is not necessary to provide for them beforehand as the expense of keeping them in repair  of the men to watch them will cost more in two years than the mere building expense this however may be provided for hereafter and i would only wish to have a true estimate of the expense of building  keeping either in actual service or ordinary and to know the number intended to be built  to be kept in service but so far as relates to the message i much fear that the efforts made in federal papers to impress the idea that this establisht is intended as a substitute to the navy have so far succeeded that some distortion of the presidents recommendation will take place repairs to our frigates this must certainly be done but it seems questionable whether it should make part of the message it is true that it ought to be considered as an evidence of the attention paid by the president to the navy but so much has been said on the subject of the ships rotting in the eastern branch as if the waters of that creek had a peculiarly corrosive quality that not only the federalists but also the inhabts of other seaports will eagerly seize the opportunity to disseminate the opinion that their predictions are fulfilled if the message shall be silent on that head nothing more will be necessary than for the secy of the navy to include the item for that object in the annual estimates and it will probably be voted without any observations should it however provoke an inquiry the secy of the navy may then make a special report which may be framed so as to meet or anticipate objections and cavils acceptance of volunteers is this really wanted and may it not always be timely provided for by congress whenever an emergency shall require it the application for a general provision is liable to objections of an intrinsic nature and will be artfully compounded with the system of volunteer corps under mr adams administration in      additional remarks it does not seem that the french aggressions in n york if they exist should be embraced in the same sentence with the british even if the reports be true their conduct has been generally unexceptionable there and a single departure cannot be compared with the unremitted insults  blockade by the british with the nations of europe in general our friendship is undisturbed does not this embrace spain  is it not therefore too general from the other powers on the same coast barbary we have every mark of the continuance of their friendship c do not the last accounts from morocco contradict this report territory of orleans is it not to be apprehended that the persons appointed members of the council or a majority will refuse to serve indians of louisiana said to be friendly so far as we have yet learned have not some murders been committed at st louis endorsed received oct    0    the following is the bill alluded to an act for the more

notes of a draft for a second inaugural address the former one was an exposition of the principles on which i thought it my duty to administer the government the second then should naturally be a conte rendu or a statement of facts shewing that i have conformed to those principles the former was promise this is performance yet the nature of the occasion requires that details should be avoided that the most prominent heads only should be selected and these placed in a strong light but in as few words as possible these heads are foreign affairs domestic do viz taxes debts louisiana religion indians the press none of these heads need any commentary but that of the indians this is a proper topic not only to promote the work of humanizing our citizens towards these people but to conciliate to us the good opinion of europe on the subject of the indians this however might have been done in half the compass it here occupies but every respector of science every friend to political reformation must have observed with indignation the hue  cry raised against philosophy  the rights of man and it really seems as if they would be overborne  barbarism biogtry  despotism would recover the ground they have lost by the advance of the public understanding i have thought the occasion justified some discountenance of these antisocial doctrines some testimony against them but not to commit myself in direct warfare on them i have thought it best to say what is directly applied to the indians only but admits by inference a more general extension there are also two papers as follows

aug    0  monticello leib monticello aug    0  dear sir —a journey southwardly from hence has prevented my sooner acknoleging the receipt of your favor of july    i see with extreme concern the acrimonious dissensions into which our friends in pennsylvania have fallen but have long since made up my mind on the propriety of the general governments taking no side in state quarrels and with respect to myself particularly after eight  thirty years of uniform action in harmony with those now constituting the republican party without one single instant of alienation from them it cannot be but my most earnest desire to carry into retirement with me their undivided approbation  esteem i retain therefore a cordial friendship for both the sections now so unhappily dividing your state you mention that doctr logan had informed the person that he had just received a letter from you exhorting him to use all his influence to procure the reelection of govr mckean for that to displace him would be extremely injurious to the republican cause whatever may be the personal esteem i entertain for govr mckean and the harmony with which we acted when members of the same body i never conceived that that would justify my taking sides against mr snyder or endeavouring in any way to influence the free choice of the state i therefore have never written any such letter nor a letter of such import to any mortal and further my long  intimate acquaintance with doctr logan  my knolege of his strict honor leaves the fullest conviction in my mind that there has been some mistake in the hearing understanding or quoting his words i the more readily believe that there has been error somewhere when i consider how far opposite passions have the power of tingeing objects seen by men equally honest of presenting them under aspects totally different and of perverting their understandings of the same expressions my confidence in doctr logans truth is so entire that i dare affirm that he will declare to anyone that he never received such a letter from me no sir so far from taking a side in this distressing quarrel that i look upon both with undiminished affection  would do anything in my power to assuage  reconcile them finally my dear sir when you recollect the bitter hostility of the common enemy towards me the unrelenting perseverance with which they torture mutilate  pervert every sentence which falls from my pen you will excuse me in beseeching that nothing of this letter may get into the public prints accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem

tons of powder and some made ammunition at magazine some small proportion of the linens cloths c in the public store some quartermasters stores the principal articles was one hundred and twenty sides of leather some of the tools in the artificers shops foundry magazine four artificers shops public store quartermasters store one artificers shop three wagons the legislature was sitting when the entrance of the enemy into james river was made known they were informed without reserve of the measures adopted every suggestion from the members was welcomed and weighed and their adjournment on the second of january furnished the most immediate and confidential means of calling for the militia of their several counties they accordingly became the bearers of those calls and they were witnesses themselves that every preparation was making which the exhausted and harassed state of the country admitted they met again at richmond in may and adjourned to charlottesville where they made a house on the   th my office of governor expired on the  d of june being the fifth day of the session and no successor had been appointed when an enterprise on the  th by tarletons cavalry drove them thence and they met again at staunton on the  th some members attended there who had not been at richmond at the time of arnolds enterprise one of these george nicholas a very honest and able man then however young and ardent supposing there had been some remissness in the measures of the executive on that occasion moved for an inquiry into them to be made at the succeeding session the members who had been present and privy to the transactions courted the inquiry on behalf of the executive mr nicholas as a candid and honorable man sent me through a friend a copy of the topics of inquiry he proposed to go into and i communicated to him with the same frankness the justifications i should offer that he might be prepared to refute them if not founded in fact the following is a copy of both—  st objection that general washingtons information was that an embarcation was taking place destined for this state answer his information was that it was destined for the southward as was given out at new york had similar information from general washington and congress been considered as sufficient ground at all times for calling the militia into the field there would have been a standing army of militia kept up because there has never been a time since the invasion expected in december      but what we have had those intimations hanging over our heads the truth is that general washington always considered as his duty to convey every rumor of an embarkation but we for some time past at least never thought anything but actual invasion should induce us to the expense and harrassment of calling the militia into the field except in the case of december      when it was thought proper to do this in order to convince the french of our disposition to protect their ships inattention to this necessary economy in the beginning went far towards that ruin of our finances which followed  d objection where were the postriders established last summer answer they were established at continental expense to convey speedy information to congress of the arrival of the french fleet then expected here when that arrived at rhode island these expenses were discontinued they were again established on the invasion in october and discontinued when that ceased and again on the first intimation of the invasion of december but it will be asked why were they not established on general washingtons letters because those letters were no more than we had received upon many former occasions and would have led to a perpetual establishment of postriders  d objection if a proper number of men had been put into motion on monday for the relief of the lower country and ordered to march to williamsburg that they would at least have been in the neighborhood of richmond on thursday answer the order could not be till tuesday because we then received our first certain information half the militia of the counties round about richmond were then ordered out and the whole of them on the  th and ordered not to wait to come in a body but in detachments as they could assemble yet they were not on friday more than two hundred collected and they were principally of the town of richmond  th objection that we had not the signals answer this though a favorite plan of some gentlemen and perhaps a practicable one has hitherto been thought too difficult  th objection that we had not lookouts answer there had been no cause to order lookouts more than has been ever existing this is only in fact asking why we do not always keep lookouts  th objection that we had not heavy artillery on travelling carriages answer the gentlemen who acted as members of the board of war a twelvemonth can answer this question by giving the character of the artificers whom during that time they could never get to mount the heavy artillery the same reason prevented their being mounted from may    0 to december we have even been unable to get these heavy cannon moved from cumberland by the whole energy of government a like difficulty which occurred in the removal of those at south quay in their day will convince them of the possibility of this  th objection that there was not a body of militia thrown into portsmouth the great bridge suffolk answer in the summer of    0 we asked the favor of general nelson to call together the county lieutenants of the lower counties and concert the general measures which should be taken for instant opposition on any invasion until aid could be ordered by the executive and the county lieutenants were ordered to obey his call he did so the first moment to wit on saturday december the   st at   oclock a m of our receiving information of the appearance of a fleet in the bay we asked the favor of general nelson to go down which he did with full powers to call together the militia of any counties he thought proper to call on the keepers of any public arms or stores and to adopt for the instant such measures as exigencies required till we could be better informed query why were not general nelson and the brave officers with him particularly mentioned answer what should have been said of them the enemy did not land nor give them an opprotunity of doing what nobody doubts they would have done that is something worthy of being minutely recited query why publish arnolds letter without general nelsons answer answer ask the printer he got neither from the executive objection as to the calling out a few militia and that late answer it is denied that they were few or late forty thousand and seven hundred men the number required by baron steuben were called out the moment an invasion was known to have taken place that is on tuesday january  d objections the abandonment of york and portsmouth fortifications answer how can they be kept without regulars on the large scale on which they were formed would it be approved of to harass the militia with garrisoning them to place me on equal grounds for meeting the inquiry one of the representatives of my county resigned his seat and i was unanimously elected in his place mr nicholas however before the day became better satisfied as to what had been done and did not appear to bring forward the inquiry and in a publication several years after he made honorable acknowledgment of the erroneous views he had entertained on those transactions i therefore read in my place the inquiries he had proposed to make and stated the justifications of the executive and nearly every member present having been a witness to their truth and conscious all was done which could have been done concurred at once in the following resolution the following resolution was unanimously agreed to by both houses of the general assembly of virginia december the   th      resolved that the sincere thanks of the general assembly be given to our former governor thomas jefferson esquire for his impartial upright and attentive administration whilst in office the assembly wish in the strongest manner to declare the high opinion they entertained of mr jeffersons ability rectitude and integrity as chief magistrate of this commonwealth and mean by thus publicly avowing their opinion to obviate and to remove all unmerited censure and here it is but proper to notice the parody of these transactions which general lee has given as their history he was in a distant state at the time and seems to have made up a random account from the rumors which were afloat where he then was it is a tissue of errors from beginning to end the nonsense which has been uttered on the coup de main of tarleton on charlottesville is really so ridiculous that it is almost ridiculous seriously to notice it i will briefly however notice facts and dates it has been said before that the legislature was driven from charlottesville by an incursion of the enemys cavalry since the adjournment from richmond their force in this country had been greatly augmented by reinforcements under lord cornwallis and general phillips and they had advanced up into the country as far as elk island and the fork of james river learning that the legislature was in session in charlottesville they detached colonel tarleton with his legion of horse to surprise them as he was passing through louisa on the evening of the  d of june he was observed by a mr gouett who suspecting the object set out immediately for charlottesville and knowing the byways of the neighborhood passed the enemys encampment rode all night and before sunrise of the  th called at monticello with notice of what he had seen and passed on to charlottesville to notify the members of the legislature the speakers of the two houses and some other members were lodging with us i ordered a carriage to be ready to carry off my family we breakfasted at leisure with our guests and after breakfast they had gone to charlottesville when a neighbor rode up full speed to inform me that a troop of horse was then ascending the hill to the house i instantly sent off my family and after a short delay for some pressing arrangements i mounted my horse and knowing that in the public road i should be liable to fall in with the enemy i went through the woods and joined my family at the house of a friend where we dined would it be believed were it not known that this flight from a troop of horse whose whole legion too was within supporting distance has been the subject with party writers of volumes of reproach on me serious or sarcastic that it has been sung in verse and said in humble prose that forgetting the noble example of the hero of la mancha and his windmills i decline a combat against a troop in which victory would have been so glorious forgetting themselves at the same time that i was not provided with the enchanted arms of the knight nor even with his helmet of mambrino these closet heroes forsooth would have disdained the shelter of a wood even singly and unarmed against a legion of armed enemies here too i must note another instance of the want of that correctness in writing history without which it becomes romance general lee says that tarleton in another enterprise some time after penetrated up the south side of james river to new london in bedford county to that neighborhood precisely where i had a possession i had carried my family and was confined there several weeks by the effects of a fall from my horse and i can assure the readers of general lees history that no enemy ever came within forty miles of new london   three days later he wrote to madison thomas jefferson aug     0  monticello madison monticello aug     0  dear sir —on a view of our affairs with spain presented me in a letter from c pinckney i wrote you on the   d of july that i thought that we should offer them the status quo but immediately propose provisional alliance with england i have not yet received the whole correspondence but the portion of the papers now enclosed to you confirm me in the opinion of the expediency of a treaty with england but make the offer of the status quo more doubtful the correspondence will probably throw light on that question from the papers already received i infer a confident reliance on the part of spain on the omnipotence of bonaparte but a desire of procrastination till peace in europe shall leave us without an ally general dearborn has seen all the papers i will ask the favor of you to communicate them to mr gallatin  mr smith from mr gallatin i shall ask his first opinion preparatory to the stating formal questions for our ultimate decision i am in hopes you can make it convenient on your return to see  consult with mr smith  gen dearborn unless the latter should be come on here where i can do it myself on the receipt of your own ideas mr smiths and the other gentlemen i shall be able to form points for our final consideration  determination i enclose you some communications from the mediterranean they shew barrons understanding in a very favorable view when you shall have perused them be so good as to enclose them to the secretary of the navy accept my fervent wishes for the speedy recovery of mrs madison and your speedy visit to this quarter   on october   d jefferson wrote to madison thomas jefferson oct    0  washington madison washington oct    0  dear sir —yours of the  0th came to hand last night i sincerely regret that mrs madison is not likely to be able to come on so soon as had been hoped the probability of an extensive war on the continent of europe strengthening every day for some time past is now almost certain this gives us our great desideratum time in truth it places us quite at our ease we are certain of one year of campaigning at least and one other year of negotiation for their peace arrangements should we be now forced into war it is become much more questionable than it was whether we should not pursue it unembarrassed by any alliance  free to retire from it whenever we can obtain our separate terms it gives us time too to make another effort for peaceable settlement where should this be done not at madrid certainly at paris through armstrong or armstrong  monroe as negotiators france as the mediator the price of the floridas as the means we need not care who gets that and an enlargement of the sum we had thought of may be the bait to france while the guadaloupe as the western boundary may be the soother of spain providing for our spoliated citizens in some effectual way we may announce to france that determined not to ask justice of spain again yet desirous of making one other effort to preserve peace we are willing to see whether her interposition can obtain it on terms which we think just that no delay however can be admitted  that in the meantime should spain attempt to change the status quo we shall repel force by force without undertaking other active hostilities till we see what may be the issue of her interference i hazard my own ideas merely for your consideration the present state of things does not so far press as to render it necessary for you to do violence to your feelings by prematurely leaving mrs madison accept for her  yourself my affectionate salutations p s let mr smith know as you pass thro baltimore  he will come on one day later jefferson wrote to the secretary of the navy thomas jefferson oct    0  washington washington oct    0  dear sir —understanding from mr madison that he would be here by the last of the week i wrote to desire him to give you notice of his passing thro baltimore but by a letter received yesterday it is probable he will have set out before my letter reaches him the almost certainty which now appears of an extensive continental war in europe changes our situation most advantageously inasmuch as it ensures us another years continuance at least of that war consequently we need be in no hurry to make any propositions to england but may proceed at once to make another  last effort to bring spain to a settlement and even if we fail it is now much more questionable than it was whether we had not better enter the war unembarrassed by any alliance that we may withdraw separately as soon as our separate terms can be obtained how  where to open new conferences is the question not in spain certainly nor with spain will it not be better to make a friendly appeal to france letting them understand it is a last effort for peace settle through them a reasonable price for the floridas part money part concession towards the rio bravo but securing from spain the indemnification for spoliations by hypothecation until she pays principal  interest we in the meantime paying our merchants their interest  guaranteeing the principal so that they may sell the debt as stock for present relief i hazard these new thoughts produced by the new circumstances for consideration  consultation as soon as we can meet then also i wish to consult you on a plan of a regular naval militia to be composed of all our seafaring citizens to enable us to man a fleet speedily by supplying voluntary enlistments by calls on that militia affectionate salutations   here the ms reads guadaloupe if to be

respecting england to read as follows new principles too have been interpolated into the law of nations founded neither in justice nor the usage or acknolegement of nations according to these a belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its own enemy which it denies to a neutral on the ground of its aiding that enemy but reason revolts at such an inconsistency and the neutral having equal rights with the belligerent to decide the question the interests of our constituents  the duty of maintaining the authority of reason the only umpire between just nations impose on us the obligation of providing an effectual and determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to peaceable nations will you give me your opinion on the above immediately as i wish to send the paper to mr gallatin should we not lay before congress the act of parl proving the british take the trade to themselves  the order of council proving they deny it to neutrals in madisons hand on the same sheet is written although it is strictly true as here applied that reason is the sole umpire yet as g b abuses the idea in order to get rid of the instituted l of nations and as it may not be amiss to invite the attention of other neutrals suppose there be added after a doctrine as alarming to all peaceable nations as it is illegal against all law in itself or some similar expression this however is merely for consideration the passage as it stands has a good countenance and is made of good stuff madison also drew up some notes indorsed received nov    0  message as follows a after others the insertion of with commissions seems necessary as others refer to the armed vessels not to commissns b instead of under the controul it may be well to insert some such phrase as unreached by any controul in

some such substitute as the following is suggested as painful on one side as immoral on the other d it is suggested whether naming the ages particularly that of    years may not be too specific and

answering that character these will give time for raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall become certain and the reducing to the early period of life all its active service cannot but

conquered in the war of      and confirmed to her in      conquered by the united states and confirmed to them in      and all ancient titles there settled and done with by authority of the united states these claims of renault are certainly at an end   as to those in louisiana i believe it has been a law as well as invariable usage with the spanish government in that country to consider all concessions void which were not settled within one two or three years which condition was often expressed in the grant and understood where not expressed oreillys ordinance is evidence of this policy and practice but independently of positive law prescription is a law of reason if renault ever took possession which does not appear he has abandoned that possession more than sixty or seventy years as appears by austins statement which is that so long ago as      these mines were considered as public property   as to the concessions in      to winter and others exclusive of the fraud and illegality so obvious on their face they bore the express condition of becoming void if not settled in a year however the commissioners of congress i believe are to report titles for the ultimate

resolved that no armed men not being citizens of the united states ought to be permitted to enter or remain nor any authority to be exercised but under the laws of the united states within the former colony or province of louisiana in the extent in which it was in the hands of spain   resolved that as to the residue of the said former colony or province of louisiana in the extent it had when france possessed it a peaceable adjustment of that extent is most reasonable and desirable so far as it can be effected consistently with the honor of the united states   resolved that pending measures for such peaceable adjustment neither party ought to take new posts therein nor to strengthen those they held before the  st day of october   00 and that any proceeding to the contrary on the part of spain ought to be opposed by force and by taking possession of such posts as may be necessary to maintain the rights of the united states   resolved that the subjects of spain still on the mississippi and its waters ought to be allowed an innocent passage free from all imposts along that part of the river which passes through the territory of the united states and the citizens of the united states on the mobile and its waters ought to be allowed an innocent passage free from all imposts along that part of the river below them which passes through the territory still held by spain but claimed by both parties or that imposts should be levied for and by the united states on the navigation of the mississippi by spanish subjects countervailing those which may be levied for and by spain on the navigation of the mobile by citizens of the united states and that the navigation of the mississippi by spanish subjects should be prohibited whensoever that of the mobile by citizens of the united states shall be prohibited   resolved that in support of these resolutions and of the consequences which may proceed from them the citizens of the united states by their senate and representatives in congress assembled do pledge their lives and fortunes and that the execution of these resolutions be vested with the president of the united states   resolved that for carrying these resolutions into effect whether amicably or by the use of force the president be authorized to apply any moneys in the treasury of the united states not otherwise appropriated   resolved that the president of the united states ought to be authorized by law to employ the armed vessels of the united states which may be in commission for restraining the irregularities and oppressions of our commerce other than those which amount to piracy by privateers cruising within the gulf stream in the gulf itself or among the islands bordering on it and that a bill be brought in for that purpose after consideration he sent a revision to gallatin with the following letter thomas jefferson december     0  mr gallatin december     0  th j to mr gallatin enclosed is a revised edition of the spanish resolutions in which you will find most of your ideas conformed to that respecting money is omitted that it may be provided in the way you suggest in the message also i have adopted all your amendments except the last which respected merely the arrangement of the phrases and could not be satisfactorily altered the enclosure was   resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the united states that the indemnities for which spain is answerable to citizens of the united states for spoliations and wrongs committed in violation of the law of nations or of treaty are objects too just and important not to be pursued to effect by the united states   resolved that no armed men subjects of any foreign power ought to be permitted to enter or remain nor any authority but of the united states to be exercised within the former colony or province of louisiana in the extent in which it was delivered by spain under the treaty of st ildefonso   resolved that as to the residue of the said former colony or province of louisiana and provisions necessary to avoid future collisions and controversies an equitable adjustment is most reasonable   resolved that pending any measures for such adjustment neither party ought to take new posts therein nor to strengthen those they held before the  st day of october   00 and that any proceeding to the contrary on the part of spain ought to be opposed by force and by taking possession of such posts as may be necessary to maintain the rights of the united states   resolved c that the subjects of spain still on the mississippi and its waters ought to be allowed an innocent passage free from all imposts along that part of the river below them which passes through the territory of the united states and the citizens of the united states on the mobile and its waters ought to be allowed an innocent passage free from all imposts along that part of the river below them which passes through the territory still held by spain but claimed by both parties   resolved that a copy of these resolutions be presented to the president of the united states for his approbation with an assurance that he will receive from the legislature the support necessary for carrying them into execution still later on this matter he wrote to gallatin thomas jefferson december     0  gallatin saturday december     0  j randolph has just called to

november     0  mr gallatin november     0  th j to mr gallatin i wish for an à peu près of the number of seamen we call ours i suppose the best way of estimating will be by our tonnage including coasters bay and river craft and everything employed on the tidewaters can you assist me with the materials for such an estimate it is of some importance for my bill for a naval militia that and the one for the land militia i will send you for consideration as soon as you can assist me as above these notes of jefferson seem to be the basis of the bills november   0  the best ground for estimating the number of seamen of the united states to be enrolled under the act for establishing a naval militia is the tonnage of our vessels the latest return of tonnage states it to have been on the   st of

from these are to be deducted the naval militiamen but far the greater part of those employed in the foreign trade and whalefisheries being always absent it is believed that not half of them were

furnishes good cause for your not acceding to my proposition of a special mission to europe my only hope had been that they could have gone on one summer without you an unjust hostility against genl armstrong will i am afraid shew itself whenever any treaty made by him shall be offered for ratification i wished therefore to provide against this by joining a person who would have united the confidence of the whole senate genl smith was so prominent in the opposition to armstrong that it would be impossible for them to act together we conclude therefore to leave the matter with armstrong  bowdoin indeed my dear sir i wish sincerely you were back in the senate  that you would take the necessary measures to get yourself there perhaps as a preliminary you should go to our legislature giles absence has been a most serious misfortune a majority of the senate means well but tracy  bayard are too dexterous for them  have very much influenced their proceedings tracy has been of nearly every committee during the session  for the most part the chairman  of course drawer of the reports   federalists voting always in phalanx and joined by some discontented republicans some oblique ones some capricious have so often made a majority as to produce very serious embarrassment to the public operations and very much do i dread the submitting to them at the next session any treaty which can be made with either england or spain when i consider that   joining the federalists can defeat a friendly settlement of our affairs the h of r is as well disposed as i ever saw one the defection of so prominent a leader threw them into dismay  confusion for a moment but they soon rallied to their own principles  let him go off with   or   followers only one half of these are from virginia his late declaration of perpetual opposition to this administration drew off a few others who at first had joined him supposing his opposition occasional only  not systematic the alarm the house has had from this schism has produced a rallying together  a harmony which carelessness  security had begun to endanger on the whole this little trial of the firmness of our representatives in their principles  that of the people also which is declaring itself in support of their public functionaries has added much to my confidence in the stability of our government and to my conviction that should things go wrong at any time the people will set them to rights by the peaceable exercise of their elective rights to explain to you the character of this schism its objects and combinations can only be done in conversation  must be deferred till i see you at monticello where i shall probably be about the  0th or   th of may to pass the rest of the month there congress has agreed to rise on monday the   st

the eloquent circular and address to your patriotic and fair companions in good works i well recollect our acquaintance with yourself personally in washington valued for your own merit as well as for that of your esteemed father your connection too with the family of the late colo morgan is an additional title to my grateful recollections he first gave us notice of the mad project of that day which if suffered to proceed might have brought afflicting consequences on persons whose subsequent lives have proved their integrity and loyalty to their country the effort which is the subject of your letter is truly laudable and if generally followed as an example or practised as a duty will change very advantageously the condition of our fellow citizens  do just honor to those who shall have taken the lead in it no one has been more sensible than myself of the advantages of placing the consumer by the side of the producer nor more disposed to promote it by example but these are among the matters which i must now leave to them time which wears all things does not spare the energies either of body or mind of a presque octogenaire while i could i did what i could and now acquiesce cheerfully in the law of nature which by unfitting us for action warns us to retire and leave to the generation of the day the direction of its own affairs the prayers of an old man are the only

subjects of your letter and should you be able to obtain any further information respecting them or their measures besides fulfilling the duties of a patriotic citizen you will confer an obligation on me by communications from time to time of what you may learn they shall be made no further use of than what you shall prescribe accept my salutations  assurances of respect   on nov      0  jefferson wrote to gallatin   as to the  00 cavalry if we have peace with spain we shall not want them if war all our plans must be new moulded it is therefore only during the present unsettled state this cannot exceed six months from october   about which time they probably went into service this will cost  00000 d the proposing to congress to establish them during the present unsettled state of things is merely to show spain that we seriously mean to take justice if she will not do it the men are in service under a previous law this is the only extra expense i contemplate to meet the present state mr smith proposes to ask only the ordinary annual appropriation   as to the salt tax if that and the mediterranean fund continued to the end of   0  will pay the florida purchase suppose the act of commutation lets the salt tax run to the end of   0 —will not its amount for   0  be made up by the increase of impost and land sales beyond calculation and the sweepings of the treasury or if they still leave a deficit would not the perpetuity of the mediterranean fund enable us to anticipate enough for the deficit   the university this proposition will pass all the states in the winter of   0 –  and congress will not meet and consequently cannot act on it till the winter of   0 –  the florida debt will therefore be paid off before the university can call for anything the only difficulty in the whole then seems to be the amount of the salt tax for   0  which i am in hopes will not be insuperable other papers relating to this message are as follows madisons memoranda indorsed received nov    0  message foreign relations insert since before taken place at the beginning of line    the preceding delay did not altogether proceed from events independent of the will of one of the parties and those who are chargeable with it ought not to be acquitted of the consequences perhaps the following change of the whole sentence would answer the delays which have since taken place in our negotiations with the british govt appear to have proceeded from causes which leave me in expectation that c spain instead of spain has consented c it might be better to say spain has taken steps preparatory to the negotiation at paris in which our ministers are authorized to meet her the term used may seem to imply a proposition from the u s wch was consented to in the penult line of p   for hope of friendly settlement perhaps course of friendly negotiation might be a more suitable expression such a change however cannot be material if proper the last instructions to wilkinson do not assume the sabine as the essential line of separation for the troops they authorize him to settle a provisional line and in no event to pass himself beyond that river it may be well therefore to vary the sentence on that point so as to run in that quarter to maintain a temporary line separating the troops of the two nations  to permit no new settlement or post to be taken eastward of the sabine river would it not be well to allude to a continuance of our friendly standing with france  the other belligerent nations or generally with other nations of europe new orleans instead of to secure that point by all the means in our power—to provide for that point a more adequate security insurrections this paragraph suggests several legal questions such as whether in strictness any preventive measures are consistent with our principles except security for the peace  good behavior whether this remedy is not already applicable to the case in question where a preparation of force justifies a suspicion of criminal intention and whether the existing provision for the case of an enterprise meditated vs a foreign nation is not rather penal agst a crime actually committed by the preparation of means with such an intention than preventive of the actual commission of a crime to guard agst the criticisms which may be founded on these questions some such change as the following is suggested for consideration for those crimes when actually committed the laws make provision would it not moreover be salutary to provide for cases where the means of force are prepared only for a meditated enterprise agst the u s as has been done for cases where the enterprise is meditated by private individuals against a foreign nation it merits consideration also whether the preventive process of binding to the observance of the peace and good behaviour ought not to be expressly extended to acts without the limits of the u s in cases where the acts are contrary to law and there is sufficient ground for suspecting the intention to commit them this change is suggested on the supposition that the occasion requires a paragraph should be addressed to congress manifestly alluding to the late information c perhaps the question may be decided with the advantage of new lights from the westward in time for the message barbary the late mission may be equivocal or obscure with tunis alone some uncertainty remains would perhaps be sufficient missouri the tenor of this paragraph ought to be such as to give as little topic as possible for foreign jealousy or complaint especially as we are not prepared to say that the expedition did not enter limits within which spain has real or plausible claims it is certain that it will be presented to spain as a measure at which she has a right to take offence the paragraph might better parry the inconvenience by being made less particular  by avoiding any allusion to the uses to which the pacific country may be applied red river nearly as far as the french establishments c has the advantage of suggesting a plausible reason for not going on but may it not also imply that those establishments were the limit to our claim mississippi the survey of the mississippi furnished certainly a very apt occasion for bringing into view our legitimate boundaries in the latitude    but as the mere assertion by ourselves will not strengthen our title and may excite british sensations unseasonably it may be doubted whether that much of the paragraph had not as well be omitted university c the denounciation of standing armies navies  fortifications cannot be better expressed if there be no room to apprehend that so emphatic a one may not at the present juncture embolden the presumption in foreign nations that an insuperable aversion to those objects guarantees the infinity of their insults and aggressions arts manufactures  other objects of public improvement seem to give latitude nearly equivalent to general welfare afterwards suggested to be too dangerous to remain a part of the constitution  other objects of public improvement which it may be thought proper to specify would avoid the inconsistency after the present state of our country might be added and with the aid of the sale of public lands would be adequate to roads  canals also instead of sweep away all restraints c—demolish the essential barriers between the general  the state govts conclusion as far as they are capable of defence suggests a disagreeable and impolitic idea preparations for the defence c without that expression will suffice this member of the sentence ought to be separated from the succeeding ones which do not c not being like these without expense till called into actual use it does not seem correct to say that war is forced on us by vain appeals to the justice of other nations in spite of appeals c or some such turn to the expression would obviate the criticism the secretary of war in answer to a letter from the president of nov    wrote h dearborn has looked over  considered the inclosed without observing anything that he can consider as a defect or requiring alteration gallatins notes indorsed received nov    0  message  st page foreign relations could leave no imputation on either our moderation or forbearance the plan determining the spanish differences by the purchase of florida will if successful prove highly advantageous to the united states but is ill relished by spain and in case of failure will not alone afford proofs of moderation or forbearance these must be found in the contingent instructions given to our ministers in case they should fail in the principal object what have these been and do they fully justify the assertion i have not seen them  mention this merely for consideration the ultimatum of our instructions is   satisfaction for spoliations    silence as to limits leaving each party to pursue its own course as to these insert by t j england whether this issue will be such as c must depend on that issue there is some inaccuracy in the construction of that sentence the meaning of which is that the necessity of the repeal or reinforcement c depends on the issue of the negotiations spain has consented to meet us c is the fact positively asserted by mr armstrong mr erving in his last letter denies it  d page and to permit no new settlement or post to be taken within it the last instructions permit as an ultimatum  under certain circumstances the maintenance of the increased force at bayou pierre but the whole of this paragraph will probably require some modification if the intelligence of an arrangement between wilkinson and herrada proves true army might not the words in other respects our or some to that effect be substituted to our regular for it seems to me that the continuance of a corps of cavalry by voluntary enlistment  for the term stated in the preceding paragraph is to all intents an increase of regular force as contradistinguished from militia or volunteers new orleans i would omit the words perhaps the present fort of plaquemine  st in order to avoid unnecessary commitment of opinion  dly because plaquemine is not i believe below all the firm lands observe also that the approaches by lake ponchartrain must be defended as well as those by the mississippi  d page fortifications substitute a for some as this last expression may be construed into an evidence of disregard for that mode of defence and considering the lively interest felt in a certain quarter on that question and the use made of it is it necessary to speak of that object in terms as decisive as those used at the end of page    might not these last be omitted or modified  th page insurrection if the information received is not sufficiently decisive to affix criminality to certain individuals the word are at the end of  th line may be omitted but if the proofs received without being legal evidence are sufficient to impress a conviction that the object was of an internal nature the word should remain where an enterprise is meditated c the following paragraph shews that there are cases in which the powers of prevention given by the laws are not sufficient against enterprises meditated against foreign nations on that account  because it appears important considering the mirandas expedition not to impress too forcibly the opinion that those powers are really sufficient i would suggest not only to substitute another word to meditated but to place the defect of the existing laws in that respect in a more prominent point of view than is done by the following paragraph this may perhaps be affected by making that subject a distinct head instead of mentioning it incidentally and by indicating it in more general terms for pointing out a single particular defect seems to diminish its importance quere whether some more direct allusion to mirandas expedition would not be politick  practicable indians we have nothing to fear from that quarter the assurance seems too positive as danger may arise from causes not under our controul such as the intrigues of spanish agents to the south  of british traders on the northwest  th and  th pages red river mississippi the details seem comparatively too long both in relation to the other parts of the message generally  to the missouri expedition but i would at all events avoid a commitment respecting the northern boundary of either louisiana or the u states the boundary fixed by the treaty of utrecht might be  probably was intended for canada rather than for louisiana and crozats charter expressly limits the last province to the   th degree of latitude as to the u states we have conceded that a parallel westwdly from the lake of the woods was not our necessary boundary and have agreed heretofore to a straight line from that lake to the source of the mississippi  th page salt tax this has never amounted to  00000 dollars  averages about   0000 the mediterranean fund at present  whilst the european war continues is worth almost a million the words not materially different in amount are not therefore correct observe also that    of the salt tax   cents per bushel expire on  d march      we may dispense with the whole of it from the present time or say from   july next provided the medit fund be continued only for   years longer or till   jany   0  if circumstances should then render a further continuation necessary it may then be again extended i would on the whole propose to suppress the words not materially different in amount and that the next line should read by continuing for a limited time the medit fund university they cannot then be applied to the extinguishment c i would wish that between the words then  the the following should be inserted without a modification assented to by the public creditors or that the idea should be inserted in some other way in the paragraph it will be consistent with the opinion expressed that the extinguishment c  liberation c are the most desirable of all objects and congress have now under consideration a plan for the purpose which i submitted last session  was postponed because reported too late by the comee of ways  means on fortifications c this is the paragraph which i think might without injury to the sense be omitted  th page to be partitioned among the states in a federal  just ratio would it not be best to omit these words as neither improvements nor education can ever in practice be exactly partitioned in that manner and the suggestion might embarrass or defeat the amendment when before the house the surplusses indeed which will arise c it may be observed on whatever relates to the connection between those surplusses  the proposed improvements  university  st that war excepted the surplusses will certainly  under any circumstance even while the debt will be in a course of payment be after   january   0 sufficient for any possible improvement i have no doubt that they will amount to at least   millions a year and if no modification in the debt takes place to nearly five  dly that it will take at least the two intervening years to obtain an amendment pass the laws designating improvements and make the arrangements preparatory to any large expense  rdly that the existing surplusses are at this moment sufficient for any university or national institute but the whole of this part of the message rests on the supposition that a longer time must elapse before we are ready for any considerable expenditure for improvements and that we would not be able to meet even that for the university before the time which must elapse in obtaining an amendment the general scope of this part of the message seems also to give a preference to the university over general improvements and it must not be forgotten apart from any consideration of their relative importance that the last proposition may probably be popular  that the other for university will certainly be unpopular i think indeed that the only chance of its adoption arises from the ease with which funds in public lands may be granted it appears to me therefore that the whole of that part from the words above quoted the surplusses indeed c to the words to which our funds may become equal should undergo a revisal introducing in the same place the substance of the last paragraph of the  th page respecting a donation of lands which seems to be misplaced where it now stands if a total revision is not approved the following alterations are suggested erase from the surplusses in   th line to first inclusively in   th line and insert the surplusses are already at this moment adequate to or words to that effect erase from to such in  th line from bottom to the end of the page and insert but whether our views be restrained  th page to the word may in  d line substitute will soon and in  d line between equal  i substitute a comma to a full stop would it not be better to stop when speaking of the amendment at the words to be applied  th line it would avoid a discussion on the words general welfare and it must be observed that if even those words had the greatest extent in the constittn of which they are susceptible vixt that congress had power to raise taxes c for every purpose which they might consider producive of public welfare yet that would not give them the power to open roads canals through the several states the first reason given that the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated c is conclusive and seems sufficient at all events i would suppress the paragraph which suggests an amendment to erase from the constitution those words as questionable in its nature  because the proposition seems to acknowledge that the words are susceptible of a very dangerous meaning thomas jefferson november      0  gallatin gallatin to jefferson november      0  the words ere long and systems of fortifications were omitted by oversight in correcting

merely to protect our citizens from aggression the criminal attempts of private individuals to decide for their country the question of peace or war by commencing active and unauthorized hostilities ought to be promptly and effectually suppressed   in the jefferson papers is the following draft madisons notes indorsed message british rec nov    i have the satisfaction to inform you that the negotiation on foot between the u states  the govt of g b is proceeding in a spirit of friendship  accommodation which promises a result of mutual advantage the delays which have taken place are to be regretted but as they were occasioned by the long illness which ended in the death of the british minister charged with that duty they could not have been foreseen nor taken into calculation and it appears that the commissioners appointed to resume the negotiation have shown every disposition to hasten its progress under these circumstances our special ministers recommend a suspension of the acts prohibiting certain importations the commencement of which was postponed till the   th of last month when it went into operation and assured us that such a mark of candor and confidence in the temper  views with which they have been met in the negotiation will have a happy effect on the course of it whilst a disregard of that friendly consideration may have a different tendency considering that justice  conciliation have been the real objects of all our measures and that whatever will promote them will be most conformable to our wishes  our interests i cannot but join in the recommendation that the operation of the act be suspended for such additional term as may be deemed reasonable it is not known here c   endorsed this was not issued the cambrian having gone off on this proclamation jefferson wrote to madison on dec    i send you the draft of a proclamation dated for tomorrow i think all the letters  orders to the effect already agreed on should be instantaneously got ready and i ask the heads of departments to meet here tomorrow at    oclock to consider what additional measures can be taken for forcing the cambrian off and for preventing her entering any other port of the u s would it not be proper to ask mr erskine to see you immediately to shew him the letter of newton  report of the officer  to let him know the measures we will take tomorrow he may by tonights post reinforce his advice to those officers he had also written to gallatin on dec    i inclose a draught of a proclamation with an amendment proposed by mr madison before i make any alteration i shall be glad of your opinion on the matter i return the two draughts of letters with an alteration or two proposed to me of them for your consideration mr erskine promised to write to commodore douglas yesterday on the subject of the cambrian he says she is reported as having sprung her bowsprit  put in on that account consequently we must let the matter lie till we hear from the collector i have made it a rule not to give up letters of accusation or copies of them in any case it is true that davies would probably care very little about a copy of his letter being sent to briggs yet i should think it sufficient that the heads of accusation have been already furnished to mr briggs affectionate salutations   endorsed by jefferson this letter was left to be finished on the   st but the mail went off at   am which was earlier than i expected so it was not sent it is kept as containing the sum of what was agreed upon at a meeting of heads of departments except mr gallatin who was not present on the   th of dec   0    on feb     0  jefferson wrote wilkinson thomas jefferson wilkinson sir —a returning express gives me an opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your letters of nov    dec               and jan   i wrote to you jan   and through mr briggs jan  0 the former being written while the secretary at war was unable to attend to business gave you the state of the information we then possessed as to burrs conspiracy i now enclose you a message containing a complete history of it from the commencement down to the eve of his departure from nashville  two subsequent messages shewed that he began his descent of the mississippi jany   with  0 boats from  0 to  00 men of his party navigated by  0 oarsmen not at all of his party this i think is fully the force with which he will be able to meet your gunboats and as i think he was uninformed of your proceedings  could not get the information till he would reach natchez i am in hopes that before this date he is in your possession although we at no time believed he could carry any formidable force out of the ohio yet we thought it safest that you should be prepared to receive him with all the force which could be assembled and with that view our orders were given and we were pleased to see that without waiting for them you adopted nearly the same plan yourself and acted on it with promptitude the difference between yours  ours proceeding from your expecting an attack by sea which we knew was impossible either by england or by a fleet under truxton who was at home or by our own navy which was under our own eye your belief that burr would really descend with   or  000 men was no doubt founded on what you know of the numbers which could be raised in the western country for an expedition to mexico under the authority of the government but you probably did not calculate that the want of that authority would take from him every honest man  leave him only the desperadoes of his party which in no part of the ud s can ever be a numerous body in approving therefore as we do approve of the defensive operations for n orleans we are obliged to estimate them not according to our own view of the danger but to place ourselves in your situation  only with your information your sending here swartwout  bollman and adding to them burr blennerhasset  tyler should they fall into your hands will be supported by the public opinion as to alexander who is arrived and ogden expected the evidence yet received will not be sufficient to commit them i hope however you will not extend this deportation to persons against whom there is only suspicion or shades of offence not strongly marked in that case i fear the public sentiment would desert you because seeing no danger here violations of law are felt with strength i have thought it just to give you these views of the sentiments  sensations here as they may enlighten your path i am thoroughly sensible of the painful difficulties of your situation expecting an attack from an overwhelming force unversed in law surrounded by suspected persons  in a nation tender as to everything infringing liberty  especially from the military you have doubtless seen a good deal of malicious insinuation in the papers against you this of course begot suspicion and distrust in those unacquainted with the line of your conduct we who knew it have not failed to strengthen the public confidence in you and i can assure you that your conduct as now known has placed you on ground extremely favorable with the public burr and his emissaries found it convenient to sow a distrust in your mind of our dispositions towards you but be assured that you will be cordially supported in the line of your duties i pray you to send me ds original letter communicated through briggs by the first entirely safe conveyance accept my friendly salutations  assurances of esteem  respect on june      0  he again wrote to wilkinson thomas jefferson wilkinson dear sir —i received last night yours of the   th and sincerely congratulate you on your safe arrival at richmond against the impudent surmises  hopes of the band of conspirators who because they are as yet permitted to walk abroad and even to be in the character of witnesses until such a measure of evidence shall be collected as will place them securely at the bar of justice attempt to cover their crimes under noise and insolence you have indeed had a fiery trial at new orleans but it was soon apparent that the clamorous were only the criminal endeavoring to turn the public attention from themselves  their leader upon any other object having delivered to the attorney genl all the papers i possessed respecting burr  his accomplices when he went to richmond i could only write to him without knowing whether he was at philadelphia wilmington or delaware for your letter of oct    desired by the court if you have a copy of it and chuse to give it in it will i think have a good effect for it was my intention if i should receive it from mr rodney not to communicate it without your consent after i learnt your arrival mr rodney will certainly either bring or send it within the course of a day or two and it will be instantly forwarded to mr hay for the same reason i cannot send the letter of j p d as you propose to mr hay i do not recollect what name these initials indicate but the paper whatever it is must be in the hands of mr rodney not so as to your letter to dayton for as that could be of no use in the prosecution  was reserved to be forwarded or not according to circumstances i retained it in my own hands  now return it to you if you think daytons son should be summoned it can only be done from richmond we have no subpœnas here within about a month we shall leave this to place ourselves in healthier stations before that i trust you will be liberated from your present attendance it would have been of great importance to have had you here with the secretary of war because i am very anxious to begin such works as will render plaquemine impregnable and an insuperable barrier to the passage of any force up or down the river but the secretary at war sets out on wednesday to meet with some other persons at new york and determine on the works necessary to be undertaken to put that place hors dinsulte  thence he will have to proceed northwardly i believe i must ask you at your leisure to state to me in writing what you think will answer our views at plaquemine within the limits of expense which we can contemplate  of which you can form a pretty good idea your enemies have filled the public ear with slanders  your mind with trouble on that account the establishment of their guilt will let the world see what they ought to think of their clamors it will dissipate the doubts of those who doubted for want of knolege and will place you on higher ground in the public estimate and public confidence no one is more sensible than myself of the injustice which has been aimed at you accept i pray you my salutations  assurances of respect  esteem   on january     0  jefferson further wrote to gallatin i return you the letter of mr gelston respecting the brutus from what i learn she cannot be destined for the mississippi because she draws too much water to enter it however considering the difficulty congress finds in enlarging the limits of our preventive powers i think we should be cautious how we step across those limits ourselves she is probably bound to st domingo could not congress while continuing that law amend it so as to prevent the abuse actually practised affectionate salutations   from a copy courteously furnished by dr j m wilson of douglas wyoming   hening was just undertaking his well known statutes at large of virginia on feb    jefferson further wrote him thomas jefferson william waller hening sir —it has not been in my power sooner to acknolege your letter of feb   after repeating that my printed collection of laws which are in strong bound volumes are at your service i must observe as to the manuscript volumes that several of them run into one another in point of time so that the same act will be found in several volumes and will require a good deal of collating but what presents a greater difficulty is that some of these volumes seem to have been records of the council and to contain interspersed copies of some laws these volumes are in a black letter illegible absolutely but to those habituated to it and far beyond the competence of an ordinary scribe i have never myself searched up the acts which these volumes contain i have always expected they would fill up some of the lacunæ in the list i sent to mr wythe as this compilation can be made but once because in doing it the originals will fall to pieces my anxiety that justice shall be done it obliges me to say that it cannot be done till i become resident at monticello there i will superintend it myself freely giving my own labour to whoever undertakes to copy  publish whether on public or private account the copyist must probably live with me during the work  of course i must take some part in his choice seeing no inconvenience in publishing first the edited  secondly the inedited laws i am in hopes that you may think the former may at once be entered on accept my salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect   from a copy courteously furnished by mr john boyd thacher of albany n y   on february      0  jefferson wrote to gallatin i send you allstons letter for perusal he thinks to get over this matter by putting a bold face on it i have the names of three persons whose evidence taken together can fix on him the actual endeavor to engage men in burrs enterprise some appropriation must certainly be made for provisions c arrested i expect we must pay for them all and use the provisions for the army but how is the appropriation to be introduced   jefferson enclosed this message to the governor of louisiana in the following letter thomas jefferson feby   0  washington washington feby   0  dear sir —i pray you to read the enclosed letter to seal  deliver it it explains itself so fully that i need say nothing i am sincerely concerned for mr reibelt who is a man of excellent understanding and extensive science if you had any academical berth he would be much better fitted for that than for the bustling business of life i enclose to genl wilkinson my message of jan    i presume however you will have seen it in the papers it gives the history of burrs conspiracy all but the last chapter which will i hope be that of his capture before this time at natchez your situations have been difficult and we judge of the merit of our agents there by the magnitude of the danger as it appeared to them not as it was known to us on great occasions every good officer must be ready to risk himself in going beyond the strict line of law when the public preservation requires it his motives will be a justification as far as there is any discretion in his ultralegal proceedings  by indulgence of private feelings on the whole this squall by shewing with what ease our government suppresses movements which in other countries requires armies has greatly increased its strength by increasing the public confidence in it it has been a wholesome lesson too to our citizens of the necessary obedience to their government the feds  the little band of quids in opposition will try to make something of the infringement of liberty by the military arrest  deportation of citizens but if it does not go beyond such offenders as swartwout bollman burr blennerhasset tyler c they will be supported by the public approbation accept my friendly salutations  assurances of esteem  respect   later the president wrote to the secretary at war thomas jefferson oct    0  washington washington oct    0  dear sir —i have reflected on the case of the embodying of the militia in ohio and think the respect we owe to the state may overweigh the disapprobation so justly due to the conduct of their governor pro tem they certainly had great merit and have acquired a very general favor thro the union for the early  vigorous blows by which they crushed the insurrection of burr we have now again to appeal to their patriotism  public spirit in the same case and should there be war they are our bulwark in the most prominent point of assault from the indians their good will  affection therefore should be conciliated by all justifiable means if we suffer the question of paying the militia embodied to be thrown on their legislature it will excite acrimonious debate in that body  they will spread the same dissatisfaction among their constituents and finally it will be forced back on us through congress would it not therefore be better to say to mr kirker that the general government is fully aware that emergencies which appertain to them will sometimes arise so suddenly as not to give time for consulting them before the state must get into action that the expenses in such cases incurred on reasonable grounds will be met by the general government and that in the present case altho it appears there was no real ground for embodying the militia and that more certain measures for ascertaining the truth should have been taken before embodying them yet an unwillingness to damp the public spirit of our countrymen  the justice due to the individuals who came forward in defence of their country  who could not know the grounds on which they were called have determined us to consider the call as justifiable  to defray the expenses this is submitted to you for consideration affectionate salutations   in the preparation of this message the president wrote to dearborn and smith the h of representatives ask what particular ports are proposed to be furnished with gunboats  how many to each i give you a list of the ports but instead of saying how many to each i will throw them into groups as below  say how many boats to each group will you be so good as to state how many you would think necessary for each of the ports below mentd to give them a reasonable measure of protection in time of war also to strike out  insert ports in the list as you think best   misipi river    l pontchartrain    mobille river    st marys    savanna    beaufort

passamaquoddy    the following evidently prepared for some newspaper was written by jefferson mr elliot in his speech on the subject of gunboats inserted in the national intelligencer of dec  0 quotes from the presidents message of feb  0   0  the following passage in the remarkable action between the russian flotilla of gunboats  gallies and a turkish fleet of ships of the line and frigates in the liman sea in      the latter commanded by their most celebrated admiral were completely defeated and several of their ships of the line destroyed he adds that he has not only consulted the professed annals of the times but has obtained some information from a writer who appears to have been personally acquainted with the scene of action  then he gives such an account of the action as may suit the scope of his argument but not naming either the professed annals or the writer who seems to have been personally acquainted with the scene of action so as to enable his hearers to question his account it stands on his own personal authority only mr elliots situation probably had not given him an opportunity of consulting the new annual register of      which is certainly among the professed annals of the times and the most respectable of them the following account of the two actions in the liman of the   th    th of june      is copied verbally from that work pa  0 a fleet of an inferior sort c—in which they had placed themselves § in the leyden gazettes of aug               the reader will find official and more detailed accounts of these two actions from these authorities taken together it appears that the turkish force was    ships of the line   frigates and many smaller vessels the russian force   ships of the line some frigates  galleys under which denomination they include gunboats making    in all in the  st action of june   th the small vessels on both sides alone engaged the turks were defeated  having lost   of their number the residue retired under the protection of their ships of the line that in the  d action of the   th the turkish admiral carried his large as well as small vessels into the liman sea or lake the russians had in the meantime been reinforced by    gunboats carrying an    pounder each the result was by the annual register   vessels ships of the line  frigates taken or destroyed  by the leyden account    the remainder of the turkish fleet the large as well as small vessels retreating under shelter of the walls of ocrakow it does not appear in either account that any part of the russian force was ever engaged but the flotilla of small vessels which were almost entirely gallies  gun boats and in the second and decisive action were arranged in two lines in the form of a crescent the reader will now judge for himself whether the statement in the message of feb  0 is not a fair summary of these accounts and whether it be true as mr elliot has said that it appears that no such battle as that described in the message of feb  0 ever happened   on the draft of this message gallatin wrote the following notes message respecting gunboats  d paragraph might not this be altogether omitted it is true that the resolution of the house has arisen from the debate on fortifications vs gunboats but as it does ask information only on the last subject it is not necessary to allude to the other subject such allusion will be construed as taking sides against n york fortifications and the expression of that opinion of the president is necessary neither to prevent too large a fortification appropn nor to shew the efficiency of gunboats on the contrary the third paragraph with some trifling alterations in its introduction would present the whole system contemplated by the executive which in fact embraced under the name of land batteries a species of fortifications without giving offence or interfering with the question of permanent  detached fortifications it may be added that castle william reg mud island fort johnson and even the works now going on on governors island must be considered as regular fortifications not properly embraced under the designations of land batteries and from their insular  detached situation to be necessarily manned by a standing military force  th paragraph omit or modify the words inhabited by c whose system like ours is peace  defence otherwise algiers will be stated as having a system of peace  defence exclusively omit the sentence already pencilled relating to our squadron it is not i think altogether correct in point of fact we wanted gunboats there to attack theirs in shallow water  even to attack their batteries but our frigates never avoided them for their ground of the frigates was on the high seas where the tripolitan boats dared not come to gunboats properly so called i do not think that the british have much resorted in the channel but they did under curtis in completing the destruction of the floating batteries at gibraltar it is well known that during that long siege they found it indispensable to have such an armament to meet a similar enemies force the swedes  russians have used them to a greater extent than any other nation the most splendid achievement by gunboats was the destruction on the   th    th june      of a great part of the turkish fleet under their celebrated capitan pacha hassan aly in the liman or mouth of the dnieper by the russian flotilla under prince of nassau nassau had twentytwo one gunboats and    galleys hassan attacked him in order to force the passage and besiege kimburn with    ships of the line  several frigates  lost nine of his ships the latter part of this paragraph commencing with the words and indeed to the end might be omitted  th paragraph  the     c would cost from   to  00 thd dollars query whether any gunboats fit for sea including rigging guns c have actually been built for less than five thousand dollars and whether it be intended that they should all be built of a size that will cost no more are also the appropriations already made sufficient to compleat the first    for the idea conveyed is that less than  00 thd dollars will complete the whole number of  00 if there be any uncertainty on that point such modification in the expressions should be made as will avoid a premature commitment having regard c it has been thought that ½ might be built this year  the other half the next i am clearly of opinion that we ought to build now all those that are wanted for the mississippi  also that number which it may be thought proper to keep afloat in time of european war in the other ports the number for the mississippi is stated in the message at  0 that to be kept afloat generally in time of european war is stated in the  th paragraph at    at most this makes at the utmost    and there are already    building it does not seem to me that there is any necessity to build beforehand any greater number for the others are expressly stated in the message to be wanted only in case the u states are at war if any length of time was necessary to build such vessels it might be proper to be at all times prepared with the whole number wanted but of all the species of force which war may require armies ships of war fortifications  gunboats there is none which can be obtained in a shorter time than gunboats  none therefore that it is less necessary to provide beforehand i think that within sixty days perhaps half the time each of the seaports of boston new york philada  baltimore might build  fit out thirty and the smaller ports together as many especially if the timber was prepared beforehand but beyond that preparation i would not go for exclusively of the first expense of building  the interest of capital thus laid out i apprehend that notwithstanding the care which may be taken they will infallibly decay in a given number of years  will be a perpetual bill of costs for repairs and maintenance sheds will be of use provided the boats are built  not launched but if once in the water they must share the fate of all other vessels whether public or private it will be an economical measure for every naval station to burn their navy at the end of a war  to build a new one when again at war if it was not that time is necessary to build ships of war the principle is the same as to gunboats and the objection of time necessary to build does not exist i also think that in this as in everything else connected with a navy  naval departments the annual expense of maintenance will far exceed what is estimated and i would not be in the least astonished if supposing two hundred gunboats were actually built it should add half a million dollars a year to our annual expenses for the support of that establishment i would therefore suggest that the latter part of this paragraph which contemplates the building of     in   years should be omitted and at the end of the  th paragraph to omit also the words without the expense for repairs or maintenance and to insert the substance of that part of the  th paragraph which submits the question to the legislature but with a modification so as to read in substance with the legislature it will rest to decide on the number sufficient for the object  the time of building indorsed recd feb  th 0    a judge of the court of appeals   an official of the territory of columbia

to london the more seriously it impresses me i believe the sine qua non we made is that of the nation  that they would rather go on without a treaty than with one which does not settle this article under this dilemma and at this stage of the business had we not better take the advice of the senate i ask a meeting at    oclock tomorrow to consult on this question   jefferson further wrote to robert r livingston thomas jefferson march   th   0  washington robert r livingston washington march   th   0  dear sir —the two receipts of paucins have come safely to hand the account has been settled without difficulty the federal papers appear desirous of making mischief between us  england by putting speeches into my mouth which i never uttered perceiving by a letter received in january that our comrs were making up their mind to sign a treaty which contained no provision against impressment we immediately instructed them not to do so  if done to consider the treaty as not accepted  to resume their negociations to supply an article against impressment we therefore hold the treaty in suspense until we hear what is done in consequence of our last instructions probably we shall not hear till midsummer  we reserve till that time the question of calling the senate in the meantime to shew the continuance of a friendly spirit we continue the suspension of the nonimportation act by proclamation another cause for not accepting the treaty was a written declaration by the british commrs at the time of signing reserving a right if we did not oppose the french decree to their satisfaction to retaliate in their own way however it might affect the treaty so that in fact we were to be bound  they left free i think upon the whole the emperor cannot be dissatisfied at the present state of things between us  england  that he must rather be satisfied at our unhesitating rejection of a proposition to make common cause against him for such in amount it was burr has indeed made a most inglorious exhibition of his much overrated talents he is now on his way to richmond for trial accept my friendly salutations  assurances of constant esteem  respect he also wrote to levi lincoln march      0  i expect you are at a loss to understand the situation of the british treaty on which the newspapers make so many speeches for me which i never made it is exactly this by a letter received from our negociators in january we found they were making up their minds to sign a treaty containing no provision against the impressment of our seamen we instantly feb   instructed them not to do so and that if such a treaty had been forwarded it could not be ratified that therefore they must immediately resume the negociations to supply that defect as a sine quâ non such a treaty having come to hand we of course suspend it until we know the result of the instructions of feb   which probably will not be till midsummer we reserve ourselves till then to decide the question of calling the senate in the meantime i have by proclamation continued the suspension of the nonimportation law as a proof of the continuance of friendly dispositions there was another circumstance which would have prevented the acceptance of the treaty the british commissioners at the time of signing gave in a written declaration that until they knew what we meant to do in the subject of the french decree the king reserved to himself the right of not ratifying and of taking any measures retaliating on france which he should deem proper notwithstanding the treaty this made the treaty binding on us while he was loose to regard it or not and clearly squinted at the expectation that we should join in resistance to france or they would not regard the treaty we rejected this idea unhesitatingly i expected to have paid a short visit to monticello before this but have been detained by the illness of my soninlaw mr randolph and now by an attack of periodical headache on myself this leaves me but an hour  a half each morning capable of any business at all a part of this i have devoted to write you this letter and to assure you of my constant friendship and respect   from the southern bivouac ii       for convenience all the letters written by jefferson to hay during the burr trial follow thomas jefferson may    0  washington george hay washington may    0  dear sir —we are at this moment informed by a person who left richmond since the   d that the prosecution of burr had begun under very inauspicious symptoms by the challenging  rejecting two members of the grand jury as far above all exception as any two persons in the u s i suppose our informant is inaccurate in his terms and has mistaken an objection by the criminal  voluntary retirement of the gentlemen with the permission of the court for a challenge  rejection which in the case of a grand jury is impossible be this as it may and the result before the formal tribunal fair or false it becomes our duty to provide that full testimony shall be laid before the legislature  through them the public for this purpose it is necessary that we be furnished with the testimony of every person who shall be with you as a witness if the grand jury find a bill the evidence given in court taken as verbatim as possible will be what we desire if there be no bill  consequently no examination before court then i must beseech you to have every man privately examined by way of affidavit and to furnish me with the whole testimony in the former case the person taking down the testimony as orally delivered in court should make oath that he believes it to be substantially correct in the latter case the certificate of the magistrate administering the oath and signature of the party will be proper and this should be done before they receive their compensation that they may not evade examination go into any expense necessary for this purpose  meet it from the funds provided by the attorney general for the other expenses he is not here or this request would have gone from him directly i salute you with friendship  respect george hay may    0  washington thomas jefferson washington may    0  dear sir —i have this moment recd your letter of the   th and hasten to answer it if the grand jury do not find a bill against burr as there will be no examination before a petty jury bollmans pardon need not in that case to be delivered but if a bill be found and a trial had his evidence is deemed entirely essential  in that case his pardon is to be produced before he goes to the book in my letter of the day before yesterday i enclosed you bollmans written communication to me  observed you might go so far if he prevaricated as to ask him whether he did not say so  so to mr madison and myself on further reflection i think you may go farther if he prevaricates grossly  shew the paper to him and ask if it is not his handwriting  confront him by its contents i enclose you some other letters of bollman to me on former occasions to prove by similitude of hand that the paper i enclosed on the   th was of his handwriting i salute you with esteem  respect bollman june   0  washington george hay washington june   0  dear sir —while burrs case is depending before the court i will trouble you from time to time with what occurs to me i observe that the case of marbury v madison has been cited and i think it material to stop at the threshold the citing that case as authority and to have it denied to be law   because the judges in the outset disclaimed all cognizance of the case altho they then went on to say what would have been their opinion had they had cognizance of it this then was confessedly an extrajudicial opinion and as such of no authority   because had it been judicially pronounced it would have been against law for to a commission a deed a bond delivery is essential to give validity until therefore the commission is delivered out of the hands of the executive  his agents it is not his deed he may withhold or cancel it at pleasure as he might his private deed in the same situation the constitution intended that the three great branches of the government should be coordinate  independent of each other as to acts therefore which are to be done by either it has given no controul to another branch a judge i presume cannot sit on a bench without a commission or a record of a commission  the constitution having given to the judiciary branch no means of compelling the executive either to deliver a commission or to make a record of it shews it did not intend to give the judiciary that controul over the executive but that it should remain in the power of the latter to do it or not where different branches have to act in their respective lines finally  without appeal under any law they may give to it different and opposite constructions thus in the case of william smith the h of r determined he was a citizen and in the case of william duane precisely the same in every material circumstance the judges determined he was no citizen in the cases of callendar  some others the judges determined the sedition act was valid under the constitution and exercised their regular powers of sentencing them to fine  imprisonment but the executive determined that the sedition act was a nullity under the constitution and exercised his regular power of prohibiting the execution of the sentence or rather of executing the real law which protected the acts of the defendants from these different constructions of the same act by different branches less mischief arises than from giving to any one of them a control over the others the executive  senate act on the construction that until delivery from the executive department a commission is in their possession  within their rightful power and in cases of commissions not revocable at will where after the senates approbation  the presidents signing  sealing new information of the unfitness of the person has come to hand before the delivery of the commission new nominations have been made  approved and new commissions have issued on this construction i have hitherto acted on this i shall ever act and maintain it with the powers of the government against any control which may be attempted by the judges in subversion of the independence of the executive  senate within their peculiar department i presume therefore that in a case where our decision is by the constitution the supreme one  that which can be carried into effect it is the constitutionally authoritative one and that that by the judges was coram non judice  unauthoritative because it cannot be carried into effect i have long wished for a proper occasion to have the gratuitous opinion in marbury v madison brought before the public  denounced as not law  i think the present a fortunate one because it occupies such a place in the public attention i should be glad therefore if in noticing that case you could take occasion to express the determination of the executive that the doctrines of that case were given extrajudicially  against law and that their reverse will be the rule of action with the executive if this opinion should not be your own i would wish it to be expressed merely as that of the executive if it is your own also you would of course give to the arguments such a development as a case incidental only might render proper i salute you with friendship and respect thomas jefferson june   0  washington george hay washington june   0  dear sir —your favor of the   st has been received and i think it will be fortunate if any circumstance should produce a discharge of the present scanty grand jury and a future summons of a fuller tho the same views of protecting the offender may again reduce the number to    in order to lessen the change of getting    to concur it is understood that wherever burr met with subjects who did not chuse to embark in his projects unless approved by their government he asserted that he had that approbation most of them took his word for it but it is said that with those who would not the following stratagem was practised a forged letter purporting to be from genl dearborne was made to express his approbation and to say that i was absent at monticello but that there was no doubt that on my return my approbation of his enterprises would be given this letter was spread open on his table so as to invite the eye of whoever entered his room and he contrived occasions of sending up into his room those whom he wished to become witnesses of his acting under sanction by this means he avoided committing himself to any liability to prosecution for forgery  gave another proof of being a great man in little things while he is really small in great ones i must add general dearbornes declaration that he never wrote a letter to burr in his life except that when here once in a winter he usually wrote him a billet of invitation to dine the only object of sending you the enclosed letters is to possess you of the fact that you may know how to pursue it if any of your witnesses should know anything of it my intention in writing to you several times has been to convey facts or observations occurring in the absence of the attorney general and not to make to the dreadful drudgery you are going through the unnecessary addition of writing me letters in answer which i beg you to relieve yourself from except when some necessity calls for it i salute you with friendship  respect george hay june    0  washington thomas jefferson washington june    0  sir —your letter of the  th is this moment received reserving the necessary right of the president of the u s to decide independently of all other authority what papers coming to him as president the public interests permit to be communicated  to whom i assure you of my readiness under that restriction voluntarily to furnish on all occasions whatever the purposes of justice may require but the letter of genl wilkinson of oct    requested for the defence of colonel burr with every other paper relating to the charges against him which were in my possession when the attorney general went on to richmond in march i then delivered to him and i have always taken for granted he left the whole with you if he did  the bundle retains the order in which i had arranged it you will readily find the letter desired under the date of its receipt which was nov    but lest the attorney general should not have left those papers with you i this day write to him to forward this one by post an uncertainty whether he is at philadelphia wilmington or new castle may produce delay in his receiving my letter of which it is proper you should be apprized but as i do not recollect the whole contents of that letter i must beg leave to devolve on you the exercise of that discretion which it would be my right  duty to exercise by withholding the communication of any parts of the letter which are not directly material for the purposes of justice with this application which is specific a prompt compliance is practicable but when the request goes to copies of the orders issued in relation to colo burr to the officers at orleans natchez c by the secretaries of the war  navy departments it seems to cover a correspondence of many months with such a variety of officers civil  military all over the u s as would amount to the laying open the whole executive books i have desired the secretary at war to examine his official communications and on a view of these we may be able to judge what can  ought to be done towards a compliance with the request if the defendant alleges that there was any particular order which as a cause produced any particular act on his part then he must know what this order was can specify it and a prompt answer can be given if the object had been specified we might then have had some guide for our conjectures as to what part of the executive records might be useful to him but with a perfect willingness to do what is right we are without the indications which may enable us to do it if the researches of the secretary at war should produce anything proper for communication  pertinent to any point we can conceive in the defence before the court it shall be forwarded to you i salute you with respect and esteem note on the same day i recd from the secr at war copies of   letters to the govr of missipi  orleans which i immediately inclosed to g hay thomas jefferson june      0  washington george hay washington june      0  sir —in answering your letter of the  th which desired a communication of one to me from genl wilkinson specified by its date i informed you in mine of the   th that i had delivered it with all other papers respecting the charges against aaron burr to the attorney genl when he went to richmond that i had supposed he had left them in your possession but would immediately write to him if he had not to forward that particular letter without delay i wrote to him accordingly on the same day but having no answer i know not whether he has forwarded the letter i stated in the same letter that i had desired the secretary at war to examine his office in order to comply with your further request to furnish copies of the orders which had been given respecting aaron burr and his property and in a subsequent letter of the same day i forwarded to you copies of two letters from the secretary at war which appeared to be within the description expressed in your letter the order from the secretary of the navy you said you were in possession of the receipt of these papers had i presume so far anticipated and others this day forwarded will have substantially fulfilled the object of a subpœna from the district court of richmond requiring that those officers  myself should attend the court in richmond with the letter of genl wilkinson the answer to that letter  the orders of the departments of war  the navy therein generally described no answer to genl wilkinsons letter other than a mere acknolegement of its receipt in a letter written for a different purpose was ever written by myself or any other to these communications of papers i will add that if the defendant supposes there are any facts within the knolege of the heads of departments or of myself which can be useful for his defence from a desire of doing anything our situation will permit in furtherance of justice we shall be ready to give him the benefit of it by way of deposition through any persons whom the court shall authorize to take our testimony at this place i know indeed that this cannot be done but by consent of parties  i therefore authorize you to give consent on the part of the u s mr burrs consent will be given of course if he supposes the testimony useful as to our personal attendance at richmond i am persuaded the court is sensible that paramount duties to the nation at large control the obligation of compliance with their summons in this case as they would should we receive a similar one to attend the trials of blannerhassett  others in the mississippi territory those instituted at st louis and other places on the western waters or at any place other than the seat of government to comply with such calls would leave the nation without an executive branch whose agency nevertheless is understood to be so constantly necessary that it is the sole branch which the constitution requires to be always in function it could not then mean that it should be withdrawn from its station by any coordinate authority with respect to papers there is certainly a public  a private side to our offices to the former belong grants of land patents for inventions certain commissions proclamations  other papers patent in their nature to the other belong mere executive proceedings all nations have found it necessary that for the advantageous conduct of their affairs some of these proceedings at least should remain known to their executive functionary only he of course from the nature of the case must be the sole judge of which of them the public interests will permit publication hence under our constitution in requests of papers from the legislative to the executive branch an exception is carefully expressed as to those which he may deem the public welfare may require not to be disclosed as you will see in the enclosed resolution of the h of representatives which produced the message of jan    respecting this case the respect mutually due between the constituted authorities in their official intercourse as well as sincere dispositions to do for every one what is just will always insure from the executive in exercising the duty of discrimination confided to him the same candor  integrity to which the nation has in like manner trusted in the disposal of its judiciary authorities considering you as the organ for communicating these sentiments to the court i address them to you for that purpose  salute you with esteem  respect thomas jefferson june    0  washington george hay washington june    0  dear sir —yours of the   th was received last night three blank pardons had been as i expect made up  forwarded by the mail of yesterday and i have desired   others to go by that of this evening you ask what is to be done if bollman finally rejects his pardon  the judge decides it to have no effect move to commit him immediately for treason or misdemeanor as you think the evidence will support let the court decide where he shall be sent for trial and on application i will have the marshall aided in his transportation with the executive means and we think it proper further that when burr shall have been convicted of either treason or misdemeamor you should immediately have committed all those persons against whom you should find evidence sufficient whose agency has been so prominent as to mark them as proper objects of punishment  especially where their boldness has betrayed an inveteracy of criminal disposition as to obscure offenders  repenting ones let them lie for consideration i enclose you the copy of a letter received last night and giving singular information i have inquired into the character of graybell he was an old revolutionary captain is now a flour merchant in baltimore of the most respectable character  whose word would be taken as implicitly as any mans for whatever he affirms the letter writer also is a man of entire respectability i am well informed that for more than a twelvemonth it has been believed in baltimore generally that burr was engaged in some criminal enterprise  that luther martin knew all about it we think you should immediately despatch a subpœna for graybell  while that is on the road you will have time to consider in what form you will use his testimony e g shall l m be summoned as a witness against burr  graybell held ready to confront him it may be doubted whether we could examine a witness to discredit our own witness besides the lawyers say that they are privileged from being forced to breaches of confidence and that no others are shall we move to commit l m as particeps criminis with burr graybell will fix upon him misprision of treason at least and at any rate his evidence will put down this unprincipled  impudent federal bulldog and add another proof that the most clamorous defenders of burr are all his accomplices it will explain why l m flew so hastily to the aid of his honorable friend abandoning his clients  their property during a session of a principal court in maryland now filled as i am told with the clamors  ruin of his clients i believe we shall send on latrobe as a witness he will prove that a b endeavored to get him to engage several thousand men chiefly irish emigrants whom he had been in the habit of employing in the works he directs under pretence of a canal opposite louisville or of the washita in which had he succeeded he could with that force alone have carried everything before him and would not have been where he now is he knows too of certain meetings of burr bollman yrujo  one other whom we have never named yet but have him not the less in our view i salute you with friendship  respect p s will you send us half a dozen blank subpœnas since writing the within i have had a conversation with latrobe he says it was  00 men he was desired to engage the pretexts were to work on the ohio canal  be paid in washita lands your witnesses will some of them prove that burr had no interest in the ohio canal  that consequently this was a mere pretext to cover the real object from the men themselves and all others latrobe will set out in the stage of tomorrow evening  be with you monday evening thomas jefferson june  0   0  washington george hay washington june  0   0  dear sir —mr latrobe now comes on as a witness against burr his presence here is with great inconvenience dispensed with as   0 workmen require his constant directions on various public works of pressing importance i hope you will permit him to come away as soon as possible how far his testimony will be important as to the prisoner i know not but i am desirous that those meetings of yrujo with burr and his principal accomplices should come fully out and judicially as they will establish the just complaints we have against his nation i did not see till last night the opinion of the judge on the subpœna duces tecum against the president considering the question there as coram non judice i did not read his argument with much attention yet i saw readily enough that as is usual where an opinion is to be supported right or wrong he dwells much on smaller objections and passes over those which are solid laying down the position generally that all persons owe obedience to subpœnas he admits no exception unless it can be produced in his law books but if the constitution enjoins on a particular officer to be always engaged in a particular set of duties imposed on him does not this supersede the general law subjecting him to minor duties inconsistent with these the constitution enjoins his constant agency in the concerns of   millions of people is the law paramount to this which calls on him on behalf of a single one let us apply the judges own doctrine to the case of himself  his brethren the sheriff of henrico summons him from the bench to quell a riot somewhere in his county the federal judge is by the general law a part of the posse of the state sheriff would the judge abandon major duties to perform lesser ones again the court of orleans or maine commands by subpœnas the attendance of all the judges of the supreme court would they abandon their posts as judges and the interests of millions committed to them to serve the purposes of a single individual the leading principle of our constitution is the independence of the legislature executive and judiciary of each other and none are more jealous of this than the judiciary but would the executive be independent of the judiciary if he were subject to the commands of the latter  to imprisonment for disobedience if the several courts could bandy him from pillar to post keep him constantly trudging from north to south  east to west and withdraw him entirely from his constitutional duties the intention of the constitution that each branch should be independent of the others is further manifested by the means it has furnished to each to protect itself from enterprises of force attempted on them by the others and to none has it given more effectual or diversified means than to the executive again because ministers can go into a court in london as witnesses without interruption to their executive duties it is inferred that they would go to a court  000 or   00 miles off and that ours are to be dragged from maine to orleans by every criminal who will swear that their testimony may be of use to him the judge says it is apparent that the presidents duties as chief magistrate do not demand his whole time  are not unremitting if he alludes to our annual retirement from the seat of government during the sickly season he should be told that such arrangements are made for carrying on the public business at and between the several stations we take that it goes on as unremittingly there as if we were at the seat of government i pass more hours in public business at monticello than i do here every day and it is much more laborious because all must be done in writing our stations being known all communications come to them regularly as to fixed points it would be very different were we always on the road or placed in the noisy  crowded taverns where courts are held mr rodney is expected here every hour having been kept away by a sick child i salute you with friendship and respect george hay june      0  washington thomas jefferson washington june      0  dear sir —in mine of the   th i informed you i would write to the atty general to send on the letter of general wilkinson of oct    referred to in my message of jany    he accordingly sent me a letter of that date but i immediately saw that it was not the one desired because it had no relation to the facts stated under that reference i immediately by letter apprized him of this circumstance and being since returned to this place he yesterday called on me with the whole of the papers remaining in his possession  he assured me he had examined carefully the whole of them and that the one referred to in the message was not among them nor did he know where it would be found these papers have been recurred to so often on so many occasions and some of them delivered out for particular purposes that we find several missing without being able to recollect what has been done with them some of them were delivered to the attorney of this district to be used on the occasions which arose in the district court  a part of them were filed as is said in their office the atty general will examine their office to day and has written to the district attorney to know whether he retained any of them no researches shall be spared to recover this letter  if recovered it shall immediately be sent on to you compiling the message from a great mass of papers and pressed in time the date of a particular paper may have been mistaken but we all perfectly remember the one referred to in the message  that its substance is there correctly stated genl wilkinson probably has copies of all the letters he wrote me  having expressed a willingness to furnish the one desired by the court the defendant can still have the benefit of it or should he not have the particular one on which that passage in the message is founded i trust that his memory would enable him to affirm that it is substantially correct i salute you with friendship  respect thomas jefferson aug   0  monticello george hay monticello aug   0  dear sir —i inclose you a letter received yesterday on the subject of genl presley nevil with respect to both him  his son i believe there is no doubt of a participation in burrs designs but i suppose that after the issue of the principal trial will be the proper time to decide what subordinate offenders may be laid hold of i learn by the newspapers that i am to have another subpœna duces tecum for eatons declaration with respect to my personal attendance higher duties keep me here during the present  ensuing months i am here to avoid the diseases of tide water situations and all communications on the business of my office by arrangements which have been taken will be daily received and transacted here with respect to the paper in question it was delivered to the attorney genl with all the other papers relating to burr i have therefore neither that nor any of the others in my possession possibly the atty genl may have delivered it to you if not he has it  he is the person to whom a subpœna to bring that or any others into court may be at once addressed i salute you with friendship  respect the most interesting of this series however is a mere draft of a letter to hay which may never have been sent but which is of the utmost importance the enclosed letter is written in a spirit of conciliation  with the desire to avoid conflicts of authority between the high branches of the govmt which would discredit it equally at home  abroad that burr  his counsel should wish to struck out divert the public attention from him to this battle of giants was to be convert his trial into a contest between the judiciary  exve authorities was to be expected but that the ch justice should lend himself to it and take the first step to bring it on was not expected nor can it be now believed that his prudence or good sense will permit him to press it but should he contrary to expectation proceed to issue any process which should involve any act of force to be committed on the persons of the exve or heads of depmts i must desire you to give me instant notice  by express if you find that can be quicker done than by post and that moreover you will advise the marshall on his conduct as he will be critically placed between us his safest way will be to take no part in the exercise of any act of force ordered in this case the powers given to the exve by the constn are sufficient to protect the other branches from judiciary usurpation of preeminence  every individual also from judiciary vengeance and the marshal may be assured of its effective exercise to cover him i hope however that the discretion of the c j will suffer this question to lie over for the present and at the ensuing session of the legislature he may have means provided for giving to individuals the benefit of the testimony of the exve functionaries in proper cases without breaking up the government will not the associate judge assume to divide his court and procure a truce at least in so critical a conjuncture george hay august  0   0  monticello thomas jefferson monticello august  0   0  dear sir —i received yesterday your favor of the   th an error of the post office had occasioned the delay before an impartial jury burrs conduct would convict himself were not one word of testimony to be offered against him but to what a state will our law be reduced by party feelings in those who adminster it why do not blannerhassett dayton c demand private  comfortable lodgings in a country where an equal application of law to every condition of man is fundamental how could it be denied to them how can it ever be denied to the most degraded malefactor the enclosed letter of james morrison covering a copy of one from alston to blannerhassett came to hand yesterday i enclosed them because it is proper all these papers should be in one deposit  because you should know the case  all its bearings that you may understand whatever turns up in the cause whether the opinion of the letter writer is sound may be doubted for however these  other circumstances which have come to us may induce us to believe that the bouncing letter he published  the insolent one he wrote to me were intended as blinds yet they are not sufficient for legal conviction blannerhassett  his wife could possibly tell us enough i commiserate the suffering you have to go through in such a season and salute you with great esteem and respect thomas jefferson sep   0  monticello george hay monticello sep   0  dear sir —i received late last night your favor of the day before and now reenclose you the subpœna as i do not believe that the district courts have a power of commanding the executive government to abandon superior duties  attend on them at whatever distance i am unwilling by any notice of the subpœna to set a precedent which might sanction a proceeding so preposterous i enclose you therefore a letter public  for the court covering substantially all they ought to desire if the papers which were enclosed in wilkinsons letter may in your judgment be communicated without injury you will be pleased to communicate them i return you the original letter i am happy in having the benefit of mr madisons counsel on this occasion he happening to be now with me we are both strongly of opinion that the prosecution against burr for misdemeanor should proceed at richmond if defeated it will heap coals of fire on the head of the judge if convicted it will give time to see whether a prosecution for treason against him can be instituted in any and what other court but we incline to think it may be best to send blannerhasset  smith israel to kentucky to be tried both for the treason  misdemeanor the trial of dayton for misdemeanor may as well go on at richmond i salute you with great esteem  respect george hay september     0  monticello thomas jefferson monticello september     0  sir —understanding that it is thought important that a letter of nov      0  from general wilkinson to myself should be produced in evidence on the charges against aaron burr depending in the district court now sitting in richmond i send you a copy of it omitting only certain passages the nature of which is explained in the certificate subjoined to the letter as the attorney of the united states be pleased to submit the copy  certificate to the uses of the court i salute you with great esteem and respect the certificate read on reexamination of a letter of nov      0  from genl wilkinson to myself which having been for a considerable time out of my possession and now returned to me i find in it some passages entirely confidential given for my information in the discharge of my executive functions and which my duties  the public interest forbid me to make public i have therefore given above a correct copy of all those parts which i ought to permit to be made public those not communicated are in nowise material for the purposes of justice on the charges of treason or misdemeanor depending against aaron burr they are on subjects irrelevant to any issues which can arise out of those charges  could contribute nothing towards his acquittal or conviction the papers mentioned in the  st and  d paragraphs as enclosed in the letters being separated therefrom  not in my possession i am unable from memory to say what they were i presume they are in the hands of the attorney for the u s given under my hand this  th day of september   0    this was a vindication of thomas jefferson against the charges contained in a pamphlet entitled serious considerations by grotius n y   00   from the southern bivouac ii       a letter of the same purport was written to dearborn later the president wrote to gallatin thomas jefferson july     0  gallatin july     0  i received last night your letter from havre de grace in which you count on being here today by two oclock it will save a day in the measures we may determine to take if i can see you soon after your arrival if you arrive before half after three come and take a family dinner with me that i may put you in possession of what is under contemplation so that you may have to reflect on it till tomorrow when as you will see by another note i have asked a meeting affectionate salutations   the following are the presidents letters to the governor of virginia concerning the steps to be taken consequent upon the chesapeake outrage thomas jefferson july   0  washington washington july   0  sir —you will have received from the secretary at war a letter requesting that the quota of the state of virginia of  00000 militia be immediately organized and put in readiness for service at the shortest warning but that they be not actually called out until further requisition the menacing attitudes which the british ships of war have taken in hampton road the actual blockade of norfolk  their having sounded the entrance as if with a view to pass up to the city render it necessary that we should be as well prepared there as circumstances will permit the secretary at war being gone to n york to arrange a plan of defence for that city it devolves on me to request that according to the applications you may receive from the officers charged with the protection of the place and the information which you are more at hand to obtain than we are here you will order such portions of the militia as you shall think necessary  most convenient to enter immediately on duty for the defence of the place  protection of the country at the expense of the u s we have moreover   gunboats hauled up at hampton    others on the stocks in matthews county under the care of commodore samuel barron which we consider as in danger i must request you also to order such aids of militia on the application of that officer as you shall think adequate to their safety any arms which it may be necessary to furnish to the militia for the present objects if not identically restored to the state shall be returned in kind or in value by the u s i have thought i could not more effectually provide for the safety of the places menaced than by committing it to your hands as you are nearer the scene of action have the necessary powers over the militia can receive information  give aid so much more promptly than can be done from this place i will ask communications from time to time of your proceedings under this charge i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson july      0  washington washington july      0  sir —your letter of the   th was received yesterday and the opinion you have given to general matthews against allowing any intercourse between the british consul  the ships of his nation remaining in our waters in defiance of our authority is entirely approved certainly while they are conducting themselves as enemies de facto intercourse should be permitted only as between enemies by flags under the permission of the commanding officers  with their passports my letter of the   th mentioned a case in which a communication from the british officers should be received if offered a day or two ago we permitted a parent to go on board the bellona with letters from the british minister to demand a son impressed and others equally necessary will occur but they should be under the permission of some officer having command in the vicinity with respect to the disbanding some portion of the troops altho i consider norfolk as rendered safe by the batteries the two frigates the   gunboats present and   others  a bombvessel which will be there immediately  consequently that a considerable proportion of the militia may be spared yet i will pray you to let that question lie a few days as in the course of this week we shall be better able to decide it i am anxious for their discharge the first moment it can be done with safety because i know the dangers to which their health will be exposed in that quarter in the season now commencing by a letter of the   th from col tatham stationed at the vicinities of lynhaven bay to give us daily information of what passes i learn that the british officers  men often go ashore there that on the day preceding  00 had been at the pleasurehouse in quest of fresh provisions  water that negroes had begun to go off to them as long as they remain there we shall find it necessary to keep patroles of militia in the neighborhood sufficiently strong to prevent them from taking or receiving supplies i presume it would be thought best to assign the tour for the three months to come to those particular corps who being habituated to the climate of that part of the country will be least likely to suffer in their health at the end of which time others from other parts of the country may relieve them if still necessary in the meantime our gunboats may all be in readiness and some preparations may be made on the shore which may render their remaining with us not eligible to themselves these things are suggested merely for consideration for the present as by the close of the week i shall be able to advise you of the measures ultimately decided on i salute you with friendship  respect thomas jefferson july      0  washington washington july      0  sir —yours of the  0th has been duly received the relation in which we stand with the british naval force within our waters is so new that differences of opinion are not to be wondered at respecting the captives who are the subject of your letter are they insurgents against the authority of the laws are they public enemies acting under the orders of their sovereign or will it be more correct to take their character from the act of congress for the preservation of peace in our harbors which authorizes a qualified war against persons of their demeanor defining its objects  limiting its extent considering this act as constituting the state of things between us  them the captives may certainly be held as prisoners of war if we restore them it will be an act of favor and not of any right they can urge whether great britain will give us that reparation for the past  security for the future which we have categorically demanded cannot as yet be foreseen but we have believed we should afford an opportunity of doing it as well from justice  the usage of nations as a respect to the opinion of an impartial world whose approbation  esteem are always of value this measure was requisite also to produce unanimity among ourselves for however those nearest the scenes of aggression  irritation may have been kindled into a desire for war at short hand the more distant parts of the union have generally rallied to the point of previous demand of satisfaction  war if denied it was necessary too for our own interests afloat on the ocean  under the grasp of our adversary and added to all this great britain was ready armed  on our lines while we were taken by surprise in all the confidence of a state of peace  needing time to get our means into activity these considerations render it still useful that we should avoid every act which may precipitate immediate  general war or in any way shorten the interval so necessary for our own purposes and they render it advisable that the captives in the present instance should be permitted to return with their boat arms c to their ships whether we shall do this a  d a  d or a  th time must still depend on circumstances but it is by no means intended to retire from the ground taken in the proclamation that is to be strictly adhered to and we wish the military to understand that while for special reasons we restore the captives in this first instance we applaud the vigilance  activity which by taking them have frustrated the object of their enterprise and urge a continuance of them to intercept all intercourse with the vessels their officers and crews and to prevent them from taking or receiving supplies of any kind and for this purpose should the use of force be necessary they are unequivocally to understand that force is to be employed without reserve or hesitation i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson july      0  washington washington july      0  sir —the secretary at war having returned from new york we have immediately taken up the question respecting the discharge of the militia which was the subject of your two last letters and which i had wished might remain undecided a few days from what we have learnt of the conduct of the british squadron in the chesapeake since they have retired from hampton roads we suppose that until orders from england they do not contemplate any further acts of hostility other than those they are daily exercising by remaining in our waters in defiance of the national authority and bringingto vessels within our jurisdiction were they even disposed to make an attempt on norfolk it is believed to be sufficiently secured by the two frigates cybele and chesapeake by the    gunboats now there    more from matthews county expected—by the works of fort nelson to all of which we would wish a company of artillery of the militia of the place to be retained  trained putting into their hands the guns used at norfolk and a company of cavalry to be employed on the bay shore between norfolk  cape henry to cut off from these vessels all supplies according to the injunctions of the proclamation  to give immediate notice to norfolk should any symptoms of danger appear—to oppose which the militia of the borough and the neighboring counties should be warned to be in constant readiness to march at a moments warning considering these provisions as quite sufficient for the safety of norfolk we are of opinion that it will be better immediately to discharge the body of militia now in service both on that  the other side of james river this is rendered expedient not only that we may husband from the beginning those resources which will probably be put to a long trial but from a regard to the health of those in service which cannot fail to be greatly endangered during the sickly season now commencing and the discouragement which would thence arise to that ardor of public spirit now prevailing as to the details necessary on winding up this service the secretary at war will write fully as he will also relative to the force retained in service and whatever may hereafter concern them or their operations which he possesses so much more familiarly than i do  have been gone into by myself immediately only on account of his absence on another service the diseases of the season incident to most situations on the tidewaters now beginning to show themselves here  to threaten some of our members together with the probability of a uniform course of things in the chesapeake induce us to prepare for leaving this place during the two sickly months as well for the purposes of health as to bestow some little attention to our private affairs which is necessary at some time of every year our respective stations will be fixed  known so that everything will find us at them with the same certainty as if we were here and such measures of intercourse will be established as that the public business will be carried on at them with all the regularity  dispatch necessary the present arrangements of the post office admit an interchange of letters between richmond and monticello twice a week if necessary and i propose that a third shall be established during the two ensuing months of which you shall be informed my present expectation is to leave this place for monticello about the close of this or the beginning of the next week the secretary at war will continue in this neighborhood until we shall further see that the course of things in the chesapeake will admit of his taking some respite i salute you with great esteem and respect thomas jefferson august   0  monticello monticello august   0  dear sir —your letters of july     aug   were received yesterday the ground taken in conformity with the act of congress of considering as public enemies british armed vessels in or entering our waters gives us the benefit of a system of rules sanctioned by the practice of nations in a state of war and consequently enabling us with certainty  satisfaction to solve the different cases which may occur in the present state of things with these rules most officers are acquainted and especially those old enough to have borne a part in the revolutionary war   as to the enemy within our waters intercourse according to the usages of war can only be by flag and the ceremonies respecting that are usually a matter of arrangement between the adverse officers commanding in the neighborhood of each other if no arrangement is agreed on still the right of sending a flag is inherent in each party whose discretion will direct him to address it to the proper adverse authority as otherwise it would be subject to delay or rejection letters addressed by flag to persons in authority with the adverse power may be sent sealed  should be delivered but if to others or to their own friends happening to be within the limits of the adversary they must be open if innocent in the judgment of the receiving officer courtesy requires their delivery if otherwise they may be destroyed or returned by him but in a case of only suspended amity as ours they should be returned letters sent from the interdicted vessels to their consul in norfolk must be open and the propriety of delivering them judged of by our officer tempering his judgment however with liberality and urbanity those to their minister plenipoty here sealed or unsealed should be sent to the secretary of state without any delay as to the demand of fugitive slaves it was the custom during the late war for the owner to apply to our commander for a flag and to go himself with that to exhibit his claim and receive the fugitive and with respect to americans detained on board their ships the application should be still as heretofore made through the secretary of state to whom proper documents are to be furnished but without waiting for his application the british officer knowing them to be americans  freemen cannot but feel it a duty to restore them to their liberty on their own demand   as to the residue of the british nation with whom we are as yet in peace their persons  vessels unarmed are free to come into our country without question or molestation and even armed vessels in distress or charged under due authority with despatches addressed to the government of the u s or its authorized agents are by a proviso in the proclamation to be received this exception was meant to cover the british packets coming to new york which are generally armed as well as to keep open through other channels the communication between the governments such a vessel as the columbine needs no flag because she is not included in the interdict her repairs  supplies are to be regulated by the collector of the port who may permit them liberally if no abuse be justly suspected so far as wanted to carry her back to the port from whence she came the articles of intercourse stay  departure are to be specially superintended by such person as the government shall authorize  instruct i have thus far in compliance with your request stated the practice of nations so generally as to meet the cases which may arise in the neighborhood of norfolk in doing this i may in some cases have mistaken the practice where i have done so i mean that my opinion shall be subject to correction from that practice on determining that the militia should be disbanded except so small a portion as would require only a major to command we concluded that so long as capt decatur should remain in his present station he should be the officer to receive authorize  regulate intercourse by flag with the british squadron in the chesapeake he has accordingly i expect received instructions to that effect from the secretary of the navy and i shall communicate to him a copy of this letter to assist him in that duty the secretary at war i presume has written to you on the appointment of a major to command the militia retained in your selection of the officer i have no doubt you will be sensible of the importance of naming one of intelligence  activity as on him we are to rely for daily information from that interesting quarter thomas jefferson august      0  monticello monticello august      0  dear sir —your favor of the  th is received it asks my opinion on several points of law arising out of the act of congress for accepting  0000 volunteers altho your own opinion  those of some of your counsellors more recent in the habit of legal investigation would be a safer guide for you than mine unassisted by my ordinary  able associates yet i shall frankly venture my individual thoughts on the subject and participate with you in any risk of disapprobation to which an honest desire of furthering the public good may expose us in the construction of a law even in judiciary cases of meum et tuum where the opposite parties have a right  counterright in the very words of the law the judge considers the intention of the lawgiver as his true guide and gives to all the parts  expressions of the law that meaning which will effect instead of defeating its intention but in laws merely executive where no private right stands in the way and the public object is the interest of all a much freer scope of construction in favor of the intention of the law ought to be taken  ingenuity ever should be exercised in devising constructions which may save to the public the benefit of the law its intention is the important thing the means of attaining it quite subordinate it often happens that the legislature prescribing details of execution some circumstance arises unforeseen or unattended to by them which would totally frustrate their intention were their details scrupulously adhered to  deemed exclusive of all others but constructions must not be favored which go to defeat instead of furthering the principal object of their law and to sacrifice the end to the means it being as evidently their intention that the end shall be attained as that it shall be effected by any given means if both cannot be observed we are equally free to deviate from the one as the other and more rational in postponing the means to the end in the present case the object of the act of congress was to relieve the militia at large from the necessity of leaving their farms  families to encounter a service very repugnant to their habits and to permit that service to be assumed by others ardently desiring it both parties therefore  they comprehend the whole nation would willingly waive any verbal difficulties or circumstances of detail which might thwart their mutual desires  would approve all those views of the subject which facilitate the attainment of their wishes it is further to be considered that the constitution gives the executive a general power to carry the laws into execution if the present law had enacted that the service of  0000 volunteers should be accepted without saying anything of the means those means would by the constitution have resulted to the discretion of the executive so if means specified by an act are impracticable the constitutional power remains  supplies them often the means provided specially are affirmative merely and with the constitutional powers stand well together so that either may be used or the one supplementary to the other this aptitude of means to the end of a law is essentially necessary for those which are excutive otherwise the objection that our government is an impracticable one would really be verified with this general view of our duty as executive officers i proceed to the questions proposed by you   does not the act of congress contemplate the association of companies to be formed before commissions can be issued to the captains c   can battalion or fieldofficers be appointed by either the state or congressional laws but to battalions or regiments actually existing   the organization of the companies into battalions and regiments belonging to the president can the governor of the state issue commissions to these officers before that organization is made  announced to him   ought not the volunteers tendering their services under the act of feb    0  to be accepted by the president before the commissions can issue had we no other executive powers but those given in this act the  st  d   d questions would present considerable difficulties inasmuch as the act of congress does appear as you understand it to contemplate that the companies are to be associated  the battalions squadrons regiments brigades  divisions organized before commissions are to issue and were we to stop here the law might stop also because i verily believe that it will be the zeal  activity alone of those destined for commands which will give form  body to the floating ardor of our countrymen to enter into this service and bring their wills to a point of union  effect we know from experience that individuals having the same desires are rarely brought into an association of them unless urged by some one assuming an agency  that in military associations the person of the officer is a material inducement whether our constitutional powers to carry the laws into execution would not authorize the issuing a previous commission as they would had nothing been said about commissions in the law is a question not necessary now to be decided because they certainly allow us to do what will be equally effectual we may issue instructions or warrants to the persons destined to be captains c authorizing them to superintend the association of the companies  to perform the functions of a captain c until commissions may be regularly issued when such a commission will be given to the bearer or a warrant authorizing the bearer to superintend the organization of the companies associated in a particular district into battalions squadrons c and otherwise to perform the functions of a colol c until a commission may regularly issue when such a commission will be given to the bearer this is certainly within the constitutional powers of the executive and with such a warrant i believe the person bearing it would act with the same effect as if he had the commission as to the  th question the execution of this law having been transferred to the state executives i did consider all the powers necessary for its execution as delegated from the president to them of this i have been so much persuaded that to companies offering their services under this law i have answered that the power of acceptance was in the governor and have desired them to renew their offer to him if the delegation of this power should be expressly made it is hereby fully delegated to the preceding i will add one other observation as we might still be disappointed in obtaining the whole number of       were they apportioned among the several districts  each restrained to its precise apportionment which some might fail to raise i think it would better secure the complete object of the law to accept all proper offers that the excess of some districts may supply the deficiencies of others when the acceptances are all brought together the surplus if any will be known and if not wanted by the u s may be rejected and in doing this such principles of selection may be adopted as without any imputation of partiality may secure to us the best offers for example   we may give a preference to all those who will agree to become regulars if desired this is so obviously for the public advantage that no one could object to it   we may give a preference to    month volunteers over those for   months and other circumstances of selection will of course arise from the face of the offers such as distribution geographical position proportion of cavalry riflemen c i have thus without reserve expressed my ideas on the several doubts stated in your letters  i submit them to your consideration they will need it the more as the season and other circumstances occasioning the members of the administration to be in a state of separation at this moment they go without the stamp of their aid  approbation it is our consolation  encouragement that we are serving a just public who will be indulgent to any error committed honestly  relating merely to the means of carrying into effect what they have manifestly willed to be a law i salute you with great esteem and respect thomas jefferson sep     0  monticello monticello sep     0  dear sir —i now return you majr newtons letters the intention of the squadron in the bay is so manifestly pacific that your instructions to him are perfectly proper not to molest their boats merely for approaching the shore while they are giving up slaves  citizen seamen  attempting nothing ashore it would not be well to stop this by any new restriction if they come ashore indeed they must be captured or destroyed if they cannot be captured because we mean to enforce the proclamation rigorously in preventing supplies so the instructions already given as to intercourse by flag as to sealed  unsealed letters must be strictly adhered to it is so material that the seaport towns should have artillery militia duly trained that i think you have done well to permit captain nestells company to have powder and ball to exercise with respect to guncarriages furnaces  clothes i am so little familiar with the details of the war department that i must beg those subjects to lie till the return of the secretary at war which will be in three weeks proposing to be absent from this place from the  th to the   th instant our daily post will be suspended during that interval i salute you with great esteem  respect thomas jefferson nov     0  washington washington nov     0  dear sir —your late letters have been regularly referred to the secretary at war who has already answered their several enquiries or will do it immediately i am inclined to believe that the departure of the british vessels from our waters must be in consequence of orders from england to respect the authorities of the country within about a fortnight we think we may expect answers from england which will decide whether this cloud is to issue in a storm or calm here we are pacifically inclined if anything comes which will permit us to follow our inclinations but whether we have peace or war i think the present legislature will authorize a complete system of defensive works on such a scale as they think we ought to adopt the state of our finances now permits this to defensive works by land they will probably add a considerable enlargement of the force in gunboats a combination of these will i think enable us to defend the chesapeake at its mouth and save the vast line of preparation which the defence of all its interior waters would otherwise require i salute you with great esteem and respect   madisons draft a free use of their harbors  waters the means of refitting  refreshment of succor to their sick  suffering have at all times and on equal principles been extended to all and this too while the officers of one of the belligerents recd among us were in a continued course of insubordination to the laws of violence to the persons of our citizens and of trespass on their property these abuses of the laws of hospitality have become habitual to commanders of british armed ships hovering on our coasts and frequenting our harbors they have been the subject of repeated representations to their govt assurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them within the limits of the rights  the respect due to a friendly nation but these orders and assurances have been without effect nor has a single instance of punishment of past wrongs taken place even the murder of a citizen peaceably pursuing his occupation within the limits of our jurisdiction remains unpunished and omitting late insults as gross as language could offer the public sensibility has at length been brought to a serious crisis by an act transcending all former outrages a frigate of the u s which had just left her port on a distant service trusting to a state of peace  therefore unprepared for defence has been surprised and attacked by a vessel of superior force being one of a squadron then lying in our waters to cover the transaction  has been disabled for service with the loss of a number of men killed  wounded this enormity was not merely without provocation or any justifiable cause it was committed with the avowed  insulting purpose of violating a ship of war under the american flag and taking from her by force a part of her crew a pretext the more flagrant as the british commander was not unapprised that the seamen in question were native citizens of the u states having effected her lawless  bloody purpose the british vessel returned immediately to anchor with her squadron within our jusridiction hospitality under such circumstances ceases to be a duty and a continuance of it with such uncontrouled abuses would tend only by multiplying injuries  irritations to bring on a rupture which it is the interest and it is hoped the inclination of both nations to avoid in this light the subject cannot but present itself to the british govt and strengthen the motives to an honorable reparation for the wrong which has been done and to that effectual controul of its naval commanders which alone can justify the govt of the u s in the exercise of those hospitalities which it is constrained to discontinue and maintain undiminished all the existing relations between the two nations indorsed department of state recd june    0  proclmn   jefferson further wrote to cooper thomas jefferson sepr   0  monticello cooper monticello sepr   0  dear sir —your favor of the  th is received  with it the copy of dr priestleys memoirs for which i return you many thanks i shall read them with great pleasure as i revered the character of no man living more than his with another part of your letter i am sensibly affected i have not here my correspondence with govr mckean to turn to but i have no reason to doubt that the particular letter referred to may have been silent on the subject of your appointment as stated the facts are these the opinion i have ever entertained  still entertain as strongly as ever of your abilities  integrity was such as made it my wish from the moment i came to the administration that you should be employed in some public way on a review however of all circumstances it appeared to me that the state of pensylva had occasions for your service which would be more acceptable than any others to yourself because they would leave you in the enjoyment of the society of dr priestley to which your attachment was known i therefore expressed my solicitude respecting you to gov mckean whose desires to serve yourself  the public by employing you i knew to be great  of course that you were an object of mutual concern and i received his information of having found employment for your talents with the sincerest pleasure but pressed as i am perpetually by an overflow of business  adopting from necessity the rule of never answering any letter or part of a letter which can do without answer in replying to his which related to other subjects i probably said nothing on that because my former letter had sufficiently manifested how pleasing the circumstance must be to me and my time  practice did not permit me to be repeating things already said this is a candid statement of that incident and i hope you will see in it a silence accounted for on grounds far different from that of a continuance of my estimation  good wishes which have experienced no change with respect to the schism among the republicans in your state i have ever declared to both parties that i consider the general government as bound to take no part in it and i have carefully kept both my judgment my affections  my conduct clear of all bias to either it is true as you have heard that a distance has taken place between mr clay  myself the cause i never could learn nor imagine i had always known him to be an able man  i believed him an honest one i had looked to his coming into congress with an entire belief that he would be cordial with the administration and even before that i had always had him in my mind for a high important vacancy which had been from time to time expected but is only now about to take place i feel his loss therefore with real concern but it is irremediable from the necessity of harmony  cordiality between those who are to manage together the public concerns not only his withdrawing from the usual civilities of intercourse with me which even the federalists with   or   exceptions keep up but his open hostility in congress to the administration leave no doubt of the state of his mind as a fact altho the cause be unknown be so good as to communicate my respects to mr priestley and to accept yourself my friendly salutations  assurances of unaltered esteem   on the same day the president wrote to the secretary of war thomas jefferson august     0  monticello monticello august     0  dear sir —i received yesterday yours of the  th with the proposition for substituting   000 twelvemonth volunteers instead of   000 regulars as a disposable force and i like the idea much it will of course be a subject of consideration when we all meet again but i repeat that i like it greatly on some occasion a little before i left washington when we were together all i think except mr gallatin but i am not quite so sure as to yourself as the others conversing on the bungling business which had been made by the officers commanding at norfolk with erskines letters and the more bungling conduct to be expected when the command should devolve on a militia major mr smith proposed that the whole business of flags should be committed to decatur this appeared to obtain at once the general approbation thinking it so settled on lately receiving a letter from govr cabell asking full  explicit instructions as to the mode of intercourse i endeavored to lay down the general rules of intercourse by flag as well digested as i could to meet all cases but concluded by informing him that the whole business was committed to decatur mr madison now informs me that either not recollecting or not understanding this to have been the arrangement instructions have been given to the officer commanding by land relative to intercourse which may produce collision the remedy i think is easy  will on the whole place the matter on more proper ground that is to give to the commanding officers by land as well as sea equal authority to send  receive flags this is the safer as i see by the papers that mr newton of congress is the major i shall accordingly write to govr cabell today to correct the error  to inform him that the two commanders stand on an equal footing in the direction of flags i wrote you yesterday as to the additional company of infantry employed and shall await your opinion before i say anything on it to the governor i salute you affectionately   part in brackets struck out   th j to j m shall i send dayton an answer as above shall i leave out the last sentence but one or shall i send him no answer note—this was sent under cover to mr hay  opened for his perusal—t j   on the next day jefferson wrote to madison    it will be very difficult to answer mr erskines demand respecting the water casks in the tone proper for such a demand i have heard of one who having broke his cane over the head of another demanded paiment for his cane this demand might well enough have made part of an offer to pay the damages done to the chesapeake and to deliver up the authors of the murders committed on board her i return you the papers received yesterday the governor has enclosed me a letter from genl mathews of august    mentioning the recent arrival of a ship in the chesapeake bearing the flag of a viceadmiral from whence he concludes that barclay has arrived i salute you affectionately   on the appointment of shee the president wrote to james gamble thomas jefferson oct    0  washington james gamble washington oct    0  sir —your favor of the   th has been duly received i have long seen and with very great regret the schisms which have taken place among the republicans  principally those of pensylvania  new york as far as i have been able to judge they have not been produced by any difference of political principle at least any important difference but by a difference of opinion as to persons i determined from the first moment to take no part in them  that the government should know nothing of any such differences accordingly it has never been attended to in any appointment or refusal of appointment genl shees personal merit universally acknoleged was the cause of his appointment as indian superintendent and a subsequent discovery that his removal to this place the indispensable residence of that officer would be peculiarly unpleasant to him suggested his translation to another office to solve the double difficulty rarely reading the controversial pieces between the different sections of republicans i have not seen the piece in the aurora to which you allude but i may with truth assure you that no fact has come to my knolege which has ever induced any doubt of your continued attachment to the true principles of republican government i am thankful for the favorable sentiments you are so kind as to express towards me personally and trust that an uniform pursuit of the principles  conduct which have procured will continue to me an approbation which i highly value i salute you with great esteem  respect   jefferson further wrote to paine thomas jefferson oct   0  washington paine washington oct   0  dear sir —your  d letter on the subject of gunboats came to hand just before my departure from monticello in the meantime the inquiry into the proposition had been referred agreeably to our usage or to reason to the practical persons of the department to which it belonged deemed most skilful on my arrival here i found the answers of the persons to whom it was referred the substance of which i now enclose you i am not a judge of their solidity but i presume they are founded and the rather as they are from officers entirely favorable to the use of gunboats we have as yet no knolege of the arrival of the revenge in england but we may daily expect to hear of it and as we expected she would be detained there  in france about a month it would be a month hence before we can expect her back here in the meantime all the little circumstances coming to our knolege are unfavorable to our wishes for peace if they would but settle the question of impressment from our bottoms i should be well contented to drop all attempts at a treaty the other rights of neutral powers will be taken care of by bonaparte  alexander and for commercial arrangements we can sufficiently provide by legislative regulations but as the practice of impressment has taken place only against us we shall be left to settle that for ourselves and to do this we shall never again have so favorable a conjuncture of circumstances accept my friendly salutations  assurances of great esteem  respect   on the same day jefferson wrote hay thomas jefferson september  0   0  monticello hay monticello september  0   0  dear sir —general wilkinson has asked permission to make use in the statement of burrs affair which he is about to publish of the documents placed in your hands by mr rodney to this consent is freely given with one reservation some of these papers are expressed to be confidential others containing censures on particular individuals are such as i always deem confidential  therefore cannot communicate but for regularly official purposes without a breach of trust i must therefore ask the exercise of your discretion in selecting all of this character and of giving to the general the free use of the others it will be necessary that the whole be returned to the attorney general by the first week in the next month as a selection will be made from them to make part of the whole evidence in the case which i shall have printed and communicated to congress i salute you with great esteem  respect   the following papers relate to the drafting of this message albert gallatin    october   0  thomas jefferson dear sir —i have kept your message longer than usual because my objections being less to details than to its general spirit i was at a loss what alterations to submit to your consideration instead of being written in the style of the proclamation which has been almost universally approved at home  abroad the message appears to me to be rather in the shape of a manifesto issued against great britain on the eve of a war than such as the existing undecided state of affairs seems to require it may either be construed into a belief that justice will be denied a result not to be anticipated in an official communication or it may be distorted into an eagerness of seeing matters brought to an issue by an appeal to arms although it be almost certain that the expected answer will decide the question yet unforeseen circumstances may protract its discussion the british government may without acceding precisely to your ultimatum take some new admissible ground which will require your sanction  delay the final arrangement so long as any hope however weak remains of an honorable settlement it is desirable that no act of the executive may by widening the breach or unnecessarily hurting the pride of great britain have a tendency to defeat it unless therefore some useful  important object can be obtained by the message in its present form i would wish its general colour  expression to be so softened nothing inserted but what is necessary for assisting congress in their first deliberations  to account for their early meeting no recapitulation of former outrages further than as connected with the unratified treaty no expression of a belief that war is highly probable which last seems either to presuppose absolute injustice on the part of great britain or to acknowledge high pretensions on ours for unless some important object be in view those may do harm  cannot be productive of any substantial benefit if the object be to urge congress to make the necessary preparations for war this may be attained by a direct and strong recommendation founded not on the probability but on the uncertainty of the issue if it be to incite them to a speedy declaration of war this also seems premature  may as effectually be done at its proper time when the answer of the british government will be communicated it may be added that recommendations or incitements to war should not under our constitution be given by the executive without much caution and above all that the precise manner  time of acting which congress should adopt are subjects which have not yet been sufficiently examined that the choice of the manner will not probably be left to us is true that great britain will prefer actual war to any system of retaliation short of war which we might select i do believe yet how far it may be proper to leave the choice to her deserves at least consideration public opinion abroad is to us highly valuable at home it is indispensable we will be universally justified in the eyes of the world  unanimously supported by the nation if the ground of war be englands refusal to disavow or to make satisfaction for the outrage on the chesapeake but i am confident that we will meet with a most formidable opposition should england do justice on that point and we should still declare war because she refuses to make the proposed arrangement respecting seamen it is in that case that measures short of war may become proper leaving to england if she chooses the odium of commencing an actual war but although that policy may be questionable and decisive measures even under that contingency be thought preferable the question of time requires most serious consideration under an impression that this month would decide the question of war or peace it was thought prudent to contemplate rather than to prepare immediate offensive operations to strike a blow the moment war is begun is doubtless important but it does not follow that war ought to be commenced at this very moment so far as relates to canada it may as easily and considering the state of our preparations i might say more easily be invaded  conquered in winter or even early in the spring than this autumn european reinforcements cannot in the spring reach montreal much less upper canada before both shall have been occupied by us quebec will certainly be reinforced before the season shall permit regular approaches no advantage therefore will result in that respect from an immediate attack no inconvenience from the declaration of war being somewhat delayed in every other respect it is our interest that actual war should not be commenced by england this autumn and as for the same reason it is her interest to commence it if she thinks it ultimately unavoidable i wish not only that we may not declare it instantaneously but that her government and her affairs in america may until the decision takes place still consider the result as uncertain the operations of war on the part of great britain will consist in the capture of our vessels attacks on our most exposed seaports  defence of canada on our part unable either to protect our commerce or to meet their fleets our offensive operations must by sea be confined to privateers and we must as far as practicable draw in those vessels we cannot defend place our ports in a situation to repel mere naval aggressions organize our militia for occasional defence raise troops  volunteers for permanent garrisons or attack those essential preparations are in some points hardly commenced in every respect incomplete our china  east india trade to an immense amount yet out no men raised indeed nothing more was practicable beyond a draft of militia whatever relates to its better selection organization or to the raising of regulars or volunteers wanting the authorization of congress  requiring time for executing the batteries contemplated at new york not yet commenced not even a temporary rampart in any part of the city and hardly a gun mounted on governors island how far the works of the two other seaports mentioned in the message as particularly exposed have progressed i do not know further appropriations stated to be necessary for the intended batteries at every other harbor it seems essentially necessary that we should if permitted provide such rational  practicable means of defence as we think may be effected within a short time before we precipitate the war is it not probable that england will if she presumes that her answer may lead to a war immediately dispatch a few ships with contingent orders and if congress were to declare war in november what would prevent their naval force here even if not reinforced to lay new york under contribution before winter great would be the disgrace attaching to such a disaster the executive would be particularly liable to censure for having urged immediate war whilst so unprepared against attack nor need i say that as a prosperous administration is almost invulnerable so adverse events will invariably destroy its popularity let it be added that independent of immense loss to individuals three millions at least of next years revenue rest on bonds due by the merchants of that city in every view of the subject i feel strongly impressed with the propriety of preparing to the utmost for war  carrying it with vigor if it cannot be honorably avoided but in the meanwhile of persevering in that caution of language  sanction which may give us some more time and is best calculated to preserve the remaining chance of peace  most consistent with the general system of your administration as to any particular alterations in that part of the message although i do not feel equal to proposing proper substitutes a sketch is inclosed intended rather to shew those parts which i think most objectionable than the proper manner of amending them with great respect  sincere attachment your obdt servt albert gallatin dated    october   0  alterations proposed by gallatin paragraph—strike out from and the moment in  th line to the word place in the last line of the first page  insert in substance the many injuries  depredations under which our commerce and navigation have been affected on the high seas for years past the successive innovations on those rules of public law established by the reason and usage of nations all the circumstances which preceded the extraordinary mission to england are already known to you i will observe on this part of the message that pierces murder was in no ways the cause of the extraordinary mission mr pinkneys nomination took place whilst congress was in session pierce was killed immediately after the adjournment nay kings conduct on that occasion has by some been ascribed to his disappointment at pinkney being selected instead of himself the next sentence ending at the word inadmissible in  th line of the  d page  which gives the history of the negotiation does not seem full enough i would introduce the idea that the efforts of our ministers were applied to the framing of an arrangement wh might embrace  settle all the points in dispute and also provide for a commercial intercourse on conditions of some equality i would also modify the declaration of the inadmissibility of the instrument by saying that although it had provided in a manner if not altogether satisfactory yet admissible for some of the points in dispute it had left one more likely to perpetuate collisions altogether unprovided for and that in other respects it was inadmissible such modification is recommended by a desire not to appear to abandon the arrangement respecting the colonial trade or that of equalization of duties and also with a view to the opposition party in england on which it is not our interest to bear too hard lest they should also unite against us same paragraph instead of the sentences on this outrage c  its character has been c i would prefer saying simply on this outrage no commentaries are necessary  d paragraph i would rather omit altogether this paragraph the continuation of aggression being the act of the same officers may fairly be considered as part of the same act nor do i think a recommendation to exclude ships of war from our ports opportunely introduced at a moment when the question is war or peace but if the paragraph be preserved i would omit what relates to demands of additional reparation which more than any other part of the message seems to indicate a determination not to arrange amicably the disputes with great britain  d paragraph i would also rather omit under existing circumstances this paragraph if preserved i would strike out from the commencement to overlooked in the  th line of the paragraph  insert another new violation of maritime rights of great magnitude has in the meanwhile taken place the government of that nation c and at the end of the paragraph i would add that that order was predicated on a supposed construction of buonapartes decree wh had been disavowed  not acted upon by the french government if that be not inserted here it should i think be alluded to in the  th paragraph  a copy of the decree  explanations be sent stating that although some expressions in the decree had at first caused alarm yet as its operation both by their declarations  practice was confined to ports within their own jurisdiction  neither affected maritime rights nor contravened our treaty it could not tho in its effects curtailing our commerce be complained of as hostile it seems to me that the  th   0th and particularly the   th    th paragraphs should immediately follow the  d or perhaps the  st the two last        relate to the measures adopted by the executive in consequence of the outrage on the chesapeake that however is only a question of arrangement  th paragraph the expressions may without further delay be expected to be brought to an issue of some sort seem to go farther than mr armstrongs communications justify i would rather say and an expectation is entertained that they may soon be brought c same paragraph i would strike out the last words during the short period now to intervene before an answer which shall decide our course  simply say that no new collisions c have taken place or seem at present to be apprehended  th paragraph i perceive by gen dearborns statement that appropriations are wanted not only for other ports but also to a considerable amount for n york charleston  n orleans the idea should therefore be introduced  i would add something stronger in the shape of recommendations for that object generally   th paragraph quere whether the contracts entered into by the navy department do not embrace other objects than those here stated  also whether a greater expense than was appropriated has not been incurred for men on the mississippi  elsewhere at least mr smith states that he has no money to pay off the constitution  he ought to have enough to pay the whole navy to the end of the year   th do i think that there should be here some additional recommendation generally to provide for the worst in case of unfavorable issue—particularly to hint at the necessity of better organization of militia volunteers c   th do i regret that part of what was first intended particularly as to the effect of late decisions on the trial by jury has been suppressed but query how far it may be proper to go whilst marshalls decision on the pending motion is not known i think the   th or financial paragraph should precede this thomas jefferson october      0  october      0  i enclose you the form in which i would wish to place the financial paragraph with blanks which i must ask you to fill up also the sequel which is to conclude the message for your correction and i must ask the return of the former part as it is still to be communicated to mr rodney for his observations and then will be to be modified and four copies made according to the several amendments which will be proposed the arrival of the constitution and wasp at boston where they are awaiting orders renders it necessary they should be forwarded today and as it is a leading question if you can call here as soon as you arrive at your office giving me a few minutes previous notice i will ask the attendance of the other gentlemen for a few moments to decide this single question t j thomas jefferson    oct   0  dear sir —i return the financial paragraph  conclusion of the message the blanks i will supply on monday morning but as it will be only an approximation the paragraph should state that all the accounts not being yet received a correct statement will be transmitted by the treasury but that in the meanwhile it is ascertained that the receipts have exceeded millions which c have enabled us to pay about millions of the principal omitting altogether mention of interest unless by introducing after current demands the words including the annual interest on the debt  th line i do not remember whether in previous messages funded debt has been the expression there also after debt should be introduced nearly or more than according to the result wh i will furnish the remainder of the message is in my opinion unexceptionable indeed it is precisely in that spirit which i have taken the liberty to advise respectfully your obdt servt albert gallatin    oct   0  cæsar a rodneys notes indorsed received oct    0  message page   line   after fellow
