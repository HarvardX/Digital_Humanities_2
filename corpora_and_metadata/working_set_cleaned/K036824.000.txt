a dissertation upon pamphlets  in a letter to a nobleman    london printed in the year mdccxxxi  a dissertation upon pamphlets and the undertaking of phoenix britannicus to revive the most excellent among them in a letter to a nobleman from the original m s my lord the inclination you have expressed to hear what might be said in behalf of those most numerous productions of our press which we distinguish by the name of pamphlets and the present undertaking by the compiler of phoenix britannicus to revive the most excellent among them has induced me thus briefly to touch upon those particulars which seemed most to attract your lordships inquiry hoping the readiness of my endeavor will atone for the imperfections of my performance which if it does not equal the extensions of your curiosity may add to the instances of your candor so that where you find not entertainment commensurate to your knowledge you will not fail of exercise correspondent to your goodness  and first for the derivation of the word pamphlet i should think it little discredited by what some etymologists and those who torture words into confessions of what they were never guilty have through the confinement of themselves to some opprobrious signification censoriously suggested thereof thus one linguist having found a word which will illustrate the adaptness of these writings to the vulgar consultation of the populace would derive it from  and  as filling all places which all vulgar and popular things have the property of doing minsheus guide to tongues fol       another original no less specious has been offered me by an ingenious friend from  and  which by a grammatical turn reaches to the analogy of sound and by a rhetorical twist to the plausible sense of inflaming all parties but others considering the subject of pamphlets in a more copious and unbiassed latitude as having branched into all other parts of science besides religion and politics from the first appropriation of the name and before their engagement in controversy could draw upon them any prevailing sobriquet to their disparagement have with less partiality concluded of these tracts whose contents therefore as well as dimensions are so generally engaging to all writers and readers so much more universally suited to every bodys perusal to every bodys purchase that the name is more properly derivable from  and  as if they were a kind of composition beloved by or delighting all people icon libellorum in pref  but notwithstanding this favorable derivation i should not be for going to athens after one or seeking it in any other of the more ancient languages seeing that word pampier for paper in one more modern more probable to me as it seemed before to one of our most industrious glossographers for this of pamphlet to be derived from skinneri etymologicon ling ang fol       the last letter of the first syllable being interwoven by epenthesis to mollify the sound and the last syllable substituted as a noted term of diminution in many languages ib in voc let and sir hen spelmans gloss  with the same difference of interpretation as between charta and chartula or papyrus and papyrulus thus also in french the diminutive of the word livre for a book itself is livret and thus in english we have aglet amulet bracelet chaplet corslet eaglet gafflet hamlet howlet oilet pallet pullet ringlet rivulet and twenty more with like terminations to the same sense now this extraction besides the plea of precedent has the farther recommendations to our preference of not antedating the familiarity of graecisms in our tongue and withal of deriving itself from the more apparent and determinable quality of the size or substance rather than the subject matter of these more exiguous compositions and thus the word pamphlet or little paper book imports no reproachful character any more than the word great book signifies a pasquil as little as it does a panegyric of itself is neither good nor bad learned nor illiterate true nor false serious nor jocular of its own naked meaning or construction but is either of them according as the subject makes the distinction thus of scurrilous and abusive pamphlets to be burned in      we read in rushworth and by the name of pamphlet is the encomium of queen emma called in hollinshed  as for the antiquity of pamphlets it is not only questionable whether the art of printing should set a bound to it but even the very adoption of the name itself which yet i take to be more modern than that art for i look upon them as the eldest offspring of paper and to claim the rights of primogeniture even of bound volumes however they may be shorterlivd and the younger brother has so much outgrown the elder inasmuch as arguments do now and more especially did in the minority of our erudition not only so much more rarely require a larger compass than pamphlets will comprise but these being of a more ready and facil more decent and simple form suitable to the character of the more artless ages they seem to have been preferred by our modest ancestry for the communication of their sentiments before bookwriting became a trade and lucre or vanity let in deluges of digressory learning to swell up unweildy folios thus i find not a a little to the honor of our subject no less a person than the renowned king aelfred collecting his sage precepts and divine sentences with his own royal hand into quaternions of leaves stitched together sir john spelman s life of aelfred the great p  0   which he would enlarge with additional quaternions as occasion offered yet seemed he to keep his collection so much within the limits of a pamphletsize however bound together at last that he called it by the name of his handbook because he made it his constant companion and had it at hand wherever he was  it is so difficult to recover even any of our first books or volumes which were printed by william caxton though it is certain he set forth near half a hundred of them in folio that it were a wonder if his pamphlets should not be quite lost there are more extant of his successor wynkin de wordes printing in this lesser form whereof as great rarities i have seen both in quarto and octavo though holding no comparison probably with those of his also which are destroyed but it was the irruption of the grand controversy between the church of rome and the first opposers thereof which seems to have laid the great foundation of this kind of writing and to have given great credit to it at the same time as well by the many eminent authors it produced in church and state as the successful detection and defeat thereby befalling those religious impostures which had so universally inslaved the minds of men nay this important reformation has been much ascribed to one little pamphlet only which a certain lawyer of greysinn obliged to fly into germany for having acted in a play which incensed cardinal wolsey composed there and conveyed by means of the lady anne bullen to the perusal of king henry at the beginning of the said rupture simon fishs supplication of beggars   o       and how the copies thereof were strewed about at the kings procession to westminster the first example as some think of that kind of appeal to the public how the cardinal was nettled thereat how he endeavored to stifle and secret the same how it provoked the pen of the bigoted lord chancellor sir tho mores supplication of souls  how glaringly it was fixed in the very front of prohibited books and yet how it captivated the said kings esteem and affection may be not only presumed from the purport but gathered from the accounts which our ecclesiastical historians have given thereof see foxs martyr burnets reformat vol    it would be endless to specify how much this province was thenceforward cultivated by prelates statesmen and authors of the first rank not excepting majesty itself in the several examples which might be produced of the said king henry viii king james and king charles and not to mention others of our princes less noted though not less truly authors in this class the middlemost of those here named thought so honorably of these pamphletperformances that he deemed one of his own writing so much above all human patronage as to make a formal dedication or inscription thereof as i remember to jesus christ himself k james against conr vorstius   to       yet are many of the said labors of those royal pamphleteers and others by some of the most renowned scholars among us no less equally difficult to retrieve with the meanest and most illiterate whatever had phoenix britannicus been alive a century past or half a one sooner we might have had a better knowledge of that vast number of pamphlets which montaigne mentions essaye sur la defense de seneque et de plutarque  and whereof he intimates many to have been so ingeniously written on the aforesaid controversy of the reformation than it is now possible we shall ever arrive at even the names of  but as england through its spirit of liberty has been the most fruitful country for the production of pamphlets so the period which has been most fruitful in them was that of our civil wars in the reign of king charles the first and indeed in all disorders or commotions it is natural to have recourse to the most expeditious intelligence and redress lest the delay should be more dangerous than the deficiency of them or they superannuated before they are born for while some persons are laboring in the paroxysms of contention were others to be pondering longwinded expedients of accommodation and prescribe a volume for a recipe the dose would come too late for the disease and the very preparation thereof disable its efficacy therefore are pamphlets and such short tracts risest in great revolutions which though looked upon by some but as paper lanterns set a flying to be gaped at by the multitude in illuminating whom they have not always escaped the flames themselves yet are they beheld by politic or penetrating eyes as the thermometers of state foreshewing the temperature and changes of government with the calentures approaching therein and even preservatives to be had against them would the active be as unanimous to prevent as the speculative have been industrious to prognosticate the same though there may not remain as eminent proofs among the pamphleteers in the aforesaid anarchy of an ambition to unanimity as there are to dissension for surely no nation has ever given more conspicuous instances to what immeasurable lengths animosity and indignation will advance upon the least imposition or even umbrage of tyrannical or arbitrary power as might be exemplified among many others in the restless john lilburn and the endless william prynne who had both been bleeding witnesses thereof there are near a hundred pamphlets written by and concerning the first of these authors but the labors of the last being unparalled i may here not improperly observe that during the fortytwo years he was a writer he published above a hundred and sixty pamphlets besides several thick bound volumes in quarto and folio all said to be gathered into about forty tomes and extant in lincolns end library i think the printed catalogue of his writings extends not their whole number beyond one hundred sixtyeight different pieces but anthony wood to above one hundred and fourscore who also computes he must needs have composed at the rate of a sheet every day from the time that he came to mans estate athen oxon vol    that authors character of him is drawn from his avowed enemies even papists as cressy or personal antagonists as heylin etc  but i cannot well omit what one sprightly pamphleteer intimates among other things of him to this purpose that nature makes ever the dullest beasts most laborious and the greatest feeders that though he had read and swallowed much yet for want of rumination he concocted little that to return things unaltered was a symptom of a feeble stomach and as an error in the first concoction derives itself to the others and nourishing up a prevalescent humor begets at last a disease even so his judgment being once depraved turned all his reading into bilious or putrid humors which being perpetually increased by his insatiate gluttony of books did miserably foment and heighten his malady of writing a serious epist to mr w prynn  to      p    another of his draughtsmen has among other humourous touches as follows  this is the william whose passion is the conqueror  the error of whose judgment and unpardonable instability is to be imputed to the loss of his two biasses for if a bowls deviation from the jack is occasioned hereby much more a rational creatures a fortiori the character or earmark of mr w prynne   to      p    neither will i omit what the translator of the ingenious father bartolis huomo di lettere says in his praise where he calls

refutation of errors reformation of vice regulation of disorders restoration of parliaments and laws that i must in justice join you with the renowned general monk as the two worthiest subjects of all honor for if his generosity speaks him herculem anglorum your erudition proclaims you alcidem litterarum etc the learned man defended and reformed transt by t salusbury  vo    0 in epist to w prynne esquire   this particular notice of our most voluminous pamphleteer will lead us to a general review of the numerous produce of the press during that turbulent series aforesaid wherein he was such a fruitful instrument to impregnate the same and promote the licentious supersoetation thereof for by the grand collection of pamphlets which was made by tomlinson the bookseller memoirs for the curious  to   0  vol   p      from the latterend of the year    0 to the beginning of    0 it appears there were published in that space near thirty thousand several tracts and that these were not the complete issue of that period there is good presumption and i believe proofs in being notwithstanding it is enriched with near a hundred manuscripts which no body then being written on the side of the royalists would venture to put in print the whole however for it is yet undispersed is progressionally and uniformly bound in upwards of two thousand volumes of all sizes the catalogue which was taken by marmaduke foster the auctioneer consists of twelve volumes in folio memoirs for the curious  to   0  vol   p      wherein every piece has such a punctual register and reference that the smallest even of a single leaf may be readily repaired to thereby they were collected no doubt with great assiduity and expense and not preserved in those troublesome times without great danger and difficulty the books being often shifted from place to place out of the armys reach and so scarce were many of these tracts even at their first publication that king charles the first is reported to have given ten pounds for only reading one of them over which he could no where else procure at the owners house in st pauls churchyard ib  and yet this collection will perhaps not now produce the tenth and some think not the twentieth part of the four thousand pounds which he is said to have refused for it whatever is the reason that they may seem to be thus depreciated i presume not to distinguish perceiving so many reasons offering themselves to our choice for the same as whether it lies not in the way of the present possessor to make the best use or advantage of them whether abundance of extraneous volumes or more extended treatises published in that interstice upon subjects foreign to a collection of occasional pamphlets historical and political interfere not to make up the number particularly whether it is not surcharged with the canting divinity of those times which may be thought too crude lean and dull for the edification of these but more particularly whether those who would be purchasers having doubtless some knowledge of pamphlets the use which has been and what remains to be made by historical writers of them do not apprehend that so many copious collectors general and special who were contemporary with that important period have already sufficiently gleaned and displayed whatever is material among these more compendious assistances for so it is evident that mr rushworth the most voluminous of them all did most plentifully supply himself from these fountains how abundantly soever he represents the facts therein corrupted with fiction how fondly soever he seems to magnify his own sagacity in the distinguishment of one from the other and how suspiciously soever he discountenances all farther examination into them than that wherewith he has been pleased to present us where he expresses himself thus slightingly of these very authorities which have yet so liberally contributed to such of the massy tomes passing under his name whereof he was the real compiler posterity says he should know that some durst write the truth whilst other mens fancies were more busy than their hands forging relations building and battering castles in the air publishing speeches as spoken in parliament which were never spoken there printing declarations which were never passed relating battles which were never fought and victories which were never obtained dispersing letters which were never writ by the authors together with many such contrivances to abet a party or interest  pudet haec opprobria such practices and the experience i had thereof and the impossibility for any man in afterages to ground a true history by relying on the printed pamphlets of our days which passed the press while it was without control obliged me to all the pains and charge i have been at for many years together to make a great collection and whilst things were fresh in memory to separate truth from falsehood things real from things fictitious or imaginary whereof i shall not at all repent if i may but prove an ordinary instrument to undeceive those who come after us histor coll voll   in pref   otherwise excepting those more partial and precipitous products of this kind wherewith that age was so much glutted there never was a greater esteem or a better market never so many eager searchers after or extravagant purchasers of scarce pamphlets than in these present times as might be made evident either from the sales of them in general as that of tom britton the celebrated smallcoalman of clarkenwell who besides his chemical and musical collections had one of choice pamphlets which as i have heard he sold to the late lord summers for upwards of five hundred pounds and more especially that of mr anthony collins the last year whose library consisting chiefly of pamphlets and those mostly controversial mostly modern yet is reported to have been sold both parts of it for above eighteen hundred pounds encouragement sufficient to make the catalogues of other like auctions as expressive and distinct as these are or whether we descend into particulars and consider the exorbitant value set upon and profits which have been made out of some single pieces as the topographical pamphlets of john norden the surveyor which before they were reprinted often sold for forty shillings apiece and some of bales tracts as that of anne askew more especially the examination of sir john oldcastle which i have known to sell for three guineas though gleaned by fox into his book of martyrs the expedition of the duke of somerset into scotland also has been sold for four guineas though totally inserted in hollinshed these and some other personal narratives i could name are as notorious as the advancement of jordano brunos little book called spaccio della bestia triumfonte to near thirty pounds at the auction of mr bernards books serjeantsurgeon to her late majesty or of the uncastrated holinshead to near fortyfive pounds some years after though when the former came to be known in english it would sometimes pass off for so many pence and the deficiencies of the latter to be supplied out of auditor jetts library it would not always rise to so many shillings that is to say above its ordinary estimation plainly demonstrating that unreasonable value arose not from any rich mines of knowledge which the scarce part would communicate from nothing intrinsically curious or instructive in it nor even any material use to be made of it but merely from the empty property of its singularity and being as the contending purchasers fondly apprehended no where else recoverable  several other tracts besides those before specified i could mention which the retailers of them have prized at their weight in gold and for which more pounds have been exacted than probably they ever yielded pence at their first publication but i refrain being too particular lest i should too inadvertently give handles for extortion on one side or too distinctly expose this dotage of curiosity on the other nevertheless i may hereupon seasonably observe and the rather because i have had your lordships noble concurrence that this cacozealous curiosity it is which has of late been deemed so obstructive to the advancement of knowledge in a set of reputed literati who make no more use of the books they are beset with in their studies than eunuchs of the beauties which inviron them in the seraglio yet can never rest till they have gathered themselves libraries to doze in like children who will not be quiet without lights to sleep by but those who are thus diseased would do well to consider while they monopolize such collections as would extensively benefit the republic of letters and bury them in the narrow circuit of their own private and unconsequentional possession only because they have great fortunes which will empower them to do it how detrimental they may be to industrious and ingenious scholars of small ones who really want them for public and important uses while the mercenary salesmen making no distinction but a general rule of valuation from the particular payments of one prodigal purchaser is encouraged to part with nothing to any body else at the intrinsic or moderate value whereas if there were no extravagant buyers of books there would be no extortionate sellers of them and if due use were allowed to be made of all that are useful there would be no such shameful scarcity among them such collectors would therefore do well i say again to consider that curmudgeons among books are as discoverable as those among bags and that they may lose more honor and credit than gain wisdom or happiness by the fruitless amassment and imprisonment of either  the extraordinary price of pamphlets aforesaid would naturally excite our more deliberate enquiry into what has been most extraordinary in the contents of them but so multifarious are the subjects they comprehend that it cannot be expected i should even enumerate the same in the narrow limits of this epistolary address what do most attract the attention of mankind are those dreaded scourges of maladministration commonly though perhaps sometimes too indiscriminately bearing the contumelious denomination of libels it matters little whether it appears to me reasonable or not that such writings as duly expose villainy should themselves be held vile or that some persons who have been unjustly injurious by any other means may not be justly injured by this but it is obvious to all who know the disproportion of riches and power in the world that there are crimes not to be blasted and criminals not to be branded by any other means and since the lashes of reason will reach where those of justice cannot since truth will project defamation from the actions of oppressive rulers as uncontrouledly as the sun does shadows from opacous bodies the redress of the effect is to be sought for in the cause and we should apply the salve to the minds which received the provocation not empericlike seek to stanch them by binding up the weapons which returned it nay we read that the emperor charles v king francis i of france

probable they had any way personally exasperated naudaeana and patiniana  vo a paris   0  in patin p     some also in our own story might be named who have taken the like methods to assuage the effects of their discreditable conduct among whom are not wanting those who having penuriously made their plaster too scanty for the sore have rather multiplied than subtracted from their own disgrace and industriously exposed their folly by the imperfect concealment of their vice these had not the effectual tenderness for their own reputation it seems even of the turk and barbarian not that exquisite apprehension of this durable discipline which may visit the sins of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation as not the love so neither the fear of men of letters

and with regard to that most memorable usurper last mentioned thus was a celebrated writer of ours for immortalizing his name after his death when we fix any infamy on deceased persons it should not be done out of any hatred to the dead but out of love and charity to the living that the curses which only remain in mens thoughts and dare not come forth against tyrants because they are tyrants while they are so may at last be for ever settled and engraven upon their memory to deter all others from the like wickedness which else in the time of their foolish prosperity the flattery of their own hearts and of other mens tongues would not suffer them to perceive  the mischief of tyranny is too great even in the shortest time that it can continue it is endless and insupportable if the example be to reign too  if it were possible to cut tyrants out of all history and to extinguish their very names i am of opinion that it ought to be done but since they have left behind them too deep wounds to be ever closed up without a scar a least let us set such a mark upon their memory that men of the same wicked inclinations may be no less affrighted with their lasting ignominy than enticed

any corroboration i flatter myself the following reply of our late excellent queen mary ought not here to be forgotten when some of her courtiers would have incensed he against monsieur jurieu who in his answer to father maimburg that he might the better justify the reformation in scotland made a very black representation of their queen mary is it not a shame said one of the company that this man without any consideration for your royal person should dare to throw such infamous calumnie upon a queen from whom your royal highness is descended not at all replied thi ingenuous princess for is it not enough that by fulsom praises kings be lulled aslee all their lives but must flattery accompany them to their graves how shall the princes fear the judgment of posterity if historians were not allowed to speak trut after their death cox his hist of ireland   thus much for the topics and arguments arising from those examples and authorities which have occurred as most observable upon this sudden recollection to illustrate my present subject what remains to be said of pamphlets will more especially regard the present undertaking to make a select revival of them the approbation whereof may be grounded on these considerations  first the regard we owe to the preservation of good writings in general and to their separation from the bad but more in particular to these for if the reprinting of good old books is commendable much more is that of good old pamphlets they being not to mention the greater ease of the expense really more in want of such justice to remove that mean opinion which some unread therein have more indistinctly entertained of them all because many indeed are but meanly written though the proportion is not greater than in books and for those pamphlets which really are well written as abundance sufficient for any such undertaking have been by the ablest pens upon the most emergent points however they daily perish in the common wreck for want of a helping hand they cannot be denied a just claim to this care  secondly because they stand in greater need of such care than writings better secured by their bulk and bindings do many good old familybooks are descended to us whose backs and sides our careful grandsires buffd and bossd and boarded against the teeth of time or more devouring ignorance and whose leaves they guarded with brass nay silver clasps against the assaults of worm and weather but these defenseless conduits of advertisement are so much more obnoxious by reason of their nakedness and debility to all destructive casualties that it is more rare and difficult for want of a proper asylum to meet with some tracts which have not been printed ten years than with many books which are more than ten times their age  thirdly as being the liveliest pictures of their times pamphlets having this considerable advantage that springing usually from some immediate occasion they are copied more directly from the life so likelier to bear a resemblance than any more extended draughts taken by a remoter light but being therefore a kind of reading a la mode and the events their sources so suddenly giving way to every fresh current of affairs it is no wonder if these little maps of them are in like manner overborne and become as transient as they and yet whenever the political wheel rouls into any of its former tracks or present occurrences tally with those of past times doubtless what was then advanced for the public good might now be conducive thereto whereas the disorders of former times revive and the remedies which were prescribed against them are to seek many as well pleasant as profitable being lost merely for want of revival  fourthly the truest images of their authors for pamphlets running so often upon new particular and unprecedented subjects the writers have less opportunity to commit and their writings are less liable to admit such foul and frequent practices of plagiary as books of matter more various and bulk more voluminous too often exhibit besides the author being more vigorously prompted to application by the expediency of bringing forth his work opportunely is urged as has been elsewhere said upon another occasion essay on epistolary writings etc  vo m s  to strike out the images of his mind at a heat in the most natural form and symmetry in the most significant circumstances at once seldom allowing leisure for the writer to dote upon or dream over his work neither to disguise it with the conceptions of other men nor to deform it with chimeras of his own hence are they preferred by many critics to discover the genuine abilities of an author before his more dilatory and accumulated productions  these besides many other arguments which might be deduced from the commodious brevity the vast choice or variety of wellwritten pamphlets more particularly their regretted dispersion consumption and obscurity but above all the many surprising scenes to be unfolded and brought in view by select and public collections from the rich but disregarded store are in my opinion sufficient recommendations to the encouragement of such a revival what few attempts have hitherto been made seem either of a shortsighted nature or of one too unbounded thus edward husband circumscribes himself to the speeches and ordinances of parliament in a few years of k charles i as the collections in k charles ii and k williams reigns contain only some statetracts of those times and for john duntons collection it might have succeeded better had he not been for rambling into foreign or heavy and unaffecting subjects but the undertaking most likely to succeed is one wholly unconfined as to time and only confined to matter domestically applicable provided the undertaker chooses judiciously his materials and certainly the public might soon be obliged with a very valuable collection if in those particulars whereof the collectors own store should be deficient he were supplied by such possessors of these curiosities as have a relish for the project which may be farther rendered a convenient receptacle for the restoration of what is not only rare and remarkable but pertinent and seasonable  and such among others are the advantages promised us by the present phoenix which if it ever grows into a volume and is accommodated with a complete index i cannot help fancying we shall imagine ourselves led into new and untrodden paths into regions of neglected but notable intelligence which having lain long dormant and widely remote from ordinary observation will look like a sudden resurrection of characters and descriptions schemes and discoveries or rather a kind of recreation of them in the land of literature so that it may yield the best comment upon past times and become the grand expositor of many incidents which general historians are either wholly ignorant of or very superficially mention  thus my lord you have the free but undigested thoughts of one totally disinterested in the undertaking aforesaid and no otherwise concerned for the same than as a wellwisher to what i cannot but think may be of public utility and the juster title they may have to your favorable censure as being the immediate consequence of your commands i might indeed have farther enlarged on a theme so fruitful but in handling the subject of pamphlets it may not be discommendable to conform my self to their size for inter pygmaeos non pudet esse brevem more especially when i consider that i may have already trespassed farther upon your lordships patience than will admit of an apology from  your lordships etc w oldys  in page  line    read trionfante
