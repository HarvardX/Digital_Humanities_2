manufacture of paper   0 the two robbers     sixth evening the transmigrations of indur at the time when fairies and genii possessed the powers which they have now lost there lived in the country of the brachmans a man named indur who was distinguished not only for that gentleness of disposition and humanity toward all living creatures which are so much cultivated among those people but for an insatiable curiosity respecting the nature and way of life of all animals in pursuit of knowledge of this kind he would frequently spend the night among lonely rocks or in the midst of thick forests and there under shelter of a hanging cliff or mounted upon a high tree he would watch the motions and actions of all the animals that seek their prey in the night and remaining in the same spot till the break of day he would observe this tribe of creatures retiring to their dens and all others coming forth to enjoy the beams of the rising sun on these occasions if he saw any opportunity of exercising his benevolence toward animals in distress he never failed to make use of it and many times rescued the small birds from the pityless hawk and the lamb or kid from the gripe of the wolf and lynx one day as he was sitting on a tree in the forest a little frolicsome monkey in taking a great leap from one bough to another chanced to miss his hold and fell from a great height to the ground as he lay there unable to move indur espied a large venomous serpent advancing to make the poor defenseless creature his prey he immediately descended from his post and taking the little monkey in his arms ran with it to the tree and gently placed it upon a bough in the mean time the enraged serpent pursuing him overtook him before he could mount the tree and bit him in the leg presently the limb began to swell and the effects of the venom became visible over indurs whole frame he grew faint sick and pale and sinking on the ground was sensible that his last moments were fast approaching as thus he lay he was surprised to hear a human voice from the tree and looking up he beheld on the bough where he had placed the monkey a beautiful woman who thus addressed him   indur i am truly grieved that thy kindness to me should have been the cause of thy destruction know that in the form of the poor monkey it was the potent fairy perezinda to whom thou gave succor obliged to pass a certain number of days every year under the shape of an animal i had chosen this form and though not mortal i should have suffered extreme agonies from the bite of the serpent had thou not so humanely assisted me it is not in my power to prevent the fatal effect of the poison but i am able to grant thee any wish thou shall form respecting the future state of existence to which thou art now hastening speak then before it be too late and let me show my gratitude  great perezinda replied indur since you deign so bounteously to return my service this is the request that i make in all my transmigrations may i retain a rational soul with the memory of the adventures i have gone through and when death sets me free from one body may i instantly animate another in the prime of its powers and faculties without passing through the helpless state of infancy  it is granted answered the fairy and immediately breaking a small branch from the tree and breathing on it she threw it down to indur and bid him hold it fast in his hand he did so and presently expired  instantly he found himself in a green valley by the side of a clear stream grazing amid a herd of antelopes he admired his elegant shape sleek spotted skin and polished spiral horns and drank with delight of the cool rivulet cropped the juicy herb and sported with his companions soon an alarm was given of the approach of an enemy and they all set off with the swisness of the wind to the neighboring immense plains where they were soon out of the reach of injury indur was highly delighted with the ease and rapidity of his motions and snuffing the keen air of the desert bounded away scarcely deigning to touch the ground with his feet this way of life went on very pleasantly for some time till at length the herd was one morning alarmed with noises of trumpets drums and loud shouts on every side they started and ran first to the right then to the left but were continually driven back by the surrounding crowd which now appeared to be a whole army of hunters with the king of the country and all his nobles assembled on a solemn chase after the manner of the eastern people and now the circle began to close and numbers of affrighted animals of various kinds thronged together in the center keeping as far as possible from the dangers that approached them from all quarters the huntsmen were now come near enough to reach their game with their arrows and the prince and his lords shot at them as they passed and repassed killing and wounding great numbers indur and his surviving companions seeing no other means of escape resolved to make a bold push toward that part of the ring which was the most weakly guarded and though many perished in the attempt yet a few leaping over the heads of the people got clear away and indur was among the number but whilst he was scouring over the plain rejoicing in his good fortune and conduct an enemy swifter than himself overtook him this was a falcon who let loose by one of the huntsmen dashed like lightning after the fugitives and alighting upon the head of indur began to tear his eyes with his beak and flap his wings over his face indur terrified and blinded knew not which way he went and instead of proceeding straight forwards turned round and came again toward the hunters one of these riding full speed with a javelin in his hand came up to him and ran the weapon in his side he fell down and with repeated wounds was soon dispatched  when the struggle of death was over indur was equally surprised and pleased on finding himself soaring high in the air as one of a flight of wildgeese in their annual migration to breed in the arctic regions with vast delight he sprung forward on easy wing through the immense fields of air and surveyed beneath him extensive tracts of earth perpetually varying with plains mountains rivers lakes and woods at the approach of night the flock lighted on the ground and fed on the green corn or grass and at daybreak they were again on wing arranged in a regular wedgelike body with an experienced leader at their head thus for many days they continued their journey passing over countries inhabited by various nations till at length they arrived in the remotest part of lapland and settled in a wide marshy lake filled with numerous reedy islands and surrounded on all sides with dark forests of pine and birch here in perfect security from man and hurtful animals they followed the great business of breeding and providing for their young living plentifully upon the insects and aquatic reptiles that abounded in this sheltered spot indur with great pleasure exercised his various powers of swimming diving and flying sailing round the islands penetrating into every creek and bay and visiting the deepest recesses of the woods he surveyed with astonishment the sun instead of rising and setting making a complete circle in the heavens and cheering the earth with a perpetual day here he met with innumerable tribes of kindred birds varying in size plumage and voice but all passing their time in a similar manner and furnished with the same powers for providing food and a safe retreat for themselves and their young the whole lake was covered with parties fishing or sporting and resounded with their loud cries while the islands were filled with their nests and new broods of young were continually coming forth and launching upon the surface of the waters one day indurs curiosity having led him at a distance from his companions to the woody border of the lake he was near paying dear for his heedlessness for a fox that lay in wait among the bushes sprung upon him and it was with the utmost difficulty that by a strong exertion he broke from his hold not without the loss of some feathers  summer now drawing to an end the vast congregation of waterfowl began to break up and large bodies of them daily took their way southwards to pass the winter in climates where the waters are never so frozen as to become uninhabitable by the feathered race the wildgeese to whom indur belonged proceeded with their young ones by long daily journies across sweden the baltic sea poland and turkey to lesser asia and finished their journey at the celebrated plains on the banks of the cayster a noted resort for their species ever since the age of homer who in some very beautiful verses has described the manners and actions of the various tribes of aquatic birds in that favorite spot not less their number than the embodied cranes or milkwhite swans on asias watery plains that over the windings of caysters springs stretch their long necks and clap their rustling wings now tower aloft and course in airy rounds now light with noise with noise the field resounds popes homer  here they soon recruited from the fatigue of their march and enjoyed themselves in the delicious climate till winter this season though here extremely mild yet making the means of sustenance somewhat scarce they were obliged to make foraging excursions to the cultivated lands in the neighborhood having committed great depredations upon a fine field of young wheat the owner spread a net on the ground in which indur with several of his companions had the misfortune to be caught no mercy was shown them but as they were taken out one by one their necks were all broken  indur was not immediately sensible of the next change he underwent which was into a dormouse fast asleep in his hole at the foot of a bush as it was in a country where the winters are pretty severe he did not wake for some weeks when a thaw having taken place and the sun beginning to warm the earth he unrolled himself one day stretched opened his eyes and not being able to make out where he was he roused a female companion whom he found by his side when she was sufficiently awakened and they both began to feel hungry she led the way to a magazine of nuts and acorns where they made a comfortable meal and soon fell asleep again this nap having lasted a few days they awaked a second time and having eaten they ventured to crawl to the mouth of their hole where pulling away some withered grass and leaves they peeped out into the open air after taking a turn or two in the sun they grew chill and went down again stopping up the entrance after them the cold weather returning they took another long nap till at length spring being fairly set in they roused in earnest and began to make daily excursions abroad their winter stock of provision being now exhausted they were for some time reduced to great straits and obliged to dig for roots and pignuts their fare was mended as the season advanced and they made a nest near the bottom of a tree where they brought up a young family they never ranged far from home nor ascended the higher branches of the tree and passed great part of their time in sleep even during the midst of summer when autumn came they were busily employed in collecting the nuts acorns and other dry fruits that fell from the trees and laying them up in their storehouse under ground one day as indur was closely engaged in this occupation at some distance from his dwelling he was seized by a wild cat who after tormenting him for a time gave him a gripe and put him out of his pain  from one of the smallest and most defenseless of animals indur found himself instantly changed into a majestic elephant in a lofty forest of the isle of ceylon elated with this wonderful advancement in the scale of creation he stalked along with conscious dignity and surveyed with pleasing wonder his own form and that of his companions together with the rich scenery of the eververdant woods which perfumed the air with their spicy odor and lifted their tall heads to the clouds here fearing no injury and not desiring to do any the gigantic herd roamed at large feeding on the green branches which they tore down with their trunks bathing in deep rivers during the heat of the day and reposing in the depths of the forests reclined against the massy trunks of trees by night it was long before indur met with any adventure that could lead him to doubt his security but one day having penetrated into a close entangled thicket he espied lurking under the thick covert a grim tiger whose eyes flashed rage and fury though the tiger was one of the largest of his species yet his bulk was trifling compared to that of an elephant a single foot of which seemed sufficient to crush him yet the fierceness and cruelty of his looks his angry growl and grinning teeth struck some terror into indur there was little time however for reflection for when indur had advanced a single step the tiger setting up a roar sprung to meet him attempting to seize his lifted trunk indur was dexterous enough to receive him upon one of his tusks and exerting all his strength threw the tiger to a great distance he was somewhat stunned by the fall but recovering renewed the assault with redoubled fury indur again and a third time threw him off after which the tiger turning about bounded away into the midst of the thicket indur drew back and rejoined his companions with some abatement in the confidence he had placed in his size and strength which had not prevented him from undergoing so dangerous an attack  soon after he joined the rest of the herd in an expedition beyond the bounds of the forest to make depredations on some fields of maize they committed great havoc devouring part but tearing up and trampling down much more when the inhabitants taking the alarm assembled in great numbers and with fierce shouts and flaming brands drove them back to the woods not contented with this they were resolved to make them pay for the mischief they had done by taking some prisoners for this purpose they enclosed a large space among the trees with strong posts and stakes bringing it to a narrower and narrower compass and ending at last in a passage only capable of admiting one elephant at a time this was divided by strong crossbars which would lift up and down into several apartments they then sent out some tame female elephants bred to the business who approaching the herd of wild ones inveigled the males to follow them toward the enclosures indur was among the first who was decoyed by their artifices and with some others following heedlessly he got into the narrowest part of the enclosure opposite to the passage here they stood awhile doubting whether they should go further but the females leading the way and uttering the cry of invitation they ventured at length to follow when a sufficient number was in the passage the bars were let down by men placed for the purpose and the elephants were fairly caught in a trap as soon as they were sensible of their situation they sell into a fit of rage and with all their efforts endeavored to break through but the hunters throwing nooses over them bound them fast with strong ropes and chains to the posts on each side and thus kept them without food or sleep for three days when being exhausted with hunger and fatigue they gave signs of sufficient tameness they were now let out one by one and bound each of them to two large tame elephants with riders on their backs and thus without resistance were led away close prisoners they were then put into separate stables and by proper discipline were presently rendered quite tame and gentle  not long after indur with five more was sent over from ceylon to the continent of india and sold to one of the princes of the country he was now trained to all the services elephants are there employed in which were to carry persons on his back in a kind of sedan or litter to draw cannon ships and other great weights to kneel and rise at command make obeisance to his lord and perform all the motions and attitudes he was ordered thus he lived a long time well fed and caressed clothed in costly trappings on days of ceremony and contributing to the pomp of eastern royalty at length a war broke out and indur came to be employed in a different scene after proper training he was marched with a number of his fellows into the field bearing on his back a small wooden tower in which were placed some soldiers with a small fieldpiece they soon came in sight of the enemy and both sides were drawn up for battle indur and the rest were urged forwards by their leaders wondering at the same time at the scene in which they were engaged so contrary to their nature and manners presently all was involved in smoke and fire the elephants advancing soon put to flight those who were drawn up before them but their career was stopped by a battery of cannon which played furiously against them their vast bodies offered a fair mark to the balls which presently struck down some and wounded others indur received a shot on one of his tusks which broke it and put him to such pain and affright that turning about he ran with all speed over the plain and falling in with a body of their own infantry he burst through trampling down whole ranks and filling them with terror and confusion his leader having now lost all command over him and finding him hurtful only to his own party applied the sharp instrument he carried to the nape of his neck and driving it in with all his force pierced his spinal marrow so that he fell lifeless to the ground  in the next stage of his existence indur to his great surprise found even the vast bulk of the elephant prodigiously exceeded for he was now a whale of the largest species rolling in the midst of the arctic seas as he darted along the lash of his tail made whirlpools in the mighty deep when he opened his immense jaws he drew in a flood of brine which on rising to the surface he spouted out again in a rushing fountain that rose high in the air with the noise of a mighty cataract all the other inhabitants of the ocean seemed as nothing to him he swallowed almost without knowing it whole shoals of the smaller kinds and the larger swiftly turned aside at his approach now he cried to himself whatever other evils may await me i am certainly secure from the molestations of other animals for what is the creature that can dare to cope with me or measure his strength with mine having said this he saw swimming near him a fish not a quarter of his length armed with a dreadful row of teeth this was a grampus which directly flying upon indur fastened on him and made his great teeth meet in his flesh indur roared with pain and lashed the sea till it was all in a foam but could neither reach nor shake off his cruel foe he rolled over and over rose and sunk and exerted all his boasted strength but to no purpose at length the grampus quitted his hold and left him not a little mortified with the adventure this was however forgotten and indur received pleasure from his new situation as he roamed through the boundless fields of ocean now diving to its very bottom now shooting swiftly to the surface and sporting with his companions in unwieldy gambols having chosen a mate he took his course with her southwards and in due time brought up two young ones of whom he was extremely fond the summer season being arrived he more frequently than usual rose to the surface and basking in the sunbeams floated unmoved with a large part of his huge body above the waves as he was thus one day enjoying a profound sleep he was awakened by a sharp instrument penetrating deep into his back instantly he sprung away with the swiftness of lightning and feeling the weapon still sticking he dived into the recesses of the deep and staid there till want of air obliged him to ascend to the surface here another harpoon was plunged into him the smart of which again made him fly from his unseen foes but after a shorter course he was again compelled to rise much weakened by the loss of blood which gushing in a torrent tinged the waters as he passed another wound was inflicted which soon brought him almost lifeless to the surface and the line fastened to the first harpoon being now pulled in this enormous creature was brought an unresisting prey to the side of a ship where he was soon quite dispatched and then cut to pieces  the soul of this huge carcass had next a much narrower lodging for indur was changed into a be which with a great multitude of its young companions was on flight in search of a new settlement their parents having driven them out of the hive which was unable to contain them all after a rambling excursion the queen by whom all their motions were directed settled on the branch of a lofty tree they all immediately clustered round her and soon formed a large black bunch depending from the bough a man presently planting a ladder ascended with a beehive and swept them in after they were quietly settled in their new habitation they were placed on a stand in the garden along with some other colonies and left to begin their labors every fine morning as soon as the sun was up the greatest part of them sallied forth and roamed over the garden and the neighboring fields in search of fresh and fragrant flowers they first collected a quantity of gluey matter with which they lined all the inside of their house then they brought wax and began to make their cells building them with the utmost regularity though it was their first attempt and they had no teacher as fast as they were built some were filled with liquid honey gathered from the nectaries of flowers and as they filled the cells they sealed them up with a thin covering of wax in other cells the queen be deposited her eggs which were to supply a new progeny for the ensuing year nothing could be a more pleasing sight than to behold on a sunshiny day the insects continually going forth to their labor while others were as constantly arriving at the mouth of the hole either with yellow balls of wax under their thighs or full of the honey which they had drawn in with their trunks for the purpose of spouting it out into the cells of the honeycomb indur felt much delight in this useful and active way of life and was always one of the first abroad at the dawn and latest home in the evening on rainy and foggy days they staid at home and employed themselves in finishing their cells and all the necessary work within doors and indur though endued with human reason could not but admire the readiness with which he and the rest formed the most regular plans of work all corresponding in design and execution guided by instinct alone  the end of autumn now approaching the bees had filled their combs with honey and nothing more being to be got abroad they staid within doors passing most of their time in sleep they eat a little of their store but with great frugality and all their meals were made in public none daring to make free with the common stock by himself the owner of the hives now came and took them one by one into his hands that he might judge by the weight whether or no they were full of honey that in which indur was proved to be one of the heaviest and it was therefore resolved to take the contents for this purpose one cold night when the bees were all fast asleep the hive was placed over a hole in the ground in which were put brimstone matches set on fire the fumes rose into the hive and soon suffocated great part of the bees and stupefied the rest so that they all fell from the combs indur was amongst the dead  he soon revived in the form of a young rabbit in a spacious warren this was like a populous town being every where hollowed by burrows running deep under ground and each inhabited by one or more families in the evening the warren was covered with a vast number of rabbits old and young some feeding others frisking about and pursuing one another in wanton sport at the least alarm they all hurried into the holes nearest them and were in an instant safe from enemies who either could not follow them at all or if they did were foiled in the chase by the numerous ways and turnings in the earth communicating with each other so as to afford easy means of escape indur delighted much in this secure and social life and taking a mate was soon the father of a numerous offspring several of the little ones however not being sufficiently careful fell a prey either to hawks and crows continually hovering over the warren or to cats foxes and other wild quadrupeds who used every art to catch them at a distance from their holes indur himself ran several hazards he was once very near being caught by a little dog trained for the purpose who kept playing round for a considerable time not seeming to attend to the rabbits till having got near he all at once darted into the midst of them another time he received some shot from a sportsman who lay on the watch behind a hedge adjoining the warren  the number of rabbits here was so great that a hard winter coming on which killed most of the vegetables or buried them deep under the snow they were reduced to great straits and many were famished to death some turnips and hay however which were laid for them preserved the greater part the approach of spring renewed their sport and pleasure and indur was made the father of another family one night however was fatal to them all as they were sleeping they were alarmed by the attack of a ferret and running with great speed to the mouth of their burrow to escape it they were all caught in nets placed over the holes indur with the rest was dispatched by a blow on the back of the neck and his body was sent to the nearest market town  his next change was into a young mastiff brought up in a farm yard having nearly acquired his full size he was sent as a present to a gentleman in the neighborhood who wanted a faithful guard for his house and grounds indur presently attached himself to his master and all his family and showed every mark of a noble and generous nature though fierce as a lion whenever he thought the persons or properties of his friends invaded he was as gentle as a lamb at other times and would patiently suffer any kind of freedoms from those he loved he permitted the children of the house to lug him about ride on his back and use him as roughly as their little hands were capable of never even when hurt showing his displeasure further than by a low growl he was extremely indulgent to all the other animals of his species in the yard and when abroad would treat the impertinent barking of little dogs with silent contempt once indeed being provoked beyond bearing not only by the noise but by the snaps of a malicious whelp he suddenly seized him in his open mouth but when the bystanders thought that the poor cur was going instantly to be devoured they were equally diverted and pleased at seeing indur go to the side of a muddy ditch and drop his antagonist unhurt into the middle of it  he had however more serious conflicts frequently to sustain he was accustomed to attend the servant on market days to the neighboring town when it was his office to guard the provision cart while the man was making his purchases in the shops on these occasions the boldest dogs in the street would sometimes make an onset in a body and while some of them were engaging indur others would be mounting the cart and pulling down the meat baskets indur had much ado to defend himself and the baggage too however he never failed to make some of the assailants pay dearly for their impudence and by his loud barking he summoned his human fellow servants to his assistance in time to prevent their depredations  at length his courage was exerted on the most important service to which it could be applied his master returning home late one evening was attacked near his own house by three armed ruffians indur heard his voice calling for help and instantly flew to his relief he seized one of the villains by the throat brought him to the ground and presently disabled him the master in the mean time was keeping off the other two with a large stick but had received several wounds with a cutlass and one of the men had presented a pistol and was just on the point of firing at this moment indur leaving his vanquished foe on the ground rushed forward and seizing the mans arm made him drop the pistol the master took it up on which the other robber fled he now advanced to him with whom indur was engaged and fired the pistol at him the ball broke the mans arm and from thence entered the body of indur and mortally wounded him he fell but had the satisfaction of seeing his master remain lord of the field and the servants now coming up made prisoners of the two wounded robbers the master threw himself by the side of indur and expressed the warmest concern at the accident which had made him the cause of the death of the faithful animal that had preserved his life indur died licking his hand  so generous a nature was now no longer to be annexed to a brutal form indur awaking as it were from a trance found himself again in the happy region he had formerly inhabited and recommenced the innocent life of a brachman he cherished the memory of his transmigrations and handed them down to posterity in a relation from whence the preceding account has been extracted for the amusement of my young readers  seventh evening the native village a drama scene  a scattered village almost bidden with trees enter harford and beaumont harford there is the place this is the green on which i played many a day with my companions there are the tall trees that i have so often climbed for birds nests and that is the pond where i used to sail my walnutshell boats what a crowd of mixed sensations rush on my mind what pleasure and what regret yes there is somewhat in our native soil that affects the mind in a manner different from every other scene in nature   beaumont with you it must be merely the place for i think you can have no attachments of friendship or affection in it considering your long absence and the removal of all your family   harf no i have no family connexions and indeed can scarcely be said ever to have had any for as you know i was almost utterly neglected after the death of my father and mother and while all my elder brothers and sisters were dispersed to one part or another and the little remaining property was disposed of i was left with the poor people who nursed me to be brought up just as they thought proper and the little pension that was paid for me entirely ceased after a few years   beaum then how were you afterward supported   harf the honest couple who had the care of me continued to treat me with the greatest kindness and poor as they were not only maintained me as a child of their own but did all in their power to procure me advantages more suited to my birth than my deserted situation with the assistance of the worthy clergyman of the parish they put me to a dayschool in the village clothed me decently and being themselves sober religious persons took care to keep me from vice the obligations i am under to them will i hope never be effaced from my memory and it is on their account alone that i have undertaken this journey   beaum how long did you continue with them   harf till i was thirteen i then felt an irresistible desire to fight for my country and learning by accident that a distant relation of our family was a captain of a man of war i took leave of my worthy benefactors and set off to the seaport where he lay the good people furnishing me in the best manner they were able with necessaries for the journey i shall never forget the tenderness with which they parted with me it was if possible beyond that of the kindest parents you know my subsequent adventures from the time of my becoming a midshipman to my present state of first lieutenant in the britannia though it is now fifteen years since my departure i feel my affection for these good folks stronger than ever and could not be easy without taking the first opportunity of seeing them

left his winter quarters under ground and with a sober pace was crawling over a sunny bed and thrusting from his shell his pretty toadlike head just come from sea a swallow as to and fro he nimbly flew beat our old racer hollow at length he stopped direct in view and said acquaintance brisk and gay how have you fared this many a day thank you replied the close housekeeper since you and i last autumn parted i have been a precious sleeper and never stirred nor started but in my hole i lay as snug as fleas within a rug nor did i put my head abroad till all the snow and ice was thawed but i rejoined the bird who love cold weather just as well as you soon as the warning blasts i heard away i flew and mounting in the wind left gloomy winter far behind directed by the midday sun over sea and land my venurous course i steered nor was my distant journey done till africs verdant coast appeared there all the season long i chased gay butterflies and gnats and gave my negro friends a morning song and housed at night among the bats then at the call of spring i northward turned my wing and here again her joyous message bring lord what a deal of needless ranging returned the reptile grave for ever hurrying bustling changing as if it were your life to save why need you visit foreign nations rather like me and some of your relations take out a pleasant halfyears nap secure from trouble and mishap a pleasant nap indeed replied the swallow when i can neither see nor fly the bright example i may follow till then in truth not i i measure time by its employment and only value life for lifes enjoyment as good be buried all at once as doze out half ones days like you you stupid dunce the price of pleasure i think i will take a ride  said the little lord linger after breakfast  bring me my boots and let my horse be brought to the door  the horse was saddled and his lordships spurs were putting on  no  said he  i will have my low chair and the ponies and take a drive round the park  the horse was led back and the ponies were almost harnessed when his lordship sent his valet to countermand them he would walk into the corn field and see how the new pointer hunted  after all  says he  i think i will stay at home and play a game or two at billiards  he played half a game but could not make a stroke to please himself his tutor who was present now thought it a good opportunity to ask his lordship if he would read a little  why  i think  i will  for i am tired of doing nothing what shall we have  your lordship left off last time in one of the finest passages in the aeneid suppose we finish it  well  ay but  no  i had rather go on with humes history or  suppose we do some geography  with all my heart the globes are upon the study table  they went to the study and the little lord leaning upon his elbows looked at the globe  then twirled it round two or three times  and then listened patiently while the tutor explained some of its parts and uses but whilst he was in the midst of a problem come  said his lordship  now for a little virgil  the book was brought and the pupil with a good deal of help got through twenty lines  well  said he ringing the bell  i think we have done a good deal tom bring my bow and arrows  the fine londonmade bow in its green case and the quiver with all its appurtenances were brought and his lordship went down to the place where the shooting butts were erected he aimed a few shafts at the target but not coming near it he shot all the remainder at random and then ordered out his horse  he sauntered with a servant at his heels for a mile or two through the lanes and came just as the clock struck twelve to a villagegreen close by which a school was kept a door flew open and out burst a shoal of boys who spreading over the green with immoderate vociferation instantly began a variety of sports some fell to marbles  some to trapball  some to leapfrog in short not one of the whole crew but was eagerly employed every thing was noise motion and pleasure lord linger riding slowly up espied one of his tenants sons who had been formerly admitted as a playfellow of his and called him from the throng  jack  said he  how do you like school  o  pretty well my lord  what  have you a good deal of play  o no we have only from twelve to two for playing and eating our dinners and then an hour before supper  that is very little indeed  but we play heartily when we do play and work when we work good by my lord it is my turn to go in at trap  so saying jack ran off  i wish i was a schoolboy  cried the little lord to himself  the goose and horse a fable a goose who was plucking grass upon a common thought herself affronted by a horse who fed near her and in hissing accents thus addressed him i am certainly a more noble and perfect animal than you for the whole range and extent of your faculties is confined to one element i can walk upon the ground as well as you i have besides wings with which i can raise myself in the air and when i please i can sport in ponds and lakes and refresh myself in the cool waters i enjoy the different powers of a bird a fish and a quadruped  the horse snorting somewhat disdainfully replied it is true you inhabit three elements but you make no very distinguished figure in any one of them you fly indeed but your flight is so heavy and clumsy that you have no right to put yourself on a level with the lark or the swallow you can swim on the surface of the waters but you cannot live in them as fishes do you cannot find your food in that element nor glide smoothly along the bottom of the waves and when you walk or rather waddle upon the ground with your broad feet and your long neck stretched out hissing at every one who passes by you bring upon yourself the derision of all beholders i confess that i am only formed to move upon the ground but how graceful is my make how well turned my limbs how highly finished my whole body how great my strength how astonishing my speed i had far rather be confined to one element and be admired in that than be a goose in all  eighth evening the grass tribe tutor  george  harry harry pray what is that growing on the other side of the hedge   george why it is corn  dont you see it is in ear   h yes  but it seems too short for corn and the corn we just now passed is not in ear by a great deal   g then i dont know what it is pray sir will you tell us   tutor i dont wonder you were puzzled about it it is a sort of grass sown for hay and is called ryegrass   h but how happens it that it is so very like corn   t there is no great wonder in that for all corn is really a kind of grass and on the other hand if you were a liliputian every species of grass would appear to you amazing large corn   g then there is no difference between corn and grass but the size   t none at all   h but we eat corn and grass is not good to eat   t it is only the seeds of corn that we eat we leave the stalks and leaves for cows and horses now we might eat the seeds of grass if they were big enough to be worth gathering and some particular kinds are in fact eaten in certain countries   h but is wheat and barley really grass   t yes  they are species of that great family of plants which botanists call grasses and i will take this opportunity of telling you something about them go george and pull us up a root of that ryegrass harry and i will sit down on this style till you come to us   h here is grass enough all round us   t well then  pull up a few roots that you see in ear   g here is the grass   h and here is mine   t well  spread them all in a handkerchief before us now look at the roots of them all what do you call them   g i think they are what you have told us are fibrous roots   t right  they consist of a bundle of strings then look at their stalks  you will find them jointed and hollow like the straw of corn   h so they are   t the leaves you see of all the kinds are very long and narrow tapering to a point at their ends those of corn you know are the same   h yes  they are so like grass at first that i can never tell the difference   t next observe the ears or heads some of these you see are thick and close exactly like those of wheat or barley others are more loose and open like oats the first are generally called spikes the second panicles if you examine them closely you will find that they all consist of a number of distinct husky bodies which are properly the flowers each of which is succeeded by a single seed i dare say you have picked ears of wheat   h oh yes  i am very fond of them   t well then  you found that the grains all lay single contained in a scaly husk making a part of the ear or head before the seed was formed there was a flower in its place i do not mean a gay finecoloured flower but a few scales with threads coming out among them each crowned with a white tip and soon after the ears of corn appear you will find their flowers open and these white tips coming out of them this is the structure of the flowers and flowering heads of every one of the grass tribe   g but what are the beards of corn   t the beards are bristles or points running out from the ends of the husks they are properly called awns most of the grass tribe have something of these but they are much longer in some kinds than in others in barley you know they are very long and give the whole field a sort of downy or silky appearance especially when waved by the wind   h are there the same kinds of corn and grass in all countries   t no with respect to corn that is in all countries the product of cultivation and different sorts are found best to suit different climates thus in the northern parts of the temperate zone oats and rye are chiefly grown in the middle and southern barley and wheat wheat is universally the species preferred for breadcorn but there are various kinds of it differing from each other in size of grain firmness color and other qualities   h does not the best wheat of all grow in england   t by no means wheat is better suited to the warmer climates and it is only by great attention and upon particular soils that it is made to succeed well here on the other hand the torrid zone is too hot for wheat and our other grains and they chiefly cultivate rice there and indian corn   g i have seen heads of indian corn as thick as my wrist but they do not look at all like our corn   t yes  the seeds all grow single in a sort of chaffy head and the stalk and leaves resemble those of the grass tribe but of a gigantic size but there are other plants of this family which perhaps you have not thought of   g what are they   t canes and reeds  from the sugarcane and bamboo of the tropics to the common reed of our ditches of which you make arrows all these have the general character of the grasses   h i know that reeds have very fine feathery heads like the tops of grass   t they have so and the stalks are composed of many joints as are also those of the sugarcane and the bamboo of which fishing rods and walking sticks are often made some of these are very tall plants but the seeds of them are small in proportion and not useful for food but there is yet another kind of grasslike plants common among us   g what is that   t have you not observed in the marshes and on the sides of ditches a coarse broader leaved sort of grass with large darkcolored spikes this is sedge in latin carex and there are many sorts of it   h what is that good for   t it is eaten by cattle both fresh and dry but is inferior in quality to good grass   g what is it that makes one kind of grass better than another   t there are various properties which give value to grasses some spread more than others resist frost and drought better yield a greater crop of leaves and are therefore better for pasturage and hay the juices of some are more nourishing and sweeter than others in general however different grasses are suited to different soils and by improving soils the quality of the grass is improved   g does grass grow in all countries   t yes  the green turf which naturally covers fertile soil in all countries is chiefly composed of grasses of various kinds they form therefore the verdant carpet extended over the earth and humble as they are they contribute more to beauty and utility than any other part of the vegetable creation   h what  more than trees   t yes certainly a land entirely covered with trees would be gloomy unwholesome and scarcely inhabitable whereas the meadow the down and the corn field afford the most agreeable prospects to the eye and furnish every necessary and many of the luxuries of life give us corn and grass and what shall we want for food   h let me see  what should we have there is bread and flour for puddings   g ay and milk for you know cows live on grass and hay  so there is cheese and butter and all things that are made of milk   t and are there not all kinds of meat too and poultry and then for drink there is beer and ale which are made from barley for all these we are chiefly indebted to the grasses   g then i am sure we are very much obliged to the grasses   t well  let us now walk homewards some time hence you shall make a collection of all the kinds of grasses and learn to know them from each other   a tea lecture tutor  pupil tut come  the tea is ready lay by your book and let us talk a little you have assisted in teamaking a great many times and yet i dare say you never considered what kind of an operation it was   pup on operation of cookery  is it not   tut you may call it so but it is properly an operation of chemistry   pup of chemistry i thought that had been a very deep sort of a business   tut o  there are many things in common life that belong to the deepest of sciences making tea is the chemical operation called infusion which is when a hot liquor is poured upon a substance in order to extract something from it the water you see extracts from the tealeaves their color taste and flavor   pup would not cold water do the same   tut it would but more slowly heat assists almost all liquors in their power of extracting the virtues of herbs and other substances thus good housewives were formerly used to boil their tea in order to get all the goodness from it as completely as possible the greater heat and agitation of boiling makes it act more powerfully the liquor in which a substance has been boiled is called a decoction of that substance   pup then we had a decoction of mutton at dinner today   tut we had  broth is a decoction and so are gruel and barleywater but when any thing is put to steep in a cold liquor it is called maceration the ingredients of which ink is made are macerated in all these cases you see the whole substance does not mix with the liquor but only part of it the reason is that part of it is soluble in the liquor and part not   pup what is the meaning of that   tut solution is when a solid put into a fluid entirely disappears in it leaving the liquor clear thus when i throw this lump of sugar into my tea you see it gradually wastes away till it is all gone and then i can taste it in every single drop of my tea but the tea is clear as before   pup salt would do the same   tut it would but if i were to throw in a lump of chalk it would lie undissolved at the bottom   pup but it would make the water white   tut true while it was stirred and then it would be a diffusion but while the chalk was thus mixed with the liquor it would lose its transparency and not recover it again till by standing the chalk had all subsided and left the liquor as it was before   pup how is the cream mixed with the tea   tut why that is only diffused for it takes away the transparency of the tea but the particles of cream being finer and lighter than those of chalk it remains longer united with the liquor however in time the cream would separate too and rise to the top leaving the tea clear now suppose you had a mixture of sugar salt chalk and tea leaves and were to throw it into water either hot or cold  what would be the effect   pup the sugar and salt would melt and disappear the tealeaves would yield their color and taste the chalk  i do not know what would become of that   tut why if the mixture were stirred the chalk would be diffused through it and make it turbid or muddy but on standing it would leave it unchanged   pup then there would remain at bottom the chalk and tealeaves   tut yes the clear liquor would contain in solution salt sugar and those particles of the tea in which its color and taste consisted the remainder of the tea and the chalk would lie undissolved   pup then i suppose tealeaves after the tea is made are lighter than at first   tut undoubtedly if taken out and dried they would be found to have lost part of their weight and the water would have gained it sometimes however it is an extremely small portion of a substance which is soluble but it is that in which its most remarkable qualities reside thus a small piece of spice will communicate a strong flavor to a large quantity of liquid with very little loss of weight   pup will all liquors dissolve the same things   tut by no means many dissolve in water that will not in spirit of wine and the contrary and upon this difference many curious matters in the arts are founded thus spirit varnish is made of a solution of various gums or resins in spirits that will not dissolve in water therefore when it has been laid over any surface with a brush and is become dry the rain or moisture of the air will not affect it this is the case with the beautiful varnish laid upon coaches on the other hand the varnish lest by gumwater could not be washed off by spirits   pup i remember when i made gumwater upon setting the cup in a warm place it all dried away and left the gum just as it was before would the same happen if i had sugar or salt dissolved in water   tut yes  upon exposing the solution to warmth it would dry away and you would get back your salt or sugar in a solid state as before   pup but if i were to do so with a cup of tea what should i get   tut not tealeaves certainly but your question requires a little previous explanation it is the property of heat to make most things fly off in vapor which is called evaporation or exhalation but this it does in very different degrees to different substances some are very easily made to evaporate others very difficultly and others not at all by the most violent fire we can raise fluids in general are easily evaporable but not equally so spirits of wine fly off in vapor much sooner than water so that if you had a mixture of the two by applying a gentle heat you might drive off all the spirits and leave the water pure water again is more evaporable than oil some solid substances are much disposed to evaporate thus smelling salts by a little heat may be entirely driven away in the air but in general solids are more fixed than fluids and therefore when a solid is dissolved in a fluid it may commonly be recovered again by evaporation by this operation common salt is got from seawater and salt springs both artificially and in hot countries by the natural heat of the sun when the water is no more than is just sufficient to dissolve the salt it is called a saturated solution and on evaporating the water further the salt begins to separate forming little regular masses called crystals sugar may be made in like manner to form crystals and then it is sugarcandy   pup but what is a syrup   tut that is when so much sugar is dissolved as sensibly to thicken the liquor but not to separate from it well  now to your question about tea on exposing it to considerable heat those fine particles in which its flavor consists being as volatile or evaporable as the water would fly off along with it and when the liquor came to dryness there would only be left those particles in which its roughness and color consist this would make what is called an extract of a plant   pup what becomes of the water that evaporates   tut it ascends into the air and unites with it but if in its way it be stopped by any cold body it is condensed that is it returns to the state of water again lift up the lid of the teapot and you will see water collected on the inside of it which is condensed steam from the hot tea beneath hold a spoon or knife in the way of the steam which bursts out from the spout of the teakettle and you will find it immediately covered with drops this operation of turning a fluid into vapor and then condensing it is called distillation for this purpose the vessel in which the liquor is heated is closely covered with another called the head into which the steam rises and is condensed it is then drawn off by means of a pipe into another vessel called the receiver in this way all sweet scented and aromatic liquors are drawn from fragrant vegetables by means of water or spirits the fragrant part being very volatile rises along with the steam of the water or spirit and remains united with it after it is condensed rose water and spirit of lavender are liquors of this kind   pup then the water collected on the inside of the teapot lid should have the fragrance of the tea   tut it should  but unless the tea were fine you would scarcely perceive it   pup i think i have heard of making salt water fresh by distilling   tut yes that is an old discovery lately revived the salt in seawater being of a fixed nature does not rise with the steam and therefore on condensing the steam the water is found to be fresh and this indeed is the method nature employs in raising water by exhalation from the ocean which collecting into clouds is condensed in the cold regions of the air and falls down in rain  but our tea is done so we will now put an end to our chemical lecture   pup but is this real chemistry   tut yes it is   pup why i understand it all without any difficulty   tut i intended you should   the kidnappers mr b was accustomed to read in the evening to his young folks some select story and then ask them in turn what they thought of it from the reflections they made on these occasions he was enabled to form a judgment of their dispositions and was led to throw in remarks of his own by which their hearts and understandings might be improved one night he read the following narrative from churchills voyages  in some voyages of discovery made from denmark to greenland the sailors were instructed to seize some of the natives by force or stratagem and bring them away in consequence of these orders several greenlanders were kidnapped and brought to denmark though they were treated there with kindness the poor wretches were always melancholy and were observed frequently to turn their faces toward the north and sigh bitterly they made several attempts to escape by putting out to sea in their little canoes which had been brought with them one of them had got as far as thirty leagues from land before he was overtaken it was remarked that this poor man whenever he met a woman with a child in her arms used to utter a deep sigh whence it was conjectured that he had left a wife and child behind him they all pined away one after another and died miserably  now edward said he what is your opinion of this story  edward poor creatures i think it was very barbarous to take them from home   mr b it was indeed   ed have civilized nations any right to behave so to savages   mr b i think you may readily answer that question yourself suppose you were a savage  what would be your opinion   ed i dare say i should think it very wrong but can savages think about right and wrong as we do   mr b why not are they not men   ed yes  but not like civilized men sure   mr b i know no important difference between ourselves and those people we are pleased to call savage but in the degree of knowledge and virtue possessed by each and i believe many individuals among the greenlanders as well as other unpolished people exceed in these respects many among us in the present case i am sure the danish sailors showed themselves the greater savages   ed but what did they take away the greenlanders for   mr b the pretense was that they might be brought to be instructed in a christian country and then sent back to civilize their countrymen   ed and was not that a good thing   mr b certainly  if it were done by proper means but to attempt it by an act of violence and injustice could not be right for they could teach them nothing so good as their example was bad and the poor people were not likely to learn willingly from those who had begun with injuring them so cruelly   ed i remember capt cook brought over somebody from otaheite and poor lee boo was brought here from the pelew islands but i believe they both came of their own accord   mr b they did and it is a great proof of the better way of thinking of modern voyagers than of former ones that they do not consider it as justifiable to use violence even for the supposed benefit of the people they visit   ed i have read of taking possession of a newly discovered country by setting up the kings standard or some such ceremony though it was full of inhabitants   mr b such was formerly the custom and a more impudent mockery of all right and justice cannot be conceived yet this i am sorry to say is the title by which european nations claim the greatest part of their foreign settlements   ed and might not the natives drive them out again if they were able   mr b i am sure i do not know why they might not for force can never give right  now harry tell me what you think of the story   harry i think it very strange that people should want to go back to such a cold dismal place as greenland   mr b why what country do you love best in all the world   h england to be sure   mr b but england is by no means the warmest and finest country here are no grapes growing in the fields nor oranges in the woods and hedges as there are in more southern climates   h i should like them very well to be sure  but then england is my own native country where you and mamma and all my friends live besides it is a very pleasant country too   mr b as to your first reason you must be sensible that the greenlander can say just the same and the poor fellow who left a wife and children behind must have had the strongest of all ties to make him wish to return do you think i should be easy to be separated from all of you   h no  and i am sure we should not be easy neither   mr b home my dear wherever it be is the spot toward which a good heart is the most strongly drawn then as for the pleasantness of a place that all depends upon habit the greenlander being accustomed to the way of living and all the objects of his own country could not relish any other so well he loved whalefat and seal as well as you can do pudding and beef he thought rowing his little boat amid the boisterous waves finer diversion than driving a plough or a cart he fenced against the winters cold by warm clothing and the long night of many weeks which you would think so gloomy was to him a season of ease and festivity in his habitation under ground it is a very kind and wise dispensation of providence that every part of the world is rendered the most agreeable to those who live in it  now little mary what have you to say   mary i have only to say that if they were to offer to carry me away from home i would scratch their eyes out   mr b well said my girl stand up for yourself let nobody run away with you  against your will   mary that i will not   ninth evening the farmyard journal dear tom since we parted at the breakingup i have been for most of the time at a pleasant farm in hertfordshire where i have employed myself in rambling about the country and assisting as well as i could in the work going on at home and in the fields on wet days and in the evenings i have amused myself with keeping a journal of all the great events that have happened among us and hoping that when you are tired of the bustle of your busy town you may receive some entertainment from comparing our transactions with yours i have copied out for your perusal one of the days in my memorandumbook  pray let me know in return what you are doing and believe me  your very affectionate friend richard markwell hazlefarm journal june  0th last night we had a dreadful alarm a violent scream was heard from the henroost the geese all set up a cackle and the dogs barked ned the boy who lies over the stable jumped up and ran into the yard when he observed a fox gallopping away with a chicken in his mouth and the dogs in full chase after him they could not overtake him and soon returned upon further examination the large white cock was found lying on the ground all bloody with his comb torn almost off and his feathers all ruffled and the speckled hen and three chickens lay dead beside him the cock recovered but appeared terribly frightened it seems that the fox had jumped over the garden hedge and then crossing part of the yard behind the straw had crept into the henroost through a broken pale john the carpenter was sent for to make all fast and prevent the like mischief again  early this morning the brindled cow was delivered of a fine bullcalf both are likely to do well the calf is to be fattened for the butcher  the duckeggs that were sitten upon by the old balck hen were hatched this day and the ducklings all directly ran into the pond to the great terror of the hen who went round and round clucking with all her might in order to call them out but they did not regard her an old drake took the little ones under his care and they swam about very merrily  as dolly this morning was milking the new cow that was bought at the fair she kicked with her hindlegs and threw down the milkpail at the same time knocking dolly off her stool into the dirt for this offense the cow was sentenced to have her head fastened to the rack and her legs tied together  a kite was observed to hover a long while over the yard with an intention of carrying off some of the young chickens but the hens called their broods together under their wings and the cocks put themselves in order of battle so that the kite was disappointed at length one chicken not minding its mother but straggling heedlessly to a distance was descried by the kite who made a sudden swoop and seized it in his talons  the chicken cried out and the cocks and hens all screamed when ralph the farmers son who saw the attack snatched up a loaded gun and just as the kite was flying off with his prey fired and brought him dead to the ground along with the poor chicken who was killed in the fall the dead body of the kite was nailed up against the wall by way of warning to his wicked comrades  in the forenoon we were alarmed with strange noises approaching us and looking out we saw a number of people with frying pans warming pans tongs and pokers beating ringing and making all possible din we soon discovered them to be our neighbors of the next farm in pursuit of a swarm of bees which was hovering in the air over their heads the bees at length alighted on the tall pear tree in our orchard and hung in a bunch from one of the boughs a ladder was got and a man ascending with gloves on his hands and an apron tied over his head swept them into a hive which was rubbed on the inside with honey and sweet herbs but as he was descending some bees which had got under his gloves stung him in such a manner that he hastily threw down the hive upon which the greater part of the bees fell out and began in a rage to fly among the crowd and sting all whom they lit upon away scampered the people the women shrieking the children roaring and poor adam who had held the hive was assailed so furiously that he was obliged to throw himself on the ground and creep under the gooseberry bushes at length the bees began to return to the hive in which the queen be had remained and after a while all being quietly settled a cloth was thrown over it and the swarm was carried home  about noon three pigs broke into the garden where they were rioting upon the carrots and turnips and doing a great deal of mischief by trampling the beds and rooting up the plants with their snouts when they were spied by old towzer the mastiff who ran among them and laying hold of their long ears with his teeth made them squeel most dismally and get out of the garden as fast as they could  roger the plowman when he came for his dinner brought word that he had discovered a partridges nest with sixteen eggs in the home field upon which the farmer went out and broke them all saying that he did not choose to rear birds upon his corn which he was not allowed to catch but must leave to some qualified sportsman who would besides break down his fences in the pursuit  a sheepwashing was held this day at the millpool when seven score were well washed and then penned in the high meadow to dry many of them made great resistance at being thrown into the water and the old ram being dragged to the brink by a boy at each horn and a third pushing behind by a sudden spring threw two of them into the water to the great diversion of the spectators  toward the dusk of the evening the squires mongrel greyhound which had been long suspected of worrying sheep was caught in the fact he had killed two lambs and was making a hearty meal upon one of them when he was disturbed by the approach of the shepherds boy and directly leaped the hedge and made off the dead bodies were taken to the squires with an indictment of wilful murder against the dog but when they came to look for the culprit he was not to be found in any part of the premises and is supposed to have fled his country through consciousness of his heinous offense  joseph who sleeps in the garret at the old end of the house after having been some time in bed came down stairs in his shirt as pale as ashes and frightened the maids who were going up it was some time before he could tell what was the matter at length he said he had heard some dreadful noises over head which he was sure must be made by some ghost or evil spirit nay he thought he had seen something moving though he owned he durst hardly lift up his eyes he concluded with declaring that he would rather sit up all night in the kitchen than go to his room again the maids were almost as much alarmed as he and did not know what to do but the master overhearing their talk came out and insisted upon their accompanying him to the spot in order to search into the affair they all went into the garret and for a while heard nothing when the master ordered the candle to be taken away and every one to keep quite still joseph and the maids stuck close to each other and trembled every limb at length a kind of groaning or snoring began to be heard which grew louder and louder with intervals of a strange sort of hissing that is it whispered joseph drawing back toward the door  the maids were ready to sink and even the farmer himself was a little disconcerted the noise seemed to come from the rafters near the thatch in a while a glimpse of moonlight shining through a hole at the place plainly discovered the shadow of something stiring and on looking intently somewhat like feathers was perceived the farmer now began to suspect what the case was and ordering up a short ladder bid joseph climb to the spot and thrust his hand into the hole this he did rather unwillingly and soon drew it back crying loudly that he was bit however gathering courage he put it in again and pulled out a large white owl another at the same time being heard to fly away the cause of the alarm was now made clear enough and poor joseph after being heartily jeered by the maids though they had been as much frightened as he sneaked into bed again and the house soon became quiet  on manufactures father  henry hen my dear father you observed the other day that we had a great many manufactures in england pray what is a manufacture   fa a manufacture is something made by the hand of man it is derived from two latin words manus the hand and facere to make manufactures are therefore opposed to productions which latter are what the bounty of nature spontaneously affords us as fruits corn marble   hen but there is a great deal of trouble with corn you have often made me take notice how much pains it costs the farmer to plough his ground and put the seed in the earth and keep it clear from weeds   fa very true but the farmer does not make the corn he only prepares for it a proper soil and situation and removes every hindrance arising from the hardness of the ground or the neighborhood of other plants which might obstruct the secret and wonderful process of vegetation but with the vegetation itself he has nothing to do it is not his hand that draws out the slender fibers of the root pushes up the green stalk and by degrees the spiky ear swells the grain and embrowns it with that rich tinge of tawny russet which informs the husbandman it is time to put in his sickle all this operation is performed without his care or even knowledge   hen now then i understand corn is a production and bread a manufacture   fa bread is certainly in strictness of speech a manufacture but we do not in general apply the term to any thing in which the original material is so little changed if we wanted to speak of bread philosophically we should say it is a preparation of corn   hen is sugar a manufacture   fa no for the same reason besides which i do not recollect the term being applied to any article of food i suppose from an idea that food is of too perishable a nature and generally obtained by a process too simple to deserve the name we say therefore sugarworks oilmills chocolateworks we do not say a beermanufactory but a brewery but this is only a nicety of language for properly all those are manufactories if there is much of art and curiosity in the process   hen do we say a manufactory of pictures   fa no but for a different reason a picture especially if it belong to any of the higher kinds of painting is an effort of genius a picture cannot be produced by any given combinations of canvas and color it is the hand indeed that executes but the head that works sir joshua reynolds could not have gone when he was engaged to paint a picture and hired workmen the one to draw the eyes another the nose a third the mouth the whole must be the painters own that particular painters and no other and no one who has not his ideas can do his work his work is therefore nobler of a higher species   hen pray give me an instance of a manufacture   fa the making of watches is a manufacture the silver iron gold or whatever else is used in it are productions the material of the work but it is by the wonderful art of man that they are wrought into the numberless wheels and springs of which this complicated machine is composed   hen then is there not as much art in making a watch as a picture does not the head work   fa certainly in the original invention of watches as much or more than in painting but when once invented the art of watchmaking is capable of being reduced to a mere mechanical labor which may be exercised by any man of common capacity according to certain precise rules when made familiar to him by practice this painting is not   hen but my dear father making of books surely requires a great deal of thinking and study and yet i remember the other day at dinner a gentleman said that mr pica had manufactured a large volume in less than a fortnight   fa it was meant to convey a satirical remark on his book because it was compiled from other authors from whom he had taken a page in one place and a page in another so that it was not produced by the labor of his brain but of his hands thus you heard your mother complain that the london cream was manufactured which was a pointed and concise way of saying that the cream was not what it ought to be nor what it pretended to be for cream when genuine is a pure production but when mixed up and adulterated with flour and isinglass and i know not what it becomes a manufacture it was as much as to say art has been here where it has no business where it is not beneficial but hurtful a great deal of the delicacy of language depends upon an accurate knowledge of the specific meaning of single terms and a nice attention to their relative propriety   hen have all nations manufactures   fa all that are in any degree cultivated but it very often happens that countries naturally the poorest have manufactures of the greatest extent and variety   hen why so   fa for the same reason i apprehend that individuals who are rich without any labor of their own are seldom so industrious and active as those who depend upon their own exertions thus the spaniards who possess the richest gold and silver mines in the world are in want of many conveniences of life which are enjoyed in london and amsterdam   hen i can comprehend that i believe if my uncle ledger were to find a gold mine under his warehouse he would soon shut up shop   fa i believe so it is not however easy to establish manufactures in a very poor nation they require science and genius for their invention art and contrivance for their execution order peace and union for their flourishing they require a number of men to combine together in an undertaking and to prosecute it with the most patient industry they require therefore laws and government for their protection if you see extensive manufactures in any nation you may be sure it is a civilized nation you may be sure property is accurately ascertained and protected they require great expenses for their first establishment costly machines for shortening manual labor and money and credit for purchasing materials from distant countries there is not a single manufacture of great britain which does not require in some part or other of its process productions from the different parts of the globe oils drugs varnish quicksilver and the like it requires therefore ships and a friendly intercourse with foreign nations to transport commodities and exchange productions we could not be a manufacturing unless we were also a commercial nation they require time to take root in any place and their excellence often depends upon some nice and delicate circumstance a peculiar quality for instance in the air or water or some other local circumstance not easily ascertained thus i have heard that the irish women spin better than the english because the moister temperature of their climate makes their skin more soft and their fingers more flexible thus again we cannot dye so beautiful a scarlet as the french can though with the same drugs perhaps on account of the superior purity of their air but though so much is necessary for the perfection of the more curious and complicated manufactures all nations possess those which are subservient to the common conveniences of life  the loom and the forge particularly are of the highest antiquity   hen yes i remember hector bids andromache return to her apartment and employ herself in weaving with her maids and i remember the shield of achilles   fa true and you likewise remember in an earlier period the fine linen of egypt and to go still higher the working in brass and iron is recorded of tubal cain before the flood   hen which is the most important manufactures or agriculture   fa agriculture is the most necessary because it is first of all necessary that man should live but almost all the enjoyments and comforts of life are produced by manufactures   hen why are we obliged to take so much pains to make ourselves comfortable   fa to exercise our industry nature provides the materials for man she pours out at his feet a profusion of gems metals dies plants ores barks stones gums wax marbles woods roots skins earths and minerals of all kinds she has likewise given him tools   hen i did not know that nature gave us tool   fa no what are those two instruments you carry always about with you so strong and yet so flexible so nicely jointed and branched out into five long taper unequal divisions any of which may be contracted or stretched out at pleasure the extremities of which have a feeling so wonderfully delicate and which are strengthened and defended by horn   hen the hands   fa yes man is as much superior to the brutes in his outward form by means of the hand as he is in his mind by the gifts of reason the trunk of the elephant comes perhaps the nearest to it in its exquisite feeling and flexibility it is indeed called his hand in latin and accordingly that animal has always been reckoned the wisest of brutes when nature gave man the hand she said to him exercise your ingenuity and work as soon as ever man rises above the state of a savage he begins to contrive and to make things in order to improve his forlorn condition thus you may remember thomson represents industry coming to the poor shivering wretch and teaching him the arts of life taught him to chip the wood and hew the stone till by degrees the finished fabric rose tore from his limbs the bloodpolluted fur and wrapped them in the woolly vestment warm or bright in glossy silk and flowing lawn    hen it must require a great deal of knowledge i suppose for so many curious works what kind of knowledge is most necessary   fa there is not any which may not be occasionally employed but the two sciences which most assist the manufacturer are mechanics and chemistry the one for building mills working of mines and in general for constructing wheels wedges pullies etc either to shorten the labor of man by performing it in less time or to perform what the strength of man alone could not accomplish  the other in fusing and working ores in dying and bleaching and extracting the virtues of various substances for particular uses making of soap for instance is a chemical operation and by chemistry an ingenious gentleman has lately found out a way of bleaching a piece of cloth in eight and forty hours which by the common process would have taken up a great many weeks  you have heard of sir richard arkwright who died lately    hen yes i have heard he was at first only a barber and shaved people for a penny apiece   fa he did so but having a strong turn for mechanics he invented or at least perfected a machine by which one pair of hands may do the work of twenty or thirty and as in this country every one is free to rise by merit he acquired the largest fortune in the county had a great many hundreds of workmen under his orders and had leave given him by the king to put sir before his name   hen did that do him any good   fa it pleased him i suppose or he would not have accepted of it and you will allow i imagine that if titles are used it does honor to those who bestow them that they are given to such as have made themselves noticed for something useful  arkwright used to say that if he had time to perfect his inventions he would put a fleece of wool into a box and it should come out broad cloth   hen what did he mean by that was there any fairy in the box to turn it into broad cloth with her wand   fa he was assisted by the only fairies that ever had the power of transformation art and industry he meant that he would contrive so many machines wheel within wheel that the combing carding and other various operations should be performed by mechanism almost without the hand of man   hen i think if i had not been told i should never have been able to guess that my coat came off the back of the sheep   fa you hardly would but there are manufactures in which the material is much more changed than in woollen cloth what can be meaner in appearance than sand and ashes would you imagine any thing beautiful could be made out of such a mixture yet the furnace transforms this into that transparent crystal we call glass than which nothing is more sparkling more brilliant more full of luster it throws about the rays of light as if it had life and motion   hen there is a glassshop in london which always puts me in mind of aladdins palace   fa it is certain that if a person ignorant of the manufacture were to see one of our capital shops he would think all the treasures of golconda were centered there and that every drop of cut glass was worth a princes ransom  again who would suppose on seeing the green stalks of a plant that it could be formed into a texture so smooth so snowywhite so firm and yet so flexible as to wrap round the limbs and adapt itself to every movement of the body who would guess this fibrous stalk could be made to float in such light undulating folds as in our lawns and cambrics not less fine we presume than that transparent drapery which the romans called ventus textilis woven wind   hen i wonder how any body can spin such fine thread   fa their fingers must have the touch of a spider that as pope says feels at each thread and lives along the line and indeed you recollect that arachne was a spinster lace is a still finer production from flax and is one of those in which the original material is most improved how many times the price of a pound of flax do you think that flax will be worth when made into lace   hen a great many times i suppose   fa flax at the best hand is bought at fourteenpence a pound they make lace at valenciennes in french flanders of ten guineas a yard i believe indeed higher but we will say ten guineas this yard of lace will weigh probably not more than half an ounce what is the value of half an ounce of flax reckon it   hen it comes to one farthing and three quarters of a farthing   fa right now tell me how many times the original value the lace is worth   hen prodigious it is worth    0 times as much as the flax it is made of   fa yet there is another material that is still more improveable than flax   hen what can that be   fa iron the price of pigiron is ten shillings a hundred weight this is not quite one farthing for two ounces now you have seen some of the beautiful cut steel that looks like diamonds   hen yes i have seen buckles and pins and watchchains   fa then you can form an idea of it but you have seen only the most common sorts there was a chain made at woodstock in oxfordshire and sent to france which weighed only two ounces and cost   0l calculate how many times that had increased its value   hen amazing it was worth      00 times the value of the iron it was made of   fa this is what manufactures can do here man is a kind of a creator and like the great creator he may please himself with his work and say it is good in the lastmentioned manufacture too that of steel the english have the honor of excelling all the world   hen what are the chief manufactures of england   fa we have at present a greater variety than i can pretend to enumerate but our staple manufacture is woollen cloth england abounds in fine pastures and extensive downs which feed great numbers of sheep hence our wool has always been a valuable article of trade but we did not always know how to work it we used to sell it to the flemish or lombards who wrought it into cloth till in the year      edward the third invited some flemish weavers over to teach us the art but there was not much made in england till the reign of henry the seventh manchester and birmingham are towns which have arisen to great consequence from small beginnings almost within the memory of old men now living the first for cotton and muslin goods the second for cutlery and hardware in which we at this moment excel all europe of late years too carpets beautiful as fine tapestry have been fabricated in this country our clocks and watches are greatly esteemed the earthenware plates and dishes which we all use in common and the elegant set for the teatable ornamented with musical instruments which we admired in our visit yesterday belong to a very extensive manufactory the seat of which is at burslem in staffordshire the principal potteries there belong to one person an excellent chemist and a man of great taste he in conjunction with another man of taste who is since dead has made our clay more valuable than the finest porcelain of china he has molded it into all the forms of grace and beauty that are to be met with in the precious remains of the greek and etruscan artists in the more common articles he has penciled it with the most elegant designs shaped it into shells and leaves twisted it into wickerwork and trailed the ductile foliage round the light basket he has filled our cabinets and chimneypieces with urns lamps and vases on which are lightly traced with the purest simplicity the fine forms and floating draperies of herculaneum in short he has given to our houses a classic air and has made every saloon and every dining room schools of taste i should add that there is a great demand abroad for this elegant manufacture the empress of russia has had some magnificent services of it and the other day one was sent to the king of spain intended as a present from him to the archbishop of toledo which cost a thousand pounds some morning you shall go through the rooms in the london warehouse   hen i should like very much to see manufactures now you have told me such curious things about them   fa you will do well there is much more entertainment to a cultivated mind in seeing a pin made than in many a fashionable diversion which young people half ruin themselves to attend in the mean time i will give you some account of one of the most elegant of them which is paper   hen pray do my dear father   fa it shall be left for another evening however for it is now late good night   tenth evening the flying fish the flying fish says the fable had originally no wings but being of an ambitious and discontented temper she repined at being always confined to the waters and wished to soar in the air if i could fly like the birds said she i should not only see more of the beauties of nature but i should be able to escape from those fish which are continually pursuing me and which render my life miserable she therefore petitioned jupiter for a pair of wings and immediately she perceived her fins to expand they suddenly grew to the length of her whole body and became at the same time so strong as to do the office of a pinion she was at first much pleased with her new powers and looked with an air of disdain on all her former companions but she soon perceived herself exposed to new dangers when flying in the air she was incessantly pursued by the tropic bird and the albatross and when for safety she dropped into the water she was so fatigued with her flight that she was less able than ever to escape from her old enemies the fish finding herself more unhappy than before she now begged of jupiter to recall his present but jupiter said to her when i gave you your wings i well knew they would prove a curse but your proud and restless disposition deserved this disappointment now therefore what you begged as a favor keep as a punishment  a lesson in the art of distinguishing f come hither charles what is that you see grazing in the meadow before you   c it is a horse   f whose horse is it   c i do not know i never saw it before   f how do you know it is a horse if you never saw it before   c because it is like other horses   f are all horses alike then   c yes   f if they are all alike how do you know one horse from another   c they are not quite alike   f but they are so much alike that you can easily distinguish a horse from a cow   c yes indeed   f or from a cabbage   c a horse from a cabbage yes surely i can   f very well then let us see if you can tell how a horse differs from a cabbage   c very easily a horse is alive   f true and how is every thing called which is alive   c i believe all things that are alive are called animals   f right but can you tell me what a horse and a cabbage are alike in   c nothing i believe   f yes there is one thing in which the slenderest moss that grows upon the wall is like the greatest man or the highest angel   c because god made them   f yes and how do you call every thing that is made   c a creature   f a horse then is a creature but a living creature that is to say an animal   c and a cabbage is a dead creature that is the difference   f not so neither nothing is dead that has never been alive   c what must i call it then if it is neither dead nor alive   f an inanimate creature there is the animate and the inanimate creation plants stones metals are of the latter class horses belong to the former   c but the gardener told me some of my cabbages were dead and some were alive   f very true plants have a vegetative life a principle of growth and decay this is common to them with all organized bodies but they have not sensation at least we do not know they have  they have not life therefore in the sense in which animals enjoy it   c a horse is called an animal then   f yes but a salmon is an animal and so is a sparrow how will you distinguish a horse from these   c a salmon lives in the water and swims a sparrow flies and lives in the air   f i think a salmon could not walk upon the ground even if it could live out of the water   c no indeed it has no legs   f and a bird would not gallop like a horse   c no it would hop away upon its two slender legs   f how many legs has a horse   c four   f and an ox   c four likewise   f and a camel   c four still   f do you know any animals which live upon the earth that have not four legs   c i think not they have all four legs except worms and insects and such things   f you remember i suppose what an animal is called that has four legs you have it in your little books   c a quadruped   f a horse then is a quadruped by this we distinguish him from birds fishes and insects   c and from men   f true but if you had been talking about birds you would not have found it so easy to distinguish them   c how so a man is not at all like a bird   f yet an ancient philosopher could find no way to distinguish them but by calling man a twolegged animal without feathers   c i think he was very silly they are not at all alike though they have both two legs   f another ancient philosopher called diogenes was of your opinion he stripped a cock of his feathers and turned him into the school where plato that was his name was teaching and said here is platos man for you   c i wish i had been there i should have laughed very much   f probably before we laugh at others however let us see what we can do ourselves we have not yet found any thing which will distinguish a horse from an elephant or from a norway rat   c o that is easy enough an elephant is very large and a rat is very small a horse is neither large nor small   f before we go any further look what is settled on the skirt of your coat   c it is a butterfly what a prodigious large one i never saw such a one before   f is it larger than a rat think you   c no that it is not   f yet you called the butterfly large and you called the rat small   c it is very large for a butterfly   f it is so you see therefore that large and small are relative terms   c i do not well understand that phrase   f it means that they have no precise and determinate signification in themselves but are applied differently according to the other ideas which you join with them and the different positions in which you view them this butterfly therefore is large compared with those of its own species and small compared with many other species of animals besides there is no circumstance which varies more than the size of individuals if you were to give an idea of a horse from its size you would certainly say it was much bigger than a dog yet if you take the smallest shetland horse and the largest irish greyhound you will find them very much upon a par size therefore is not a circumstance by which you can accurately distinguish one animal from another nor yet is color   c no there are black horses and bay and white and pied   f but you have not seen that variety of colors in a hare for instance   c no a hare is always brown   f yet if you were to depend upon that circumstance you would not convey the idea of a hare to a mountaineer or an inhabitant of siberia for he sees them white as snow we must therefore find out some circumstances that do not change like size and color and i may add shape though they are not so obvious nor perhaps so striking look at the feet of quadrupeds are they all alike   c no some have long taper claws and some have thick clumsy feet without claws   f the thick seet are horny are they not   c yes i recollect they are called hoofs   f and the feet that are not covered with horn and are divided into claws are called digitated from digitus a finger because they are parted like fingers here then we have one grand division of quadrupeds into hoofed and digitated of which division is the horse   c he is hoofed   c there are a great many different kinds of horses did you ever know one that was not hoofed   c no never   f do you think we run any hazard of a stranger telling us sir horses are hoofed indeed in your country but in mine which is in a different climate and where we feed them differently they have claws   c no i dare say not   f then we have got something to our purpose a circumstance easily marked which always belongs to the animal under every variation of situation or treatment but an ox is hoofed and so is a sheep we must distinguish still farther you have often stood by i suppose while the smith was shoeing a horse what kind of a hoof has he   c it is round and all in one piece   f and is that of an ox so   c no it is divided   f a horse then is not only hoofed but wholehoofed now how many quadrupeds do you think there are in the world that are wholehoofed   c indeed i do not know   f there are among all animals that we are acquainted with either in this country or in any other only the horse the ass and the zebra which is a species of wild ass now therefore you see we have nearly accomplished our purpose we have only to distinguish him from the ass   c that is easily done i believe i should be sorry if any body could mistake my little horse for an ass   f it is not so easy however as you imagine the eye readily distinguishes them by the air and general appearance but naturalists have been rather puzzled to fix upon any specific difference which may serve the purpose of a definition some have therefore fixed upon the ears others on the mane and tail what kind of ears has an ass   c o very long clumsy ears asses ears are always laughed at   f and the horse   c the horse has small ears nicely turned and upright   f and the mane is there no difference there   c the horse has a fine long flowing mane the ass has hardly any   f and the tail is it not fuller of hair in the horse than in the ass   c yes the ass has only a few long hairs at the end of his tail but the horse has a long bushy tail when it is not cut   f which by the way it is pity it ever should now then observe what particulars we have got a horse is an animal of the quadruped kind wholehoofed with short erect ears a flowing mane and a tail covered in every part with long ears now is there any other animal think you in the world that answers these particulars   c i do not know this does not tell us a great deal about him   f and yet it tells us enough to distinguish him from all the different tribes of the creation which we are acquainted with in any part of the earth do you know now what we have been making   c what   f a definition it is the business of a definition to distinguish precisely the thing defined from every other thing and to do it in as few terms as possible its object is to separate the subject of definition first from those with which it has only a general resemblance then from those which agree with it in a greater variety of particulars and so on till by constantly throwing out all which have not the qualities we have taken notice of we come at length to the individual or the species we wish to ascertain it is a kind of chase and resembles the manner of hunting in some countries where they first enclose a very large circle with their dogs nets and horses and then by degrees draw their toils closer and closer driving their game before them till it is at length brought into so narrow a compass that the sportsmen have nothing to do but to knock down their prey   c just as we have been hunting this horse till at last we held him fast by his ears and his tail   f i should observe to you that in the definition naturalists give of a horse it is generally mentioned that he has six cutting teeth in each jaw because this circumstance of the teeth has been found a very convenient one for characterising large classes but as it is not absolutely necessary here i have omitted it a definition being the more perfect the fewer particulars you make use of provided you can say with certainty from those particulars the object so characterised must be this and no other whatever   c but papa if i had never seen a horse i should not know what kind of animal it was by this definition   f let us hear then how you would give me an idea of a horse   c i would say it was a fine large prancing creature with slender legs and an arched neck and a sleek smooth skin and a tail that sweeps the ground and that he snorts and neighs very loud and tosses his head and runs as swift as the wind   f i think you learned some verses upon the horse in your last lesson repeat them   c the wanton courser thus with reins unbound breaks from his stall and beats the trembling ground pampered and proud he seeks the wonted tides and laves in height of blood his shining sides his head now freed he tosses to the skies his mane disheveled over his shoulders flies he snuffs the females in the distant plain and springs exulting to his fields again popes homer f you have said very well but this is not a definition it is a description   c what is the difference   f a description is intended to give you a lively picture of an object as if you saw it it ought to be very full a definition gives no picture to those who have not seen it it rather tells you what its subject is not than what it is by giving you such clear specific marks that it shall not be possible to confound it with any thing else and hence it is of the greatest use in throwing things into classes we have a great many beautiful descriptions from ancient authors so loosely worded that we cannot certainly tell what animals are meant by them whereas if they had given us definitions three lines would have ascertained their meaning   c i like a description best papa   f perhaps so i believe i should have done the same at your age remember however that nothing is more useful than to learn to form ideas with precision and to express them with accuracy i have not given you a definition to teach you what a horse is but to teach you to think   the phoenix and dove a phoenix who had long inhabited the solitary deserts of arabia once flew so near the habitations of men as to meet with a tame dove who was sitting on her nest with wings expanded and fondly brooding over her young ones while she expected her mate who was foraging abroad to procure them food the phoenix with a kind of insulting compassion said to her poor bird how much i pity thee confined to a single spot and sunk in domestic cares thou art continually employed either in laying eggs or in providing for thy brood and thou exhaustest thy life and strength in perpetuating a feeble and defenseless race as to myself i live exempt from toil care and misfortune i feed upon nothing less precious than rich gums and spices i fly through the trackless regions of the air and when i am seen by men am gazed at with curiosity and astonishment i have no one to control my range no one to provide for and when i have fulfilled my five centuries of life and seen the revolutions of ages i rather vanish than die and a successor without my care springs up from my ashes i am an image of the great sun whom i adore and glory in being like him single and alone and having no likeness  the dove replied o phoenix i pity thee much more than thou affectest to pity me what pleasure can thou enjoy who live forlorn and solitary in a trackless and unpeopled desert who have no mate to caress thee no young ones to excite thy tenderness and reward thy cares no kindred no society amongst thy fellows not long life only but immortality itself would be a curse if it were to be bestowed on such uncomfortable terms for my part i know that my life will be short and therefore i employ it in raising a numerous posterity and in opening my heart to all the sweets of domestic happiness i am beloved by my partner i am dear to man and shall leave marks behind me that i have lived as to the sun to whom thou have presumed to compare thyself that glorious being is so totally different from and so infinitely superior to all the creatures upon earth that it does not become us to liken ourselves to him or to determine upon the manner of his existence one obvious difference however thou may remark that the sun though alone by his prolific heat produces all things and though he shines so high above our heads gives us reason every moment to bless his beams whereas thou swelling with thy imaginary greatness dreamest away a long period of existence equally void of comfort and usefulness  the manufacture of paper f i will now as i promised give you an account of the elegant and useful manufacture of paper the basis of which is itself a manufacture this delicate and beautiful substance is made from the meanest and most disgusting materials from old rags which have passed from one poor person to another and at length have perhaps dropped in tatters from the child of the beggar these are carefully picked up from dunghills or bought from servants by jews who make it their business to go about and collect them they sell them to the ragmerchant who gives from twopence to fourpence a pound according to their quality and he when he has got a sufficient quantity disposes of them to the owner of the papermill he gives them first to women to sort and pick agreeably to their different degrees of fineness they also with a knife cut out carefully all the seams which they throw into a basket for other purposes they then put them into the dustingengine a large circular wire sieve from whence they receive some degree of cleansing the rags are then conveyed to the mill here they were formerly beat to pieces with vast hammers which rose and fell continually with a most tremendous noise that was heard from a great distance but now they put the rags into a large trough or cistern into which a pipe of clear spring water is constantly flowing in this cistern is placed a cylinder about two feet long set thick round with rows of iron spikes standing as near as they can to one another without touching at the bottom of the trough there are corresponding rows of spikes the cylinder is made to whirl round with inconceivable rapidity and with these iron teeth rends and tears the cloth in every possible direction till by the assistance of the water which continually flows through the cistern it is thoroughly masticated and reduced to a fine pulp and by the same process all its impurities are cleansed away and it is restored to its original whiteness this process takes about six hours to improve the color they then put in a little smalt which gives it that bluish cast which all paper has more or less the french paper has less of it than ours this fine pulp is next put into a copper of warm water it is the substance of paper but the form must now be given it for this purpose they use a mould it is made of wire strong one way and crossed with finer this mould they just dip horizontally into the copper and take it out again it has a little wooden frame on the edge by means of which it retains as much of the pulp as is wanted for the thickness of the sheet and the superfluity runs off through the interstices of the wires another man instantly receives it opens the frame and turns out the thin sheet which has now shape but not consistence upon soft felt which is placed on the ground to receive it on that is placed another piece of felt and then another sheet of paper and so on till they have made a pile of forty or fifty they are then pressed with a large screwpress moved by a long lever which forcibly squeezes the water out of them and gives them immediate consistence there is still however a great deal to be done the felts are taken off and thrown on one side and the paper on the other from whence it is dexterously taken up with an instrument in the form of a t three sheets at a time and hung on lines to dry there it hangs for a week or ten days which likewise further whitens it and any knots and roughnesses it may have are picked off carefully by the women it is then sized size is a kind of glue and without this preparation the paper would not bear ink it would run and blot as you see it does on gray paper the sheets are just dipped into the size and taken out again the exact degree of sizing is a matter of nicety which can only be known by experience they are then hung up again to dry and when dry taken to the finishingroom where they are examined a new pressed in the dry presses which gives them their last gloss and smoothness counted out into quires made up in reams and sent to the stationers from whom we have it after he has folded it again and cut the edges some too he makes to shine like satin by glossing it with hot plates the whole process of papermaking takes about three weeks   h it is a very curious process indeed i shall almost scruple for the future to blacken a sheet of paper with a careless scrawl now i know how much pains it costs to make it so white and beautiful   f it is true that there is hardly any thing we use with so much waste and profusion as this manufacture we should think ourselves confined in the use of it if we might not tear disperse and destroy it in a thousand ways so that it is really astonishing from whence linen enough can be procured to answer so vast a demand as to the coarse brown papers of which an astonishing quantity is used by every shopkeeper in packages etc these are made chiefly of oakum that is old hempen ropes a fine paper is made in china of silk   h i have heard lately of woven paper pray what is that they cannot weave paper surely   f your question is very natural in order to answer it i must desire you to take a sheet of common paper and hold it up against the light do not you see marks in it   h i see a great many white lines running along lengthways like ribs and smaller that cross them i see too letters and the figure of a crown   f these are all the marks of the wires the thickness of the wire prevents so much of the pulp lying upon the sheet in those places consequently wherever the wires are the paper is thinner and you see the light through more readily which gives that appearance of white lines the letters too are worked in the wire and are the makers name now to prevent these lines which take off from the beauty of the paper particularly of drawing paper there have been lately used moulds of brass wire exceeding fine of equal thickness and woven or latticed one within another the marks therefore of these are easily pressed out so as to be hardly visible if you look at this sheet you will see it is quite smooth   h it is so   f i should mention to you that there is a discovery very lately made by which they can make paper equal to any in whiteness of the coarsest brown rags and even of dyed cottons which they have till now been obliged to throw by for inferior purposes this is by means of manganese a sort of mineral and oil of vitriol a mixture of which they just pass through the pulp while it is in water for otherwise it would burn it and in an instant it discharges the colors of the dyed cloths and bleaches the brown to a beautiful whiteness   h that is like what you told me before of bleaching cloth in a few hours   f it is indeed founded upon the same discovery the paper made of these brown rags is likewise more valuable from being very tough and strong almost like parchment   h when was the making of paper found out   f it is a disputed point but probably in the fourteenth century the invention has been of almost equal consequence to literature as that of printing itself and shows how the arts and sciences like children of the same family mutually assist and bring forward each other   the two robbers scene  alexander the great in his tent guards a man with a fierce countenance chained and fettered brought before him alex what art thou the thracian robber of whose exploits i have heard so much   rob i am a thracian and a soldier   a a soldier  a thief a plunderer an assassin the pest of the country i could honor thy courage but i must detest and punish thy crimes   r what have i done of which you can complain   a have thou not set at defiance my authority violated the public peace and passed thy life in injuring the persons and properties of thy fellow subjects   r alexander i am your captive  i must hear what you please to say and endure what you please to inflict but my soul is unconquered and if i reply at all to your reproaches i will reply like a free man   a speak freely far be it from me to take the advantage of my power to silence those with whom i deign to converse   r i must then answer your question by another how have you passed your life   a like a hero ask fame and she will tell you among the brave i have been the bravest among sovereigns the noblest among conquerors the mightiest   r and does not fame speak of me too was there ever a bolder captain of a more valiant band was there ever  but i scorn to boast you yourself know that i have not been easily subdued   a still what are you but a robber  a base dishonest robber   r and what is a conqueror have not you too gone about the earth like an evil genius blasting the fair fruits of peace and industry  plundering ravishing killing without law without justice merely to gratify an insatiable lust for dominion all that i have done to a single district with a hundred followers you have done to whole nations with a hundred thousand if i have stripped individuals you have ruined kings and princes if i have burned a few hamlets you have desolated the most flourishing kingdoms and cities of the earth what is then the difference but that as you were born a king and i a private man you have been able to become a mightier robber than i   a but if i have taken like a king i have given like a king if i have subverted empires i have founded greater i have cherished arts commerce and philosophy   r i too have freely given to the poor what i took from the rich i have established order and discipline among the most ferocious of mankind and have stretched out my protecting arm over the oppressed i know indeed little of the philosophy you talk of but i believed neither you nor i shall ever repay to the world the mischiefs we have done it   a leave me  take off his chains and use him well exit robber  are we then so much alike  alexander to a robber  let me reflect   end of the second volume
