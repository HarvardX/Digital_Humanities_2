an essay on humanity or a view of abuses in hospitals with a plan for correcting them  by william nolan  to sooth the hapless plaints of human woe and purge the tainted fount from whence they flow to bring to sinking nature sweet relief and wipe the tear from unrelenting grief to heal the body and instruct the mind are the great works which dignify mankind london printed for the author and sold by j murray no    in fleet street       price one shilling  to john macnamara esquire member of parliament for the city of leicester sir i hope you will not be offended at the liberty i take in recommending the following work to your protection  and i am the rather confirmed in this hope as well from its name an essay on humanity as its object so virtually corresponding with such name   it has been remarked of authors that their writings were the justest description of their dispositions and i think the observation may with great propriety be extended to their patrons for in the constitution of human concerns i believe there has seldom a work been inscribed to a patron the qualities of whose mind or dispositions of whose heart did not bear a congenial relationship to the subject treated of the gentleman which i now have the honor and happiness to address is a living example of the justice of this observation whose private life is one uniform exertion of the diffusive virtues of generosity and benevolence it is upon this expanded principle sir that i ground my hopes of your indulgence in patronizing  an essay on humanity and which by a species of relative attraction you have drawn to seek shelter under your fostering protection  i must here restrain the effusions of a grateful mind lest malignity might construe the genuine language of heartfelt gratitude into unworthy adulation  which i am perfectly confident you are as much averse to receive as i am to offer  justice however demands this public declaration that whatever benefit which i hope will not be inconsiderable may hereafter result to society from the present performance will be principally attributable to you in consequence of your liberality to the author   i have the honor to be sir with all becoming respect your most devoted and most obedient humble servant wm nolan st catherinescourt near the tower july        to the public as the institution of public charities is universally applauded so their abuse should be universally condemned to correct therefore a public evil of this tendency is the object of the following sheets  the nation is loud in its praises on the benevolence of the humane society instituted for the recovery of persons apparently dead and certainly praise could never be more judiciously bestowed nor more justly merited as a grateful individual of society it claims my particular veneration and as the plan which i have recommended here is projected upon the same principles of indiscriminate benevolence i fondly anticipate a portion of the public approbation for attempting to promote a public good  the humane society may in the exercise of ten experiments be successful perhaps but in one their exertions are nevertheless laudable but the institution of a humane committee which i have in the course of this essay recommended to be appointed in hospitals may exercise the functions annexed to it with greater probability of success as perhaps that in ten attempts to restore health and prolong life one will not miscarry as therefore the object of the humane society is to rescue from premature death our fellow creatures surely that institution formed upon similar principles of universal benevolence and which has in its comprehension the probability of saving ten for one of the human race must be allowed a decided superiority and consequently command a proportionate earnestness in its being established into a system of permanency  i am well apprized that imputations adduced against public institutions or public characters are generally supposed to take their rise in envy or disappointment and not from any disinterested or public spirited motives how far the degeneracy of humannature will justify such an illiberal charge it is not for me here to investigate therefore shall not attempt to refute the injustice or acknowledge the propriety of it nevertheless i think it absolutely necessary thus publicly to declare that such motives have not the least influence either immediate or remote in the present undertaking and that however singular the licentiousness of the times may make the declaration appear i profess myself a volunteer in the cause of humanity only  upon this principle it will not be esteemed presumptious to hope that this pamphlet will obtain a dispassionate investigation from the benevolent governors and subscribers to the different hospitals in and about london and also a candid examination of its utility from a discerning generous and impartial public whose judgment i hope in this respect will be directed by the magnitude of the object recommended by it and for whose benefit it is avowedly written  i also think it necessary to declare that i was not influenced by any general disapprobation i did or do entertain of the profession of physic or surgery or against any particular professor of those halfdivine arts on the contrary it has ever been my opinion that benevolent and intelligent physicians and surgeons were characters that gave additional dignity to human nature but the gentlemen of the faculty themselves will be my witnesses when i say that there are several characters in the profession who do not come strictly under this venerated denomination and in whose hands a mans life would be in as much danger as his property in those of an unprincipled pettifogging attorney  the sarcasms so liberally thrown out against both professions are the greatest pannigerycks upon the respectable part of the professors  it is only for ignorance insensibility and injustice to smart under the rod of satirical chastisement intelligence humanity and integrity will be ever above its reach  that want of literary merit which must ever distinguish maiden productions and which is so very conspicuous in the following essay will i hope in some measure be overlooked by the critic eye of classical accuracy in consideration of the benignity of its intention for though my capacity in pourtraying this subject in the affecting colors it would admit of is inferior to many yet in a benevolent anxiety for its happy accomplishment i am inferior to none  for if ever i could entertain so inordinate a wish as to be possessed of the captivating pathetic and persuasive eloquence of mr burke it would be that i might like him with more success plead the cause of humanity  the ancient romans the most unsullied model of human perfection which history presents us with carried their love of humanity to so exalted a pitch that they decreed the particular honor of a civic crown to every individual who should save the life of one citizen this was a generous incitement  an honorable stimulative to the virtues of humanity and benevolence and as the british nation is the only living copy on the face of nature of so illustrious an original i hope that my feeble endeavors which are levelled at the preservation of the lives of thousands of my fellowcitizens and fellow creatures in future will entitle me to the more envied distinction  their approbation and though i should not be so happy as to gain this flattering reward  yet i shall not relax my perseverence in endeavoring to deserve it by availing myself of every opportunity of discharging the benevolent duties of a citizen of the world  an essay on humanity etc it is no less a compliment to the liberality and wisdom than to the humanity of great britain that it takes precedence of all other states in europe for the number variety and affluence of its charitable institutions the large voluntary subscriptions in supporting hospitals for every species of calamity entailed on human nature excite sentiments of the most exalted sensibility in the feeling breast  all benevolent descriptions of mankind must sympathetically partake of blessings thus indiscriminately diffused and though our feelings may be wounded either by the sight or recital of the afflictions inseparable from the constitution of human nature yet we are in a great measure consoled by the reflection that these mansions of hospitality are erected for their alleviation  the great mass of mankind ever has been and ever will be formed of two component parts good and bad  the one ever solicitous to promote the happiness of their fellow creatures the other to counteract these laudable efforts this is a truth so well established by the experience of successive ages that a further commentation on it here might be justly considered an impertinent prolixity i am led to this reflection from the wanton abuse which is known but too generally to prevail in the above mentioned godlike institutions  where avarice and insensibility in the officers and servants not to say neglect in the physicians and surgeons belonging to these establishments frequently prevent the unhappy patients from receiving that consolation in them that the nature of their malady demands and which was the primitive object of their pious and humane founders to correct these enormities is the avowed object of the present work and success in the undertaking will be to me the most acceptable reward of my labor it will ever be admitted by the advocates for humanity that the greater the distress of the object the greater his recommendation to the care of philanthropy but some instances which i shall hereafter mention seem to confirm that they maintain a contrary opinion in hospitals and that the greater the distress of an object soliciting relief there the greater the difficulty of removing it should seem necessary  the following circumstance which may be depended upon as authentic i shall mention as well for its singular cruelty as a confirmation of the imputation just mentioned curiosity led me to st bartholomews hospital on a takinginday as it is termed when a patient was admitted into the ward where i was and after passing through the extraformalities necessary for such admission he was introduced by one of the beadles to the sister of the ward who at first received him with that affected cordiality and seeming tenderness which pecuniary expectations make low minds assume after which she asked him  had he got his wardage  the unhappy man said he had no money  that the last sixpence he had in the world he gave to the beadle who showed him into the ward the tender hearted sister on this information flew into the most outrageous passion and in an imperious elevation of voice in which were blended insolence ignorance and barbarity demanded how he dare come there without it did he not know it was customary and that it was her due or perquisite  with a number of other interrogatories equally divested of decency as humanity the trembling patient modestly replied he believed it might be customary but alleged his inability as his only reason for noncompliance to it this affecting confession so far from softening the heart of the inexorable sister exasperated her still more in so much that she absolutely insisted on his turning out of the ward immediately and actually proceeded to push him out shocked at such unexampled inhumanity i arrested her in the execution of her unfeeling purpose  hold monster said i here is your wardage and may the gin you procure for it rid human nature of so great a reproach to it this inveterate imprecation i could not restrain in the moment of my indignant resentment and detestation for such unparrallelled insensibility of soul  i shall leave the mind of sensibility to make its native sympathetic comment on unfortunate wretches in the situation above described and shall only observe that such inhumanity is in diametric opposition to the very name and nature of an hospital and shows a lamentable degeneracy of the institution  this perquisite of wardage operates variously to the disadvantage of patients  it makes the sister look with the eye of anxiety on the patient in all the progressive situations and stages of his cure not from a humane concern for the restoration of his health but with an avaricious expectation of having him discharged as she is to get  s from the person whom accident or decease makes his successor and as perhaps she has no other bed in her ward to accommodate such casual successor with but that occupied by some halfcured patient it is therefore very evident that the number of cures effected in the ward committed to her humane superintendance is not so much the object of her solicitude as the number of patients admitted into it as she has  s for each it is very reasonable to infer from this circumstance that her tenderness will not be much exerted toward the patients the very reverse is justly to be apprehended as she must know from experience that moroseness and brutality might induce some to quit the hospital before their cures were accomplished though tenderness and humanity would be an additional inducement to them to stay for that very desirable purpose to be accomplished  another infamous practice of these wretches to multiply their perquisites is to prefer complaints to the steward against the unhappy patients for if in the acuteness of their pains they are guilty of the least vehement expression they are immediately represented to the steward as intollerably noisy and troublesome thus for not having the constancy to maintain an equality of temper in the extremity of pain they are painted out as intolerable and for no other human reason than that perhaps their agonies are so and a dismission soon after notwithstanding any pathetic remonstrance to the contrary is frequently the consequence  this despotic act of power in the lord steward is faithfully copied by the lady matron in her department with this difference only that the delicacy of the complaints which females frequently labor under will not dispense with so immediate a dismission but in any circumstances where they will her plenitude of arbitrary authority will be as severely and as instantaneously exercised and for the same iniquitous reason already mentioned  is it not a melancholy consideration that the health or perhaps the life a useful member of society should thus fall a facrifice either to the avarice of the sister or the captice of the steward and it amounts to more than a presumption that this is frequently the case when patients are turned out of the hospital before their cures are effected the disorder upon the point perhaps of being conquered by the regimen prescribed and followed when the process of medicinal application is interrupted returns to its wonted strength at a time that the body is considerably exhausted by the abstinence imposed by regimen when a conflict between recruited disease and harrassed nature ensues which must necessarily terminate in human dissolution  the number of evils arising from this pernicious perquisite of wardage are as obvious as they are distressing to the poor afflicted part of the community it is therefore hoped the governors and subscribers to hospitals will apply a radical cure to the evil by totally suppressing it and substitute in its room an additional equivalent of salary to the sisters and nurses for to the eternal reproach of human nature i must own that while the degraded principle or passion of selfinterest stands in opposition to the discharge of any duty there will be found very few especially in the inferior orders of mankind who will not make that duty subservient to their interest however important to society the faithful discharge of such a trust may be and indeed i may venture to affirm that the ills and calamities ideally ascribed to pandoras box will be realized by the continuance of this with other prohibitions on humanity which i shall hereafter mention how many are the unfortunate objects who from having large families painful illness or a long want of employment are in actual want of subsistence it is not therefore strange that under the pressure of any or all of these calamities they should want a few shillings but it is very strange indeed that this want should be the foundation on which the want of being cured is built as they can not get into the hospital without it as has been already sufficiently demonstrated this illustrates and explains that negative text in the scripture so remarkable for its obscurity and from those that have nothing even that which they have will be taken from them  it applies immediately to the peculiarly unfortunate wretches i have been just describing  having nothing but hope and even that is taken away from them by this illtimed rejection of their double claim to compassion  it is also customary nay indeed it is indispensibly necessary in order to be admitted into the hospitals for the patient to bring two clean shirts with him besides the shirt he wears which must be clean also to the propriety decency and utility of this regulation i very readily subscribe where the circumstances of the patient will admit of a conformity to it i admit it is also a cooperative assistance in the restoration and preservation of health in the course of medical application  for as filth is as obnox ous to health as to sense so is cleanliness as useful to the one as agreeable to the other but do all these reasons united justify the cruelty of rejecting an unhappy patient for nonconformance to this hospital mandate especially when unrelenting necessity is the cause will any good intended to be promoted by it counterbalance the evil promiscuously entailed on every unhappy wretch thus rejected no  i am confident it will not let us for a moment enter into the thoughts of the unhappy creature thus disappointed  all his less acute sorrows which before lay in a state of torpitude are now newedged by this recent aggravation of his calamities his poverty his hapless helpless irremediable poverty he justly considers as the cause of this consummation of human woe his mind is alternately torn with the passions of grief and despondence when he sees even the probability extinguished of having his health reestablished  though the above is a melancholy yet it is a true picture of the human mind bending under the complicated lead of grief poverty and pain  therefore however commendable it may be to relieve the misfortunes of our fellow creatures it is much more so to prevent them by the timely exertions of wisdom and liberality in their behalf for accomplishing so meritorious a purpose i would recommend it to the governors etc to have half a dozen or a dozen of coarse cloth shirts in each ward and that the sisters and nurses might be ordered to accommodate such unfortunate patients as above described in such manner as their respective necessities should demand the object of additional expense on this occasion would be very inconsiderable but when put in competition with the blessings resulting to individuals and to society at large from it it would entirely vanish this indulgence not to be extended to any but those whose necessities alone should entitle them to it how many useful members of society by the extension of this well timed benevolence would be enabled to resume a life of honorable industry who might through the want of this means of seeking to recover their health become an encumbrance to society as would also their relatives whose immediate subsistence was drawn from the exercise of their trade  workhouse patients it frequently happens that parish patients are brought to hospitals to the very great prejudice of the patients who are before warded in them as these parish patients have a distinction paid them very injurious to the convenience and sometimes to the health of those other patients who are removed out of their beds though they should be even in the extremity of a fever to make room for the parish patients and only for the pitiful consideration of fourpence a day which the parish allows in such cases and which becomes the perquisite of the servants belonging to the hospitals this is a barefaced partiality and a flagrant outrage on the rights of humanity and consequently calls loudly for redress  the food for patients with respect to the quality and quantity of food appointed for the use of the patients it appears to me in a general sense tolerably well calculated to answer the ends proposed by it but notwithstanding some alterations and additions might be made in some particular cases exclusive of the hospital allowance especially to such patients as are afflicted no otherways than by wounds or sores of little or no malignity and whose constitutions are not debilitated through antecedent excess an abstinence from a sufficiency of food in a constitution thus circumstanced lays the foundation of several disorders  as belchings windy cholics dizziness in the head etc etc and in juvenile constitutions it is the undoubted forerunner of a consumption  a line of distinction should be therefore accurately drawn between those who from the nature and malignity of their complaints can not eat so much as the hospital allowance and those who from contrary reasons could eat more without endangering their health or retarding their cure such patients should by all means have an additional allowance lest the restraining them in this particular should be productive of the unhappy consequences above particularized  though this increase of food would incur a small additional expense yet it would be a temporary one and in its consequences would prove a saving as this assertion has the mysterious appearance of a paradox i solve it thus  many patients of the description now in question contract those windy consumptive complaints when in the hospital for want of a sufficiency of food who are obliged to go back there again for their cure and perhaps stay there until they become infinitely more expensive than by giving them the necessary addition of nourishment above mentioned the first time they were in the hospital  security to bury patients who die in the hospital or to lodge a deposit equal to the expense that such interment may amount to this regulation appears to me fraught with cruelty and inhumanity as it is undoubtedly the cause of several of the most unhappy of our fellow creatures breathing their last in the poor and obscure environs of this extensive metropolis  every patient is according to this law or regulation obliged to find one or two housekeepers to subscribe to an undertaking to bury him in case he dies in the hospital and unless he can procure such responsibility or advance a stipulated deposit himself to defray the incidental expense whatever may be his claim to humanity from the complicated wretchedness of his condition he is utterly precluded admission the degrading vice of selfinterest which in a great measure pervades all descriptions of mankind will immediately point out the insurmountable difficulties which will attend  a friendless  sickly  and pennyless individual in procuring such responsibility but this is not the only instance which shows a manifest perversion of the intention of those temples of compassion  though it is enough to show that at present the internal as well as external regulations of them are only directed to the relief of such as are in part distressed those that are wholly so they seem to think should remain so  as is sufficiently evinced in the instance now under consideration why should not this inexorable law be dispensed with in cases where there is not the least human likelihood of the patients dying in the hospital and in cases where such a fatality may with justice be apprehended  is not though shocking to humanity to relate the wretched objects body a sufficient forfeiture for this temporary mitigation of the calamities which terminate with life  physicians and surgeons having now pointed out some of the enormities of the servants i shall take the liberty of making some observations on the conduct of the gentlemen belonging to the hospitals immediately antecedent to a patients discharge from the hospital he passes through a very ridiculous unnecessary formality  he is called into a room where the physicians and surgeons attend and asked  if he has any complaint against the sisters or nurses etc in the name of common sense i would ask  admitting he had  of what consequence would it or could it be to say so then what advantage would result to him to tell the gentlemen that he was not treated with the tenderness he expected and which from the intention as well as constitution of the charity should be shown him or that the peculiar circumstances of his complaint demanded  of what utility could it possibly be to him just at the moment he was to be discharged to say he was not tenderly or carefully nursed such information now would like a malicious accusation especially when it could not have for its object the redress of such grievances as to himself had these questions been proposed to him during his residence in the hospital for instance the first week after his admission the fear of incurring the displeasure of the gentlemen might exact that tenderness from the sisters and nurses which the fear of violating the obligations of humanity could no this therefore i take to be an afterpiece of attention and consequently nugatory and unavailing for if any thing can equal its absurdity it is its palpable inutility  without intending the least disparagement to the respectibility of their profession or the integrity of their principles i would earnestly recommend to these gentlemen a more humane regard to the feelings of their unhappy patients i have frequently heard and beheld with astonishment gentlemen who arrived to the highest pitch of eminence in their profession use exceeding harsh language and apparently unfeeling treatment to their patients when in the most agitating mental anxiety and under the most excruciating corporeal pain this is a conduct which is by no means reconcilable to the dignity of the gentleman the sensibility of the man or the profession of a surgeon people of this assumed or natural austerity of manners should reflect that there are some constitutions so delicately constructed by nature that though they have arrived to maturity in years are but infants in the great virtues of patience and resignation and consequently require the same cordiality and affability in their treatment  another prevailing practice in an hospital and which to excite general indignation needs only to be mentioned is that if a surgeons patient has the misfortune to have a leg or an arm dangerously afflicted amputation is immediately proposed without any previous consultation whether a possibility exists of effecting a cure without having recourse to this desperate alternative surely in a matter of such magnitude to human nature as the mutilation or dissolution which frequently follows it of one of our species it merits the utmost professional deliberation before such unrelenting resolutions are decidedly adopted  for exclusive of the horrible fears that anticipation unavoidably excites in the patients mind preparatory to amputation the excrutiating pain of the operation must be indescribeably great why then wantonly or incautiously condemn a fellow creature to such intolerable pains of mind and body if there are any possible human means to avoid it  but long experience and impartial observation suggest to me a consideration which at the same time that it accounts for this inhuman premature propensity to amputation reflects very little honor on the principles of the chirurgical tribe which is  that experiments of this desperate nature are made on the poor that they may be practiced with more probability of success on the rich though this is a harsh imputation yet i conscientiously believe it to be true in various instances but for the honor of human nature i hope there are a number of exceptions to it  indeed i am confident to assert and ready to prove that in many instances there is not that attention paid to hospital patients that there ought to be for unless some singular affliction attracts the attention of the gentlemen the patients frequently languish under common complaints with as little prospect of redress in the hospital as out  in order to the substantiating what is alleged above relating to amputation i shall recite the following instance which came under my own immediate knowledge  some few years ago there was a patient in st bartholomews hospital who labored under a violent inflammation in his left arm a certain great professional character whose amputating abilities are as universally known as admired ordered amputation immediately on the first sight of the arm without ever consulting the patient or giving himself a moments time to enquire into his habit of body or disposition of mind on so momentous an event the man anticipated his advice from his general character but absolutely refused to comply with it very rationally considering that if a course of medicine was prescribed for the purpose of correcting and purifying the blood it would probably abate the inflammation and on that events taking place external applications might operate more effectually this reasonable expectation was soon afterward justified for in less than the short space of a month the patient was discharged from the hospital with his arm perfectly healed a living monument of the cruelty and justice of having recourse to amputation unless in cases where the unequivocal symptoms of mortification make it indispensibly necessary i have every reason to apprehend the instances of such cruel inattention are not few nor the still more cruel consequences with which they are attended nor can the circumstance of this unrelenting practice not being more generally known in the least invalidate the probability of those humane apprehensions being just as can be very rationally inferred from the case just mentioned  respecting the clergyman who attends the hospital having now represented what bodily inconveniences patients labor under i shall proceed to examine the inattention shown to the still more exalted and important concern their souls  ingratitude it is justly observed is a crime of syrian dye but alas it is a crime from which very few of the human race can plead an exemption particularly to that supreme being whose mercies to us demand our most animated gratitude while in the meridian of health and prosperity we neglect those great duties we ought to perform and which when descended under the clouded horizon of sickness and adversity we cannot perform it is in this state the mind resumes its salutary attribute of reflection  it is then she would wish by a life of prudence and penance in future to ward off calamities which antecedent intemperance or impiety make her dread for the present both as to body and soul when the human mind is in this susceptible disposition a wise and humane clergyman should avail himself of its situation as in it we are more inclined to hear and follow good advice than at any other time by visiting patients in such situations and admonishing them to refrain from a repetition of those irregularities which perhaps laid the foundation of their present sickness and that such sickness was the consequent punishment of their criminal neglect of the performance of their religious duty or in any other pathetic manner that the love or duty of christianity might dictate  for as the state of heat in metallic substances is the state wherein they are made capable to assume new or beautiful forms so the state of affliction is the state to mould the human mind to every pursuit that is congenial to the dignity of its nature but i am extremely sorry to say that there is very little attention paid to the discharge of this indispensible duty in an hospital more especially at the time that it is most necessary toward the approach of death  for it is truly lamentable to see how shamefully negligent in this momentous concern are the people about an expiring wretch in an hospital  to whom custom joined to innate insensibility has made it as indifferent to see a patient leaving the world as leaving the hospital this conduct is not only inhuman but impious in the highest degree as at this awful tremendous moment desponding fears and infidel doubts find an easy conquest of a mind which though not strengthened by christian philosophy is considerably weakened by disease this therefore is the time to administer to the exhausted mind the lenient balsam of christianity by infusing into the anxious trembling palpitating soul a conviction a hope and a belief of its divine and merciful authors protection in a future state i would not dwell so long on this matter but from an internal conviction that virtue and good morals are as often the means of preserving health as medicine is in restoring it a proper method of treating the minds and morals of patients shall be pointed out hereafter in its place that is immediately after suggesting a plan for the removal or mitigation of all the antecedent bodily inconveniences alluded to  the plan for reformation having now shown the neglect and abuse of hospitals i shall proceed to the method of correcting them and in their room to recommend regulations which if adopted will be productive of the most salutary effects with very little additional expense to the institutions for the accomplishment of this desirable purpose i would recommend it to the governors subscribers etc to appoint a committee from amongst themselves to be called the humane committee whose office might be to examine minutely into the arrangement and treatment of the patients to discover any neglect or inattention to the cure of their respective maladies in order as well to remedy them as trace out the source from which such inhuman negligence originates  this committee should have a discretionary power from the governors etc to examine with the most scrupulous attention the disposition and character of those who are candidates for any office internal or external belonging to hospitals in order to have ample satisfaction in this momentous particular i would recommend that each candidate should undergo the following or some similar examination viz  what life did they lead antecedent to this particular period whether moral or debauched religious or profligate  what capacity in the commerce of society did they fill whether they discharged with probity the relative duties annexed to such employment  and particularly what was generally reputed to be the natural bent of their dispofition whether morose or humane for from the man of humanity the discharge of all social obligation is as reasonably expected as their violation is to be apprehended from a man of a contrary stamp  if the candidates could undergo a liberal examination of this tendency corroborated by some respectable characters of their acquaintance they might with propriety be admitted otherwise not  this would infallibly annihilate partial recommendation  the contaminated source from which various evils flow to the human race  as there is no line of discrimination or distinction drawn by it between the worthy and unworthy often bestowing upon ignorance and inhumanity appointments to which in moral rectitude genius us and philanthropy have the justest claim i am very well convinced from my observations on human nature in the melancholy stages of perturbation of spirit and corporeal pain that a patients cure is as much accelerated by the tenderness and humanity of the nurse as by the most obedient conformity to the prescriptions of the doctor and that to effectuate a cure in the body i hold it absolutely necessary to maintain peace in the mind it is evident from this how essential it is to the health of a patient to have an affectionate tender nurse and consequently how necessary the precaution here recommended for the admission of such  as also the rejection of such others as do not fall under this denomination  this committee should have a power of suspending any officer or servant already employed in the hospitals on preferring and substantiating any charge of injustice inattention or inhumanity against them and also of substituting in their room others who after examination should be found possessed of the qualifications already particularized  the committee should consist of about eight persons of which number a physician and surgeon should always make two the necessity of adding professional gentlemen will appear obvious for the following reasons first the patients under a physician may have a very just cause of complaint and though the humane society might be disposed to remove it yet from a want of professional knowledge they might through the insinuations of the sisters and nurses be induced to believe that such treatment as the patient received was necessary for the correction of his disorder and that it was the doctors express requisition to pursue invariably such and such prescriptions a gentleman of the faculty being of the committee will easily discover whether the treatment such patient receives is or was adapted to remove his complaints or whether the process prescribed is sanctified by experience for being efficacious in removing maladies similar to those under which the patient labors  if not the report of the physician belonging to the humane committee to the humane committee at large would point out an abuse which for want of this professional investigation would remain concealed and which in my opinion would deserve particular reprehension and if a remonstrance from the humane committee to such physician did not immediately produce a variation in the subsequent treatment of his patients a report then to be made to the governors subscribers etc at large who on the impartial confirmation of such dangerous inattention should prevent a repetition of such delinquency by the suspension of its author secondly the surgeon to be added to the humane committee to have an equal superintending control and unlimited privilege of inspection as the doctor into the surgeons patients their maladies and manner of treatment and also any neglect incapacity or inattention in those gentlemen whose immediate province it should be to attend this description of patients and to make the necessary report as in the case of the physician   it is a matter of no consequence to the unhappy patient who loses his health for want of due care whether his misfortune is attributable to the inhumanity of the nurse or the inattention or ignorance of his doctor and here i cannot avoid observing that as much from these causes as from any incurable obstinacy of his disorder the patients dissolution happens  whether abuses of this magnitude fraught with consequences the most conspicuously subversive of the original intention of these institutions demand the interposition of the protecting hand of humanity i leave it to the sensibility of the feeling mind to determine  i would not be understood here to make the most distant insinuation that the instances are many where patients suffer through the ignorance of the physicians or surgeons and even when they do it is more from negligence than any professional inability for if they will not sedulously examine the patients complaint they undoubtedly must be ignorant of it and consequently of the most efficacious manner of treating it an imputation of this species of ignorance they very frequently and very justly deserve i think inclination should cooperate with duty in expediting the cure of disorders which time makes  multiply in malignity  to the insupportable multiplication of the unhappy patients afflictions  these affecting considerations should be particularly attended to by the humane committee  with respect to the young gentlemen who walk the hospital for information that levity which is almost the inseparable characteristic of youth in any profession prevents them from paying that compassionate attention to the present disorder which without being radically cured lays the foundation of the future calamity of patients that they so pressingly demand  to remedy this evil it is indispensibly incumbent on the senior practitioners to recommend by precept and enforce by example the humane attention here recommended and a doubt cannot remain of such conduct being circumspectly copied it would not only imperceptibly introduce a professional but also a humane emulation amongst them especially when they consider that humanity gives the highest polish to their professional character i must assert with regret that at present the majojority of the young gentlemen who walk our different hospitals are very little under the dominion of the humane power of sympathy for it is no uncommon thing to hear some of them wrapped up in all the coxcombical consequence of selfadmiration hum an opera tune while an operation is performing on a fellow creature to this perhaps it may be replied that the frequency of operations and amputations familiarizes them to such affecting sights and that there is a professional necessity for a surgeons being divested of the feminine weakness of pity in desperate eases to the propriety of this i readily subscribe so far as courage is necessary to the performance of those hazardous undertakings but this admission by no means implies that insensibility is a necessary qualification in the constitution of a surgeon the contrary as has been already shown is the case he must set out with very little humanity indeed who has lost it all before he has acquired so much knowledge in his profession as will in some sort apologize for the want of it but as the consideration of youth makes this matter as much the object of admonition as reprehension i would recommend it to those young gentlemen to consider that humanity will always stamp a dignity on the profession which moroseness will rob it of and that in their endeavors to become surgeons they should never forget  that they are men  and gentlemen  appellations to which a perseverance in an unfeeling conduct of this kind will utterly exclude them from having the least pretentions  the humane committee should visit the hospital every week that is a physician and three other members one week and a surgeon and three other members the next and so on alternately but if the intervention of any unexpected or extraordinary circumstance made it necessary according as each division informed the other the whole to attend  that in the course of these joint examinations they should make a report to the governors or subscribers etc at their general meetings of every thing which in the course of such enquiry presented itself to them as a proper object of reformation or correction which must be collected principally from the state and information of the patients  such as inattention severity or partiality or any other inconvenience arising to the patients by omission or commission from the servants nurses etc either by a censurable neglect or a wanton violation of the sacred obligations of the institution  it will probably be objected here by some critic who has more imaginary wisdom than real humanity that giving a power of so extensive a latitude to one physician and one surgeon as to superintend the practice and conduct of all the physicians and surgeons attending each respective hospital where this regulation should be established would multiply the evil it was calculated to remove by being productive of professional alteration but this objection will be entirely obviated when it is considered that the physician and surgeon belonging to the humane committee being inverted with no further authority than to see that the patients are not neglected in their respective professional department their office consequently cannot be considered as a tribunal to bring characters of well established abilities in their profession to the bar of examination their abilities are not the subject or object of the committees enquiry it is the impartial attentive and humane exercise of those abilities which will fall under their investigation and as the idea of their superior abilities is generally and i think justly acquiesced in so the exercise of them in the line of their dute should be enforced merit it is true is the principal recommendation to any public employment whatever but it is not the only one for next to the indispensible necessity of knowing any public professional duty is that of saithfully performing it but care should be always taken in accurately drawing a line of distinction between accidental and intentional guilt that is acting contrary to the spirit of the institution from ignorance or from a depravity of sentiment it will in such cases be in the discretion of the committee to proportion the punishment to the crime  this committee should be perpetual as well to prevent future as to correct present abuses it should be chosen annually or quarterly etc as the wisdom of the governors should point out or as the necessity of the patients might demand a salary to be appointed to the use of the physician and surgeon bearing proper proportion to their merit and the fidelity with which they would be found to discharge the humane appointment they should be now called to  wisdom and experience have found it necessary in discharging the great commercial constitutional duties of the state to institute reciprocal checques in the different departments of it  and to this institution is principally owing the fidelity with which these important trusts are discharged the rule will immediately apply to the discharge of the offices of humanity in hospitals  and surely the one is not less important than the other  consequently demands an equal vigilance in its administration  i would have the humane committee see that the clergyman should visit the hospital every day  preparing those that are likely to die for so tremendous a change and admonishing those that are likely to live to pursue the paths of virtue as the most likely means of preserving future health and procuring happiness  for it is an indelible reproach to christianity the general neglect of this great  this important consideration at present and as divines in general are not remarkable for doing more than their duty i would see that in the present case they should not do  less and that this additional labor should not militate against their interest they should have an additional salary for performing it this would make their duty their interest  and i believe without intending any offense to the cloth i may say would be one reason why they would perform such duty with alacrity  observations to enforce the foregoing motives of reform though the internal regulations of hospitals may vary in particulars yet their general object is the same they are all appropriated to some benevolent purpose or other  for the relief of human misery in whatever variety of shapes it may assume and to comfort the comfortless as this is a fact universally known what i write respecting one applies to all i therefore most pathetically recommend a general enquiry to be made into the abuses here complained of  and sincerely wish that a general reformation may be the consequence there cannot be a more ample field for the exercise of general benevolence than such an investigation  and if entered upon with the spirit of unanimity must rescue the national character from the illiberal though unjust imputation of foreigners on the intolerable abuse of our public charities who say that there are very few monuments of our humanity here besides stone  i have chalked out the foregoing line for accomplishing this muchto bewishedfor reformation without being the least tenacious whether the plan i have delineated will be literally pursued or not to the superior wisdom of the governors etc i implicitly submit my humble efforts in recommending a better regulation in our hospitals than at present characterizes them and if the moae i have suggested does not meet their approbation as to manner i have the pleasure to anticipate it will be adopted as to matter it is indifferent to me what means are pursued so the end is obtained an effectual reformation of the abuses here alluded to was my motive in taking up my pen and i have a secret pleasure in hoping that the cooperation of the governors etc will bring to a benevolent conclusion what i had the good fortune to begin not doubting but their humanity will adopt the hint and their wisdom point out the most effectual means of carrying it into execution  the french nation though distinguished for peculiar levity and national volatility are by no means divested of the exalted feelings of humanity their hospitals are many and under excellent regulations particularly since a reformation of the nature here recommended has taken place there which brought to light a number of enormities that otherwise would have lain covered in the oblivion of venality but there is not so extensive a field for abuse in their charities as in ours  as in point of wealth our hospitals have a decided superiority  and this advantage which could be converted to the additional accommodation of these receptacles of affliction is one of the sources from whence the majority of the evils here complained of flow  for extensive wealth will ever give birth to peculation and peculation to infidelity in the discharge of lucrative trusts   as it must be admitted that we frequently copy the fashionable absurdities of our gallic neighbors let us convince them and the world that we are also capable of imitating their virtues by adopting a plan similar to that they have pursued for correcting the flagrant abuses committed in the administration of our public charities a work which whoever sets on foot that will redound no less to their immortal honor than the endowments of these hospitals do to their godlike founders and will in conjunction with such dignified names hand theirs down to the latest posterity with the veneration and respect that disinterestedness and humanity will ever receive from a sensible and generous people  humanity is the most distinguishing characteristic of human perfection  any man divested of it should be divested of all the social privileges of a rational being it is in man what mercy is in the gracious author of our existence and the greatest possible degree of excellence our nature considering its inseparable imperfections is capable of arriving at is to be humane  it comprehends every social obligation that unites man to man religion is but a name and man a two legged monster without it as humanity is therefore the unadulterated religion of nature i would wish to impress this consequential truth on the minds of mankind that an external conformity to gospel injunctions can never be acceptable to god unaccompanied by internal motives of humanity and the actual discharge of its obligations  the love of god is religion the love of man humanity so that it is evident it is no less a christian duty to love god above all things than our neighbors as ourselves  the latter duty left unperformed makes the pretentions to the former as absurd as impious how necessary therefore to recommend and enforce this secondary obligation of mankind especially as our own happiness is so immediately connected with the discharge of this benevolent duty  as we have the most unequivocal assurance from the divine author of our redemption that if we act with humanity toward our distressed brethren he will act with mercy toward us that is if we show benevolence we shall find mercy this is a consideration of the greatest magnitude that can possibly attract the attention or exercise the rational faculties of man and consequently the most useful to be preached and practiced this is the religion which every man should openly profess and inwardly believe and in which no man need be ashamed to live or afraid to die humanity with any system of chistian religion must be acceptable to heaven any without it an abomination  i hope therefore the united motives of christianity and humanity will animate every generous spark of benevolence in the mind of the governors etc in which those virtues appeared to be suspended by suffering with impunity the abuses and neglects here complained of and that they will accordingly take such necessary steps as will guard those benevolent institutions from abuse neglect or degeneracy what a heartfelt congratulation it must be to them in every subsequent stage of life to reflect that at one and the same time they have discharged the sacred duties of christianity and complied with the natural dictates of humanity but on the contrary how agonizing would it be to their exalted sensibility to apprehend that those pious and humane intentions should be counteracted by the depravity of the persons entrusted with the execution of them the native benevolence of his own mind prevents a good man from even suspecting that such depraved characters as are here described have an existence  his own innate goodness being the standard by which he charitably though erroneously estimates the characters of others by but though this unsuspicious goodnature is the most infallible characteristic of a generous mind yet it by no means implies a necessary knowledge of mankind for it is well known that both in principle and practice no two distinct things stand in more diametric opposition to one another than man and man it is therefore but half of a good mans duty to act well himself the other half consists in making those under his immediate control act well also  in a matter of such importance to society at large as the restoration of the health of perhaps some thousands so as to be enabled to resume lives of independent industry too much care cannot be taken to see that the operations for so salutary a purpose are not retarded by the intervention of any sinister or interested motives or even by the neglect of those whose immediate province it is to see these benevolent purposes carried into execution humanity is capable of degenerating into a criminal forgiveness in goodnatured minds from this misguided notion of its principle goodnatured men frequently forgive through compassion what they ought to punish through justice this error they are insensibly led into by endeavoring to avoid the opposite character of severity but it should be engraved with an damantine pencil on tablets of the most lasting tempered steel as a maxim for the regulation of the conduct of mankind  that there should always be a wreath for the advocates and a rod for the enemies of humanity  i shall make no apology for the above digression from a conviction that my humane readers will coincide with me in the opinion that any deviation from the immediate subject which is calculated to enforce the absolute necessity that exists of a reformation in our hospitals and also the general good likely to arise from it cannot be considered as uninteresting or unimportant  should the adoption of the foregoing hints of reformation be thought likely to conduce to the obtaining the ends proposed the humane committee would in the exercise of their newinvested authority inavoidably be presented with numberless objects of correction and reformation at the same time this consideration restrains a great many particulars which i otherwise would here recommend to their attention but should i have the happiness to see that these labors of mine should be productive of an enquiry into the abuses alluded to and that any consequent resolutions should be entered into for the final accomplishment of so benevolent a purpose i will cheerfully give any assistance in the power of my circumscribed abilities toward suggesting or digesting a plan for the better disposition and arrangement of the reformation here recommended and for the facilitating and carrying into execution such a scheme in all its possible latitude and with as little additional expense as may be to the respective institutions  there is shortly it is reported a general regulation and reformation intended to take place in our prisons and work houses by a revision of the statutes relating to them i devoutly wish it may be true for humanity calls loudly for it why should the temporary legislators of hospitals be backward in setting or copying so laudable an example the objects in hospitals have a stronger claim to compassion than either the inhabitants of prisons or workhouses upon this very interesting ground of humanity  that the latter are generally in ealth and the former generally first or  pain and it will i think be admi without hesitation that sickness and corpoal pain are the bitterest ingredients in the  cup of life and consequently more  mdiate objects of human compassion  subordinate calamities incident  for  beneath the weight of sickness and of pain the body and mind an equal share sustain   finis
