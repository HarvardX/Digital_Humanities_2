information with pleasure but the following work is more immediately calculated for the peculiar convenience of the traveller and is principally designed as a local guide to strangers who may be tempted to visit the curious and entertaining particulars which it professes to describe and illustrate  for the satisfaction of the reader it may be necessary still further to premise that our account is compiled from the best private information from an attentive examination on the spot and from a variety of materials relating to the subject incidentally dispersed in different books which have been carefully collected and succinctly digested to reader our detail still more complete and authentic we have consulted two folio volumes written on vellum belonging to the cathedral church of winchester containing the acts of the pontificate of william of wykeham whose benefactions make so conspicuous a figure in the history of winchester it is called registrum wykeham and begins with the

crostaff a tankard silvergilt a basin and yeure of silver and a turkey carpet  besides these we have been favored with the perusal of several original evidences and authentic papers  the city winchester appears to have been a city of considerable note among the ancient britons by whom it was called caer guen or the white city from its situation upon a chalky soil many reputable historians report that it was founded by ludor rous hudibras     years before the birth of christ it afterward became a roman station and probably one of their cities as appears from the discovery of a pavement of brick and coins of constantine the great found in digging the foundaton of the royal palace of charles ii camden but p    ed cib tells us that during the saxon heptarchy the west saxon kings

a fosse of prodigious breadth and depth but to the meadows which were easily floated by the river such a defense was thought unnecessary the vacant spaces within the walls now formed into gardens demonstrate that the town has been greatly depopulated  near the west gate we survey the ruins of a strong and stately castle which according to tradition was built by king arthur anno dom     and was a place of remarkable defense in the reign of king stephen against whose attacks it was bravely maintained by maud the empress for a considerable time by a plan of it drawn anno dom    0 it appears to have been a quadrangular structure with a tower at each angle and by a small sketch in speed anno dom      we discover that the entrance from the west was over a bridge thrown across the western fosse

but at present the chapel of which i have been just speaking is appropriated to this purpose at the end hangs what is commonly called king arthurs round table which is    feet in diameter it would be needless to multiply authorities for a proof that this table is of modern date however it is of higher antiquity than it is commonly supposed to be for paulus jovius descript region  who wrote above two hundred years ago relates that it was shown to the emperor charles v and that at that time many marks of its antiquity had been destroyed the names of the knights having been then just written afresh and the whole table with its ornaments newly repaired tournaments being often held at winchester before the court and parliament this table might probably have been used on those occasions for entertaining the combatants which on that account was properly inscribed with the names of arthurs twentyfour knights either in commemoration of that prince who was the reputed founder and patron of tilts and tournaments or because he was supposed to have established these martial sports at winchester in later times these exercises were called mensa rotunda thom walsing edit i page    see also seldom de duello page    works fol vol iii  the names of the knights inscribed on the table are much the same as those we find in an old romance concerning king arthur called morte arthur etc printed

palace only the shell of which was finished a cupola was designed  0 feet higher than the roof which would have been seen at sea and a street was intended leading from the west end of the cathedral to the center of the front the length of the whole is     feet a park was also projected ten miles in circumserence but the death of the king prevented the progress and execution of this noble plan the palace is at present converted into a commodious prison for french prisoners of war  the city of winchester contains eight parish churches it had formerly    or more many of which were suppressed by

middle of the high street is an elegant gothic structure    feet high and as i conjecture of the age of henry vi  besides the college and cathedral which will be separately described there have been several religious foundations in this city the most eminent was hydeabby for benedictines which stood for  00 years within the precincts of st swythuns and on a quarrel between the two societies was

of mendicant friars the augustine friars were just without the south gate on the left in the road to southampton the gray friars or minors on the right just with the east gate the dominicans on the north within the city  to these we may add the prior and brethren of st peter in the church of st maurice and the church of st mary calendar  we shall close our account of the city with a description of the hospital of st cross which stands about half a mile southward of the town  this from lowths life of wykeham edit   page    tanners account varies in one or two circumstances ut supra page     hospital was founded by henry de blois bishop of winchester and brother of king stephen about the year      for the maintenance of thirteen poor men who likewise ordained that one hundred other poor persons should be entertained here every day at dinner in a place appointed for that purpose called hundredmenneshall of these there were always thirteen of the poorer scholars of the great grammar school of winchester but this institution of daily feeding the one hundred poor was not of long continuance for it was abrogated before the reign of richard ii and instead of it an establishment was substituted of four priests thirteen secular clerks and four choristers in the year      cardinal beaufort bishop of winchester made ample additions to the hospital for the maintenance of two priests thirtyfive brethren and three sisters besides those of the original foundation he gave his new constitution the name of the alms house of noble poverty by which it appears that he designed the house for the relief of decayed gentlemen this hospital though considerably diminished in it is revenues still subsists on the remains of both endowments  the building consists of one extensive irregular court the church which was built in the reign of king stephen by the first founder is a curious remain of saxon architecture we have some examples of the ancient saxon manner which was with peers or round pillars much stronger than tuscan roundheaded arches and windows such was winchestercathedral of old and such at this day the royal chapel in the white tower at london the chapel of st crosses

is remarkably lofty on each side of the altar are handsome screens of spire work in stone the names of all the officers belonging to the hospital about ad      are carved on a desk in the chancel among which we find those of a chanter and singing men but at present there is no provision for a choir  the great west window the construction of which is in a more ornamental style than any of the rest was probably altered to it is present form by the second founder cardinal beaufort it has some remains of painted glass with an inscription nothing of which is legible or at least intelligible at present except the words nicholas bedford in a south window of the cross i will are these arms viz gules three lions heads passant fl de lis reversed or three eagles quartering barry and a chief in an east window of the north transept we find an ave maria with some fragments of painted glass under which is orate pro anima ricardi de buteshall if i am right in the name which is the most imperfect part he was master of the hospital a d       on the roof of the nave are two cheverons the arms of wykeham between three roses also the arms of france and england quartered the coat between these two

a cross pat s quart fr and england a board gobon the same are over the gate i suppose for cardinal beaufort the lodgings of the master contiguous to the refectory are spacious and decent on the east side of the court is this inscription henricus compton episcopus he was master here and promoted ad      to the sea of oxford and afterward to that of london we likewise find his initials on the stables hc with the year      in the eastern gallery and in other places we frequently read dilexi sapientiam rs   0  this is the memorial of roger or robert sherborn master of the hospital and from hence preferred to the bishopric of st davids he was afterward bishop of chichester and founded in that cathedral church four prebends for which those alone are qualified who are or have been fellows of new college in oxford the gateway of the hospital is formed in a square stately tower on one side of which is the statue of the cardinal praying to another figure now destroyed this tower was probably built by the cardinal  about the year    0 lowth ut supra the revenues of this ample foundation were valued at  00 l per ann at which time the yearly salary of the master was estimated at   l   s   d its second founder cardinal beaufort added to the former endowment an annual augmentation of  00 l besides several impropriations  the college the college of st mary of winchester commonly called winchester college is situated to the south east of the cathedral just without the city wall the front is extended to the length of     feet and consists of offices on the west side of the gateway and of a part of the wardens lodgings on the east under the gateway the tower of which is adorned with a statue of the virgin mary we enter the first court on the left are the wardens lodgings which are commodious and ample that part of them which fronts the garden was erected at the expense of warden nicholas  the year      that part which faces the street was raised in the wardenship of dr john harmar as appears by the initials jh and the date      the north front of the second quadrangle loses much of its intended effect by means of another part of these lodgings built ad      which runs at right angles against it on the left  we enter the second quadrangle under a stately tower called the middle gate adorned with the statues of the founder the virgin mary and an angel this court is    feet over the lower rooms on either side of the gateway and of the whole eastern side of this court are the lodging rooms of the scholars over which are the apartments of the fellows the stair case adjoining to the north west angle leads to the apartments of the schoolmaster which are spacious and elegantly furnished on the west is the kitchen and a convenient conduit  the whole south side is magnificently formed by the chapel and hall the latter is a noble gothic room    feet in length and    in breadth in which the scholars dine at twelve and sup at six in the uppermost window on the north side are the arms of england and of the marquis of winchester  the chapel is equal to most and superior to many in our universities whether we regard its dimensions its furniture and the solemnity which strikes us at our entrance it is  0  feet long and    broad the screen stalls and altarpiece which is of the ionic order were executed in the wardenship of dr nicholas abovementioned the altar is adorned with a beautiful salutation piece painted by le moine and given by the reverend dr burton the present publicspirited and learned head master the branches are the gift of the reverend mr christopher air formerly usher the east window is painted with the genealogy of christ and has been celebrated in an elegant poem written by the reverend dr lowth prebendary of durham which is printed in an admired collection of english poems entitled the union printed for r baldwin in paternoster row  the rest of the windows are decorated with the pourtraits of saints with their names underwritten together with the following inscription which is in many places at present destroyed  orate pro anima wilhelmi de wykeham fundatoris istius collegii on the north side stands the organ the roof is covered with a cieling of wood in imitation of arched stone work without which the height would be too great as it is at new college chapel in oxford where such a cieling was probably originally intended at least the present rafter work of that noble chapel is by no means equal to the magnificence of the rest this cieling seems to have been finished about the time of that which covers the presbytery in the cathedral as it is exactly of the same workmanship  in this chapel choir service is performed at eight and five on sundays and holidays and at five on their preceding eves the choir consists of three chaplains three clerks one organist and sixteen choristers  in the ante chapel is a recess to the south over part of which stands the tower containing five bells this addition which exhibits a more modern style of architecture seems to have been erected in the reign of henry vi together with the tower by william of wainfleet bishop of winchester whose arms are cut in the roof together with the following arms and rebuses  two cheverons between three roses wykeham lions passant quartering a fret giron of    in fess a rose three sugar loaves over it a

which by length of time are rendered unintelligible  one of the windows belonging to this recess has been lately closed up and the other is greatly defaced but the paintings and inscriptions of both having been fortunately preserved by anthony wood the oxford antiquary who visited this college in february      i shall insert them from his original mss which has never yet been printed the curious

first charter established only a warden and seventy scholars which was the whole society who took formal possession of the college as abovementioned and who before the building was finished were provided with lodgings in the parish of st john upon the hill the founder obtained a second charter for the establishment of the ten fellows and officers of the choir see the charters in dugd mon vol

appears by fox of whose respective benefactions and alterations i shall find a proper occasion hereafter to speak more particularly  notwithstanding the positive assertions above concerning walkelynes entire demolition of the old church i am persuaded that the lowbuilt isles at the east end of the choir existed before the time of walkelyne and are a part of the old church erected by the saxon kings this appears from several demonstrative proofs for they are in a more simple and confined style of architecture than any part of walkelynes new work and admitting that walkelyne demolished great part of the old church it seems probable that he should leave that part of it standing in which many of the saxon kings and bishops his predecessors are confessedly buried another evidence of this hypothesis are the crypts on which these low isles stand to this day and which as appears from a latin epistle in verse of wolstan apud leland collecta vol i page      precentor of the church to aelphege bishop of winchester ad     were constructed by ethelwold in the reign of king edgar he is speaking of ethelwolds rebuilding the church  insuper occultas studuistis and addere cryptas these crypts now remaining if they do not prove the antiquity of the building they support yet at least they point out the original situation of the church and invalidate those testimonies which assert that walkelyne entirely demolished the old church and chose a new groundplot for his new structure  there is another circumstance mentioned by rudbourne page   0     apud whart angl sacr vol i  which still further corroborates my supposition he observes that william rufus was buried in the choir under a tower which fell down a few years afterward and that in the place of it walkelyn erected the present tower he adds that walkelyn did not build this tower in his lifetime but committed the care of it to his executors who finished it after his death  the writer of the epistle abovementioned who lived ad     tells us that ethelwold introduced a watercourse into the priory now corruptly called the logpond   hucque dulcia piscosae flumina traxit aquae secessusque sic laci penetrant secreta domorum

greatness and extent which are peculiar to the proportions of gothic architecture a judicious and entertaining passage from lowths life of wykeham will here be properly introduced  this i will was originally of the saxon architecture not greatly differing from the roman with round pillars much stronger than doric or tuscan or square piers adorned with small pillars roundheaded arches and windows and plain walls on the outside without buttresses as appears by the crossile and tower which remain of it to this day the nave of the church had been for some time in a bad condition bishop edyngdon undertook to repair it in the latter part of his time and by his will ordered his executors to finish what he had begun and whether in pursuance of his design and by his benefaction or otherwise it appears that in the year      some work of this kind was carrying on at a great expense however wykeham upon due consideration and survey found it either so decayed and infirm or else so mean in its appearance and so much below the dignity of one of the first episcopal sees in the kingdom that he determined to take down the whole from the tower westward and to rebuild it both in a stronger and more magnificent manner this great work he undertook in the year      and entered upon it the beginning of the next year upon the following conditions stipulated between him and the prior and convent who acquit the bishop of all obligation to it and acknowledge it as proceeding from his mere liberality and zeal for the honor of god they agree to find the whole scaffolding necessary for the work they give the bishop free leave to dig and to carry away chalk and sand from any of their lands as he shall think most convenient and useful for the same purpose and they allow the whole materials of the old building to be applied to the use of the new he employed william winford as architect simon membury was appointed surveyor of the work on the bishops part and john wait one of the monks controller on the part of the convent as the church of winchester is situated in low ground which without great precaution and expense affords no very sure foundation for so weighty a structure wykeham thought it safest to confine himself to the plan of the former building and to make use of a foundation already tried and subject to no hazard he even chose to apply to his purpose some part of the lower order of pillars of the old church though his design was in a different style of architecture that which we commonly call gothic with pointed arches and windows without keystones and pillars consisting of an assemblage of many small ones closely connected together but which is more properly saracen for such was its origin the crusades gave us an idea of this form of architecture which afterward prevailed throughout europe the pillars or piers of the old building which he made use of were about sixteen feet in height of the same form with those in the east side of the northern crossile these he carried up higher according to the new design altering their form but retaining their strength and adopting them as a firm basis for his own work the new pillars are nearly equal in bulk to the old ones and the intercolumniation remains much the same these circumstances in which stability and security were very wisely in the first place consulted have been attended however with some inconvenience as it seems owing to them that this building has not that lightness and freedom and that elegance of proportion which might have been expected from wykehams known taste in architecture and from the style and manner of his other works in this kind of which we have evident examples in the chapels of both his colleges especially in the western part of that of new college in oxford which is remarkably beautiful to the further disadvantage of its present appearance an alteration which could not then be foreseen has since happened at that time the buildings of the monastery covered the whole south side of the church so that it seemed needless to be at a great expense upon ornaments in that part which was like to be for ever concealed by the demolition of the monastery this side is now laid open and discovers a defect of buttresses and pinnacles with which the north side which was then the only one in view is properly urnished another alteration of the same kind has been made in inside and with the like effect immediately before the entrance of the choir stood the vestry which extending from side to side of the nave prevented the entire conformation of those pillars against which it rested to the new design but at the same time concealed the irregularity in the time of charles the first this was pulled down and the present beautiful skreen the work of inigo jones was erected but no care was taken by an easy and obvious alteration to correct a deformity which was then uncovered and still continues to disgrace the building in a part which of all others is the most frequently exposed to observation however with its defects which appear thus to be owing partly to an accidental and unforeseen change of circumstances partly to the care of avoiding greater inconveniences there is no fabric of its kind in england after those of york and lincoln which excells this part of the cathedral church of winchester in greatness stateliness and majesty this great pile took up about ten years in erecting and was but just finished when the bishop died he had provided in his will for the entire completion of his design by his executors in case of his death and allotted   00 marks for what then remained to be done besides  00 marks for the glass windows this was about a year and half before it was finished by which some sort of estimate may be made of the whole expense lowths life of wykeham page  0    from this i will by a stately flight of eight steps we approach the choir the screen abovementioned is of the composite order and adorned

wrought and ornamented we find the same opening in the tower of st cross built about the same time it was undoubtedly looked upon as a beauty in the architecture and had in some measure the same effect as the louvre or open lantern formerly used in great halls height of roof in the inside was also a favorite circumstance in structure of this sort which was produced from this expedient in a very striking degree the arms and initials of the king with those of his queen mary and of john young dean at that time are introduced among the ornaments of the vaulting which is of wood the two

perhaps might be interred in it he seems to have born some relation to it for opposite to it are the remains of a canopy under which the presses for the ch vestments are placed which formerly seems to have been the covering of stalls and still preserves in the cornice the initial letters of silkestedes name often repeated these i suppose belonged originally to the opposite chapel it is not unlikely that silkestede altered the windows on this side of the transept for on the library window contiguous to them on the outside is carved ts for thomas silkestede as i have before observed the elegant screen of this little chapel was at least erected by this prior for on it is carved in large ornamented gothic capitals  c hd ma s s on the north side of the virgin marys chapel is a small chapel perhaps dedicated to s michael as the pourtraiture of that angel appears in many parts of the roof  about the middle of the great western i will stands an ancient font it is a square massy block of jetcoloured marble in which a circular basin is formed for the water it is three feet three inches over and supported by a plain pedestal of stone the sides of the square are embellished with rude bass relievos which seem to represent the miracles of some saint belonging to this church if we may judge from the style of the architecture introduced in the carving on the south side this singular monument of antiquity was the workmanship of the saxon times  in the northern transept are some imperfect traces of ancient painting supposed to represent the combat of guy earl of warwick with the danish champion before mentioned mention is made of a painting in the queens chapel at winchester the king to the sheriff of hants  cause to be painted in the queens chapel at winchester upon the gableend toward the west the image of st christopher who holds in his arms our blessed savior from a latin record in the court of liveries    henry iii m   citat apud stukeley palaeograph brit no   page    i presume this was some chapel in the castle of winchester where the royal family resided     by way of recapitulating what has been said concerning the building this church i shall observe that it contains three styles of architecture agreeable to the taste of the three different ages in the progress of which it grew to the present perfection the first is the saxon of which is the tower the transept and the eastern isles for the most part built or begun by walkelyne the second is the gothic simply so called of which are the western isles and west front erected by wykeham the third is the ornamental or improved gothic which began about the reign of henry vi and of which the presbytery side isles and outward east end of the choir by fox as well as our ladys chapel by silkestede are elegant specimens  tombs and monumental inscriptions  on the south partition wall of the presbytery the first chest from the altar has this inscription  edredus rex obiit anno     hic pius in tumulo rex edredus requiescit qui has britonum terras rexerat egregie on the second is inscribed  edmundus rex obiit quem theca haec retinet edmundum suscipe christ qui vivente patre regia sceptra tulit the third chest formerly contained the bones of canutus and of william rufus who was interred below this chest had once this inscription  hic jacent ossa cnutonis et willelmi rufi the present inscription is this  in hac et altera e regione cista reliquiae sunt ossium canuti et rufi regum emmae reginae winae et alwini episcoporum  on the first chest on the outside of the north partition wall  rex kingilsus obiit     on the choir side of the chest  adulphus rex obiit     on the outside  kingulsti in cista hac simul offa jacent et adulphi alter fundator hic benefactor erat on the second chest  adulphus rex obiit     on the outside of the same  egbertus obiit     hic rex egbertus pausat cum rege kenulpho nobis egregie munera uterque tulit the third chest formerly contained the bones of bishop wina  hic jacent ossa winac episcopi with bishop winas were enclosed the bones of stigand at first bishop of winchester afterward translated to the sea of canterbury ad  0   and on the north side of the coffin was this inscription  hic jacet stigandus archiepiscopus but at present this inscription is placed thereon  in hac cista ad      promiscue recondita sunt ossa principum et praelatorum sacrilega barbary dispersa ad       under the second chest on the south wall we read the following inscription  intus est corpus ricardi willielmi conquestoris filii et beorniae ducis  under the same wall under the second chest is entombed the heart of ethelmarus bishop of winchester with this inscription  obiit anno      corpus ethelmari cujus cor nunc tenet istud saxum parisiis morte datur tumulo near the choir entrance in the same wall is this inscription  intus est cor nicolai olim wintoniensis episcopi cujus corpus est apud waverly  on the north side of the wall formerly stood a fourth chest containing the bones of the bishops elmstan and kynulphus with this inscription  pontifices haec capsa duos duos tenet incineratos primus elmstanus huic successorque kynulphus the monument of bishop alfimus was on the same wall eastward from bishop elmstons with this inscription  alfymus plumbo praesul requiescit in isto under kingulstuss chest in the same wall is this inscription  qui jacet hic regni sceptrum tulit hardicanutus emmae cnutonis gnatus et ipse fuit obiit ad iiiio in the same wall  alwinus obiit  0   hic jacet alwini corpus qui munera nobis contuli egregia parcito christ pio in the same wall within the choir is this inscription for queen emma  hic emmam cista reginam continet ista duxit etheldredus rex hanc et postea cnutus edwardum parit haec ac hardicanutum quatuor hos reges haec vidit sceptra tenentes anglorum regum fuit haec sic matter et uxor under the monument of bishop alfimus we read this inscription  defuncti corpus tumulus tenet iste johannis points sometimes called john de pontissara who built st elisabeths college mentioned supr page     wintoniae praesulis eximii obiit anno   0  in the wall on the same side under the chest of wina is the monument of bishop toclive with this inscription  praefulis egregii pausant his membra ricardi toclive cui summi gaudia sunto poli obiit anno      at the east end of the southern partition lies the body of richard fox bishop of winchester the pious founder of corpus christi college in oxford under a shrine which is a most finished specimen of the improved ornamental gothic adjoining to the shrine is a small private oratory built with the rest which he usually frequented for his devotion and which is still called bishop foxs study he died ad       at the east end of the northern partition wall is interred stephen gardener bishop of this see under a shrine of plain architecture he died ad      the recumbent figure of the bishop was much injured in the civil wars  behind the sanctum sanctorum is a traverse wall at the bottom of which we discern the entrance into the vault where the saxon kings already mentioned were first buried over it is this inscription  sancta maria et dominus jesus over the entrance from end to end are these names  kyngulstus rex kinewaldus rex adulphus rex edwardus rex senior s birinus episcopus egbertus rex aluredus rex filius ejus athelstanus rex filius ejus  edredus rex edgar rex emma regina alwinus episcopus etheldredus rex s edwardus rex filius ejus canutus rex hardicanutus filius ejus  over each name is a well ornamented niche and pedestal under the whole is this inscription  corpora sanctorum sunt hic in pace sepulta ex meritis quorum fulgent miracula multa the niches abovementioned seem to have made or ornamented by fox the arms above are of charles i  in the area on the east side of this wall is a sumptuous and stately monument to the memory of henry beaufort cardinal of st eusebius and bishop of winchester his effigies is represented in the cardinals habit the inscription is now totally lost this being all according to godwyn that remained legible near two hundred years ago  tribularer si nescirem misericordias tuas he was a liberal benefactor to the hospital of st cross near this city as i have before observed and died ad       opposite to it and designed in evident imitation of it is the magnificent shrine and monument of william wainfleet bishop of winchester the munificent founder of magdalen college in oxford he is represented on the tomb in his episcopal habit grasping his heart between his hands the roof and spire work of the shrine is perhaps superior in exuberance of ornament and height of finishing to any structure of the same kind it was gratefully repaired by magdalen college ad      hedied ad       westward of this are the traces of the effigies of a bishop said to be st swythun  near these is a monument raised somewhat higher than the pavement said to be that of lucius the first christian king it has no inscription to illustrate this improbable conjecture  at the bottom of the steps on the south side of the choir are two very ancient monuments one of which has no inscription the other belongs to a prior of the convent who died ad      and is thus inscribed  hic jacet williemus de basing quondam prior istius ecclesiae cujus animae propitietur deus and qui pro anima ejus oraverit tres annos and quinquaginta dies indulgentiae percipiet  his predecessor may with equal probability be the prior here interred whose name was likewise william de basynge and who died ad       near the stone pulpit in the body of the church we read the following epitaph to the first dean of this cathedral  wilhelmus kingsmell prior ultimus decanus almost contiguous is the following inscription  robertus horn theologiae doctoreximius quondam christi caufa exul deinde episcopus winton pie obiit in domino jun      0 episcopatus sui anno     opposite to the former upon another marble this inscription appears  d johannes watson hujus ecclesiae winton praebendarius decanus ac deinde episcopus prudentissimus pater vir optimus praecipue erga inopes misicors obiit in domino januar    anno aetatis suae    episcopatus         nearer the choir is the tomb of william of edingdon bishop of winchester with this epitaph  edyndon natus wilhelmus hic est tumulatus praesul praegratus in wintonia cathedratus qui pertranfitis ejus memorare velitis providus and mitis anfit cum mill peritis pervigil anglorum fuit adjutor populorum dulcis egenorum pater and protector eorum mc tribus junctum post lxv fit i punctum octava sanctum notat hunc octobris inunctum      not far from the little south door is the superb tomb and shrine of william of wykeham bishop of winchester the munificent founder of winchester college and of new college in oxford who died ad   0  his nobler shrine is the magnificent i will under which he lies entombed and which was erected at his expense the figure of the bishop is remarkably fresh and well preserved but the shrine was much injured by the presbyterians this grand mausoleum is placed on the very spot on which an altar stood where wykeham when a boy constantly frequented a mass called pekismass lowths wykeham page      at the feet of the bishop are three small figures of benedictine monks and at his head two angels this epitaph encompasses the tomb  wilhelmus dictus wickham jacet hic nece victus istius ecclesiae praesul reparavit eamque largus erat dapifer probat hoc cum divite pauper consiliis pariter regni fuerat been dexter hunc docet esse pium fundatio collegiorum oxoniae primum stat wintoniaeque secundum jugiter oretis tumulum quicunqque videtis pro tantis meritis quod sit sibi vita perenni near the choir is the figure of a martial personage which is much defaced we learn his name from the following inscription  hic jacet willielmus comes de insula besides the saxon kings already recited ethelwulf edsed and edwin were interred in this church together with some of its more ancient bishops not yet mentioned viz denewulf ewold brithwald walkelyne it is d that he was buried before the high altar ad      but t among his many curious manuscript insertions in le s fast  bibl bodl oxon in museola bibliothecarii acquaints us that he was buried at ivinghoe co bucks a manor belonging to the bishop of winchester where he founded a nunnery there is a statue in that church which the inhabitants suppose to be his see mon angl t   page   0 ivinghoe was or is in the patronage of the bishop of winchester henry de bloys etc  the more modern monuments and inscripscriptions of this church which are very numerous are here purposely omitted  a formal and entire recital of them would have exceeded the limits of our plan and extended our work to a tedious and perhaps unnecessary prolixity those i have described are most likely to engage the attention of curious observers and their inscriptions are such as are not immediately obvious to every spectator  from this survey of the inside of the church we would conduct the spectator to the west end which is a striking specimen of the massy gothic manner it is finished with two small side spires and a central pinnacle with a niche containing an episcopal statue of william of wykeham from whose ample beneficence this venerable pile derives its principal magnificence and beauty  finis
