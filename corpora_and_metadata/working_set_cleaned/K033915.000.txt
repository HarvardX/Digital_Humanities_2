britannia triumphans  or the empire savd and europe delivered by the success of her majestys forces under the wise and heroic conduct of his grace the duke of marlborough  a poem by mr dennis  ab jove principium musae virg  london printed for j nutt near stationers hall   0   to her most sacred majesty anne queen of great britain france and ireland the true defender of the protestant faith  the great supporter of the liberties of europe  the illustrious maintainer of the honor of the english nation and  the victorious asserter of the empire of the ocean  the following poem  that it may live with the immortality of her renown is with all humility dedicated by her  most humble most faithful and most dutiful subject and servant john dennis  preface i must confess i cannot in the beginning of this preface bespeak the readers good opinion by informing him that i was put upon the following work by the command of some great man who has power and interest my friends can bear me witness that i wanted no such incitement that as soon as ever i heard of the victory i resolved upon writing the verses and though my interest at that time as all who know me know very well extremely required that i should do something else yet it was enough for me that i looked upon my self to be obliged to do this by the duty which i owe to the public which i have always preferred before my interest thus i quickly came to a resolution of writing the following verses but as to the form and the manner of them i remained something doubtful till i was determined by her majestys proclamation for a general thanksgiving and that joined to the consideration of reducing some former critical speculations into practice made me resolve as far i was able to make the following verses turn upon religion my design when i began them was to publish them upon the  th of september but besides that ill health intervening caused delay i soon found to my sorrow that a poem is not so easily composed as a prayer  if the following poem has any degree of force or elevation in it the judicious reader will easily discern that it owes them in a great measure to the religion which is mingled with it for religion as i have formerly proved is the best and most solid foundation of a great and lofty spirit in poetry  if any one objects that the religion is double in the following poem he will find upon a more strict enquiry that he is mistaken for though i have made the danube a person that is not making him a heathen god david has done the same thing by jordan and deborah by kishon  i resolved to make the religion that is mingled with the following verses as poetical as i could without making it pagan though fame is called a goddess there i by no means design the goddess of the ancient poets but an angel or celestial spirit for which i have the authority of milton who in the seventh book of his poem by urania does not mean the heathen muse though he calls her goddess but an angel or celestial spirit and he there makes a second invocation which is addressed to her after he has invoked god himself in the beginning of his poem it is true indeed angels have been always painted masculine but without either any sufficient reason or divine authority if they have bodies i see no reason why they may not be of both sexes if they have none i cannot imagine how they can be of either but a poet who must of necessity give them bodies before they can be proper machines for him since he gives them the beauty of women may very well give them the sex too  the following verses were written without rhyme which i have a long time believed to be below the majesty of the greater poetry for which i have the authority of three eminent poets mr milton my lord roscommon and mr dryden the reader may see mr miltons sentiments in the preface to his paradise lost and mr drydens and my lord roscommons before the beginning and at the end of the essay on translated verse  but only the humble or the weak will yield to meet human authority they who are conceited of their own understandings will submit to reason alone and yet methinks the former authorities carry reason along with them for they who best understand a controversy if they have sincerity are fittest to decide it now the sincerity of the three forementioned writers in relation to rhyme ought never to be called in question for mr dryden and my lord roscommon are known to have exploded it at the very time that they wrote in it and mr milton was very well known to be one who would not deceive either himself or his reader it therefore follows that those three gentlemen had less understanding of the efficacy of poetry and the power of numbers than our vulgar readers who are fond of rhyme or that rhyme was very justly condemned by them  we shall now with as much brevity as we can give some reasons that are independent of authority why rhyme must of necessity debase the majesty and weaken the spirit of the greater poetry which bceause the arguments are entirely new may not perhaps be disagreeable to those who have a taste of poetry  the sentiments in poetry ereate the spirit or the passion which are but two words for the same thing and the spirit or passion produces the expression and begets the harmony now it is the expression which shows the spirit and it is the harmony which causes it to make its utmost impression and when all these things are adjusted when the sentiments are adapted to the subject the spirit or passion in a just degree to the sentiments and the harmony and the expression to the particular kind and degree of spirit or passion why then the result of all this is what the men of art call perfection or the truth of nature i know indeed very well that expression and harmony go together because the expression includes the harmony yet for the better clearing of the matter we shall distinctly treat of them  this then is certain that every sentiment or thought has a degree of spirit or passion or fire call it what you please which is proper to it and every thing above or below that degree is utterly wrong now this is as certain that there is but just one expression which can convey that spirit or passion in its true proportion and every thing that is not that one expression is false and weakens the spirit and obscures the sentiment now nature whose sagacity is most admirable and her operations of celerity almost infinite and who goes the shortest way to her works very often dictates that expression at first especially in the greater poetry where the imagination is always warm and the thoughts are always flowing  but this is plain from common experience that the expression which nature dictates at first and whieh is powerful sounding significant and in short the true one is very often altered upon the account of the rhyme and a word or two are changed which destroys its beauty and the greater part of its force makes it less strong less sounding less significant and weakens the spirit and sets the sentiment in a false light from whence it follows that rhyme in the greater poetry running counter to nature must be against art  but as every sentiment has but one particular expression which of right belongs to it so that expression has but one particular harmony which is adapted to that peculiar degree of spirit which naturally attends on the sentiment now nature who as we observed before is wonderful in her operations very often in the greater poetry dictates that harmony together with the expression every poet must know by experience that the harmony which we naturally slide into in the greater poetry is that of blank verse which whenever we are obliged to alter to introduce the rhyme we for the most part impair the harmony infeeble the expression debase the spirit and set the sentiment in a wrong view  there can be no nearer relation between any two things in the world than there is in writing between passion and harmony harmony may be said to be both the father and the child of passion it is produced by it and begets it and the more pathetick any discourse is the more harmonious it must of necessity be even of discourses in prose those are the most musical which are the most passionate the orations of cicero have more harmonious periods than his philosophical discourses and therefore poetry is more harmonious than prose because it is more pathetick and the more pathetick poetry is the greater must be its harmony and therefore the spirit the passion the fire or the flame being very great in the greater poetry and sometimes very violent have as it were a natural tendency to the producing perfect harmony  but rhyme being utterly false in harmony as we shall show immediately must be contrary to true passion and to the greater poetry rhyme is the same thing in relation to harmony that a pun is in relation to wit as a pun is false wit or a foolish affectation of wit rhyme is false harmony or an affectation of harmony rhyme may not so absurdly be said to be the pun of harmony  there are in our english poetry four things which have been thought to cndouce to harmony which are number measure cadence and rhyme of these the three first consist of several different sounds which are dependant one of another  rhyme is wholly independent of the other three and consists in the greater poetry but of two sounds which are unisons now i appeal to all the masters of music if unisons can make any harmony harmony is the agreement of different sounds and the perfection of harmony is the agreement of discordant sound by the mediation of others and there is a great deal of chromatick harmony in poetry as well as in music and such particularly is a great deal of virgils harmony well then rhyme consisting of unisons can have no harmony in it self and being independent of numbers cadence and measure can never promote the harmony which they produce and a poets constant application to rhyme diverts his application in a great degree from numbers measure and cadence and consequently is a severe restraint upon the three producers of harmony and as it diverts the application of the writer so by alluring the attention of vulgar readers it diverts them from the other three  but besides that rhyme by the constraint that it puts upon the writer impairs the beauty and the natural force of the expression and the power of true harmony it has something effeminate in its jingling nature and emasculates our english verse and consequently is utterly unsit for the greater poetry english tragedies that have been writ in rhyme most of them roll upon love the soul of a tragic poet who has given himself up to rhyme has seldom been capable of terror or majesty or the instruction of the noblest philosophy or any thing that is truly great  besides rhyme has in its nature something that is low and comical and the more of rhyme there is in a verse the nearer it comes to the comic double rimes are more comical than the single and treble ones than either a rhyme alone is very often a jest as all who are acquainted with hudibras very well know but never any one was extravagant enough to affirm that there was any thing great and noble in rhyme alone  but the last consideration but one viz the effeminacy of rhyme and the influence which it had upon tragedy brings me to enquire further into the matter of fact and to add the proof of experience to those which we have drawn from authority and reason for men of sense are too proud to yield to authority and fools are too weak to submit to reason but experience which never deceived any one carries conviction both for the one and the other  the matter of fact then is that most of our plays that have been writ in rhyme have been most abominably out of nature and where in rhyme we have one tolerable tragedy in blank verse we have ten so that those very numerical persons who declare for rhyme in other kinds of poetry are utterly against it in tragedy but not only the tragedies in blank verse are the best but the very best of our epick poems is writ in the same verse and that is the paradise lost of milton and though this may in some measure be attributed to the admirable and extraordinary choice of the subject yet i am satisfied that something of its excellence is owing to the blank verse for mr dryden has handled the very same subject in rhyme but has fallen so infinitely short of the sublimity the majesty the vehemence and the other great qualities of milton that they are never to be named together  well but since it is manifest from what has been said that rhyme is prejudicial both to poetry and to true harmony the reader may very naturally enquire how it came at first to be introduced into our english verse why milton has given a very good account of that it was says he the invention of a barbarous age to set of wretched matter and lame meeter when rhyme was first introduced into this island the language was without harmony and the writers were without genius and rhyme after all that has been said against it must be allowed to be an admirable invention to conceal the want of spirit and the want of harmony verse with rhyme seems to me to be like the music of a bagpipe where the drone by continually stunning your ears hinders you from nicely enquiring into the notes and what a dexterous expedient rhyme is to conceal the want of genius may appear abundantly from most of the riming plays that were writ and acted in king charles the seconds time in most of which it is very plain that rhyme made extravagant simile pass for nature abominable fustan for fine language ridiculous rant for great spirit and senseless whining for true passion well but is our language now without harmony so far from that that it is the most musical perhaps of the western are now our writers without genius no certainly not all of them but why does rhyme continue then why is it writ why does it please why in the first place there are thousands who read rhyme who never so much as heard of blank verse and when we consider those who have heard of it we have little reason to wonder that a great many of them can by no means taste it if we reflect upon the prevalence of prejudice and the force of custom they who read poetry have been used to rhyme from their infancy and what cannot long habititude render agreeable let us instance particularly in sounds enquire of the inhabitants of london bridge if the fall of the water there is not grown as it were natural to them by long use ask them if it be not necessary either to compose their spirits or to keep them up if they do not sleep with the more soundness for it and wake with the more cheerfulness examine a fellow who has lived all his life in a papermill and he shall assure you that not only the running round of the wheels and the hurrying noise of the mill but even the insupportable jangling of the cogs is a thing that sooths him is a thing that pleases him that he is melancholy when he is long out of the hearing of it and even weary and sick of less tumultuons sounds nay ask even a fellow that has been bred to sawing of marble and he shall tell you that the sound which it makes is music to him and sawing of marble is next to riming the most impertinent noise in nature  after what has been said no man will wonder if readers who have all their life time been used to rhyme soon grow weary and sick of true harmony unless in case of a delicate ear which is so rare a gift of nature that it has been observed in every nation that harmony has been the very last thing that has been improved in poetry and as soon as in any nation the poetical harmony has grown perfect there the whole art of poetry has been accomplished  but to come from the readers of poetry to the writers these last are of two sorts the good and the bad the bad will certainly endeavor to maintain rhyme because rhyme does in some measure conceal their want of ear and their want of genius and is perhaps as necessary to the giving them a sort of a dull mettle and to the keeping them jogging on with their burden of dullness as bells are requisite to a carthorse or to a packhorse which very bells upon the course at new market would but render the racer ridiculous and would but stop his speed rhyme has the last of these effects upon a good writer and would have the first if it were not for the force of custom and it is the prevalence of custom alone that keeps good writers fast to it some great men who have writ well in spite of it serve to keep them in countenance for they little consider that those great men would have writ much better if they had writ without it besides the business of most even good writers is to make themselves popular there are but few very few of them who are capable of sacrificing their interest to their reputations and to the service which they do to the public by improving a noble art and they are rather vain than ambitious and had rather have a present general applause than a reputation in time to come lasting and universal  the universal use of blank verse in tragedy and be spreading fame of milton is a sure prognostic of he decaying reputation of rhyme a man may venure to foretell without incurring the censure of being  or visionary that before this century is half expired rhyme will be wholly banished from our greater poetry a custom that has been a long time generally received cannot be broke at once but nothing that is false can remain always it is true indeed prejudice and opinion and interest and vanity are frequent friends to falsehood but time the most sagacious of all critics will surely be a friend to truth  i desire that the reader would take notice that it is only in the greater poetry that i have been condemning rhyme it may do well enough in amorous verses and it may be necessary in some sorts of satyr for the following verses i do not pretend that because they are without rhyme they are without all defects if i had had more time they should have been less numerous and some expressions should not have been repeated not but that there are several repetitions in the following poem which were studied and sought for upon the acc ount ofgrace and ornament but there is here and there one which should have been omitted  the empire savd and europe deliverd up rouse your selves ye nations praise

thou can thou confine thy joy can thou the transports of thy praise restrain o no thou surely wilt grow wild with joy for thou have past at once beyond all hope to blissful rapture from extreme despair thou art delivered from a world of woe now naught but stormy shouts of joy are heard from rhaetian mountains to the northern main where lately naught but doleful sighs were heard and piercing groans and shrieks and rueful wails thou stately daughter of imperial rome were bound alas with most opprobrious bonds and basely threatened with impending rape thy trembling offspring helpless round thee ran and some shrieked piously aloud for aid while others wrung their wretched arms in vain some frighted into madness wildly stard and some looked on with stupid eyes aghast some swooning dying

sounding voice but sadly shaking his majestic head and casting a compassionating look strait hid himself within his thickest ooze what could thou do but shrink thy inglorious head within thy reeds and breath forth empty threats the windy births of melancholy rage when in the dreary horrors of the dark as often as night returned to imbrown thy waves thou like a bittern through thy doleful reeds complaindst in sullen and in moody groans expressing manly sorrow mixed with rage while thy brown billows sounding on thy shore and swinging slow with hoarse and sullen roar kept murmuring consort to thy threatening moan thou danube to the euxin durst not run to which insulting thou were wont to fly not to discharge the tribute of thy waves but carry terrors to the astonished main and make the crescent wear a deadlier pale now swiftly danube to the euxin fly and in thy rapid flight thy maker praise sound sound his praise at all thy extended mouths and let the attending euxin with a groan

with dreadful schellenbourgh which conquest opened the bavarian plains and made them to victorious flames a prey that their perfidious chief impatient grown under his countrys irritating spoil might force the backward french tengage as soon as marlborough the bright occasion found how great is he who in his ample thought could comprehend and afterward prepare by the illustrious toils of two campagns in which a large extent of ground he gained a strengthening barrier for the cautious dutch the astonishing design which all at once like magic changes all the face of war confounds the gallick tyrants proud designs dashes him headlong from his towering thoughts the mountains heaped on mountains in his head from which his proud imagination thought to drive our reason gods vicegerent

drew that mustered up black clouds tobscure the day and scare the nations with their dreadful gloom and then the tempest raged the thunder roared threatening the world with universal wreck at length the time ordained by fate is come the conquering heros come who breaks the charm and now the old enchanter looks aghast forlorn forsaken by the infernal powers and trembling at the impending wrath of

wondrous way daring yet wise thy conduct and resolved with all the judgment of discerning thought for the great juncture called for all thy speed the insulting french were overturning all and liberty in dire convulsions lay the empire foundring like a vast galloon that is by the tempest beat on every side when raging ocean in a general storm sends his sonorous billows to the assault savoy was sinking and the cruel french climbing the summits of the horrid alps embrued their murdering hands in guiltless blood even in the dreadful region of the thunder the lusitanian grumbled at the chance of adverse war and unexpected rout and fondly sighed for ancient leagues again with terror more then cold helvetia shook whiter than ambient snow her deadly hue and howling over her alpine rocks she ran though fenced with alpine rocks yet unsecure and trembling with pale fear her hoary hair that hung disheveled and the sport of winds she tore and would have wrung her wretched arms but her own sons for mercenary sums had bound her wretched arms with chains of gold and her majestic robe had rudely torn and naked left her to the killing cold a giant over the neighboring mountains stalked with mad deportment and with savage mein and cruel eyes that threatened instant fate italia ah how fallen how changed from her who won the world with her victorious arms with the wide ocean circumscribed

both unless united hopelesly undone england was plagued with an unnatural race a race expecting but the blow of fate the cutting off one slender royal thread that thread on which the christian world depends and then but long avert that hour ye heavens resolving infamously to betray their country to a foreign tyrants power these were the potent reasons for dispatch beside the undaunted spirit that appeared in the brave squadrons and batallions joined that flashed victorious lightning from their eyes which their great leader soon perceived with joy too wise their boiling ardor to restrain and check their fire impatient to be freed raised and inflamed by that stupendous march such as their famed forefathers never knew and which attracted the admiring eyes of all the gazing world and seemed to cry they had not time to cool but must do things to satisfy the expecting world so great as scarce their great forefathers ever performed besides it is not the valor of their troops to which the french their boasted conquests owe it is not their discipline which makes them dreadful it is treason subornation daggers poison besides a thousand other arts obscene could they by discipline or force prevail it is manifest they bravely would disdain to have recourse to such inglorious ways and wisely the sagacious general thought the sooner he compelled them to decide the contest by the last event of war the less occasion would the traitors find to try detestable infernal arts add that the exhausted empire could afford no long supply to such a numerous host lastly this war was an appeal to heaven and this great cause the darling cause of heaven for twas for truth they appeared in glorious arms for justice liberty religion god and showing his brave troops that he reposed his confidence in heaven would fire their souls and would sustain them in the dreadful field more than a thousand bodies of reserve and what could more convince the impatient troops that he reposed his confidence in heaven than sudden and determinate recourse to the decisive vengeance of the field urged by these powerful motives to dispatch he his bold english leads to schellenbourgh where the bavarian and the gallick troops lie with the utmost skill of art entrenched to guard the important pass of donawert of donawert bavarias fatal key upon possessing which the great success of this illustrious enterprise depends there he the orders for the fierce assault issues with cheerful majesty serene valor in human hearts too often proceeds from ardent temper or from glowing rage provoked by mortal wrongs or fear of shame but here remote from fear or rage behold a valor worthy of the heroic chief who leads the squadrons that appear in arms for liberty at once and spotless faith the two great causes of the earth and sky and here the french their maxim may recant le soleil ny la mortne se peuvent regarder fixement roche refl  0  that no man can with fixed regards survey the dazzling front of death or of the sun for as an eagle with a steadfast eye stares on the effulgent fountain of the day which streaming with impetuous flood of light blinds other gazers with its torrent fire so marlbro with a calm considerate soul undazled viewed the king of terrors front that cruel front that with its ghastful glare without his adamantine mace can bill exposed to gallick and bavarian fire he all his cheerful majesty maintains his orders to exact advantage gives commanding all the movements of his soul with independent and with lordly power he who himself thus absolutely rules seems by wise nature framed for martial sway his shouting troops exalt him to the sky him they all imitate him all admire on pointed cannon they have run before here they do more and hushed and passive stand while their invincible brigades are formed awaiting what commands their wondrous chief has to impose while all the murding fire of the bavarian cannon tears their ranks troubling whole squadrons with the tyrant rage of missionary thunder they mean while who by no rage no fury are sustained the frenzy that on brutal courage waits but by true valor by heroic minds unmoved unshaken keep the dangerous posts which were assigned them by their dread commander the friends and dear companions of their toyls those whom they cherish equal to themselves torn from their sides without concern they see a nobler care possesses all their souls themselves too torn they from themselves behold their mangled trunks divided from their limbs yet all their dauntless spirit they retain even for themselves no grief no pity show they see the king of terrors in their view they see him stalking near with hideous stride they see him frowning with a ghastful scowl threatening to grasp their hearts with iron gripe yet see it all untroubled undismayed o greatness worthy greece or ancient rome o valor worthy of eternal fame the great epaminondas thus expired for his dear thebes for his great cause concerned regardless of his blood regardless of his life and they like him would think themselves too blessed to see their party victors ever they expire if any show concern it is only fear least they should fall before their generals voice allows them to discharge the impetuous fire that now pent inward choaks their generous hearts thrice happy if permitted even in death to be the instruments employed by fate to bestow freedom on the christian world and on their country never dying fame but what are they unable to perform who such extremes with godlike patience bear they who appeared so calm so meek before are now all rage all storming fury grown now fate looks frowning from their wrathful brows now from their flaming eyes red lightning flies while in their arms the avenging thunder roars and now of dying they can think no more their generals fatal order is to kill his voice they as the voice of fate regard and as the ministers of fate themselves rushing like sounding waters they assault the strong retrenchments so with bellowing sound old oceans rage attacks some lofty digue which sturdy swains have raised to oppose his power he billows upon billows storming pours which rise and swell and rage and foam and roar till the victorious tenth at last comes on oerwhelming all with dismal inundation in vain the foe outragiously resists the trumpet kindles mars with fiercer sounds and in their ears it clangs its martial roar which to the english sounds the voice of fame that to immortal glory calls them on now all wars godhead rages in their breasts and to themselves they demi gods appear oh the transporting fury has the world an enemy that can resist them now in vain grim death in his most hideous shape with haughty strides along the intrenchments stalts whom all his terrors all his plagues sustain the undaunted english turn him on the foe he sees britannias genius in their eyes and in a dreadful tone cries out my friends these are my friends my benefactors these lead on ye race of demi gods lead on i follow you and all your steps attend fortune and fate are on the conquerors side impetuous now they rush conducting fate to their resistless fury all things bow for what must not submit to fate or them now every thing against the foe conspires and fire and water to confound them league behind them conquering death in fiery cart drives on and urges furiously the chase discharging lightnings and the vollied thunder before them the revenging danube swells and then he gaping with a hideous yawn and roaring swallows down his impious prey britannia let thy joy salute

every act begun on thee thee may great minds for mighty actions choose by high foreknowledge sure o sacred day thou were ordained to accomplish wondrous things thy happy influence once before preserved the laboring world from universal sway at least a while delayed its dismal fate twas upon thee the carthaginian chief making the worlds aspiring tyrants yield vanquished proud rome at cannes fatal field but time was teeming with a nobler birth and bleinheims day surpasses cannes field at cannae the contending rivals strove which of them should enslave the vanquished world the great contention was at bleinheims field on one side to oppress immortal liberty to make her wing her flight from earth to heaven and there for ever with astrea dwell her divine sister on the other side the intent was solidly to fix her here in lasting peace and make of earth a heaven and never two more powerful armies met than that which strove to drive thee from below and that o goddess which maintained thy power on the oppressors side the hostile french with the bavarian squadrons now were joined the fierce bavarians were by nature framed hardy and rough and fit for bloody fields and victory had raised their spirits high expert was their perfidious chief and brave and now the memory of past success and hope of future empire fired his soul and the wild prospect of his flaming towers stung him till frantic with his rage he roard and called on heaven and hell for dire revenge the french were all of gallick troops the flower experienced and victorious were their chiefs soldiers and chiefs inured to vast success and claiming right to conquest and renown from long possession with their dearest blood resolved their lofty title to defend by long success presumptious grown and vain aspiring to the conquest of the world believed by all the nations and themselves to be unequalled and invincible proud of their junction with bavarian powers which they with so much hazard so much toil inspight of all great eugenes force achieved from which the empire sure destruction waits and all the christian world perpetual bonds but o how vain are human hopes and fears how blind is the poor providence of man and what a fool to the designs of fate the dreadful moment comes upon the wing when they who make this junction now their boast their pride their hope their joy their ecstasy when they whole conquered provinces would give that this accursed junction never had been when that which now deludes their glorious minds with the vain hope of empire and of fame will prove the gaudy lure thrown out by fate to bring them down from their aspiring flight and leave them in the dust for now the conquering english are in view inspiriting the whole confederate power for what to them can be impossible after the glorious rout at schellenbourgh a conquest gained when scarce their march was over a march like what great philips greater son or the first caesar took to win the world a march almost incredible to those who saw at schellenbourgh its great effect a march so swift that it prevented fame for such dispatch transcends the germans thought at which their listless nations look amazed they gazing seem the english to regard as if descended to their aid from heaven and their illustrious chief on danubes shore no less astonishes the various powers whose squadrons the confederate force compose than a bright star that all at once appears with new effulge in the hemisphere amazes all the planatary worlds who gazing cry it is sent express from heaven to change the fortune of the universe the nations in the british squadrons eyes divine presage of victory behold full of their islands noble pride they march full of their fierce forefathers conquering fire and while they deathless vigor in them feel esteem themselves invincible alone believing firmly that to conquer france is but their old hereditary right which from remote progenitors descends who then were wont to triumph over france even when they were a people fierce and free when for their country and their friends they fought fought for their dear relations and themselves how must they then disdain to yield to those who to support a griezly tyrants pride against their country and their friends contend against their dear relations and themselves that for their parts they fight for justice truth for god and for celestial liberty that fate the first occasion now presents when they the foe may in the field surprise without oppressing numbers on their side whom they resolve like englishmen to attack that is like men resolved to overcome or die that now the eyes of all the christian world are on this great decisive action bent that all the christian world expects from them deeds worthy of the champions of mankind against oppressing tyrants beasts more wild than africa ere produced and which proceed to render europe yet more waste than her that they must fight like heroes who support the glory of their conquering ancestors who great britannias liberties assert and those of other sinking realms restore who vindicate their own undoubted rights and those of all posterity defend with godlike sentiments like these inflamed they under their heroic leader march to attack the foe encamped on bleinheims field the rest to deathless lyres ye angels sing to such a height no mortal force can soar and now the inspiration leaves my soul or if i must with feeble wings essay the aetherial flight assist y aetherial powers and thou the brightest angel of the sky with whose enchanting beauties all the host of heaven above all heavenly minds below are charmed with whom the great creators charmed eternal fame thee goddess i invoke for nothing without thy aid was ever produced or great or fair in earth or heaven above so the great maker willed and made it fate descend bright goddess to my aid descend to infuse a beam of thy celestial fire into my soul and raise my adventurous song if with thy beauties all my soul is fired if all that wretched mortals here call great i sacrifice to liberty and thee instruct me goddess for thou only know for thou with all thy hundred eyes were by when stooping on thy azure wings thou leftst the fields of light for bleinheims glorious field thou goddess with thy own celestial trump did sound the charge through all the aetherial vault when at the immortal blast the powers above looked wondering from the battlements of heaven thou saw how all the host of heaven looked down and shouting filled the eternal realms with joy to see bold man the cause of heaven maintain the souls of british heroes from the sky upon the glories of that field looked down thither their eyes the conquering edwards bent on that magnanimous henry wondering gazed all charmed to see their times of gold return all charmed to see bright victory descend and perch upon an english generals plume there the blessed patron of britannick knights the red cross champion looked transported down to see the honor of his order raised and there looked down the blissful souls of those who in the same immortal cause expired at fleury and at landens fatal plain and godlike william looked with rapture down to see great marlborough do what he had done had but the false bavarian been his foe the preexisting souls of future kings on that important field looked down on which their future right and future power depends mean while the sun the worlds great eye and soul with all his power serend the aetherial space that no invidious cloud might intercept the eternal deeds of bleinheims wondrous day which showed a nobler sight than all the worlds and all the space immense that with one kenn he views could all afford him when it showed so many myriads of heroic souls resolve to conquer or devove themselves in the great cause of liberty and truth the nations here below had all their eyes intent upon that field on whose event depended all their freedom all their peace the very elements attend in truce the dreadful issue silent were the winds and hushed the voice of danubes angry roar all nature in all others parts had peace discord had now no leisure to attend inferior strife for bleinheim claimed her all for there were all her stygian snakes employed there were the fates and all the furies there who shaped like faulcons waiting for their prey were perched on baleful eughs by danubes shore so that both earth and heaven and hell below times present past and future all appeared to be concerned on that important day but hark the goddess gives the dreadful charge i hear the enchanting sound i feel its magic power that sound can like the last angelick trump from their eternal mansions rouse the dead that magic sound brings future times in view and makes the past return that mighty sound swift as the movement of quick thought transports the hearer to the worlds remotest ends i feel i feel even now that i am rapt over lands and seas to bleinheims wondrous field do you see how the tempestuous squadrons move like clouds with thunder charged along the plain oh the transporting sight the noble sound the sprightly neighing of the warlike steed and the impatient champions eager shouts the trumpets roar the thunder of the drum how danube rears his hoary head aghast the adjacent forest frightfully surveys the adjacent forests darts a dreadful gloom and on his flood with double horror frowns on to the attack the thundering squadrons move the very heavens above them seem to smoke and the resounding earth beneath them shakes the noble rage of battle fires the plain me too the noble fury has inspired of registring in fames eternal roll their actions worthy the recording muse the daughter of celestial memory and the immortal mother of renown eternal fame thy summons i obey like them thy charge great goddess i obey but while the verse which thou inspirst i sing do thou great goddess thou my numerous song accompany with that angelick trump whose sound by all the listening globe is heard and to the worlds remotest times descends but now the trumpets clangors heard no more no more the impatient warriors eager shouts for now the cannon thunders through the plain and drowns all dreadful noises in its own the moving squadrons are no longer seen the very earth and heavens are seen no more for earth and heavens seem all involved in night a night of dust and of tumultuous smoke or hid in brightness of tempestuous flames too dazzling to be pierced by mortal eyes but now the goddess with celestial light dispells the mist that veiled these mortal eyes and now through clouds of stormy dust i see through curling smoke through dazzling flames i see say goddess what heroic forms are those who the bold britons lead impetuous on who between them and danger interpose and shield them with their very breasts from fate at once in danger foremost and renown esteeming glory cheaply bought with life and frankly offering up their noble hearts a great unblemished sacrifice to thee how each looks worthy of his high command each looks as if on his heroic deeds the fate depended of this dreadful day ay now their shapes distinctly i discern ay now i know the herolck leaders well and thou eternal goddess know them well and thou with all thy hundred tongues wilt spread their deathless actions and extend their praise wherever thou expandst thy sounding wings hail race of heroes british worthies hail hail noble churchill lumley villars wood and thou great ingolsby great orkney thou hail thou the foremost in the dire assault brave cuts the lightning of the british thunder great favorites of deathless fame all hail those are the immortal heroes whose commands the freeborn english joyfully obey the pride and flower of britains godlike sons upon their eyes the fierce batallions gaze and from their beams derive a glorious fire and the remembrance of great henrys days now after them they move impatient on impatient for the horrid shock they earn now meet the french and we with hideous noise in thunder lightning and in iron hail y immortal powers assist britannias cause assist ye bright spectators of the sky the cause of justice and of truth support the cause of all the christian world defend ah miserable me the immortal powers either against their own great cause declare or else blind fortune governs all below for see the unconquered english are repelled bright honor is repelled and virtue lost and false ambition wins o dismal sight o dire calamity surprzing fate that such as fought like these should ever know repulse can they from such heroic chiefs retire o can they poorly yield in such a cause no see they rally with a noble fire and shame grown fury to the charge returns but to the valor of the foe i hate i must do justice here a braver foe by britains godlike sons was never charged the french undaunted all their fury meet and all with double fury they repel and drive the english horse like lightning back see how once more confounded they retire o cursed fate o fortune o despair aloud methinks i hear all nature groan aloud methinks i hear the immortal powers lament the honor of britannia lost the wretched fate of liberty lament o fond imagination vain conceit immortal is the date of liberty and britains honor never can be lost for see where now heroic marlborough comes comes to maintain them to revenge them comes see where the dusty squadrons he collects as homers jove convenes the threatening clouds that with his dire artillery are fraught with what exalted air he leads them on terror before him marches fame behind and conquest like the austrian eagle shaped over his head flies towering to the skies with such majestic air in ancient days phidias or great euphranor formed his jove but warring jove preparing to discharge vindictive thunder on the impious world death his august appearance sees from far and sees him worthy all his direful rage to attack him mounts upon a fiery globe but as more near the griezly monarch draws he knows the hero doomed to oercome by fate and then his fiery thunderbolt he shoots into the earth and all its entrails tears about the hero casts a mount of clay and buries him almost alive with have to shun him sacred to eternal fame the squadrons all with shuddring horror shake and ruin from that dreadful moment wait he in that dreadful moment is alone fearless and calmly of them all takes care an intrepidity so like their own charms all the bright spectators of the sky the squadrons now redouble all their rage and catch heroic fortitude from him their flame rekindled rages in their breasts and sparkling in their fatal eyes it rowls unanimous they to the charge return with resolution never seen before each champions with the fate of nations big all all resolve to conquer or to die ay now even now the dreadful moment comes on which the destiny of men depends their raging blood like fiery torrents rowls their hearts even burst with rage their noble hearts that utterly disdain that utterly abhor the inglorious thoughts of flight or foul retreat again with dreadful shouts rhey rend the skies and now their murdering carabines they sling with matchless rage their flaming swords they draw in missionary death they trust no more but in their hands they carry hideous fate now now with all their might with all their souls they rush on death and wounds their dismal way with their protended bloody points they plough or brandishing aloft the horrid edge like ripened corn the adverse squadrons mow extending them in heaps upon the plain the adverse squadrons can no longer bear their fatal weapons or their fatal eyes or their victorious cries but slaughter some some pain and anguish seize confusion all and now in heaps they fall in crowds they fly they fly fair europes proud oppressors fly and godlike libertys for ever fixed and to the stars is englands glory raised victoria the transported britons cry with rapture bleinheims blissful plain resounds to bleinheims field the ravished heavens reply and with victorious shouts the welkin rings both heaven and earth and gods and men are charmed and phoebus with redoubled glory shines and on the blessed event all ravished nature smiles danube transported drives his rapid flood with double fury by his ecchoing shores and to the euxin sends the enchanting sound adown his shores the acclamation runs that godlike libertys for ever fixed and to the stars is englands glory raised oh joy oh rapture never to be born they fly fair europes proud oppressors fly the victors rushing tear their trembling rear shouting they rage and raging they pursue a dismal joy is on their rattling tongues fate in their arms and fury in their eyes now discord stalking with gigantick stride wades through a crimson stream of torrent gore and hideous is the face of slaughter now and yet even now when all the conquering troops soldiers and chiefs are all even wild with joy all frantic with the transport of their rage their great commanders calm he who before in his own danger dauntless was alone lord of himself in universal joy serenely doubts for all yet his the praise the glory of the immortal day is his he to a pitch of human glory raised to which no subject ever rose before and by this great deciding moment made darling of nations and mankinds delight britannias second pride batavias hope the roman empires ornament and fame the everlasting blessing of the good and constant panegyric of the brave en in this great deciding moment he the impetuous movements of his soul commands commands himself with more imperious sway than even the meanest warrior of his troops to no unruly transport he gives way to all attacks remains invincible and stands the noble conqueror of himself for now his genius whispers him within that while the day is doubtless on his side heroic eugene is severely pressed and by the false bavarians power distressed and wants the succor of the conquering wing then as great virgils neptune with his voice tames the wild horrors of his frantic waves and flattens with a breath the refluent main so mighty marlborough with a word a nod the fury of his conquering troops restrains en raging madness hears that awful voice and in a moment sinks into a calm that voice the stormy king of terrors hears he hears that voice and in midway arrests his furious arm descending to destroy and as the hero with a breath can calm the raging storm in forty thousand breasts so with a breath he reinflames them all again like stormy seas they waving roll and rise and foam with far resounding roar and tenfold joy and tenfold rage succeeds for on the spur the blissful news arrives that happy eugene no support requires that conquering eugene making vast efforts efforts which never will be forgot by fame a third time rallied his disordered troops and turned confusion back upon the foe again great marlborough gives the fatal word again the goddess gives the dreadful charge and the victorious squadrons of the left again fall on with terrifying cries conquest before now great revenge they seek the french astonished all resistance loose all resolution courage order thought their squadrons now confounded all disband each for himself takes sordid care alone sure ruin both to armies and to states the victors with immortal rage pursue and smite the affected french like wrath divine that sweeps whole people and lays nations waste see this ye proud aspiring tyrants see and let the face of bleinheims dreadful field teach you to rremble at the wrath of heaven and the just judgments of the avenging god do you see that heap of abject wretches there that fall by hundreds and by thousands fly how is ambition fallen how in his turn the insolent oppressor faints and dies are these the brave the invincible are these the royal household of the immortal king are these the bands so proud of triumphs past so vain upon the hopes of those to come and with the spoils of conquered nations big are these the giants who their tyrant swelled with the fond hope of universal sway how they fly how they fall how they tremble how they die an iron tempest galls them in the flank and the fierce victor with ten thousand swords insulting hangs upon their broken rear before them danube rises on their flight and loudly for revenge revenge he roars arresting their precipitated flight he strikes them backward with his stormy brow or with his angry voice their guilty souls he scares but tenfold horror drives them headlong on down down ten thousand take the fatal leap and plunge among the waves the danube raves and calls his stormy billows to the spoil his stormy billows to the mighty spoil drive on advancing with a hideous roar ten thousand warriors rolling ln the flood horses and men reverst midst scattered arms and floating ensigns on each other plunge drive one another drowning to the abyss and with tremendous prospect strike the eye the very victors grow with horror chill shake at the dire catastrophe they cause and tremble at the terrors of a scene such as no no nation of the world no age since the great hebrews wondrous passage saw here heavenly goddess could thou but impart to my weak mind the force the immortal force to paint with lively strokes the dismal scene to paint the cries the shrieks the dying groans the grief the rage the fury of their fear and all the horrors of their baleful eyes and all the astonishment the amazement of their souls with every dreadful ghastful circumstance not miltons wondrouspiece should mine transcend in which messiah with his thunders armed drove down the infernal tyrants warring host with terrors and with furies through the abyss not michael angelos stupendous work where the last dreadful doom sends guilty souls down to eternal punishments in hell hell seizes them hell meets them on the way for in their air and in their looks is hell and endless torments in their baleful eyes thus fell the french before the victors wrath they who had stood so many storms of war yet still unshaken kept their ground in all thus of tall oaks i have known a goodly row that graced the winding margin of the flood defy the rage of many a wintry blast the tempest saw their strength and sighed and past them by but when a hurrican by wrath divine came lately bellowing over the western main that with immortal fury on them fell that made them tremble at impending fate and rent at once their sturdy trunks in twain or twisted up their roots and whirled them in the air that tore their lofty branches down from heaven and brought to light theirserpent roots fromhell down they came rushing with a fatal groan and strewn the river with their scattered limbs and with their mangled trunks his channel pild till devastation choked the encumbered stream o conquering death like sampson blind though strong had thou the glorious hecatombs foreseen which noble marlborough was ordained by fate to offer up to thy insatiate power thou surely then had saved one godlike youth and to the heroic father given the son but blanford in his early bloom was snatched to make the glory of the sire complete had noble blandford still remained below he was good so charming and so great so worthy all the fathers fond desire the invidious world might have pretended then that marlboro had achieved his godlike deeds for private ends to make his offspring great now clearly for his country and his queen for liberty and for the world he acts thou too great queen by whose auspicious care and wisdom these astonishing events were brought to light thou for thy country actst and for the world for children thou have none too rigid fate has ravished all away oh royal gloucester had but cruel death permitted thee to see this wondrous day how had great marlbros actions raised thy blood and roused the hero in thy blooming breast till grown impatient thou had called to arms had like young edward crossed the ambient main attended with the flower of british youth displayed thy ensigns in the galliek plains while france had trembled at thy conquering arms once more had france an english sovereign owned once more had spain its rightful monarch seen placed by a british hero on his throne but thou art gone britannias hope is gone for thee britannia mourns like royal ann thy fate thy mothers happiness impaired but it has raised her glory to the stars the wonders which she every day performs moved by the noblest motives she performs now for her conntry and the world she acts for liberty the darling cause of earth for spotless faith the darling cause of heaven her children all were snatched away in thee o fond mistake whatever the best of queens performs she does it for her children all her happy people are her children now and oh so good so excellent is she so tender of their happiness and fame so watchful over their rights so studious of their peace to all extending her impartial care so grateful and so dutiful are they such honor and such awful love return such love as heaven of human hearts requires that fame is doubtful which she most shall praise the childrens duty or the mothers care the dutifulst of children sure are they the very best of tender mothers she and not the fancied mother of the gods great queen could boast a more heroic race and as that fancied mother of the gods was charmed at sight of her immortal sons with all my power i have rouzed my genius up that thy victorious subjects thou might see made like to gods at bleinheims deathless field what glorious sight can more delight thy soul than conquest which thy subjects bliss ensures thy glory and the worlds felicity yes bleinheim still can show a nobler sight a sight that for thy zeal has stronger charms than all the worlds vain greatness can supply see there thy conquering heroes who before were like to gods now equal to the worm all low and prostrate as the vanquished now humbling themselves before the god of hosts offering to him the glory and the praise the sacrifice most worthy of the god the almighty god of war the god of great revenge finis
