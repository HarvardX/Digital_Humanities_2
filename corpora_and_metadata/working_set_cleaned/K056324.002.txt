whigs and tories promiscuously in his interest  the clergy favor him  parliament meets  proceedings of both houses  observations william had obtained the crown through the folly of his predecessor he was now in danger of losing it by his own negligence disappointments in their views had estranged from him the minds of the whigs he disgusted the tories with the coldness of his manner even when he distinguished them most with his favor the dissolution of the conventionparliament had diminished the influence of the former to a degree that offended their pride they saw a prince who had ascended the throne upon their own principles throwing himself into the hands of their political opponents from an avowed affection for those prerogatives which he was called to circumscribe the same conduct which deprived the king of the attachment of his first friends in england destroyed his interest with the party which had accomplished the revolution in scotland in both kingdoms the seeds of discontent had been sown with a lavish hand and they gradually rose to maturity in the progress of events the people in general inflamed by disappointment misled by designing men or from levity fond of change began to show a manifest dislike to the behavior of the king and the measures of the crown they became jealous of foreigners they complained of an expensive war where victory itself could produce no advantage to britain they murmured against a standing army they repined at the little use made of the navy the great and natural bulwark of england  discontents though the enemies of william exaggerated his mismanagements it must be allowed that men who judged of causes by events had just reason to complain the expenses of england from the landing of the prince of orange on the fith of november      to the twentyninth of september      had amounted to near eighteen millions ms      journals passim  besides great arrears were owing to the army in ireland the navy was destitute of stores and the ships were out of repair the service done in the intermediate time exclusive of the change made in the person of the monarch was far from being adequate to that enormous sum the war in ireland had been at first strangely neglected it was afterward prosecuted with little judgment and it terminated in no honor the inhabitants of a few parishes in the highlands of scotland without any aid from abroad and destitute of the means of war at home remained in arms against the king for more than two years they had once totally defeated his army in the field the checks which they had received were neither splendid nor decisive and he owed the pacification which ensued to the influence of his rival and his own money ms       and not to the terror of his power england had been in the mean time wounded in her pride her fleet had been twice defeated her enemy rode in triumph in the channel her coasts were insulted she was left naked of troops and exposed to invasion nottingham to william    0   secret intrigues but william ought not in common fairness to be blamed for all these misfortunes he reigned over a divided people his title was disputed by one party he lost the other by not yielding to their claims upon his exclusive favor his rival in the mean time supported by a powerful monarch either maintained war against him within his kingdoms or hovered over the coast with threatened invasions deprived by his unhappy manner and avowed attachment to foreigners of the affection of the english he had no friends among his servants his councils were betrayed his orders neglected his person hated his authority despised intell from england ms       his only safety lay ultimately in the folly of his enemies and that invincible aversion to the french nation which the people of england had derived from their ancestors james had scarce landed in france when many of those by whose desertion he had lost his throne began secretly to favor his return men who apparently had the chief hand in the revolution admitted his agents into conferences and encouraged their hopes rcresby  the unprepared state of france in the beginning of the year      rendering an immediate invasion of england impracticable james contrary to his own opinion mem to lewis ms       was induced to sail to ireland he knew that it was impossible to hold that exhausted kingdom against the wealth and power of the english nation to render his rival uneasy in the possession of his throne and to furnish france with an opportunity of aiding him with effect in england was all that he expected from his expedition ibid   with the whigs while james was on the worst terms with his favorite sect the catholics of ireland william by the coldness of his manner and his exertion of the prerogative lost his influence with the whigs in england and scotland discontented friends are frequently the most dangerous enemies a plot was formed in scotland by the presbyterians in favor of james many of the whigs in england were privy to a conspiracy which threatened the subversion of their former principles in both kingdoms those inferior agents of the party who had ruined the late king were now busy in procuring his restoration sir john cochran ferguson wildman engaged themselves deeply with james caermarthen to william june       0 the leaders of the party though they had not avowedly espoused the cause of that prince became very indifferent concerning the fate of william the very secrets of the cabinet were said to have been betrayed by the earl of monmouth to wildman and by the latter to the late king mary to william    0 the duke of bolton the marquis of winchester the earl of devonshire the lord montague were suspected caermarthen to william    0 the party in general made no secret of their disappointment in the prince whom they had raised to the throne those who came over with him from holland and such as first joined him on his arrival hated his person and his government the most dalrymples appen stuartpapers   james gains many friends the retreat of james from ireland though unadvised precipitate and weak neither lessened his influence nor increased the interest of william the tories urged by their principles favored the former the whigs swayed by their resentment still contitinued adverse to the latter the agents of james were in the mean time extremely active the colonels bulkely and sackville sounded the marquis of halifax and the lord godolphin the earl of marlborough inflamed by recent injuries from william and perhaps remembering his former obligations to james began as shall hereafter appear to correspond with the latter admiral russel disappointed in his own private views as well as in his public expectations from william entered into the cabals in favor of the late king the marquis of caermarthen in all his avowed zeal for the revolution listened in secret to proposals for the restoration of james dalrymples appen and ms       while the great offered their service to the late king that prince neglected not to support his interest with conspiracies among the inferior ranks he corresponded with ferguson he informed him of his intentions he asked his advice instructions to g h ms       a party was formed in the city in his favor the tower was to have been surprised the guards were to be attacked on the first news of his landing the persons of william and mary were to be seized ibid   their views the affairs of james wore a like favorable aspect in scotland toward the end of the preceding year the cessation of arms made by breadalbin with the highlanders had been begun and finished by his consent his firm friend the earl of arran had promised body for body to use his own expression for the earl of argyle and the marquis of athol the highlanders were again prepared to take the field ten thousand men under the duke of berwick and the earl of dumbarton were to have been sent to scotland the marquis of athol the earls of argyle and home were to have received commissions as lieutenantgenerals from james the intrigues of james extended in england to the projected measures of parliament and even to the very appointment of williams servants the delay at first in granting the supply the facility with which it was afterward obtained proceeded from the secret machinations of the late kings friends some of them wished to leave the kingdom naked to an invasion by refusing money others to vote the excise that their old master might enjoy the benefit without the odium of that unpopular tax under the mask of patriotism they proposed to attack his enemies the bishops of salisbury and st asaph were to be impeached for persuading the clergy to take the oaths to william as a conqueror the marquis of caermarthen though he might not obstruct a restoration was not from his temporizing character to be trusted he was therefore to be terrified from office by an impeachment for declaring that no king could reign in england as long as the act of habeas corpus should remain in force the choice of his successor as minister was left to james and the contest for preference lay between the marquis of halifax and the earl of rochester fergusons memorial ms oct       to keep alive the spirit of discontent in the kingdom ferguson employed for king james that very private press with which he had some years before so much annoyed the duke of york ibid   correspondence of marlborough and russel though the whigs by their leaders and the most of the tories in their own names had made engagements with the late king he relied chiefly upon marlborough and russel marlborough had asked in the most abject terms and obtained forgiveness for his former conduct from james and his queen jan  0th       he even became an agent for that prince he gained the earl of shrewsbury he tampered with caermarthen he promised to bring back the princess of denmark to her duty to her father may  0th       he undertook in some degree for the army he requested james to invade england with twenty thousand men though he was not trusted by james he was perhaps sincere in his professions and he effected what he promised the princess of denmark gained by his solicitations warmed with a returning affection for her father or urged by resentment for personal injuries received from william and her sister made her peace with the late king she wrote to him a letter full of contrition dec  0th       she asked his forgiveness and promised to join him whenever he should land in england dec       marlborough judging it vain to corrupt the captains of men of war as they durst not communicate the secret to the sailors was the person who advised james to accept of the services of russel marlboroughs message ms      james ii       to avoid an action with the french fleet should they fall in his way would have been impossible but it always was in the admirals power to carry the fleet from the course held by the enemy under the specious pretense of orders the conspiracy was so great and general that william seemed to have no friend to apprize him of his danger though he dismissed the earl of marlborough from all his employments in the month of january though he disgraced and deprived of her guards the princess of denmark his resentment seems to have rather proceeded from a renewal of private quarrels than from any discovery of their secret negociations with the court of st germains  intrigues of james in england james himself had taken all the precautions which prudence or the advice of his friends could suggest to render his return agreeable to the nation he endeavored to awaken the feelings of his former subjects with a detail of the injustice of his rival and his own misfortunes he hoped to rouse their resentment by representing in a strong light their grievances he dwelt in his proposed declaration on the tyranny of foreigners he reminded the people of the enormous expenses of government the weight of taxes the profusion of william his glaring partiality to his countrymen the dutch he yielded to all the requisitions of the whigs in favor of the subject he satisfied the church of england with regard to religion the nonjurors were his determined friends the clergy who had taken the oaths offered to return to their allegiance and they were with cheerfulness received to satisfy the world that the protestant religion was in no danger five hundred clergymen had engaged to join the late king upon his landing and to attend him in his progress to preach to the people the deprived bishops the most of those prelates who had temporized with william by taking the oaths were busy in inculcating upon the inferior clergy the propriety of restoring james while they at the same time assured that prince of their zeal and fidelity stuart papers        project of an invasion encouraged by favorable accounts from britain and eager to turn the scale of the war by placing that kingdom in the hands of a friend lewis the fourteenth began to think seriously of an invasion james possessed of his native subjects an army almost equal to the purpose of the expedition the transports which had carried to ireland five thousand french in the year    0 had brought back to france as many irish the english government had been at the expense of sending fourteen thousand more troops to james after the capitulation of limeric lewis promised to transport to britain ten thousand of this army with a like number of french troops under the convoy of his whole fleet early in the year      he began in the month of january to equip squadrons of men of war at toulon breast rochfort and portlewis an embargo was laid upon all merchantmen all privateers were recalled to man the fleet an army under the marshall de bellefons filed off toward the coast of normandy transports were prepared james had concerted his measures with his friends in england he had settled his concessions to the nation to secure the earl of marlborough already in disgrace from the further resentment of william he agreed at his own request to except that nobleman from pardon in his projected declaration to his people stuart papers      dalrymples append   preparations of william though so many persons were privy to the designs of james though every channel of intelligence brought news of the preparations of france william was still a stranger to his own danger he however made all necessary preparations for manning the fleet presswarrants continued to be executed throughout the month of february all sailors fit for service were forced to enter on board the navy the utmost expedition was used in the docks and yards in the first week of march all the ships of force had come round from portsmouth many had fallen down from deptford woolwich and chatham to the nore william upon his arrival in holland hastened the dutch fleet to sea the amsterdam the maese the northholland the zealand squadrons were ordered to proceed successively to the downs the combined fleets formed a greater naval force than had ever covered the sea they consisted of ninety ships of the line with many frigates and fireships they carried more than forty thousand men with near six thousand guns russel in the britannia a first rate commanded in chief the whole he resolved to adhere to his engagements with james but time and accident broke through all his designs stuartpapers        james arrives at la hogue the late king had concerted with his friends in england that the french fleet should sail early in the year had the preparations of lewis answered his expectations he proposed to put to sea in the middle of march he however left not st germains until the eleventh of april he had even then sufficient time to carry his army to england before the junction of russel with the dutchfleet besides that officer continued his correspondence and assured him of his firm intention to serve his cause he proposed one of two alternatives that james should suspend his expedition till winter or that he himself should under the pretense of making a descent on the coast of france permit the french fleet to pass he accordingly applied but in vain to the court of england for permission to attack st maloes he advised james by all means to prevent the meeting of the fleets none of his officers was trusted with the secret and he would therefore find himself under a necessity to fight a contrary wind which blew incessantly for four weeks hindered the french from sailing and prevented james from conveying his instructions to russel the toulon squadron was kept by the same adverse wind from passing the streights tourville with the breast squadron was after repeated efforts driven back to his port during this interval the dutch joined the english in the downs may    russel proceeded immediately to st helens and ordered two small squadrons that cruized on the coast of france to join him in that place  vigorous measures in england during this time of suspense the government of england were not remiss in their duty several of the servants of the crown were in correspondence with the late king but they endeavored by a show of alacrity against him to prevent every suspicion of infidelity some imperfect insinuations of a plot had been carried to william in flanders the earl of portland arrived with secret instructions for the queen the earls of huntington and marlborough were sent to the tower with others of lesser name a proclamation was issued for apprehending several other persons of rank who had absconded a camp was formed between petersfield and portsmouth six regiments under orders to embark for flanders were countermanded the lieutenancy were commanded to raise the militia the same precautions were used in scotland but ireland was left to its fate orders were sent to the fleet to sail in quest of the enemy a declaration issued by james before he left st germains was published and answered by authority activity and spirit prevailed every where and that terror which commonly precedes danger was lessened by the bustle of preparation gazettes        the fleet sails toward la hogue the communication between france and england was in the mean time completely interrupted james during all the time he had remained at la hogue received no intelligence from his friends in london james ii       captain lloyd who had been dispatched to him by his adherents with an important message and a letter from the princess of denmark was detained two months on his way tourville upon a change of wind sailed at length from breast with fortyfour ships of the line he directed his course to la hogue unfortunately for that admiral the combined fleet of the enemy consisting of many more than double his number of ships arrived at the same instant in the neighborhood of that place the weather in the mean time was extremely hazy on the nineteenth of may about four of the clock in the morning the sun having cleared a little the weather admiral russel descried the enemy holding with a very small gale at west and by south their course southward on the same tack with himself they began on both sides to form the line tourville who had been irritated by a reflection thrown on his courage by de seignelay resolved to fight the enemy though he was not ignorant of their force he bore down upon the combined fleets at ten of the clock the dutch were in the van the french admiral threw out the signal of battle as he advanced on russel who lay to receive him with his fore topsail to the mast russels letter to nottingham june          an engagement at half an hour after eleven tourville in the royal sun of one hundred and four guns brought to within three quarters of a musket shot of the britannia of one hundred guns commanded by russel the rest of the french admirals division fell in with the english line a smart engagement ensued the two commanders plied their guns very warmly till one of the clock the weather during the engagement fell almost calm tourville was disabled his rigging sails and yards were shot his fire began to slacken he ordered his boats to tow him to windward five fresh ships of the squadron with a furious fire covered their admirals retreat about four of the clock a thick fog fell on the battle and the firing ceased at half after five a small breeze of wind arose at east the weather cleared up a little the french were running on every side russel gave the signal for the fleet to chase the fog returned and night came on the french stood to the west with all their sails the breeze was so light that little way could be made the fog continued the greatest part of the next day toward the evening russel took in the signal for the line of battle and ordered each ship to make the best of her way in pursuit of the enemy the tide of ebb being done both fleets came to an anchor both resolving to take advantage of the next return of the tide ibid   sixteen french ships burnt in the morning of the twenty first of may all the french ships were far advanced toward the race of alderney one and twenty however were driven eastward from the entrance of the race by the tide of flood toward cape la hogue three of that number endeavored to tack to the westward against the current but one of them after two or three short boards ran ashore the other two were weathered by the sternmost ships of russels squadron sir ralph delaval rear admiral of the red was ordered to destroy the three ships russel himself stretched after the remaining eighteen who hauled in for la hogue five made their escape eastward in the night thirteen were observed on the twentysecond hauled in close with the shore on the twentythird rearadmiral rooke was ordered with several men of war the fireships and boats of the fleet to destroy the enemys ships the men of war could not approach he however burnt six ships in the night the remaining seven were destroyed in the same manner the next day little resistance was made by the french their officers had retired and the men fled upon the approach of the english sailors james himself is said to have been a spectator of this last action but tourville refused to receive his advice the army intended for the invasion were near but they had the mortification to behold a destruction which they could not prevent russels letter to nottingham june          observations the french owed their misfortunes in the battle or rather in the affair of la

had wantonly entered the superior skill of the english in managing light breezes of wind and impetuous tides gave them a great advantage over an enemy who were manifestly conquered in their own minds

outnumbered the consusion and want of plan which prevail in all naval engagements ought to have saved the victors from the censure which some writers have thrown on their conduct the chief loss of the

to the proposed descent they ordered him to take the advice of a council of war the result was that the fleet stretched over to la hogue but with a design to return to st helens in four days the fate

stream and formed into morasses the adjoining fields to make at first an attack was to risque a defeat and the place surrendered before william who was always slow in his councils could determine upon any vigorous measure to raise the siege to retrieve the glory which he had lost before namur william endeavored to suprise the french army under the duke of luxembourg at steinkirk the attack was chiefly carried on by the english in columns they ascended with amazing resolution and spirit the rising ground on which a wing of the french army lay encamped they took possession of their batteries

them of an equal success by land he informed them that the french were repairing the loss which they had sustained in their fleet that they designed to augment their army against the next campaign he

flew into the most violent heat they rejected the amendment without one dissenting voice the lords agreed to pass the bill without alteration with a formal protest on their journals that though they yielded to the present urgent state of affairs they had a right to insist upon taxing themselves in other matters the two houses were more unanimous they ordered by a joint vote that a pamphlet entitled king william and mary conquerors should be burnt by the hands of the common hangman they addressed the king to dismiss from his place the licenser of the press under whose sanction it had

other respects showed little complaisance for the crown they even appeared to be selfdenied with regard to the private interest of their own members they introduced and passed a bill touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament which excluded from the right of sitting in the house all persons who should accept of any office from the crown the ministry found themselves incapable of opposing in the lower house a measure so popular to facilitate the passing of this important bill it was not to be in force till the king should think fit to call a new parliament it was sent up to the lords early in the session the malcontents in the upper house carried the motion in favor of the bill in the committee but when it came to be reported the court party by the means of proxies rejected it by

odious by a series of frauds cruelties and rapacities they sold common justice for money they screened the guilty and oppressed the innocent for gain to render their proceedings summary to clothe their authority with more terror and with most expedition to enrich themselves they chose to exert their power in the military way the corruption at the source extended itself through every channel of

in the intermediate time they presided in the court of claims for adjusting the demands of those comprehended in the articles of limerick and the obvious road to their justice was said to lie through their avarice the arrival of sidney in his government though it might lessen the fear of future oppressions diminished not the resentment of the people for former injuries his own conduct seemed more calculated to preserve the prerogative of the crown than to redress the grievances of the subject his speech at the opening of the parliament was suited to the times and well received but the memory of the past created an ill humor among the commons seventy thousand pounds had been demanded as an additional revenue for the annual and necessary expenses of government but the house were either slow in finding the ways and means or ignorant where they could be found two bills ready drawn the one for an additional excise on malt liquors the other for a tax on land bearing corn were sent down from the irish privy council the commons were highly offended at the manner of introducing these bills which were in themselves especially the latter highly exceptionable and in some degree partial and unjust they argued that though by poynings law no bill was to be passed without the sanction of the english privy council it was never deemed that the irish commons were precluded from taxing themselves journals passion slones narrative   laid before the english parliament the necessities of government induced the lord lieutenant to hearken to a compromise the commons consented to pass the excise bill with a declaration that the thing should not be drawn into a precedent but they rejected the landbill as laying an unequal tax upon the farmers when sidney found himself in possession of the additional excise he gave vent to his resentment against the parliament he sent for them on the fourth of november       he reprimanded them severely for invading the prerogatives of the crown he

constitution was the depriving the citizens of dublin of their right to choose their own magistrates  a remonstrance on that subject the lords presented an address upon the subject of the irish complaints the commons sent a remonstrance to the throne to the grievances already specified the latter added several others of the same alarming kind they complained of the miseries of free quarters and the licentiousness of the army to which the protestant subjects had been exposed they represented the danger of recruiting the troops as had been notoriously done with irish papists and such persons as had been in open rebellion they averred that the common course of law was stopped by granting protections to roman catholics not comprehended within the articles of pacification and that it was from the mercenary views of the servants of the crown that the impolitic addition was made to the treaty with the papists at the surrender of limerick all these grievances they requested the king to redress and he promised to rectify all that had been amiss in ireland the miseries of that kingdom might perhaps have been exaggerated the expectations of the protestants were high from the success of their party the claims of the papists were extensive from the favorable articles by which they had finished the war recent injuries were added on both sides to ancient prejudices and animosities to satisfy either was certainly a thing difficult for any government but it is equally certain that the servants of the crown were much less attentive to the happiness of the people than to the gratification of their own passions and avarice  parliament prorogued march    william seems either to have repented of his promise to the commons or to have been persuaded from his purpose by those most concerned in the mismanagements in ireland to prevent the parliament from resuming the affair he prorogued it on the fourteenth of march just four days after receiving the remonstrance he thanked the commons for their large supplies he signified to the two houses his intention of going abroad he promised to continue to expose his person upon all occasions for the good and advantage of his kingdoms and that his hearty and sincere endeavors should never be wanting to make the english a great and flourishing nation journals mar     notwithstanding this soothing speech the different

attachment to his rival the king by the advice of secretary johnston managed his affairs with prudence he gained by promoting their leaders the presbyterians he reconciled the duke of hamilton and his party to his government by appointing that nobleman commissioner to the approaching parliament on the eighteenth of april in the present year a parliament met at edinburgh to flatter the pride of the scots the king signified in his letter that ever since his coming to the crown he had been fully resolved to hold a parliament in person in his ancient kingdom he declared that nothing but his necessary presence abroad or the business of his station when in england could have hitherto prevented his purpose the commissioner assured the house that the king was resolved to support the present establishment in civil and ecclesiastical affairs he awaked their fears of present dangers by recounting those he had escaped in the preceding year and he concluded his speech with demanding a supply

authority of government and to recover the ruined trade of the nation  ill requited by william the spirit which had uniformly opposed government since the late revolution if not extinguished was at

of england he promised to settle with the concurrence of parliament a liberty of conscience he was fully resolved he said to assent to all laws for securing effectually the liberty and property of the subject not only during his own reign but against all the encroachments of his posterity and successors in the throne he affirmed that it was his resolution to meet his people frequently in parliament as the best expedient to render a king truly great and the subject perfectly happy and that it was his determined resolution neither to design nor attempt to introduce any arbitrary power in the crown ibid nov        the late king he hoped he said that he had expressed himself plainly he declared that he meant honestly he was sensible that the nation besides the violence done to their own principles had not found their account in the injury they had done to his right he was no stranger he said from that circumstance that some who were displeased with the times pursued projects of redress by other means than his restoration but he averred that his return to his native country was the only thing that could either give a better establishment for the future or relieve them from their present distress he requested his friends for the greater security of the nation to send any persons they pleased to discourse with him at large upon the subject of his letter he doubted not he said to give any commissioned to him for that purpose an entire satisfaction upon every point to create future confidence he desired to forget the past he was resolved for his own part to pardon all the miscarriages of all his subjects without exception he expressed his earnest desire to close in every thing with the united interest of the people he requested that more of them would make him acquainted with their inclinations without the least degree of flattery which had often too fatal an influence upon the councils of kings stuartpapers nov       and he concluded with declaring that he wished for nothing in the world so earnestly as to see his people establshed upon the true and legal foundation ibid   in england the malcontents in england were so much disgusted with william that they received the assurances of james with ardour the earl of middleton in the month of january returned to france with eight proposals from those who wished to restore the late king upon conditions they were accepted without hesitation the high opinion which james always entertained of the importance of the fleet induced him to apply to the principal officers with unremitting diligence russel had promised in the preceding autumn his best endeavors to serve his cause but william in consequence of russels opposition in parliament and his disputes with the earl of nottingham had deprived that officer of the chief command delaval killegrew and shovel were appointed in a joint commission to execute the office of admiral the two first had been for some time in the interest of the late king that prince encouraged by a very great party in england and numbering among his friends some of the first officers of state flattered by the engagements of the fleet and the discontents in the army promised to himself an absolute certainty of being restored with little opposition to the throne the french king kept the crown of england on the head of william he listened to the proposals of james but he entertained no serious thought of assisting that prince with effect stuartpapers        his declaration urged by his own hopes and the zeal of his friends in england the late king prepared a declaration upon the eight articles transmitted to france through the hands of the earl of middleton it was dated at st germains on the seventeenth of april april    n s  he promised an unlimited pardon to all his subjects an absolute oblivion of all the past he declared that he would immediately call a parliament inform himself through them of the inclinations of his people and redress by their concurrence former grievances and give every security for their future happiness he promised to protect the church of england to secure to its members all the churches universities colleges and schools to confirm their immunities rights and privileges he pledged his word to recommend to his parliament an impartial liberty of conscience he declared that he would never violate the test and that he would leave the dispensing power of the crown in other matters to be explained and limited by the representatives of the nation he solemnly promised to give his assent to all such bills as should be found necessary to shorten the duration of parliaments to secure the freedom of elections the fair returns of members and impartial trials  to the people of england to regain the favor of those who had been most active in the late revolution he engaged himself to ratify and confirm all such laws during the government of william as should be tendered to him by his parliament he declared his willingness to reestablish in the most ample manner the act of settlement of ireland as passed in his brothers reign to relinquish the chimneymoney or any other part of the revenue as should be deemed burdensome to the people for any other more easy assessment he assured his people that he had formed his declaration upon the advice of a great number of his subjects of all ranks and degrees who had already adjusted the manner of his reascending the throne to remove the apprehensions of his subjects that great sums might be demanded by france he positively assured them that his most christian majesty expected no compensation but the glory of having succored an injured prince he added that he was on the eve of coming to vindicate his own right and to establish the liberties of his people and he concluded with solemnly praying that god might so give him success in the prosecution of the one as he was sincere in his intentions to confirm the other printed declaration   legal severities a month after this declaration was dated in france it was dispersed privately in england by the adherents of the late king some persons who had undertaken that dangerous office were secured and upon slender proofs punished severely for a high misdemeanour may     several violent libels against the government had raised the resentment and indignation of the courts of justice the legal severities of which the people formerly complained seemed in some cases to be renewed in all their horror one anderton was seized may    by the messenger of the press as the printer of two seditious pamphlets and committed for a misdemeanour to newgate but when he offered sufficient bail he was by a fresh warrant continued in prison for high treason on the trial of this unfortunate person no positive evidence of guilt appeared though the statute of treason allowed no conjectural presumptions no strained inferences no forced constructions he was at length condemned treby lordchiefjustice of the common pleas and formerly a vehement patriot presided at his trial and was said to have even surpassed jefferys himself in violence upon this occasion he browbeat the prisoner he rejected without any answer his defense he reviled and threatened the jury when they seemed to lean to the favorable side the novelty of andertons case being the first who had ever suffered death for printing raised the attention of the public the lameness of the proof was generally condemned and to convict upon presumptions in cases of treason was deemed a dangerous innovation andertons case  but when a nation is divided into two inveterate parties it is difficult to exclude violence even from the seats of justice  campaign in flanders the king impatient to open the campaign in flanders left kensington on the thirtyfirst of march and arrived in the maese on the second of april the french had disturbed the winter itself with military excursions and attacks they had taken furnes and dixmuyde in the end of november with their garrisons consisting chiefly of the english who had reduced those places in the close of the preceding campaign his own preparations the necessity of settling previously the councils of the allies and the difficulty of assembling the forces detained the king at loo and the hague till the middle of may having joined the troops of the allies at deigham he marched from thence to parks near louvaine and by that judicious position is said to have broken the designs of france upon brabant lewis the fourteenth with an equipage more suitable to a triumph than a campaign joined his army consisting of one hundred thousand men on the second of june maestricht charleroy huy brussels and liege dreaded by turns the fall of the storm but the french king having fallen sick soon after his arrival returned to versailles and left to the marshall de luxembourg the conduct of military operations in flanders luxembourg on the fifteenth of june placed his head quarters at meldert within half a league of the camp of the allies the two armies continued in this situation above a month each endeavored to find an opportunity of giving battle to advantage while both suffered great hardships from the incessant rains  the french attack the marshall de luxembourg despairing to force william to fight at a disadvantage left his camp on the eighteenth of july he sat down before huy which surrendered in two days having amused the enemy with a feigned design upon liege he suddenly quitted his post at hellicheim crossed the jaar in four columns directed his march toward the allies being determined to attack them in their camp or if they retreated to fall upon their rear his van was in sight before they were apprised of his march the king made the necessary preparations for receiving the enemy with vigor he sent away his heavy baggage he ordered his infantry to entrench themselves in the front of his camp the river geette bounded his right and ran winding along his rear on the left and in the front of the left was the brook of landen a thick hedge joining with one end the geete covered part of the front of his right wing the village of neerwinden with entrenchments before it was situated between the left end of the hedge and the center the village of romsdorff stood farther advanced opposed to the front of the left wing and the entrenchment before it stretched to the rivulet of landen a line of entrenchments extended themselves behind the two villages and behind these the army of the allies was formed their whole front was covered with one hundred pieces of cannon which by being advantageously placed on an eminence commanded all the approaches to their line mem de feuquieres   and defeat willam on the evening july    of his arrival in sight of the allies the marshall de luxembourg dislodged a detachment of the enemy posted in the village of landen which stood advanced before the brook of that name between this village and that of romfdorff he placed forty battalions in the night he formed his center of eight lines of horse and foot intermixed his horse on the left wing were ordered to extend themselves to the geette opposing their line to the thick hedge which covered the front of the enemys right the french were formed before five in the morning and the cannonading began on both sides six brigades under the duke of berwick and two other lieutenant generals attacked the village of neerwinden this important post was carried but it was soon recovered by the vigilance of william who had the good fortune at the same instant to see his enemies repulsed on every side the center of the french army was not properly sustained by either wing but the marshall de luxembourg was not to be intimidated he made a second effort on neerwinden he succeeded he was again repulsed he resolved to attack some other quarter of the enemy they were inaccessible every where the village of neerwinden is a third time attacked william with great bravery led twice the english infantry to the entrenchment which the enemy endeavored to force nothing however could resist the impetuosity of the french their center reinforced by their right opened a way for their cavalry into the very lines of the allies they flanked the english they charged and put to flight the troops of hanover they overturned and routed the spaniards williams account gazettes   at landen william perceiving this disorder advanced suddenly with a part of his left wing but the enemy gave him no time to form they flanked the dutch horse as they came they broke them in a furious onset before the english could draw into a line the king however was not to be driven from the field he ordered his troops to charge as they found themselves his efforts were attended with some success when he perceived his right wing driven headlong into the geete nothing but confusion could now be seen throughout the camp slaughter and flight prevailed every where on the field the bridge being too much crowded by the runaways many were drowned in the river william retreated in the same order with the remains of the left wing he however left a complete victory to the enemy sixtysix pieces of cannon eight mortars eighty standards colors and other trophies fell into the hands of the french twelve thousand of the allies lay dead in this bloody field two thousand were made prisoners the marshall de luxembourg gained little but glory from the battle of landen he lost eight thousand of his best troops in the action and his army was so much weakened by the number wounded that he could take no advantage of the consternation of the enemy hist de france tom iii   reflections on his conduct william displayed upon this occasion great courage and presence of mind he exposed his person to danger he issued his orders with coolness he was present every where he has notwithstanding been censured for hazarding in his circumstances a general engagement he had detached a considerable number of his troops under the duke of wertemberg he had sent a reinforcement to the garrison of liege mem de feuquieres  in point of numbers he was much inferior to luxembourg he had sufficient time to retreat beyond the geette and cover himself from insult behind that river ibid  his post however was so strong that his officers encouraged him to fight and he himself was extremely anxious to recover the laurels which he had lost in the preceding campaign six weeks of inactivity succeeded the battle both sides weakened by their losses seemed unwilling to grapple again in the field the marshall de luxembourg being at length reinforced by detachments from the coasts of picardy and normandy as well as from the army on the upper rhine moved toward charleroy he sat down before that place on the eleventh of september william made no efforts to raise the siege the garrison behaved themselves with such spirit as deserved relief the king quitted the army on the fifth of october and charleroy surrendered on the eleventh of that month hist de france vol iii   campaign on the upper rhine on the side of germany the french tarnished their

burnt the churches pillaged the inhabitants stripped naked the women exposed to violence and lust de lorges in the mean time was prevented from passing the necker by the prince of baden who commanded the confederate army the king of france having undertaken to the ottomans to make a powerful diversion on the side of germany had detached june  0 twenty thousand men from the army in flanders to the upper rhine when this reinforcement joined de lorges the dauphin assumed the command of the army that prince having dispersed in vain a manifesto containing humiliating terms of peace advanced to the necker and crossed that river july     with twenty thousand men the germans under the prince of baden unable to contend with such superior numbers avoided the risque of a battle in a strong post the dauphin returned to versailles the french and imperialists having remained for some time in the field in a state of inactivity retired at length to their respective winter quarters  in piedmont the operations of the armies on the side of piedmont having languished throughout the summer ended in a decisive action in the beginning of october october    the duke of savoy at the head of the confederates sat down before pignerol the marshall de catinat having been reinforced with ten thousand men from the army on the upper rhine descended from the mountains and from his motions seemed to threaten turin the duke having bombarded pignerol raised the siege on the second of october he advanced to the small river cisola where it passes by marsaglia he sent away his heavy baggage resolving to engage de catinat the next day the two armies came in sight and formed themselves in order of battle neither side showing any inclination to come to battle the consederates lay all night on the field in their arms when day light appeared the french were already formed the allies were instantly in motion the imperial and piedmontese cavalry commanded by the duke in person covered the right wing the insantry consisting of the infantry of savoy and great britain were in the center under the famous prince eugene the spaniards led by their native officers formed the left wing the french began the attack in an unusual manner they received the fire of the spaniards as they advanced and then charged them with bayonets fixed and sword in hand the whole wing was broken in an instant and thrown in their confusion on the center the battle was sustained by the latter with great obstinacy they were however broken at length and forced to fly a complete victory remained to the french the cannon colors standards and light baggage of the allies fell into the hands of the enemy they lost eight thousand men in the field the duke of schomberg who commanded the troops in the pay of great

french were too few and ill provided to pursue the advantages which they had obtained besides the marshall de noailles had embarked six thousand men to reinforce de catinats army in piedmont both sides remained inactive from may till the end of the year the war in hungary produced no signal event the imperialists under the duke de croy laid siege to belgrade in vain after five weeks open

was feebly manned and ill supplied with necessaries and provisions killegrew delaval and shovel who executed the office of admiral having been reinforced by the dutch arrived at st helens on the seventh of may the whole fleet was to have consisted of one hundred sail of men of war seventy of which were to have been of the line they however had not all rendezvoused when the admirals arrived

he stood away with an easy sail he ordered at the same time the merchantmen nearest to the land to shift for themselves in the ports of spain the enemy gaining fast upon him he made sail the french came up with the sternmost ships three dutch men of war fell into the hands of the enemy eighty merchantmen were either taken in their flight or destroyed in ports where they had taken shelter the rest owed their escape to the bad conduct of tourville had he kept the wind he might have surrounded and taken the whole fleet but when the dutch ships stood in to the shore he tacked after them and

discontents which ever accompany national misfortunes filled the whole kingdom with complaints murmurs and noise the merchants of london presented a remonstrance rather than an address to the queen they enumerated the hardships imposed upon trade by the want of convoys they exaggerated past evils they magnified the present they expressed their anxiety for the future this spirit of resentment spread from london to the rest of the nation in the events of the past years of the war some glory had been blended with disappointment but the present year was uniformly covered with misfortune and

profiting by the restoration of james had entered into the views of the latter prince james requested him to betray the councils of the king and to obstruct and defeat his measures in parliament he desired him if he could depend upon his son to induce him to keep his command in the navy he instructed the earl of shrewsbury the earl of marlborough and the lord godolphin to exert themselves

his temper to regulate his conduct with prudence and reserve to raise no enemies that might obstruct his designs ms instructions to russel oct       the intrigues of james prevailed william fell evidently into the snare the adherents of the late king insinuated that to restore russel to the command of the fleet was to soothe the nation for the miscarriages at sea he was accordingly replaced in his former office on the sixth of november the anxiety with which james pursued this point is as unaccountable as it is remarkable deleval and killegrew two out of the three joint admirals were devoted to his service stuartpapers ibid  but he perhaps perceived that it was impossible for them to retain their offices in opposition to a torrent of popular clamours the first had been raised by the late king and owed every thing to that prince the latter depended on caermarthen who had resolved to favor a restoration  whigs as well as tories though james depended much upon the zeal of

more resolute in their political views in the list of noble correspondents with the court of st germains the two parties were blended with one another in the present year james had received the most solemn assurances from four dukes four marquises twenty earls four viscounts eleven barons beside the roman catholics in every degree of nobility  most of the clergy many in the army the whole body of the nonjuring clergy consisting of six bishops and six hundred ministers and four fifths of those who had taken the oaths were ready to join the late king to preach in favor of his authority to convince the people that the protestant religion was in no danger the cities of bristol and exeter in the west and in the north the town of boston had signified their loyalty to james through their respective leaders the earl of yarmouth in the name of seventeen baronets and one hundred and thirty gentlemen promised for the county of norfolk the gentlemen of essex assured the late king that they

that they had sufficient credit with their companions to bring back the whole to their former allegiance they even solemnly undertook to cut the throats of such of their comrades and officers as should dare to oppose their design in the north of england seven regiments of cavalry and dragoons were privately listed under officers bearing commissions from the late king stuartpapers passim james

county of somerset the seat of monmouths rebellion and jefferyss cruelties was now ready to receive him with open arms the town of taunton itself that had suffered so much eight years before for opposing james expressed the greatest affection for his person and the warmest zeal for his restoration the legal severities of the year      must therefore have been exaggerated or the people acquitted the king of the rigorous conduct of his servants the lord powlet and the majority of the gentlemen of the county together with the citizens of taunton solemnly engaged themselves to james to rise in his cause even individuals were as unsteady to their former principles as bodies of men the famous ferguson who had uniformly abetted the opposition to the late king till he lost his throne employed at this time all the vehemence of his active spirit in his cause he requested he even implored him to invade the kingdom to testify his own zeal to encourage james with a certainty of his success he proposed to deliver himself up in france to be punished with death should the enterprise fail some of the clergy who had most opposed james ran so violently into the other extreme that they

proceeded from their high principles in favor of monarchy but to what principle can be ascribed the relentings of the earl of sunderland that nobleman who had hurried james into his worst measures to accomplish his ruin endeavored by the like conduct to place him again on the throne william having distinguished sunderland with his favor for former services furnished that lord a second time with an opportunity to betray having with his usual address convinced the adherents of king james of the sincerity of his repentance he wrote a letter full of contrition for his past conduct to that prince he told him that a descent with a competent force was the only means of finishing the misfortunes of the king and the miseries of the nation he informed him that from the state of the kingdom an invasion could not fail of success he declined to enter into particulars because he was afraid his majesty did not confide sufficiently in his advice but when he should be assured that the king was satisfied with his fidelity he promised to send the best intelligence and to contribute all in his power to his service the earl of arran vouched for the sincerity of sunderland the earl of marlborough pleaded in his favor but james had felt so much from his treachery before that even his pursuing the natural bias of his mind with regard to william could not convince him for some time that sunderland was sincere stuartpapers        parliament meets such was the secret state of affairs before and some time after the two houses met for the dispatch of the public business william opened the session on the seventh of november with a speech from the throne he lamented that his usual joy at meeting his parliament was damped by disadvantages by land and miscarriages at sea he ascribed the former to the number of their enemies he expressed his resentment against the authors of the latter he declared his resolution to punish the offenders he promised to manage better for the future his power at sea he desired them to consider whether the kingdom was not defective in the number of ships and in proper ports to annoy the enemy and to protect themselves he was very sensible he said of the great affection with which they had supported him against his enemies but he was persuaded that the experience of the last summer was sufficient to convince them all that an increase of forces by sea and land was necessary to put a happy period to the war his allies he said had resolved to add to their troops he formed no doubt on his part but his parliament would enable him with a suitable supply to follow their example he earnestly requested the commons to hasten their grants in order to render them effectual on their expeditious councils would depend he concluded that forwardness in his preparations which seemed necessary to the security and honor of the nation journals nov          proceedings of the commons many in the lower house were attached to the late king but the majority though tories in principle had uniformly supported the cause of william the people discouraged with repeated misfortunes and feeling the weight of the war on every branch of their commerce were loud in demanding peace some of the toryleaders in office particularly the earl of nottingham joined the voice of the people others of the same party sacrificed their opinion to their interest and adhered to the court a dispute arose in the house whether the miscarriages of the fleet or the supply should be the first object of their consideration the question was carried for the latter after a series of debates which continued six days on the thirteenth of november the house unanimously resolved to support their majestys and their government to their utmost power notwithstanding the vast sums raised in the preceding year they had greatly fallen short of the expenses of government those who served in the army were in the utmost distress for money more than one million of the wages of the seamen without any funds remained unpaid though the greatest severities were used the sailors in their distress became mutinous for want of pay the first business therefore of the commons was to grant four hundred thousand pounds by way of advance to remove immediately a part of that grievance this sum was to be raised on the general credit of the exchequer upon the promise of the commons to repay it with interest after the rate of seven per cent under a caution that this proceeding should form no precedent journals nov      they grant large supplies with equal alacrity the commons entered upon the great business of supply upon the general estimates of the navy and army they granted five millions for the service of the following year forty thousand seamen including two regiments of marines were required by government and voted by the house but to a demand of one hundred thousand men for the landservice they granted only eightythree thousand in this only they seemed uncomplaisant to the court besides a provision made for paying all wages due to seamen more than four hundred thousand pounds were voted for making up the deficiencies in the grants of the preceding year it was much more easy to grant the supplies in general than to find particular funds upon which they might be laid the commons began with a land tax four shillings in the pound were carried as soon as proposed dec    dec     the deficiencies of the last year were to be defrayed from this ready fund the second money bill was a supplement to the million annuity act of the year      near one hundred and twenty thousand pounds were still deficient though fourteen per cent had been allowed some appropriations of excise duties were made for this purpose the first lottery and the bank of england were two remarkable moneybills in the present session of parliament one million was raised by means of the first and one million five hundred thousand pounds by the second still the ways and means fell short of the money wanted new taxes were imposed and appropriated as funds of credit for raising the deficiencies which still subsisted in the necessary supplies journals passim   other proceedings the inquiry into the mismanagements at sea produced nothing but altercation and debate a general censure was passed but the censure was attended with no consequences the malcontents in the house of commons being the minority founded their opposition on popular grounds the bill for frequent parliaments was again introduced and a second time rejected the placebill was passed by the commons without opposition the lords made amendments but they withdrew them and passed also that important bill the facility with which it slipped through both houses proceeded probably from the certainty that it was to be rejected by the king the commons had become unpopular through the vast sums which they had granted for supporting an inglorious war to regain their credit with their constituents they framed the placebill william seldom subject to political terror refused his assent jan   th       though the commons in all appearance would have been much disappointed had the placebill passed into a law they remonstrated against the conduct of the king they voted that whoever had advised the refusal of the royal assent to the act touching free and impartial proceedings in parliament was an enemy to their

his own expense stuartpapers        of the two houses the affairs of the east india company which had already employed so much of the attention of parliament produced undecisive debates in the present session the train of corruption which soon after broke forth in such disgraceful discoveries had been already laid the complicated nature of the business and the violent opposition of the merchants prevented the friends of the company from making an immediate return for the favors which they had desired to receive a bill for a general naturalization of all foreign protestants created violent debates in the house of commons those who opposed it called the prejudices of the populace to the aid of their cause they averred that the design of the act was to place all the power and authority in england in the hands of aliens the people knew the affection of the king for his countrymen the dutch they believed that he would sooner trust any foreigners than his own subjects the jacobite party in particular were vehement in their stuartpapers       spoke with uncommon violence against the bill he concluded with a motion that the bill should be kicked out of the house and the foreigners out of the kingdom the people were inflamed to a degree of madness and the courtparty sacrificed the bill to the public rage  of parliament to pursue the session to its period we must transgress upon the order of time the grievances of ireland were again revived as they had not been redressed in pursuance of the kings promise the irish gentlemen who had made their appeal to the english parliament complained afresh of coningsby and porter whose injustice and tyranny had exceeded all bounds the earl of bellamont impeached them both in the house of commons the articles against coningsby contained charges of the blackest kind the accusation against porter was scarce less severe bellamont supported with vouchers every charge the commons seemed convinced of the guilt but they declined to ground upon them an impeachment the reason which they assigned was plausible if not sufficient they insinuated that in times of domestic commotions and civil war exertions of power might be necessary which should not be punished though they ought not to be approved though this argument satisfied the commons it was notorious that the crimes charged upon the accused were committed after the establishment of a civil government and the opening of the courts of justice bellamont for endeavoring to punish others was actually persecuted himself he was deprived of his place under the government while

fourteenth to transport an army into britain they observed in their letters to the late king that a descent in england would infallibly break the league and enable france to finish with advantage as well as reputation the war they assured him that while the confederates remained united the kingdom would be wretched and his own affairs obstructed if not ruined penn the famous quaker informed james in express terms that while there was a fool in england the prince of orange would have a pensioned parliament to give him supplies among others the earl of marlborough continued to espouse with

his party and numerous friends stuartpapers             in correspondence with the late king the adherents of the late king in all their representations in the preceding year agreed that thirty thousand men would be necessary to ensure a revolution in england when they perceived a coldness in the court of france they lessened their demands in the month of february they assured james that they found his party much stronger than they had ever imagined before they said twenty thousand men would now be sufficient to give him without a battle the throne they affirmed that the nation expected with impatience his arrival they told him that england could not till the month of april send to sea above twentyfive third and fourth rate men of war and these not completely manned that no more than seven thousand five hundred troops were then in the kingdom and that even these would be diminished to four thousand when the regiments destined for flanders should embark for that country ibid feb       lewis listened with some attention to the unfortunate king but he meant nothing less than to undertake with any vigor his cause though victorious in the field he was oppressed with calamities at home having exerted his whole force in the late campaigns he had already impoverished his subjects with grievous taxes besides a terrible famine had added in the preceding summer to the miseries which arose from the war hist de france tom iii   intrigues of marlborough but james was not discouraged either with the langour of lewis or the exhausted state of france though he placed little confidence stuartpapers march      james ii      in the professions of the noble converts to his cause he sent captain lloyd in the month of march to england to facilitate is now past should the offer which may well happen again be made i will accept but it is only to serve the king for whose reestablishment i am resolved to risque my life to expiate my crimes stuartpapers march      james ii       he had made the same professions to james himself in a letter in the preceding december admiral russel received lloyd with still greater marks of attention and regard he assured him with the strongest asseverations and even with oaths that he would undertake the restoration of the late king he promised to endeavor to gain the officers of the fleet he reiterated his most solemn protestations of fidelity he told him that the earls of shrewsbury and marlborough should be the winesses the judges and sureties of his conduct he however refused to avoid the french fleet though said he i once determined to execute that business as it depended then on myself alone ibid   russel lloyd not yet satisfied with the answer of russel opened various expedients to his view he told him that there certainly was a design in agitation for making a descent on the coast of france he therefore requested russel to send timely information to james that transports might be prepared where no attack could be feared he proposed that toward the end of autumn when the large ships should be disarmed and convoys sent to america he might retain in the channel such commanders as he should gain in the summer that safe in their fidelity he might himself transport such troops as might be necessary for accompanying the late king to england he still protested but seemed unwilling to determine on any plan lloyd gave an account to the earl of marlborough and to sackville of his conference with russel they observed that he said a great deal could he be trusted but that if he was not sincere all he could say would answer no purpose stuartpapers passim   shrewsbury the earl of shrewsbury had succeeded nottingham as secretary of state on the fourth of march a few days before lloyd arrived from france his being in office prevented him from admitting into his presence the avowed agent of the late king he however sent his mother the old countess of shrewsbury to lloyd with assurances of his fidelity he instructed her to inform him that upon being solicited to take the seals he declined that honor under the pretense of want of health that william insinuated he was no stranger to some words which the earl dropped in conversation in favor of the late king that the earl perceived there might be some danger in refusing the offer that he therefore promised to accept but that he requested a few days to settle his affairs in the country that he accordingly retired with some friends well mounted that as reports of an immediate descent were then current he had resolved to join james on his landing that he was disappointed in his hopes to his very great regret that he was obliged to take the seals on his return but that he only held them to serve the late king with more effect ibid march        godolphin godolphin was at this juncture first lordcommissioner of the treasury though he was trusted by william he affected to be in the interest of the late king he explained to lloyd his sentiments of james in the most affectionate manner in the world he expressed his fears that a peace was likely to be concluded before the end of the next summer he told him that he was sorry to believe from the words of the prince of orange for so he called the reigning king that the terms would be highly prejudicial to the late king he informed him that william would endeavor to oblige the most christian king to send james out of the dominions of france that he thought it his duty to acquaint his old master of the designs of his enemy and rival he told it as his opinion that king james should forthwith endeavor to transport himself into england with a considerable force that there appeared to him no difficulty in making a descent in this kingdom without either the aid or concurrence of russel that however he ought still to be treated with attention that he had said all that could be expected from a person in his situation that the earl of shrewsbury who was sincerely in the interest of the late king possessed an absolute influence over russel he assured lloyd that russel would infallibly appear before breast that this circumstance would give a just pretense to lewis to send an army to the coast he advised therefore that the necessary transports might be prepared in the summer to carry to britain the invaders in autumn he told him that the large vessels would return to port in the middle of september that the sailors would be dispersed the convoys sent to the different places of commerce the coast left bare of men of war that he believed a revolution might be effected without a blow as nine in ten of the people either heartily detested william or were firmly attached to the late king stuartpapers march        sunderland though the earl of sunderland possessed no office under william he held for an englishman a high place in his favor swayed by the natural levity of his own mind or infected with the changed opinions of others he continued his correspondence with the late king he however was more guarded in his intercourse with that prince than those great men who trusted their lives and fortunes in the hands of intermediate agents his soninlaw the earl of arran who first promoted his intrigues with the court of st germains was the only person in the secret in britain stuartpapers march       in france james concealed with great caution his intercourse with a man who had so much injured his cause before sunderland pressed the late king to an immediate invasion upon various grounds he entreated that prince to take advantage of the changed opinions of the people their contempt for william their discontent at the late heavy taxes their losses at sea their disappointments in the war by land these circumstances he informed him would ensure a favorable reception to himself in the kingdom while the design of sending the greatest part of the fleet to the streights and almost the whole of the army to flanders would render his passage easy and his success certain he advised the late king not to be intimidated with the great supplies granted to the reigning prince as the money given by the parliament could not be raised in time to place the kingdom in a state of defense stuartpapers   whigs and tories promiscuously in office while sunderland tendered thus his advice to james he and the earl of portland formed the secret cabinet of william dutch encroachments p  0  that prince felt some part of the misfortunes which he had contributed to throw on his predecessor when he sat on the throne he was worst served by those whom he courted the most impressed with the opinion that interest forms the principles of men he resolved to bribe into fidelity those whom he could not otherwise trust in the arrangements of the present year he seems however to have regarded most the supposed whigs the admiralty in particular was placed in the hands of that party russel was made first commissioner rook and houblon supplanted the obnoxious admirals delaval and killigrew at the board though william seems to have entertained some wellgrounded suspicions of shrewsbury he was accounted a whig by the nation and though the marquis of caermarthen was considered a tory by principle his known prudence was deemed a security for his faith to the prevailing powers but some other persons of rank who were known to be adverse to the late revolution were either continued in employment or raised to office among the latter the earl of abingdon then actually in correspondence with james succeeded to a place of profit vacant by the death of the lord lovelace gazette   titles conferred on the twentyfifth of april a few days after he prorogued his parliament william went to gravesend to embark at that place for holland the wind proving contrary he returned to kensington the next day this accident furnished the king with a further opportunity of gratifying some of his principal subjects with dignities and honors but though he had of late shown some attention to the whigs his first care seems still to have been commanded by the tories the marquis of caermarthen was created on the thirtieth of april duke of leeds the title of duke of shrewsbury was conferred upon the earl of the same name the earl of clare then deeply engaged with james stuartpapers            was raised to the dignity of duke of newcastle the earl of mulgrave a secret abettor of the designs of the late king ibid  was made marquis of normanby with an annual pension of three thousand pounds but no titles of honor nor even views of profit could reconcile these men either to the manner or title of the king shrewsbury and leeds whose advice mary was implicitly to follow in her husbands absence were to have embarrassed and betrayed her councils should her father appear with a force in england ibid  to stop their clamours rather than to gratify the party who had raised him to the throne the king before his departure for holland had ordered patents for dukedoms to be prepared for the earls of bedford and devonshire the first derived his title to a name in party from the fate of his unfortunate son disappointments in his views for the public as well as personal neglect had rendered the latter indifferent concerning the fate of william and the permanency of his authority ibid    0        preparations at sea on the fourth of may the king embarked at gravesend but the wind being contrary he went by land to margate and was escorted from that place to holland by a squadron of dutch men of war the projected operations of the summer at sea had employed a great part of his attention during the winter his councils however were betrayed the destinations of the different squadrons were generally known stuart papers       nothing but the time of their departure which depended upon accidents remained a secret sir francis wheeler with a strong squadron of english and dutch men of war had been sent to convoy the trade to the mediterranean in the end of the preceding year on the seventeenth of february a terrible tempest overtook his fleet in the bay of gibraltar the admiral himself some ships of war and several merchantmen were lost the rest were disabled some took shelter in gibraltar many in the harbor of cadiz the combined fleets were not assembled on the coast of england till the end of april russel hoisted his flag at portsmouth on the twentyseventh of that month and his avowed design was to sail into the mediterranean to defend the ports of spain from the french who were resolved to make the principal effort of the campaign on that side burnet vol iii   an expedition against breast but the chief enterprise of the season was to be directed against breast the lord godolphin had furnished the late king in the month of march with this important intelligence stuartpapers       but from the uncertainty which attended the sailing of the fleet he could not fix the time general talmash contrary to the express opinion of russel promoted first and at length carried this design when the admiral hoisted his flag at st helens the landforces destined for the expedition were on their march under talmash to portsmouth the french had made no secret of their resolution to assist with their whole fleet the designs of the marshall de noailles upon barcelona the court of spain had concerted with william to send the main body of the combined fleet to protect the place men in general believed that the force under talmash was destined for the same service the french were either ignorant of the preparations of the english or they knew not where the storm was to fall the alarm concerning breast which had been raised by the intelligence sent by godolphin to james had already subsided besides the danger of france upon that side had been lessened by the actual sailing of her fleet from the port of breast on the fifteenth of april april   th n s   betrayed by the earl of marlborough may  th the zeal of the earl of marlborough for the service of the late king or his aversion to the reigning prince induced that nobleman to become upon this occasion an informer against his country he transmitted through the hands of colonel sackville intelligence of the danger to which france was exposed his letter was dated on the fourth of may he informed james that twelve regiments encamped at portsmouth with two regiments of marines all commanded by talmash were designed for destroying breast and the ships of war in that harbor he owned that success in the enterprise would prove of great advantage to england but that no consideration could now hinder or ever should prevent him from informing his majesty of all that he believed to be for his service he desired the late king to make the best use of the intelligence he told him that he might depend on its being exactly true but he conjured him for his own interest to keep the secret to himself and the queen he informed him that russel was to sail the next day with forty ships and that the rest of the fleet with the landforces were to follow the admiral in ten days he had endeavored he said to learn the whole from russel but he always denied the fact though he was no stranger to the design for six weeks before this continues the earl gives me a bad sign of this mans intentions sackville who transmitted the letter formed for the same reason a like unfavourable opinion of russel he mentioned that the man had not acted sincerely and that he feared he would never act otherwise stuartpapers may      james ii        the enterprise miscarries the event established the truth of the intelligence transmitted by marlborough russel sailed the next day with a part of the combined fleets shovel remained at st helens with the rest to take talmash and his troops on board on the twentythird of may the admiral having discovered that the french squadron had left breast returned on the twentyninth he again put to sea with the forces and on the fifth of june the division of the fleet destined to attack breast bore down for camaret bay under the command of the lord berkley nine hundred men were landed in a disorderly manner on the eighth of june under the fire of some men of war the bay was lined with entrenchments which were full of the french marines the english having for some time sustained the fire of the enemy suffered much and were forced to fly to add to the misfortune it was now ebbing tide and several boats were left dry on the sand confusion and slaughter prevailed six hundred were slain many were drowned talmash himself received a wound of which he afterward died at plymouth the ships which covered the landing were shattered by the batteries which guarded the shore one dutch frigate was sunk after losing almost her whole crew the french had profited so much by the intelligence of marlborough that the english chose to return without any further attempt to their own coast burnet marq of caermarthens journal   this disgrace at sea was not repaired by any splendid advantage obtained by land the french standing on the defensive in flanders amused william with dextrous movements throughout the summer with scarce half the force of the allies the dauphin assisted by the marshall de luxembourg covered from insult the french lines the king was forced to remain in a state of inactivity with the finest army he had ever brought into the field the rapid movement of the french from vignamont was the most signal event of the whole campaign having marched forty leagues in four days they formed an impenetrable line from the lys to the ocean and prevented william from attacking by land the maritime places which his fleet had insulted by sea he however found means to besiege and take the town and castle of huy he ended the campaign with this exploit and left the army on the thirtieth of september to stop the progress of the king on the side of flanders was deemed equal to a victory by the court of versailles the confederates had never a nearer prospect of success but their hopes were defeated by the abilities of the marshall de luxembourg hist de

passage of the river ter defeated the spanish army entrenched on the further shore he took palamos by assault on the seventh of june gironne and ostalric fell successively into his hands his designs upon barcelona were defeated by the arrival of russel with the combined fleet in the neighboring seas tourville with his squadron was blocked up in the port of toulon the absence of their ships stopped the progress of the french but a panic had seized the king and shaken the councils of spain the queen mother a daughter of austria and devoted to the views of her family prevented charles the second from soliciting peace on advantageous terms intrigue jealousy and even murder prevailed at court the queen mother gained the young queen by supporting her supposed lover the baron de perlis the duke dossona who alone remained faithful to the interest of his master was poisoned and the public measures were distracted between the feeble efforts of a weak monarch and a faction devoted to the court of vienna hist despagne tom ii   other military transactions in piedmont the campaign was inactive nothing of moment happened upon the upperrhine the duke of savoy was employed in secret negociations with france the emperor made his chief effort on the side of hungary the war in that country produced no striking event but the poles in alliance with the imperialists defeated the tartars on the neister in the month of october oct     the operations of the combined fleets in the ocean after the fruitless attempt upon breast were either languid or illdirected the lord berkley bombarded diep july     with some effect he was not equally successful at havre he proceeded from thence to la hogue and cherbourg but his progress was more a matter of parade than service william anxious to make an impression on france on the side of flanders had recommended an attempt upon dunkirk and calais in the course of the summer a squadron under the command of sir cloudsley shovel and subject to the directions of one meesters a dutchman came before the first of those places on the twelfth of september this man had invented a machine which from the fury of its discharge was called the infernal two of these machines were sent in against the fort which guarded the risbank the first blew up without effect the latter spent its effect on itself and was destroyed the attempt on calais july    was equally unsuccessful and thus the naval campaign in the ocean especially if the expression may be used produced neither glory nor advantage to the nation burchit   king arrives parliament meet the king having left the army on the last day of september repaired to his favorite residence at loo on the twentythird of october he departed from that place having adjusted at the hague the state of the war for the ensuing year he set sail from the maese on the eighth of november and landed at margate the next day the queen met him at rochester and they arrived at kensington on the tenth in the evening amidst the acclamations of the populace the parliament after repeated prorogations met on the twelfth at westminster the king informed them in his speech that he was glad to meet them in such a good posture of the public affairs he told them that the enemy had not been in a condition to meet the fleet in these seas that the great force sent into the mediterranean had broken all their designs in spain and that an effectual stop had been put to the progress of the french arms on the side of flanders he doubted not he said neither their affection for his person nor their zeal for the public service he therefore demanded such supplies as might enable him to prosecute the war with that vigor which was the only means for procuring peace he put them in mind that the act of tonnage and poundage was to expire at christmas and that the great anticipations had rendered that revenue necessary for the support of the crown journals nov      a supply granted the commons declining to proceed to business adjourned themselves for seven days the plan of government was either not settled or the heads of the opposing party were to be sounded and gained a bill for frequent parliaments which has since obtained the name of the triennial bill seems to have been the price of the demanded supplies the absolute necessity of a frequency of parliaments had been asserted in the declaration of rights but the demands of the subject on this important point had been expressed in such indefinite terms that they had been hitherto eluded with ease by the crown the measure was prosecuted with such an appearance of firmness that the court party chose to comply the bill was accordingly prepared ibid nov     and it was followed with a vote of supply nov     two millions and near four hundred thousand pounds were granted for the service of the navy dec    and the like sum to support the army throughout the ensuing year the house voted that the subsidies of tonnage and poundage which expired on the twentyfourth of december should begin from the twentysixth and continue for five years the discontinuing of these duties for one day was intended to prevent the pretense of prescription on the side of the crown for revenues which ought to be considered as the free gift of the subject  triennial bill the king came to the house of lords on the twentysecond of december and gave the royal assent to the triennial bill two reasons burnet vol iii seem to have combined to induce william to give his concurrence to an act which he had defeated the preceding year the commons he found were resolved to receive this concession from the crown as the price of a supply for the war besides the queen had been taken ill of the smallpox the day before with incurable symptoms of that dangerous disease he was unwilling therefore by an exertion of the prerogative to shake his influence with the nation which would necessarily be weakened by the event of her death his prudence only could in this instance overcome his attachment to what he deemed to be the inherent right of the crown the commons however in asserting the liberties of the subject appeared not to have neglected themselves in the second clause of the bill they implied the continuance of the parliament then subsisting for three years this selfish provision was not passed without censure in the house of peers some lords at the last reading protested against the bill as tending to the continuance of the present parliament longer than was agreeable to the constitution of england journals of the lord dec      death and character of the queen the distemper of the queen from bad symptoms advanced rapidly to worse till it terminated in her death on the twentyeighth of december her figure her manner her affability the decency of he carriage and equality of her temper rendered he sincerely and generally beloved by a people ever for of the virtues of their princes in her person she was tall and graceful full proportioned and easy in all her motions though her complexion was not fair the lineaments of her face were regular and wellcombined a lively and piercing eye threw such a pleasing light on her countenance that she even might be called a woman of beauty the genuine features of her mind are difficult to be traced as her passions were neither uncommon in their kind nor strong in their degree a strict attention to her husband and even an absolute subserviency to his will seem to have been more the rule of her life than those more majestic virtues which alone could thoroughly justify her political conduct when she held the reins of government she displayed more prudence than ability and less of art than solidity of judgment unambitious in her disposition and subdued in her youth to obedience she was ever uneasy under the weight of power and she always resigned her authority not only with indifference but even with pleasure her private virtues in short were chiefly conjugal she was not a kind sister none will say that she was an affectionate child her situation it must be confessed was cruel and difficult it was only through a breach of the ties of nature she could become at all an object of public applause  grief of william though william was neither a fond husband nor subject to feelings of a delicate kind he exhibited every symptom of an unfeigned grief upon the death of the queen her amiable manner and an habitual attention to all his commands had it seems made an impression on his mind which he had not cared to own besides gratitude had perhaps supplied the place of a warm affection in his breast the queen certainly deserved every return of friendship at his hands she had acted in all respects toward him as if virtue consisted solely in the implicit obedience of a wife to her husband motives of policy might also have joined their force to more tender sentiments in his mind the whole popularity of his measures proceeded from the open and agreeable deportment of mary many considered her as having the only natural right to the crown his own manner when at its best procured more respect than affection and he therefore had sufficient reason to lament the loss of a consort whose influence had so much contributed to reconcile the people to his government but whatever motive weighed most with the mind of william his prudence might have been trusted as to the sincerity of his grief  conduct of the princess of denmark the city of london the two houses of parliament the nation in general expressed in warm addresses to the throne their sense of the merit of mary and their own sorrow the princess of denmark was induced by the earl of sunderland to send a letter of condolence on the death of her sister to the king this princess even before her disgrace in the year      had begun a secret correspondence with her father but having now obtained a nearer prospect of the crown she was easily induced to adopt an appearance of reconciliation with william his prudence dictated that he ought to meet her halfway he was apprehensive that she might carry her resentment for former injuries to a pitch that might prove uneasy to his government if not dangerous to his power she was the next heir by act of parliament she was nearer than william himself by the title of blood he was sensible that many had been restrained by their deference to mary as the daughter of the late king and he was certain that at least the discontented would pay their court with more diligence to the princess should he permit her to remain in a state of proscription from his favor he therefore admitted her into his presence presented her with most of her sisters jewels and conferred upon her some other favors more from political views than any affection for her person burnet duchess of marlborough   reflections of james on the death of mary mary was scarcely considered as a partner in the regal authority during her life her death therefore produced no material change some doubts arose whether the parliament was not dissolved by her demise but the question was scarce proposed in the house of lords when it was dropped as unfit to be debated burnet vol iii  the late king declined to make any efforts for his restoration upon the present occasion he conceived hopes that a government which he thought depended upon the popularity of his daughter would shake and unhinge itself by her decease he was much affected by the intelligence but his sorrow was more that of an enthusiast than a father he was rather grieved at her manner of dying than at her death the king said that unfortunate prince received this additional affliction to those which he had already undergone he saw a child whom he tenderly loved persevering to her death in a signal state of disobedience and disloyalty he perceived that she was extolled for a crime as for the highest merit he heard her contradictions called virtues and her breach of duty to a parent a becoming sacrifice to her religion and her country james h       such were the reflections of james upon the death of a daughter whose behavior to a parent could scarce be justified by his own conduct  proceedings of parliament the death of the queen though alarming to the nation interrupted not the course of business in parliament a remarkable transaction in the preceding summer and autumn was laid before the commons early in the present session one lunt a person of a very profligate character who had once been a daylabourer at highgate gave information on the fifteenth of june concerning a plot for levying war against the government he affirmed that he had delivered commissions from the late king to several gentlemen in lancashire and cheshire that at their instance and expense he had bought arms and enlisted men that he had been twice sent to france to receive the commands of james concerning the intended insurrection and that one wilson who had assisted him in delivering the commissions was privy to the circumstances of the plot the supposed conspirators were seized they were brought to london and then remanded to manchester to take their trials lunt and wilson swore to the truth of the information but lunt being ordered in court to point at the several prisoners mistook his men this created a violent suspicion of perjury and at the instant one taffe who had been acquainted with lunt declared publicly that the whole plot was nothing but a villainous contrivance fabricated between himself and that profligate witness the kings council stopped all proceedings the prisoners were acquitted and the popular clamor became so loud in favor of the accused that the ministry found it necessary to commit their witnesses to prison and to order them to be prosecuted trial kennet vol iii ralph vol ii auct cirat passim   on the lancashire plot though the most of the persons accused were attached to the late king and some of them actually plotting for his service the information of lunt and his associates seems to have had no foundation in fact the whole appears to have been framed by the intrigues and precipitate zeal of one johnston a scotsman brother to the secretary of state of that name this busy and selfinterested man had in the hopes of a gratification from william long acted the part of an informer against the jacobites in england as well as in scotland he had employed every mean art to circumvent the unwary and to find evidence against the accused johnstons letters to carstares  the victory obtained by the gentlemen of lancashire over the witnesses of government in a court of justice induced them to lay their grievances before the parliament the result of the deliberations of the commons answered not their hopes on the subject they voted that there had been sufficient grounds for the prosecution and trial of the conspirators at manchester and that a dangerous plot had been carried on against the king and government notwithstanding these resolutions the witnesses were tried and found guilty of perjury at the lancaster assizes they were afterward aug      indicted for a conspiracy against the lives and estates of the accused gentlemen but the prosecution was dropped and lunt and wilson were discharged  an inquiry into abuses the popularity of passing the triennial bill into a law secured not william from an opposition in parliament the commons ordered a state of the loans debts and charges upon the revenue together with an account of the expense of the civil list to be laid before their house journals january   th  they opened the same day a channel of inquiry into abuses and corruptions which led to important but disgraceful discoveries of the venality of the times upon a petition of the inhabitants of royston against the violence and exactions of the soldiery the house came to some spirited votes they resolved that the officers and soldiers demanding and exacting subsistencemoney in their quarters or on a march was arbitrary and illegal and a great violation of the rights of the subjects some agents who by defrauding the soldiers of their pay had forced them into violences were committed by the command of the house guy secretary of the treasury the known instrument of the crown in purchasing yotes in parliament was sent to the tower for taking a bribe for himself ibid feb       they addressed the king against colonel hastings for his acts of avarice and violence against his regiment and that officer was instantly discharged from his command a bill was ordered in the mean time to oblige the agents of the regiments to account for the disposal of the money which they had received ibid   the speaker expelled for corruption this detection of flagrant abuses established a wellfounded opinion that the court the camp the city and even the parliament were infected with one general contagion of bribery corruption and venality the commons to extricate themselves from their part of the aspersion resolved to proceed in their inquiry the unsuccessful attempts made by the city of london to carry the orphans bill into a law and the facility with which it had been lately passed created suspicious

they even frustrated all the endeavors of that assembly by procuring a new charter from the king the house suspected corruption upon the present occasion and they ordered the same committee who had examined the books of the chamberlain to inspect those of the east india company the abstracts of the sums paid for special services since the revolution soon led to the discovery so much required in the reign of james the annual charges scarce exceeded twelve hundred pounds ever since they had gradually increased in the year      they were very considerable but in the year      when the charter was obtained they amounted to near ninety thousand pounds which had been lent on the notes of sir thomas cook the governor of the company cook was called before the house he resused to account for the money he was immediately committed to the tower and a bill ordered to be brought in to oblige him to make a discovery the bill passed in a few days and was sent up to the lords for their concurrence

his zeal for cook rendered his own honor suspected the protestations of his innocence with which he blended his speech against the bill were considered as so many acknowledgments of guilt in a man more remarkable for his talents than either for his integrity or disinterestedness the house yielding either to his arguments or influence postponed the business from the sixth to the thirteenth of april a point of consequence as the session was known to draw near to its close cook was brought before the lords on the thirteenth he declared himself willing to make a full discovery on condition of being indemnified against all actions and suits except those of the east india company whom he had never injured the peers resolved to drop the bill of pains and penalties sent up from the commons and they ordered a committee to withdraw to form such a bill of indemnification as cook required the commons amended the bill with a penal clause the lords agreed to the amendment and cook was directed by the act to make a full discovery to a joint committee of peers and commons on or before the twentythird of april journals passim   by the commons some in both houses were eager in the prosecution of the affair but from the loss of time the majority seemed determined to defeat a measure which common decency forbade them to drop entirely the king himself appeared to be no great friend to a

containing an unsatisfactory discovery several persons privy to the transaction were examined ten thousand pounds were traced to the king five thousand to the duke of leeds and other sums to other men

eighth of january a committee of the commons were appointed to receive proposals to prevent clipping and the exportation of silver the report of the committee lay for some time neglected on the table

countenance to patersons plan which from views of their own was adopted with ardour by the scottish ministry the project was to establish one settlement at darien on the east side of the isthmus of america and another on the opposite side toward the south sea this scheme was laid before the king by secretary johnston instructions were prepared and signed impowering the commissioner to give his assent to any bill for the encouragement of trade that nobleman accordingly communicated the kings intentions to the parliament the bait was greedily seized the people lost their resentment in a condescension which flattered their hopes of wealth the parliament itself was all submission a vote of condolence for the death of the queen was instantly passed they gave at once all the necessary supplies the ways and means were a general polltax a sixmonths cess out of the landrents and an additional excise proceedings of scot parl   proceedings but notwithstanding this seeming complaisance to the crown the current of the nation for an inquiry into the massacre of glenco was too strong to be opposed the artifice of the courtparty could not conceal the shocking circumstances of that barbarous affair they however diverted with some appearance of decency the implication of guilt from the king himself to dalrymple his acting minister upon that occasion the parliament voted the whole a murder they addressed the king for justice on the offenders but their application was couched in terms which seemed to demand no compliance with their request william accordingly paid no attention

likely to increase after the intended elections for a new house of commons william he said was to demand eight millions from parliament and to alter the established succession by preferring any children he might hereafter beget to the princess of denmark and her son but middleton built most on the credit of sunderland who he continued had been always the first to deceive himself and the

blow the success of william in seizing the throne of england his inflexible perseverance in all his plans his courage in the field his apparent prudence in the cabinet his former obstinacy in continuing an unsuccessful war and at length the reputation which he acquired in the present campaign excited that admiration which invariably follows good fortune he was besides seen through a favorable medium by the nations of europe the haziness which covered him at home obscured not his luster abroad the astonishing exertions of england in the war were ascribed to his management he was considered as the absolute master of holland and not only the chain which united the grand confederacy but even the absolute lord of the members of which it was composed perths correspondence stuartpapers        compared with james his rival if in his present distressed condition james deserved that name labored under every disadvantage in the eyes of the world the enthusiasm which had deprived him of his throne was construed into an incurable folly by the more sensible part of his own persuasion a kind of wicked policy as the pope perhaps ludicrously said had superseded every idea of religion among the catholic powers who were engaged in the grand alliance innocent the twelfth himself though the sat in st peters chair was swayed by temporal views from entertaining any favor for a prince who had sacrificed his crown to a blind attachment to the romish faith he received the earl of perth who had been sent in the character of ambassador by james with manifest coldness or treated him with seeming ridicule the utmost that the most pressing solicitations could obtain from that pontiff amounted only to a compliment he assured the earl of perth that the would never concur in a peace which tended to deprive a catholic prince of his just rights but innocent and all his court were in the interest of the house of austria and thus james though a very faithful son of the church lost his influence with the holy father through his dependence on france perths letter stuartpapers        kings progress william having spent some time at loo repaired to the hague on the seventh day of october having in an interview with the elector of brandenburg and in conferences with the states of holland settled the operations of the succeeding campaign he returned to england and

november the earl of sunderland in concert with the court of st germains advised this measure stuartpapers       the former parliament from their liberal grants to the crown were become odious to the people and the latter therefore were not likely to choose again representatives so compliant to the views of the king but william beheld the matter in another light the popularity which he thought he derived from the glory of a successful campaign induced him to hope for a return of members more favorable to his interest than those who had lately pushed their inquiries so far to improve to his advantage the present good humor of the people the king resolved to make a royal progress but his want of affability his frigid manner and dry address were not calculated either to gain the favor of the populace or to retain it when gained a visit which he paid to the earl of sunderland at althorp was construed by his enemies into gratitude for former favors while his precipitate retreat from

elections for the new house of commons the jacobites were unsuccessful in proportion to the decline of their cause few of the known adherents of the late king were returned but the abbetors of the interest of the reigning prince were not implicitly chosen by the nation many of the firmest whigs were elected men who made a greater distinction between the principles of government than between the persons of kings the two houses met on the twentysecond of november foley who had succeeded trevor in the office of speaker was again placed by the commons in the chair the king in his speech from the throne demanded the usual supplies to prosecute with vigor the war he complained that the funds which had been formerly given were deficient he represented that the civil list was in a condition which rendered it impossible for him to subsist unless that matter should command their immediate care he recommended the french protestants to their support he laid before them the bad state of the coin he expressed his wishes for a bill to encourage seamen he concluded with assuring the commons that he wa entirely satisfied with the choice which his people had made journals nov           a bill for regulating trials the commons addressed the king on the twentyninth of november and promised to assist him effectually in the prosecution of the war but before any supply was voted a bill was brought in for regulating trials in cases of treason and misprision of treason a bill to the same effect had been often introduced before and as often disappointed the adherents of the court opposed it in its progress the popularity of the measure at length prevailed by this salutary law it was provided that no person should be tried for high treason except an attempt to assassinate the king unless the indictment be found within three years after the offense was committed that the prisoner shall have a copy of the indictment but not the names of the witnesses five days at least before his arraignment that he shall have a copy of the panel of jurors two days before his trial and that he shall have the same compulsive process with the crown to force his witnesses to appear statute   w  a change of situation too frequently makes an alteration in the principles of men many who had suffered by the want of such a law in the two former reigns opposed with vehemence the bill they argued that the security of the government was the best provision for the security of the subject and they urged that the act by giving every possible advantage to conspirators exposed the kingdom to revolution and change  a supply voted on the second of december the commons voted the supply for the war two millions five hundred thousand pounds were assigned to the navy journals dec    two millions for the support of an army of eightyseven thousand men though these sums were great they were less than the demands of the crown there was besides an arrear of deficiency for which no provision was made but before the supply was fixed upon adequate funds a matter of the last importance employed the attention of the commons the act passed in the preceding session of parliament to prevent the clipping and exportation of silver coin had been found inadequate to the purpose the evil had risen to too great a height to be removed by slight remedies the lords went first upon the business they prepared an address to which they desired the concurrence of the commons to request the king to put a stop by proclamation to the currency of clipped crowns and halfcrowns the commons chose to proceed in their own way they went into a committee of the whole house to deliberate on the state of the nation with respect to the current coin journals   debates individuals differed much in their opinions upon a subject in which the interests of all were so deeply concerned it appeared from various experiments that the silver coins on a medium were diminished at least one third in proportion as the intrinsic of silver sunk beneath its nominal value the gold rose two evils with equal violence pressed the nation on either side a remedy must be instantly applied the first question proposed to the commons was whether it was expedient to recoin the silver money the house was divided upon the subject the opponents of the court opposed the recoinage with some specious arguments they affirmed that the present conjuncture was by no means fit for a measure whose operations must give so general and so violent a shock to the nation they observed that the people labored under the calamity and expense of a burdensome and doubtful war that the nation as yet unsettled in their opinions with regard to the present establishment might be provoked by this new grievance to unhinge the government that though things might be managed and accommodated at home it would be difficult if not impossible to maintain either commerce or war abroad that a present recoinage would most certainly suspend all the operations of trade for the want of mutual payments and they concluded with affirming that the people in their despair might be hurried into the most dreadful extremities  on the coinact the necessity of a speedy remedy was argued by the other side they observed that the bad state of the coin had turned the exchange of all europe in an alarming degree against the nation that therefore the supplies voted for the support of the army abroad would never answer their end that guineas by this growing evil were already advanced to thirty shillings and foreign gold in the same extravagant proportion that all europe sent their gold as the most valuable of all commodities into our market that gold at last would remain the sole currency for trade in the kingdom but that it could not be expected that other nations would receive that commodity at the value which it bore in this kingdom they concluded with affirming that the evil would gather additional strength every day that the contagion had already spread through every vein of commerce and that unless a speedy and powerful remedy should be applied the certain dissolution of the state advanced with hasty strides  a bill passed the question whether the standard of the several denominations of the new money should continue the same produced many and vehement debates some affirmed that as the price of silver was raised to six shillings and threepence  the standard should be proportionably increased they argued that the measure would prevent the exportation of the coin and the melting of it down as had been practiced for several years they urged at the same time that people would be induced to bring their plate and bullion to the mint from views of advantage the majority with more reason asserted that it was impossible the price of silver could either rise or fall in respect of itself that the alteration in the price of bullion was merely relative to the diminished money and they affirmed in support of their position that an ounce of bullion could be actually bought at that very time for five shillings and two pence of newmilled money as to the exportation of the coin they justly observed that nothing could effectually prevent that evil but a superiority in trade over other nations the arguments for a new coinage on the old standard at length prevailed the present inconvenience was deemed less dangerous than the future evils which were justly to be apprehended the commons resolved to put a stop to the currency and to proceed to a new coinage with the utmost attention and dispatch dec  0  a bill was accordingly brought in for that purpose dec     and twelve hundred thousand pounds were voted for supplying the dificiency of clipped money this sum was ordered to be raised by a duty for seven years on houses and windowlights dec      address against the scottish east india company these measures though spirited appeared from the event to be too precipitate a proclamation for stopping the currency of the gold coin was issued before the mint had provided any quantity of new money for the purposes of trade this evil was in some measure remedied by an act formed upon subsequent resolutions in parliament but the wisdom of that assembly could not prevent a general loss of credit which shook the government while it distressed the nation another affair of importance employed a part of the attention of both houses during the debates on the coin on the fourteenth of december dec     the lords sent down to the commons an address to the king against an act passed in the scottish parliament for erecting a company trading to africa and the east indies the commons concurred with the peers the two houses attended the king with their address his answer was that he had been illserved in scotland but that he hoped some remedy might be found to the evil of which they complained this indefinite reply was not sufficient to satisfy the commons      they resolved that the directors of the scottish company should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors that a council of trade should be established by act of parliament for the preservation of the commerce of england that the commissioners should be nominated by parliament but that none of them should be members of the house jan           a bill for a new council of trade an attempt to establish a new board by act of parliament was considered by the adherents of the court as a high encroachment on the rights of the crown william himself was as fond of the prerogatives as any of his predecessors in the throne he stuartpapers        the commons address against the earl of portland while the commons seemed thus to encroach on the power of the crown they pushed an inquiry which affected the person of the king bentinck whom william had created earl of portland retained in england that ascendency in the favor of his master which he had acquired in holland he had obtained from the king a grant of the lordships of denbigh bromfield and yale in the county of denbigh and a part of the ancient demesnes of the prince of wales the gentleman of the county had opposed the warrant for the grant in the treasury they followed it with their opposition to the office of the earl of pembroke who was then lordprivyseal this nobleman was at the time in correspondence with the late king he heard the petitioners with a seeming candor which bordered on favor the affair was permitted to lie dormant but the warrant was not recalled the gentlemen of denbigh carried their complaints before parliament mr price afterward a baron of the exchequer introduced the petition with a spirited but vehement and bitter speech the house warmed to a degree of fury voted unanimously an address against the grant the king promised to recall the warrant but he assured the commons that he would find some other way of showing his favor to the earl of portland journals  he performed his promise in the most ample manner in the succeeding may  an incident favorable to william in the midst of circumstances so mortifying to william a favorable event changed the whole face of his affairs the reputation which he had acquired in flanders his weight and consequence abroad and his own persevering policy at home were not sufficient to supply the loss of influence which he sustained in the death of mary the nation distressed by an adulterated and diminished currency offended at the captures made upon their commerce at sea and oppressed with the enormous expense of the war by land placed all their misfortunes to the account of the kings predilection for other interests than those of england his manner was better calculated to inflame than to allay the ferment which prevailed in the minds of his subjects his enemies took every advantage of the state of the public opinion they increased the discontents of the people in general and they found means to improve the same bad humor in the new parliament  preparations of james for an invasion the malcontents had foreseen in the preceding summer the height to which the bad humor of the people was likely to rise they urged the late king as has been already related to undertake an invasion they promised insurrections in england whenever he should appear on the coast when the new parliament discovered symptoms of refractoriness to the measures of william the adherents of james redoubled their instances for an invasion early in the spring they assured that prince that to land in england wa to regain without contest his crown that cou he once come to london or even to some considerable town without any force the greatest part of the nation would rise in arms and resore him to the throne lewis the fourteenth flattered with the accounts agreed to furnish an army and every thi necessary for a descent he however insisted that the jacobites should rise in arms before the french troops should embark and the duke of berwick was dispatched by his father to england to take the insurgents under his command james ii       the preparations of france were carried forward with expedition and zeal the troops intended for the invasion began to draw near to calais and dunkirk four hundred sail of great and small vessels were assembled from different ports james himself urged by lewis the fourteenth took post on the seventeenth of february and he arrived on the twentieth at calais the dutch became alarmed for their own country but an unaccountable security prevailed in britain ibid   a conspiracy against the kings life during these preparations for an invasion from france a conspiracy for assassinating william was framed in england by some zealous adherents of the late king this scheme had been forming long one crosby had been sent to the court of st germains to demand a commission from james for perpetrating the crime but that prince suspected from his earnestness that crosby was employed by william himself to persuade him to consent to a measure which must for ever put an end to his hopes ibid  the zealous conspirators had long endeavored but in vain to argue james into an express approbation of the attempt upon the person of the king they however obtained at length a commission for a general insurrection ibid  against william and all his adherents this commission was placed dec  0      in the hands of sir george barclay a native of scotland a man of courage and an experienced soldier barclay arrived in london in the month of january he joined himself in that city to one harrison a priest to charnock who from being a fellow of magdalen college at oxford had become a roman catholic and a captain to one captain porter and to sir william perkins  the plot discovered these inconsiderate and daring men under the pretense of a commission from james gained over some desperate jacobites to aid them in their projected scheme they first proposed to surprise seize and carry william to france james ii       but this was deemed impracticable should they scruple to take his life ibid they resolved therefore to attack him with an armed party consisting of forty men in the midst of his guards the scene of the intended assault was the lane between brentford and turnhamgreen through which william usually passed upon his return from richmond the fifteenth of february was the day appointed for the execution of their purpose but an unexpected discovery baffled at once their views a captain fisher whom the chief conspirators had resolved to employ in the attack communicated the whole to the earl of portland on the thirteenth of february the same evening pendergrass an irishman and one of the forty confirmed the information of fisher they were both examined by the king in person he encouraged them to mix again with their friends he kept at home on the fifteenth of february the conspirators fixed upon the twentysecond of the month to execute their scheme the king again remained at home a panic seized the whole party some fled but others were seized the next night feb          in their beds  the kings speech to the parliament the day after the seizure of some of the conspirators the king informed his parliament of the danger which had threatened his life he acquainted the two houses that preparations were made in france for invading the kingdom he assured himself he said that nothing should be omitted on their part that might be deemed proper for the present safety or the future security of his people he told them that he had not been wanting in giving the necessary orders to the fleet that he had commanded a considerable body of troops to be brought home that some of the conspirators against his person were already seized that care was taken to apprehend the rest and that upon the whole all such other orders were given as the public safety in the present conjuncture seemed to require the two houses lost at once their bad humor in the danger to which the life of the king had been exposed they sent a joint address to the throne full of expressions of the most unlimited zeal and loyalty they declared to all the world that should his majesty come to any violent death they would revenge the same on all his enemies and their adherents as an instance of their affection to william they promised to give all possible dispatch to the public business and they made it their desire to the king to seize upon the present occasion all such persons as he should think fit to apprehend journals feb      zeal of the two houses the commons followed their warm address with various resolutions of the same kind they ordered in a bill to enable his majesty to seize all suspected persons they prepared an address for commanding by proclamation all papists to retire from the cities of london and westminster they drew up the form of an association for the defense of the kings person they acknowledged him the rightful and lawful sovereign of england they engaged themselves to support and defend the succession of the crown according to the act of settlement passed in the first year of the present reign four hundred members placed their names to the association in one day such as withdrew from the house or were absent with leave were ordered to sign that paper or signify their refusal before the sixteenth of march ibid  the same warmth of affection and even vehemence of zeal extended themselves to the lords the peers adopted with little alteration the association signed by the commons the whole nation partook of the flame which the discovery of the plot had kindled in the two houses of parliament their objections to william were obliterated at once by their abhorrence of the conspiracy against his life and thus the imprudence of his enemies confirmed him in a throne on which he tottered before  projects of the late king broken this unsuccessful underplot of a few zealots was sufficient to ruin all the present projects of the late king but the seeds of disappointment were already sown in france itself a mr powel had been sent to st germains from the jacobites in england to lay before james the state of the designs in his favor in that kingdom powel spoke with such vehemence confidence and zeal that the late king supposed that his party were resolved to take arms when they should receive certain intelligence of his own preparations for an invasion from france he desired powel to put the whole in writing but before his commands were executed james happened to meet and converse with the most christian king he told that prince that his friends in england were ready upon the first notice to take arms he perceived his mistake when he read mr powels written account but he was afraid of alarming the french ministers who were never his friends by undeceiving the king the preparations for the expedition proceeded upon this mistake the adherents of james had declared it impossible for them to rise till he himself should land lewis gave positive orders that not a single vessel should sail till certain intelligence of an insurrection should arrive from england the late king was perplexed beyond measure by this insurmountable difficulty he derived his whole hopes from fortune and as usual he was deceived james h        the invasion laid aside the discovery of the plot in england broke in an instant the whole scheme the kingdom was in a ferment the french court who had not hitherto been undeceived lost all hopes of an insurrection an fell into their usual languor a storm which shattered the transports as they came round from havre an an uninterrupted course of contrary winds were adde to the other misfortunes of the late king he however remained on the coast of france the transports lay i the port of calais eighteen men of war intended for their convoy had anchored for their own protection against the enemy among the sands of dunkirk the appearance of the english fleet put an end to a design which seemed to be already broken admiral russel upon the first certain intelligence of the invasion was ordered to repair to the downs having hoisted his flag on board the victory and collected with incredible diligence and expedition a powerful fleet he stood over to graveline and stretched along the coast to calais calais was again bombarded with little effect to destroy the french men of war was found impracticable but the enemy instead of preparing for a descent on england became anxious for their own coast james in a disconsolate state of mind returned at length to st germains he saw his project broken his hopes blasted his friends ruined by their pursuing measures contrary to his judgment and without his consent james h        conspirators punished the courts of justice were in the mean time employed in the trial of such of the conspirators as had fallen into the hands of government charnock king and keys were the first tried and upon positive evidence condemned and executed they declared with one consent in papers delivered to the sheriffs that james was not only not privy to the design against the person of william but that he always rejected such proposals when offered sir john friend a wealthy citizen and sir william perkins were soon after tried and condemned the first for abetting the intended invasion the latter for concurring in the plot against the life of the king several other persons of less consequence and rank inferior suffered death for the same crimes the evidence against the most of the prisoners was full and decisive the notoriety of the conspiracy proved more fatal to a few than the facts advanced by the witnesses the conspiracy against the king was confounded on the present occasion with the intended invasion from france the whole seemed to have been the exact counterpart of the conspiracy in the year      when the people in their horror of the ryehouseplot transferred the guilt of assassins to men who meditated only an insurrection the criminals on the present occasion died enthusiasts to their political principles they confirmed their own minds in an opinion which they endeavored in vain to inculcate on james that any attack on an enemy was a species of war stuartpapers        proceedings of parliament during these transactions the parliament proceeded in the same strain of complaisance to the crown which the attempt on the life of the king had raised supplies were granted not only with liberality but even without reserve clauses of loan were inserted in almost every moneybill an act was passed impowering the king to apprehend and detain such persons as he might suspect of conspiring against his person and government the commons in a body presented the association at the foot of the throne on the third of april the lords soon after followed the example laid by the lower house a bank for the purpose of raising money for the use of the government was established by act of parliament this new institution obtained the name of the national landbank from its security lying on land the measure was unadvised and proved mischievous to public credit notwithstanding the complaisance of the two houses the king exerted his prerogative in a manner that gave some offerce to the commons he refused his assent to a bill for regulating elections of members to serve in parliament the projectors of the bill made a motion that those who had advised his majesty to put a negative on the bill were enemies to the king and kingdom but the current of the times ran with violence in favor of government and the motion was rejected by a great majority journals  the business of the crown being brought to a conclusion on the twentyseventh of april the king put a happy end to a session which promised at the beginning

peace prevailed throughout the kingdom past disappointments and the fear of future misfortunes had abated the ambition of the king he had lost his best generals in the course of the war and a great part of the reputation of his arms in the preceding campaign a deficiency in resources deprived him of every hope of making any successful efforts in the present year he had even some reason to fear he could not retain what he had already gained and that instead of pushing the enemy in their territories he would find it difficult to defend his own  her intrigues france however endeavored to supply with address what she wanted in point of power to provide against the misfortunes dreaded from the continuance of a burdensome war lewis extended with success his intrigues to the different courts of europe it turkey he induced mustapha the second to frustrate all the attempts made by the maritime powers to facilitate a peace he secured his influence in poland by a pension to the queen he gained the confidence of the courts of italy by professing a concern for the repose and prosperity of a country harassed by the exactions of the allied powers he disconcerted the measures of the germanic body by fomenting the feuds and supporting the pretensions of the various princes he placed spies and established pensioners in spain he gained the good offices of the king of sweden by flattering his pride and in holland he renewed his ancient correspondence with the heads of the republican party  and desire of peace in the midst of measures for supporting the war with vigor the french king thought seriously of means to obtain peace he endeavored in the preceding year through the channel of denmark and sweden to negociate a treaty for the reestablishment of the tranquillity of europe he had in some measure agreed to a preliminary of the imperial court that the affair of england should be settled to the satisfaction of the prince of orange he even ascribed the continuance of the war to williams hopes of regaining in one campaign the laurels which he had lost in the war during the winter the court of france continued to make advances toward a peace to facilitat a treaty they proposed to the states of holland that in case the affair of england was not settled to the satisfaction of the prince of orange the whole negotiation should be void they agreed to admit the treaties of westphalia and nimeguen as the basis of the expected peace but these advances on the side o france were not answered with equal warmth by the allied powers in proportion to the eagerness of lew for peace they rose in their demands and thus throughout the summer the whole affair remained in suspense  an inactive campaign in flanders william having left london on the second of may arrived at the hague on the seventh of that month but he joined not his troops till the sixth of june the french had taken the field with two armies one under marshall de villeroi was posted between mechlen and deynse the marshall de boufflers commanded another between flerus and sombref the king opposed in person the enemy at mariekirke with one army the elector of bavaria assembled another in the neighborhood of louvain the whole summer either passed in inaction or was wasted in motions which neither promised nor produced any important event though no congress was opened the expectations of peace suspended the operations of war the allies were in no condition to push with vigor the advantages which they had obtained in the preceding campaign and france in her present condition considered her being able to protect her conquests an advantage equal to the glory of a victory  operations on the side of spain to avail himself of the weakness of spain the french king bent his principal efforts toward that side a dispute with the court of madrid on account of a jew who had served him in quality of an agent had contributed to induce william to withdraw all the naval force of the english from the mediterranean but the french having ordered the squadron at toulon to fail into the ocean were incapable of insulting the coast of spain though exposed they however pushed with some vigor their operations by land the duke de vendome who commanded in catalonia was ordered to take the field he passed the ter on the the thirtieth of may he attacked the prince of hesse darmstadt on the banks of that river and forced him to retire with loss under the cannon of ostalric an inactive campaign succeeded this undecisive engagement the hopes of an immediate peace and the prospect of future advantages rose to france on the side of spain the queen mother who as a daughter of austria had carried the ammosities of her family against france into the councils of charles the second was lately dead lewis the fourteenth had his agents at madrid and he even then entertained hopes of practicing to advantage on the weakness of that prince hist despagne   naval transactions nothing of any moment happened on the side of germany the french and imperialists alternately passed and repassed to little purpose the rhine the efforts of the maritime powers at sea were as languid and undecisive as their operations by land sir george rooke upon his return from cadiz where he had wintered with his squadron was appointed commander in chief of the combined fleet having in vain endeavored to intercept the french fleet upon its way from toulon to breast he returned to torbay on the twentythird of may and he was recalled by the lords of the regency from his command the lord berkley who succeeded rooke performed nothing of any importance the most remarkable transaction of this summer at sea was performed by du bart who had sailed with a french squadron from dunkirk in the end of may he fell in on the eighth of june with a fleet of dutch merchantmen from the baltic under the convoy of five men of war the latter he took after an obstinate resistance thirty of the former fell also into his hands having performed this important service he escaped the vigilance of an english squadron and returned with his booty to france hist de france tom iii   military affairs desertion of the duke of savoy on the side of hungary an undecisive battle between the ottomans and the imperialists near temeswaer comprehended the whole operations of the campaign the poles were as usual inactive but the death of the king john sobieski converted their country into a scene of intrigue for the succession to the crown hist du nord tom ii  the czar of muscovy by the taking of asoph on the tanais rendered himself for the first time an object of attention to the courts of europe a peace between the french and the duke of savoy changed the whole face of affairs in italy this pacification which greatly disconcerted the allies had been long negociated by the count de tesse as intermediate agent between the duke and the marshall de catinat who commanded the french troops on the side of savoy de catinat made the first offer of peace on the sixth of june the duke willing to secure the supplies of the year from england and holland concealed for some time the treaty after it was actually signed may  0th  when he professed to avow the conditions they only seemed to comprehend the neutrality of italy he suppressed the terms which concerned his own interest but to convince the confederates of his determination to adhere to his agreement with france he laid siege on the thirteenth of september to valentia in conjunction with the marshall de catinat hist de france tom iii   advances toward a peace the defection of the duke of savoy while it much offended all the confederates rendered the maritime powers in particular very desirous of peace william had various reasons to wish for an immediate pacification with france the failure of the landbank on which he had so much credit the consequent difficulty of present remittances the uncertainty of future supplies the example of savoy for further desertions from the common cause the disposition of the states against the continuance of a burdensome war the clamours of the english under their heavy taxes all combined to make the reestablishment of the tranquillity of europe an object of importance to the king he therefore prosecuted with sincerity every measure to accomplish his views he concurred with the states in appointing dykveldt to confer with callieres who had for some time carried on in holland secret negociations leading to a peace on the twentyfourth of august dykveldt communicated the whole proceedings to the deputies of the states for foreign affairs the deputies made their report on the third of september to the states general who came to a resolution that the concessions of france to the demands of the emperor were sufficient grounds for accepting the mediation of sweden in concluding a general treaty of peace the house of austria in neither of its branches seemed willing to close with the proposal of the maritime powers the court of spain was offended with william the emperor had an interest in continuing the war de torcy tom i   english scottish and irish affairs in england nothing of importance happened during the summer the lords of the regency applied their chief attention to the recoinage of the silver money and to the operations of the fleet at sea in scotland a session of parliament was held on the eighth of september the lord murray eldest son of the marquis of athol being created earl of tullibardin was appointed commissioner the earl of arran and other malcontents took the oaths for the first time and their seats in the house a supply was voted for one years service to maintain the standing forces a measure calculated to induce the government to hold an annual session for its own support an illhumour had crept into parliament the people were distressed with a general scarcity which rendered them clamorous and discontented the commissioner therefore thought proper to put an end to the session on the ninth of october the lord capel dying in ireland the government of that kingdom devolved by the choice of the council on the chancellor sir charles porter in terms of an old act of parliament    hen viii  nothing material happened in a parliament which met by adjournment soon after his elevation to that dignity june   th  in the end of july the earls of montrath and drogheda were associated with porter in the government of the kingdom  parliament meets on the seventh of october the king arrived from holland at kensington on the twentieth of the same month the parliament met at westminster william in his speech from the throne expressed his satisfaction that no disorder had happened at home and no disadvantage abroad in the course of the present year he ascribed this happiness to the good disposition of his army and the steady affection of his people for his person he recommended unanimity on account of the magnitude and importance of the business which they had to transact the supplying of former deficiencies the providing for the service of the ensuing year he informed them of overtures made for a general peace but that the only means to reestablish the public tranquillity was to show themselves prepared for a vigorous and effectual war he earnestly desired the commons to raise speedily the necessary supplies which ought not to be less than the sum intended for the preceding year he recommended the civil list to their support the french protestants to their commiseration he desired them to consider whether some inconvenience did not still remain with regard to the coin he requested them to find the best expedient for the reestablishment of credit a circumstance as necessary for trade as for the support of the war journals oct  0        diligence of the commons the commons with perfect unanimity agreed immediately to resolutions which answered the chief demands of the kings speech in a spirited address they promised in the name of the people of england to support his majesty in obtaining by war a safe and honorable peace oct     they pledged the faith of the house that a supply should be granted for carrying on with vigor the war and that the deficiencies of the parliamentary funds should be made good oct     they applied themselves with the utmost diligence to this necessary business the sums to be raised were immense the deficiency of former funds amounted to more than six millions two millions and a half were found necessary for the navy and a still greater sum for the service by land public credit had in the mean time sunk so low that banknotes were at twenty per cent discount and exchequer tallies at sixty per cent the commons turned their immediate attention to the silver coin they resolved that the hammered money should be received only by weight that an allowance of four pence an ounce should be made on all loans and plate brought to the mint before the first of january nov    to answer the most pressing demands on government they resolved to transfer to the next aids any loans not exceeding six hundred thousand pounds that should be advanced on the credit of the exchequer nov     public credit restored to restore the credit of the bank which had from various causes fallen so low the commons resolved to extend the time of its continuance and to augment the capital feb         the new subscriptions were wisely ordered to be made in the tallies upon parliamentary funds and in banknotes the first in the proportion of fourfifths of the payments the latter as having been subject to the least discount in that of onefifth men of money for the benefit of acquiring at a low price a capital in the bank purchased with such eagerness the tallies and notes that their price arose the latter soon became equal to money the discounts on the former fell rapidly as a fund for the payment was fixed to supply the scarcity of money was as necessary for the purposes of commerce and government as the recovery of the credit of the bank notes and tallies bills were ordered to be issued from the exchequer to the amount of two millions bearing interest at more than seven per cent these were received in the exchequer with a small discount in the payments made of the revenue this measure raised at length exchequer bills to an equality with money and supplied at present the want of coin mountague who was then chancellor of the exchequer had the chief merit in measures which for the time relieved the nation from imminent distress  sir john fenwicks case the extraordinary case of sir john fenwick interrupted in some degree the deliberations of the commons on the subject of public credit fenwick had been accused of being concerned in a plot against the king he was taken at new romney in the preceding june in endeavoring to make his escape to france he was committed to newgate and a bill found against him by the grand jury june          to preserve or at least to prolong his life he fell upon the expedient of obtaining a pardon as a price of discoveries to the king through the means of the duke of devonshire he conveyed a paper to william when he was in flanders containing an account of correspondences and intrigues carried on with the court of st germains by the duke of shrewsbury the earls of bath and marlborough the lord godolphin and admiral russel though this account is known now to be true in every particular it neither gained williams favor nor served the design of fenwick the persons accused were too powerful to be punished besides fenwick had refused to be an evidence and had he done otherwise the proofs which he could produce were not sufficient in law his trial however was delayed by various means till the kings arrival in england his friends in the mean time removed one of the two witnesses on whose oaths the bill had been found and according to the statutes of treason a single witness was not sufficient to condemn  he is attained and executed william is said to have entertained a personal enmimity james ii      against fenwick for some expressions reflecting on his conduct when he served in the army in holland this disposition in the kings mind combined with the resentment of the accused persons contributed to punish in a very irregular manner that unfortunate man admiral russel by the express permission of william was the first who laid before the commons the information of fenwick which reflected on himself and several other persons of high rank the prisoner was brought to the bar of the house and required to confess all he knew journals nov    he declined to obey without assurances of pardon were first given upon a vote passed on his own paper a bill of attainder was introduced against fenwick journals nov    he was heard by his council but the weight o the crown and the interest of his enemies prevailed the bill passed the commons after violent debate nov        agai      and though much opposed in the upperhouse it received the sanction of the lords    against    feb         and the assent of the king on the twentyeighth of january he was beheaded on tower hill his behavior a his death was more spirited than his conduct in prison the precedent established in his case was justly deemed dangerous as nothing could be less excused than the employing of the whole force of the legislature to take away the life of a man whom the law of treason could not condemn the death of fenwick was not of such consequence to the public quie as to justify this violent exertion of the ultimate power reposed in the state ja ii        obsequiousness of parliament an uninterrupted complaisance to the crown continued throughout the session the commons provided with cheerfulness for the service of the year the made good eight hundred and forty thousand pounds which the funds for the last had fallen short feb         upon a message from the king they granted a suppl of more than five hundred thousand pounds for the support of the civil list they as the last gift of the session made provision for the payment of the deb for the transports employed in the reduction of ireland the liberality of the commons raised in some degree the resentment of the people they we openly traduced as corrupt by individuals the were frequently besieged in their houses by mob the public business being finished on the sixteen of april the king put an end to the session with  speech from the throne he thanked the common for their large supplies he informed both house that he found it necessary to go for some time abroa but that he would take care to leave the administrtion of government in the hands of persons upon whom he could depend april      sunderland in office an event which happened three days after the rising of parliament rendered remarkable the paragraph with which his majesty closed his speech to the astonishment of the nation he raised the earl of sunderland to the office of lordchamberlain in the room of the earl of dorset who had suffered himself to be bought out of his place with the public money that this lord uniformly betrayed the late king to the views of the present when prince of orange is now known and was even then suspected by the intelligent there seemed therefore to have been a degree of imprudence in the appointment though the place which he held before in williams favor entitled him to a part of the management of public affairs on the twentysecond of april the earl was sworn a privycouncillor and as such took his place

in the end of the preceding summer were improved in the winter william had named in the month of december three plenipotentiaries to negociate a treaty the french king had appointed two persons in the like capacity to be joined to calliers who had long carried on a negotiation at the hague the emperor and the court of spain threw various objections in the way but these being at length overruled by the rest of the allies a congress was agreed to be opened under the mediation of charles the eleventh king of sweden that prince dying in the mean time the office of mediator was transferred to his son the ambassadors of the belligerent powers met on the ninth of may at a house belonging to the king of england in the neighborhood of riswick a village situated between delft and the hague  the peace opposed by the emperor and spain france and the maritime powers seemed to find little difficulty in defining their respective claims england and holland had scarce any farther concern in the treaty than to settle a barrier in flanders and to procure an ample acknowledgment of williams right to the throne calliers then sole plenipotentiary for lewis the fourteenth in holland had consented as early as the tenth of february to preliminaries which declared that strasbourg should be restored to the emperor mons charleroi dinant and the whole duchy of luxembourg together with the conquests in catalonia to the spaniards the duchy of lorrain to its native prince and that the title of william should be acknowledged without any manner of difficulty restriction condition or reserve but that the claims of other princes should be left to be settled by the treaty for a general peace to be negociated under the mediation of the king of sweden the house of austria however in neither of its branches seemed willing to put an immediate end to the war though spain was destitute of troops of ships of money and of councils though the grandees at variance among themselves possessed  credit at court nor authority among the people though the monarchy tottered through all its exte sive dominions the influence of a haughty and imprious woman who hated every body and was herse detested by all swayed the timid mind of charles t second to listen to the court of vienna and to continue a war which he abhorred  the cause of their obstinacy the cause of this obstinacy on the part of the eperor leopold requires to be explained charl the second the last male of that branch of the ho of austria which had sat for near two centuries  the throne of spain was a prince weak in body  feeble in mind subject to melancholy and a slave  passion a stranger to business timid by constituti as well as through ignorance his mother who w sister to the emperor had endeavored to protract  torcys memoirs vol i   intrigues for the spanish succession a daughter of the duke of neubourg succeeded the unfortunate queen in the bed of charles the second being sister to the empress she was firmly attached to the allies and she governed spain she entered into the views of leopold for preserving the succession of the crown in his own family in exclusion of the female line her object was to induce her husband to send for her nephew the archduke to madrid to be educated as the sole heir of spain the king for some time resisted her importunities but in the year      he yielded to his own fears alarmed at the progress of the french in the heart of his kingdom he promised to invite the archduke to spain upon condition that the emperor should send twelve thousand of his troops to oppose the enemy in catalonia the slow councils of the court of vienna obstructed this design till mutual advances toward a peace were made by france and the maritime powers the emperor therefore endeavored when too late to protract the war as favorable to his own views on the spanish succession torcys memoirs vol i   operations in flanders and catalonia while the emperor and his influence by means of the queen over the councils of spain obstructed the treaty with new demands lewis the fourteenth declared his resolution to adhere to the articles of the preliminaries his ministers signified in form that the treaties of westphalia and nimeguen must be the basis of the future peace that it remained with the allies to agree to terms or to prosecute the war this declaration at the congress was strengthened by operations in the field the marshall de catinat invested and took aesh william was either indifferent as to the fate of the place or unprepared to raise the siege he joined the army in person on the twentyfourth of may the mareschals de villeroi and boufflers were posted too advantageously to be attacked he however disappointed the designs of the french upon brussels and the fortress of trois trous but the chief efforts of lewis were made on the side of spain to extricate by disasters the timid mind of charles the second from the intrigues of the emperor the duke de vendome laid siege to barcelona by land the count destrees blocked up the place by sea the count de velasco dividing the force with which he proposed to raise the siege was surprised in both his camps and put to flight the city capitulated on the last day of july and that conquest determined the emperor and spain to listen to the proposals of a general peace hist de fran tom iii hist despange tom ii   crown of poland offered to james the success of the arms of france was balanced by the defeat of her negociations in poland the death of king john sobieski on the eighth of june in the preceding year had opened a scene of intrigue for the crown of that kingdom the predilection of the queen for her younger son alexander in opposition to james the elder divided the friends of the la king and ruined the influence of his family many of the poles had turned their eyes to another quarter the abbe de polignac ambassador of france in poland wrote to his master that thoughts were entertained of the late king of england in the new election for filling the throne and that he had been already named by some of the diets lewis was eager to seize an opportunity of ridding himself with honor of a prince whose pretensions he could no longer support he sent de pomponne to st germains the friends of james were sanguine for the project but he rejected it himself he told de pomponne that he would ever retain a grateful remembrance of his friends in poland that however he would not accept of the crown had it actually been offered much less would he endeavor to obtain by solicitation any throne that was not his due that his acceptance of any other scepter would amount to an abdication indeed of that which he deemed his right that therefore he was resolved to remain in his present forlorn condition possessing less hopes than ever of being restored than to do the least act to prejudice his family james ii        conferred on the elector of saxony the selfdenial of james induced lewis to turn his eyes to the prince of conti as a fit candidate for the polish throne the character of that prince and above all the bribes and promises distributed by the abbe de polignac seemed to have conciliated the suffrages of the whole nation but in the midst of these flattering hopes a new and powerful candidate appeared the elector of saxony supporting himself with an armed force advanced to the frontiers of the kingdom and demanded the crown he had removed all objections to his religion by previously abjuring the lutheran says he added the force of bribery to less powerful claims on the night before the election a very large sum was distributed in the camp to fortify his party but the majority still adhered to the french the prince of conti was declared duly lected by the primate on the other hand the bishop of cujavia also nominated frederick augustus elector of saxony king of poland and great duke of lithuania the result of the whole was that the elector promoted his own interest to such advantage that the prince of conti on his arrival in the road of dantzic on the fifteenth of september found that he came too late to support his pretensions to the crown james ii        the maritime powers and france resolve on a peace though the success of the elector of saxony in poland flattered the pride of the emperor it contributed little to his designs of obstructing the negociations at riswick the maritime powers were now absolutely under the direction of the king of england who had all along been the life and soul of the confederacy and he had scarce any thing except her acknowledgement of his own right to the throne to settle with france lewis the fourteenth had long determined to prefer the benefits of a necessary peace to his engagements to the late king that unfortunate prince had laid aside all expectations from the aid of france ever since his disappointment in the projected invasion of the preceding year he flattered himself in his lost condition with other hopes he was assured from england that william was in a declining state of health that he was dropsical in his habit of body and that his dissolution seemed t advance with hasty strides james had formed a new scheme upon the event of his nephews death h resolved to return to england though three men should not follow him and to throw himself on the goo nature of the english nation ibid  it could not enter into his mind he said that the people of england would treat him with indignities and he knew that the majority were determined to preserve all the just prerogatives of the crown ibid   secret views of the late king the hopes derived by james from the death  william were dashed from a quarter where  check to his views was then feared the princess  denmark had for six years maintained a fair correpondence with her father full of assurances of du and expressions of repentance the bad health of the king had awakened her ambition with the prospect of the crown she wrote to her father upon this subject she desired to know his pleasure whether he would permit her to ascend the throne according to the act of settlement should the prince of orange so she called king william happen to die she accompanied this request with expressions of duty and a seeming readiness to make restitution when opportunity should serve she insinuated that should he refuse to accede to this expedient considering the present disposition of the kingdom he would remove himself further from the hopes of of recovering his throne the scepter she said would fall into worse hands out of which it would not be so easily recovered the reasoning of the princess was too refined for the temper of her father he told his friends that though he could suffer injustice he could never be persuaded to give it countenance he knew he said that of all restitutions none is harder to make than that of a crown he however excused himself to his daughter and his declared adherence to the resolution of placing himself in the hands of his former subjects put an end to the proposal james ii        he is alarmed at the congress the late king was no stranger to the endeavors of france to put an end to the war but he could never believe ibid  he said that lewis would wholly neglect his interest in the terms of the peace in the course of the preceding campaign he was for the first time alarmed he pressed in person the french king on the subject his adherents argued the matter with the ministry in vain ibid  in the preceding december he sent an agent to the court of vienna the emperor was deaf to his entreaties ibid  he disregarded at once his misfortunes and his claims upon himself as a catholic prince on the score of religion notwithstanding this repulse from leopold he rested some faint hopes on the generosity of lewis the fourteenth but when the two french plenipotentiaries de harlay and de creci departed from paris in march to join callieres at delft he gave all his hopes away james ii       the event however may serve to show that lewis deserved to be more trusted and that he yielded to necessity only when he seemed to the world to neglect the interest of the abdicated king  william hastens the peace though the views of the emperor were disappointed by the apparent resolution of the maritime powers to restore the public tranquillity his ministers at the congress discovered no inclination to bring the conferences to a speedy issue it was reserved for william who had been the soul of the war to conclude with a decisive stroke the peace the two armies after the surrender of aeth lay opposed to one another in the neighborhood of brussels the allies under the king were encamped at cockleberg the mareschals de villeroi de catinat and de boufflers commanded the french army at pepinge the earl of portland on the part of the king of england and de boufflers in the name of lewis met between the armies and held a conference in the open field on the tenth of july they met again on the fifteenth and twentieth of the same month in the same manner but on the twentysixth of july and the second of august they retired to a house in the suburbs of hall and reduced to writing the terms to which they had agreed in the field depot des affairs etrangeres a versailles   agrees that the prince of wales should succeed him in the throne the world have hitherto been no less ignorant of the object of these interviews than europe was then astonished at such an uncommon mode of negotiation as william trusted not his three plenipotentiaries at the hague with his agreement with france mankind justly concluded that a secret of the last importance had been for some time depending between the two kings time has at length unraveled the mystery lewis unwilling to desert james proposed that the prince of wales should succeed to the crown of england after the death of william the king with little hesitation agreed to this request he even solemnly engaged to procure the repeal of the act of settlement and to declare by another the prince of wales his successor in the throne james ii       this great preliminary being settled other matters of less importance followed of course the fifty thousand pounds a year settled as a jointure upon king jamess queen was agreed to be paid though the money was afterward retained upon various pretenses on the third of august the king left the army and retired to dieren he sent from thence the earl of portland to acquaint the ministers assembled at the congress that he had settled his own affairs and those of his kingdoms with france and that he earnestly pressed the allies and particularly the emperor to hasten the conclusion of the great work of peace  reflections on that transaction those who ascribe all the actions of william to public spirit will find some difficulty in reconciling this transaction to their elevated opinion of his character in one concession to france he yielded all his professions to england and by an act of indiscretion or through indifference deserted the principles to which he owed the throne the deliverance of the nation was not however the sole object of this prince like other men he was subject to human passions and like them when he could gratify himself he served the world various motives seem to have concurred to induce him to adopt a measure unaccountable on other grounds the projected peace was to secure the crown in his possession for his life he had no children and but few relations and those he never loved the successors provided by the act of settlement he either despised or abhorred and he seems hitherto not to have extended his views beyond the limits of that act though james had displeased the nation he had not injured william the son had offended neither he might excite compassion but he could be no object of aversion the supposed spuriousness of his birth had been only held forth to amuse the vulgar and even these would be convinced by the public acknowledgment intended to be made by the very person whose interest was most concerned in the support of that idle tale  the proposal rejected by james but the same imprudence which lost to the late king the crown excluded for ever his posterity from the throne he told his most christian majesty who had made the first overture to him on this important subject that though he could suffer with patience the usurpation of his nephew upon his right he would never permit his own son to be guilty of the same injustice james ii       he urged that should the son reign in his fathers lifetime that circumstance would amount to a formal renunciation that the prince of wales by succeeding to the prince of orange would yield his sole right which was that of his father and being obliged to the people for his elevation the hands which had raised him might at any time justly pull him down from his throne that should he himself be capable of consenting to such a disgraceful proposal in favor of his son he might be justly reproached with departing from his avowed principles and with ruining monarchy by rendering elective an hereditary crown besides that though he should consent to sacrifice all that he reckoned dear to a mortal enemy the prince of orange could only promise a thing which he was not perhaps able to perform that the same parliament that had conferred the royal authority on himself had settled the reversion of the crown on the princess of denmark and that therefore by reversing the act of settlement he disjointed the whole chain which bound the people to his government but that should even the prince of orange induce the parliament of england to repeal the act of settlement it would be always upon condition of having the prince of wales placed in their hands without their being able to give any security either for his person or his conscience memorial to the pope      memorial to the elector palatine ms   france more peremptory in her demands the last consideration was not perhaps the least motive of this deluded prince for rejecting the only certain prospect that had ever offered itself for restoring his family to the throne the french king perceiving his obstinacy urged not further a point of which james himself could be the only judge the latter endeavored in the mean time to stop the progress of a treaty with vain protests and with unavailing memorials and remonstrances to the confederate princes the demand of france for the eventual succession of the prince of wales being removed the reestablishment of peace between lewis and william became absolutely certain the first therefore became more peremptory in his negociations with the empire and spain as the allies were already apparently disunited he ordered his ministers at the congress to deliver in the project of a general peace upon the footing of the preliminaries july  0  the project was accompanied with a declaration limiting the time of its being accepted to the last day in august the house of austria were as dilatory in their motions toward a peace as they had been slow in prosecuting the war they paid no regard to the limitations offered by france though they were in no condition for maintaining themselves singly against her power spain had added to her misfortunes at home a distaster of an alarming king abroad a french squadron under de pontis had with the assistance of the buccaniers taken carthagena in america plundered the place of an immense treasure and having escaped the utmost efforts and vigilance of the english sleet arrived safely at breast on the nineteenth of august  treaty signed sept  0 this fresh misfortune succeeding the capture of barcelona hastened greatly the conclusion of the treaty on the part of spain the emperor however continued obstinate and he was deserted by the rest of the allies william having settled his own concerns with france had left the army on the third of august and retired to dieren he dispatched from thence the earl of portland to the hague he ordered him to acquaint the congress that he had adjusted matters in such a manner with lewis the fourteenth that no delay in the general peace should arise from his concerns that therefore he earnestly pressed the allies and particularly the emperor to contribute all that lay in their power toward concluding so great a work this declaration of the king was regarded as a command the plenipotentiaries of the states signed the treaty on the ninth of september about midnight their example was taken in an hour after by the ambassador of spain and he was followed by the plenipotentiaries of england the treaties of munster and nimeguen served as a basis for that with holland the places taken in catalonia the duchy of luxembourg the county of chinei charleroi mons aeth courtrai and all places united to france by the chambers of metz and brisac were restored to spain the king of england agreed to pay fifty thousand pounds a year by way of jointure to king jamess queen and lewis the fourteenth engaged not to disturb william in the possession of his kingdoms vid treaty   peace between france and the emperor oct  0 room was left for the emperor to accede to the treaty and an immediate armistice was procured france having disunited the allies entertained no doubt of forcing the emperor and empire into a peace leopold having complained of being a second time deserted by the dutch in a pacification with france thought proper at length to comply on the twentieth of october his ambassador signed also the treaty of riswick the terms were regulated by those of westphalia and nimeguen fribourg brisga and philipsbourg were restored to the emperor the duchies of lorrain and bar were on conditions rendered back to his nephew the duke of lorrain hist dallemagne tom vii  and thus a general tranquillity though not destined to last long was reestablished in the north and west o europe objections have been made to the conduc of the king of england in signing a separate peace against both the letter and spirit of the grand alliance but the distresses which would have been brought upon the kingdom through the continuance of a war that ceased with regard to england to have any object and the impotent obstinacy of the court of vienna sufficiently justifies william in forcing in a manner the emperor to the acceptance of reasonable terms  the bloods battle of zenta the emperor had scarce agreed to the treaty of riswick when he received intelligence of the total defeat of the turks at zenta sept     a small village on the western bank of theysse in the kingdom of hungary the famous prince eugene of savoy had succeeded the elector of saxony in the command of the army and to his spirit and conduct was owing the complete victory which the imperialists had obtained the slaughter ratehr than the fight lasted from ten in the morning till late at night the two preceding ages though remarkable for battles had not produced so bloody a combat the ottomans broken by the enemy in front were at the same time attacked in the rear in less than an hour resistance was over on the side of the turks but the rest of the day was spent in butchery and blood all endeavored to gain the bridge but it was rendered impassible by the heaps of slain to avoid the fury of the sword thousands threw themselves into the river and were drowned thirty thousand were said to lie dead on the field before coming of night saved a few fugitives from death the camp of the enemy the magnificent pavillion of the sultan himself the stores the provisions the ammunition all the cannon and baggage fell into the hands of the prince eugene the grand vizier was killed the seal of the empire taken the aga of the janissaries and twentyseven bashaws were found among the slain never was victory more complete but the advanced season and the want of resources in the court of vienna prevented it from having any immediate or striking consequences hist dallemague   king returns to england nov on the thirteenth of november the king embarked for england under the convoy of a fquadron of men of war and on the fourteenth he arrived at margate he entered london on the sixteenth amid the acclamations of the populace intemperance and rio were mixed with solemn thanksgivings and as every individual had suffered by the waste of the war the whole nation seemed sincerely to rejoice at the return of peace the parliament had been summoned by the lords of the regency to meet on business on the twentythird of november but that assembly wa further prorogued to the third of december an object of the utmost consequence and in the state o the times of the greatest difficulty had been communicated by the king to the ministry before his return to england he wished to retain a great part of the standing army in pay after the reestablishment o peace his servants felt the pulse of the nation by publications on that subject but instead of persuading the people into the views of the crown they alarmed their fears the resentment of mankind in general was added to their astonishment they saw with a degree of indignation that those who had mos violently opposed a standing force in former times were the chief supporters of that unpopular measure in the present reign  a session of parliament the session at length was opened on the third o december with a speech from the throne the kin informed his parliament that the war into which h had entered by the advice of his people was now terminated in its object an honorable peace tha however he was sorry his subjects could not find a first that relief from the reestablishment of the public tranquillity which either he could have wished  they have expected the funds intended for the preceding year he told them had failed there wa a debt on account of the fleet and on the part of the army the revenues of the crown he said we anticipated for the public use he himself was wholy destitute of means to support the civil list he to them that he trusted their providing for him durin his life in a manner suitable to his honor and the dignity of government he informed them that t increase of the navy since his accession to the crown had proportionably augmented its charge that the interest and reputation of england rendered necessary a great force at sea the circumstances of affairs abroad he said were such that he assured them england could not be safe without a land force he expressed his hopes that they would not give an opportunity to the enemies of the nation to effect under the notion of a peace what they could not accomplish by a war he therefore desired the commons to consider the matter in such a manner as to provide the necessary supplies journals nov     views of parties this speech was construed by the different parties in parliament as they themselves were variously inclined the disaffected deeming it haughty and even insolent in its whole strain some wished to ease the subject by reducing to a low degree the peaceestablishment some who loved their country were afraid of a standing army the adherents of james were resolved to distress william on popular grounds the few who harbored in secret republican opinions opposed from principle a measure calculated to place an uncontrollable power in the hands of the king the different views of all the parties centered in one point they were supported by the people in their opposition to the crown the nation was exhausted with late taxes they were alarmed at the continunce of present burdens and terrified at future imosts the kingdom had derived no advantage from he peace except the prospect of ease from the disontinuance of the war and the people disappointd in their reasonable hopes became discontented olent and clamorous a more steady but a no ss determined conduct was observed by the commons hey addressed the king on his speech in terms full  respect but with great reserve nov    they assured  majesty that as the house had effectually enabled  to carry on the war they were ready to assist and port him in the time of peace on the seventh of december the address was read and ordered to be presented by the whole house journals dec     the army ordered to be disbanded the first resolutions of the commons bore the appearance of moderation though they promised not implicit compliance on a division of the house the friends of the court carried a vote of supply dec    having inquired into the deficiencies of the aids of the preceding year they resolved that a sum not exceeding six hundred thousand pounds to be raised on the credit of the exchequer should be transferred to the supplies of the next session of parliament on the tenth of december they received the kings answer to their address though he perceived the design of the commons he receded not from his own purpose he told them as they assisted him beyond expression in the war he had no doubt of an equal zeal in the house to maintain the peace dec  0  this answer signifying plainly the kings wishes to retain a considerable standing force in his pay hastened the discussion of that important point in a committee of the whole house it was resolved without a division the next day dec     that all the landforces raised since the twentyninth of september    0 should be paid and disbanded  arguments for the question the courtparty urged various arguments for carrying a point in which the king had signified himself to be much concerned they urged that as france had not yet disbanded any of her troops it would be dangerous as well as absurd to trust to the faith of a treaty for the safety of the nation they affirmed that to trust the navy with the protection of the kingdom was to leave the fate of its independence  fortune they averred from the example of the late revolution that a wind might arise which could carry an enemy out of their ports and at the sa time confine the ships of england to their own habours they freely owned that some dangers mig arise to the liberties of the people from a standi army but they denied it to be true that pub freedom was always ruined by armies they produced venice and the states of the united provinces as examples of this position and they endeavored to prove that the liberties of france fell through the dark policy of lewis the eleventh and not by the means of a military force they attempted to raise the fears of the people by explaining the facility with which the late king might return they represented the disaffection of a part of the nation as too strong to be suppressed without the terrors of a standing army they concluded with observing that as the power of the purse was in the hands of the nation the crown might without danger be trusted with any degree of the power of the sword  general arguments on the other side it was urged with vehemence that an island like britain had little to fear from an enemy whose naval force was inferior to its own they affirmed that the fitting out of a fleet was a work of time that the preparations of the kingdom might in a great measure keep pace with those of the invaders that the confederates would either call the attention of france to another quarter or she might be opposed with effect on the coast of england by troops called from scotland and ireland they affirmed that no wind could arise more favorable to the french in quitting their principal ports than to the english in sailing from their own besides that merely for the bare possibility of such a circumstance no prince could be supposed to hazard a vast expense upon one improbable contingency that the examples of venice holland and france were inapplicable to the present argument that the two republics kept their standing forces only in their conquered countries that though lewis the eleventh invaded the liberties of his subjects without public violence a standing army was soon found necessary to support the usurpations of the crown on the natural rights of the people they urged with great force of argument that a militia was the most natural and least dangerous protectors of the kingdom as the gentry freeholders and traders of england were more concerned in the freedom and safety of their country than soldiers whose only motive to action was pay  particular reasons against it they descended from general to particular arguments they averred that the most likely way to restore the late king was to support a standing force to defeat his designs to prove this position they affirmed that the affection of the people was the only rock on which the throne of the prince could remain firm that when it leans on a standing force it depends on the unsteady humors of the soldiery revolution and change they showed from the examples of former ages had proceeded oftener from the caprice of an army than from the violence and inconstancy of the multitude they alleged that the fate of the kingdom would depend on the political principles or the avarice of the chief officers that one might be swayed by an affection for the late king another gained with french money they descended to all the inconveniences arising from standing armies they mentioned quarrels assassinations robberies the dishonouring of women the insolence to men their injustice to mankind in general the license derived from the pride of their station their contempt for laws by which they ceased to be confined they however concluded that it was by no means their design to ruin by the peace those who had deserved so well of the nation by their courage fidelity and conduct in the war that their arguments were directed against the thing itself and not against particular men and that therefore the officers ought to receive from the parliament a recompense for the loss of their commissions journals   the opposing members prevail the adherents of the crown propagated rumors of danger without doors to strengthen their arguments within they affirmed that the french ambassador was stopped that the king of spain was dead that europe was ready to plunge again into a war they endeavored to gain the interested with promises to impress the minds of the feeble with fears but these artifices produced no effect on the country party some of the latter in the course of their arguments upbraided the king himself with a breach of faith to the nation they observed that in his declaration when prince of orange he promised upon the settlement of the nation to send back all his foreign forces but that instead of adhering to his solemn engagements he still retained a great number of aliens about his person that of his countrymen the dutch he had a troop of horse of two hundred and twenty men and one regiment of bodyguards of the same nation consisting of four battalions amounting to more than two thousand six hundred soldiers that he had also in the same capacity one regiment of scots consisting of one thousand six hundred men and that of french refugees who depended on himself alone he had two regiments of dragoons and three of foot falling in all little short of five thousand men the disaffected exaggerated greatly the dangers to be apprehended from these troops they compared them to the pretorian bands who executed the tyrannical decrees of the worst emperors of rome and even to the turkish janissaries who by being cut off in their infancy from all connexions with the rest of mankind know no umpire but the sword and own no ties but an absolute submission to the will of the reigning prince trenchards remarks   the king disgusted the warmth expressed in these debates excited disgust on both sides the king was highly displeased with the conduct of the commons a majority of the commons were almost dissatisfied with the choice they had made of a king william was at no pains to conceal his sentiments he complained that by reducting his army the commons had rendered him contemptible in the eyes of europe that he was doubtful whether he could support either his government at home or any of his alliances abroad in his present despicable state that had he foreseen such returns for his services he would never have meddled with english affairs and that he was weary of governing a nation who through their jealousy of the crown exposed their sovereign to contempt and themselves to danger burnet vol ii  but when the king vented his resentment in complaints his chief adviser the earl of sunderland yielded to his own fears he had supported with all his eloquence the arguments for a standing army he was deemed the author of the measure he found that the whigs and the tories were alike his enemies that the first hated him for his measures in the reign of james that the latter abhorred him for his treachery to that prince he therefore resolved to prevent the falling of the storm by resigning the office of lordchamberlain dec     and retiring into the country the anxiety of william to keep sunderland near his person burnet vol iii  was construed by his enemies into a kind of criminal gratitude for that lords betraying the councils of his predecessor  the large provision for the civil list the resolution for reducing the army to seven thousand men being carried the commons brought a bill dec    into their house for regulating the militia and for rendering them serviceable to the nation they voted the next day dec     that ten thousand men were necessary for a summer and winter guard at sea they resolved that a sum not exceeding seven hundred thousand pounds should be granted to his majesty for the support of the civil list dec  0  they at the same time passed a bill against corresponding with the late king and his adherents they agreed to an act for continuing the imprisonment of several persons accused of being privy to the late conspiracy against the life of the king they voted three hundred and fifty thousand pounds for maintaining guards and garrisons for the year school jan    school  they granted a supply not exceeding two millions seven hundred thousand pounds to answer and cancel all exchequer bills to reconcile the army to the projected reduction they ordered a gratuity to the common soldiers and halfpay to such officers as were naturalborn subjects of england till they should be provided for in some other manner jan     they provided for jan     they resolved to pay the sums due for subsidies to the allies feb  0  they considered the state of the national debts and voted that all arrears should be gradually paid  obtained by an artifice of the king the king is said to have owed the large sum for the support of the civil list more to his own management than to the generosity of the commons the leading members had designed to give only six hundred thousand pounds for that purpose but william told the adherents of the princess of denmark that he intended to form a household for her son the duke of gloucester and that the establishment would require fifty thousand pounds duchess of marlborough burnet  he insinuated at the same time to such members as still retained some regard for the late king that he had promised to pay to the exiled queen her jointure amounting to fifty thousand pounds in consequence of an agreement with france at the treaty of riswick this precaution facilitated the grant of an addition of one hundred thousand pounds a year to the civil list he however found means to retain in his own hands the money destined for the queen the earl of portland being sent ambassador to paris in the beginning of the year insisted that in the conferences between himself and the marshall de boufflers the latter had promised secretly that king james should be removed from st germains he averred that this removal was the condition of the payment of the jointure boufflers denied the fact but lewis the fourteenth was not in a disposition to argue the matter with william james ii       the king observed the same strain of economy with regard to the duke of gloucester an establishment for that prince was not made for some time after the provision for the civil list was granted and when his household was at length formed fifteen thousand pounds a year were only given duchess of marlborough   an inquiry into grants and fraudulent indorsements of exchequer bills an attempt made jan    by the opposition in the house of commons to apply a part of the forfeited estates to the use of the public was disappointed by the art of the court party the latter insisted on beginning with the grants of the two preceding reigns the persons affacted by the amendment opposed the motion they joined their influence with those who had received grants from the reigning prince petitions were presented on every side difficulties were raised and the whole matter was dropped as the interests of all parties were concerned in defeating the measure during this attempt toward a kind of resumption of grants another enquiry of some importance employed a part of the attention of the commons the exchequer bills upon their being first issued bore no interest but on their being paid in upon any of the taxes and issued a second time they were entitled to seven and a half per cent interest this circumstance induced some of the kings officers in the exchequer customs and excise to place false endorsements on the bills before they had been circulated at all one duncomb who was receivergeneral of the excise had amassed a fortune by this fraudulent practice sufficient to protect himself and the partners of his guilt from justice he was expelled the house journals  a bill fining him in half his estate valued at the enormous sum of four hundred thousand pounds passed the commons the lords were equally divided but the duke of leeds being in the chair of the committee rejected the bill by his casting voice the wealth of duncomb and the character of leeds gave rise to reflections less improbable than difficult to be ascertained  a new east india company established debates on the expediency of enlarging the stoc of the east india company employed the latter part of this long session of parliament the company by bribing the king and corrupting his servants had obtained in september      a new charter exclusiv of the interlopers on their trade these interlopers consisting of some capital merchants had been  several sessions supported in their pretensions b various votes of the commons the old company by the suggestion of some persons in power offere seven hundred thousand pounds at four per cent  the service of government upon condition of having their own exclusive charter confirmed by an act of parliament the other merchants protected by mountague chancellor of the exchequer proposed to the house of commons to advance two millions at eight per cent in consideration of an exclusive trade to be vested in the subscribers a bill was ordered to be brought in upon this offer for settling the commerce to the east indies the old company petitioned in vain against the bill in the lower house journals  they followed it to no purpose to the lords the royal assent was given on the fifth of july and such was the eagerness of the nation to employ their money in the stock of the new company that the subscription of two millions was filled in the space of three days  parliament dissolved the two houses having finished the public business were prorogued on the fifth of july two days after a proclamation was issued for disolving the parliament in terms of the triennial act the kings speech was less suitable to his temper than to sound policy he congratulated his parliament on the association on their remedying the corruption of the coin on their restoring public credit he thanked them for their supplies for the war their provision for maintaining the peace and satisfying with the the least burden possible to his people the debt of the nation he told the commons that he deemed himself personally obliged to their house for their regard to his honor in establishing a permanent revenue for the civil list he assured both houses that he valued nothing so much as the esteem and love of his people and that as for their sake he had avoided no hazard in war he should make it his whole study and care to improve and continue the advantages and blessings of peace ibid july     embassy of portland to france though william pretended to part on the best terms with his parliament the rigid behavior of the commons with regard to the army made a lasting impression on his mind and even affected his conduct deeming himself left at the mercy of his enemies by the reduction of his forces he endeavored to secure himself against france by gaining her confidence and flattering her favorite views the earl of portland who had declined in favor though he still retained the esteem of the king was sent with a splendid equipage in the character of ambassador extraordinary to the court of versailles he made his public entry into paris on the twentyseventh of february with a pomp more suitable to the vanity of lewis than the gravity of his own master the court of france answered the advances made by the king of england with equal ardour from views of their own the pretensions of the house of bourbon on the succession of the spanish monarchy had employed the mind of the french king ever since the signing of the treaty of riswick the distresses brought upon his kingdom by his exertions in the war joined to a decline in his own ambition rendered him extremely anxious for the continuance of the peace and he was willing to relinquish in a great measure the claims of his family to obtain that desirable end  intrigues for the spanish succession march the relapse of charles the second into one of those fits of illness which were so common to his feeble constitution gave fresh spirit to the intrigues of the competitors for his crown the only pretenders to the succession prior to the treaty of riswick were the emperor and the elector of bavaria the first as the male representative of the family of austria the latter as the husband of an archduchess the only surviving child of the emperor by the second daughter of philip the fourth of spain the powers of europe from a jealousy and fear of the house of bourbon had contested the right of the dauphin of france though the son of the eldest daughter maria theresa philip himself to her exclusion had declared the descendants of her younger sister margaret born of a second bed the heirs of his crown the son of the elector of bavaria in default of male issue by charles the second would therefore have possessed the whole succession i either the testament of philip the fourth or the renunciation of his eldest daughter at her marriage with the french king had been deemed valid and decisive de torcy vol i   negociations of france in spain the elector of bavaria either diffident of his right or of his own power to support his claims had applied for the protection of lewis the fourteenth and had desired to know from that prince what part of the spanish dominions he would choose to reserve for himself lewis returned an evasive answer and in december      sent the marquis dharcourt in the character of ambassador to learn the state of parties in spain to enquire into the views of the court the disposition of the grandees and above all to discover and traverse the secret measures of the imperial ministers though he found that the party which favored the lineal succession in the family of bourbon were the most numerous they had the least credit the queen and her creatures favored the emperor and held the reins of government when they despaired of the life of the king they injured with their eagerness the cause which they wished to promote the prince of hesse darmstadt who governed in catalonia supplanted the spanish officers with germans and took every measure that seemed calculated to secure that province for the house of austria while he ultimately disobliged the spaniards without accomplishing his own views ibid   a treaty of partition proposed to william such was the situation of affairs soon after the arrival of the earl of portland at the court of france lewis the fourteenth wishing to preserve the peace was still inclined to a partition of the dominions of spain finding it needless to treat with the emperor he discovered an inclination to enter into treaty with the king of england but the unexpected demands of portland obstructed for some time the designs of lewis the earl plainly told that prince that he did not expect to find king james at st germains he complained of that circumstance as a breach of a promise made by the marshall de boufflers in their conserences in flanders the marshall denied the whole affair portland continued obstinate but when william disapproved of his conduct he changed his tone he protested that agreeable to the intentions of his master he would be glad to establish a good understanding and even a perfect harmony between that prince and the french king the latter was encouraged upon these assurances to propose to william a partition of the spanish monarchy nearly on the same plan as that concluded with the emperor leopold about thirty years before de torcy vol i  portland sent a courier to england with the proposals of the court of france william was guarded and undecisive in his answer but his language discovered that he was far from being averse from the measure ibid   negotiations for that purpose in england lewis perceiving that portland was not sufficiently instructed to conclude the treaty on which he had fixed his mind sent the comte de tallard with full powers to england that minister arrived in london on the nineteenth of march william disapproved of the mode of partition proposed by france but the defenseless state in which he had been lest by his parliament induced him to listen to any terms calculated to continue the repose of europe besides his health was declining and a feeble constitution had subjected him to a premature old age his answer to the french ambassador  he was become inactive in his person and his ambition and love of glory had declined in proportion as his unfitness for the field arose the negotiation begun in france between lewis and the earl of portland was continued in england between william and tallard portland in the mean time was recalled and succeeded in his embassy by his brotherinlaw the earl of jersey a friendly correspondence subsisted between the two courts during the summer but though the negotiation advanced it was not destined to be concluded till william by the dissolution of his parliament found leisure to repair to holland de torcy vol i   earl of marlborough restored to office at the settlement of the revenue for the civil list the king had engaged to the adherents of the princess of denmark to form an establishment for her son the duke of gloucester who was now arrived at an age to be placed in the hands of men the earl of marlborough had retained his influence with the princess during his disgrace with the king and william who respected his parts though he disliked his principles made use of the present occasion to recall him to his presence the earl had lessened his professions to the late king in proportion as the views of restoration entertained by that unfortunate prince declined he therefore was under no difficulty in accepting williams returning favor he was appointed governor of the duke of gloucester on the nineteenth of june and on the sixteenth of july he was declared one of the lordsjustices for the administration of government during his majestys intended absence abroad gazette  the first officers of state were named in the commission but the chief management of affairs rested in the hands of the lord summers then chancellor admiral russel who had been created earl of orford and mountague a man of vivacity and scheming abilities who had for some time served with reputation as chancellor of the exchequer  the king goes abroad william sailed from margate on the twentieth of july and on the twentysecond he arrived at the hague his leaving the kingdom was construed by his enemies into an unjust preference given to holland over a country which had raised him to a throne the nation was uneasy under an unusual burden of public debt and malcontents and designing men inflamed the passions of the people to forward their own views the press teemed with bold publications complaints were mixed with the conversations of the idle the discontented and the speculative the tumult and noise of a general election furnished an ample field for declaimers of every kind the corruptions which had crept into parliaments were a great topic of disquisition complaints were made that one hundred and sixteen members of the lower house were in office that many more were devoted to the crown by means of secret pensions or expectations of reward to this circumstance the generality of mankind ascribed their misfortunes and they laid to the charge of the king an evil which sprung from the weight thrown by the increase of the public revenue in the scale of the crown state tracts   proceedings of on the day of the kings departure from london the parliament of scotland met at edinburgh the earl of marchmont then lord chancellor of that kingdom was nominated commissioner and the session was opened with reading the kings letter in the usual form his majesty thanked them for their cheerful and in the war he congratulated them upon the blessings to be expected from an honorable peace he laid on the urgency of his present affairs the blame of his not appearing in his kingdom of scotland in person an excuse uniformly made every session since he came to the throne he informed them that he judged it necessary for their preservation that the forces upon their present establishment should be continued he recommended the raising supplies for making good the deficiencies in former grants for paying the arrears of the army and for repairing the forts he concluded with assuring them of his care to maintain their laws religion and liberties and of his royal favor and firm protection in all their concerns letter to the scot parl   the parliament of scotland upon the report of the committee for the security of the kingdom the parliament voted that there was a necessity for continuing the present standing force notwithstanding this complaisance to the views of the king the scottish nation in general entertained a wellfounded resentment against the crown their commercial company was not only discouraged by the ministry but even injuriously treated by william himself he had made his court to the parliament of england by disavowing in some measure the acts of the parliament in scotland he had even carried his opposition to the new commercial company established by the scots beyond the limits of his own dominions in england the two houses of parliament had terrified the merchants from subscribing to the funds formed by the scottish company the jealousy of the dutch prevented money from being found in their country the kings resident at hamburgh terrified with menaces the merchants of that city from performing their contract for furnishing the deputies of the company with at least two hundred thousand pounds sterling their remonstrances to the king though favorably answered produced no beneficial effect his residents abroad were not hindered from obstructing the subscriptions solicited by the company they even disowned the authority of the acts of parliament and the letters patent upon which the scottish company was founded petition of the genesis council to parl school   on the affair of darien these disappointments arising from acts which were deemed unjust roused the resentment of the nation to an uncommon degree but the majority of their representatives were gained to the interest of the king either by the possession or expectation of the wretched pittance of offices in the gift of the crown the parliament it is true addressed the king upon the subject but in terms that by softening the complaint seemed little calculated either to command or expect redress the company were also induced by the ministry to transmit a soothing petition of their own to william in opposition to the public memorials presented against their deputies in hamburgh they requested an intimation to be made to the senate of that city that they might enter into commerce with the scottish company instead of demanding that assistance from government which had been solemnly promised by the king they desired only as a mark of the royal favor the use of two of the smallest frigates that lay useless in the harbor of burntisland these unmanly representations scarce deserved any return and they received none that was favorable the parliament was in the mean time adjourned sept school  they seemed only to have raised the present expectations of their constituents to aggravate their future disappointments  affairs of ireland sir charles porter lord chancellor of ireland dying at dublin of an apoplexy on the eighth of december      left the kingdom in a state of tranquillity under his two colleagues in the government the earls of montrath and drogheda irish affairs exhibited nothing remarkable in      nor in the succeeding year till the parliament met in the end of september the lordsjustices in their speech to that assembly recommended to their care the settlement of the linen manufacture as more advantageous than the woollen the latter being the stapletrade of england they told them that the king since the peace had sent into that kingdom a part of the forces who had served abroad during all the war that he had disbanded the greatest part of the forces who had served in ireland with a resolution however to continue their subsistence to the officers they concluded with informing them that the king expected to be enabled to support the present establishment and that for that purpose an account of what the revenue produced for one year from midsummer      should be laid before the house of commons journals sept    school   proceedings of parliament illhumours which seemed to lurk in the lower house were suppressed by a considerable majority in favor of the crown a supply was granted for the support of the establishment oct     an attempt to address the king to disband the five regiments of french protestants then in ireland was overruled a tax was voted on old and new drapery that should be exported an impost of thirty thousand pounds was laid upon lands in addition to ninety thousand already imposed notwithstanding this liberality to the crown the lordsjustices adjourned the two houses without the usual ceremony of a speech of thanks an act was passed in this session for confirming the estates and possessions held and enjoyed under the acts of settlement and explanation a bill for the better security of his majestys person and government was introduced and after a debate rejected and though the crown had warmly recommended to the parliament to encourage the linen in preference to the woollen manufacture as interfering with england the commons annexed to their vote of supply a resolution to regulate the woollen trade of ireland oct  0   william in holland during these transactions in scotland and ireland the king was employed in holland in conferences with the comte de tallard on the subject of the partition treaty proposed by the french king william having in some measure resolved before his departure from england to accede to the overtures made by france communicated in part his design to the lord summers the great seal of england being necessary to render valid the treaty which he proposed to conclude no other person born in england seems to have been trusted with a transaction whose efficacy depended upon its being kept a profound secret on the sixth of august the king arrived at loo he was followed to that place by tallard and on the fifteenth of the month the king wrote to the lord chancellor for full powers under the great seal with blanks for names to treat with the french ambassador the desire expressed by the king when he wrote to summers to receive his advice on the subject of the negotiation seems to have been an unmeaning compliment as the treaty itself was concluded august    four days after the letter was sent from loo to press the necessity of the treaty and to urge the chancellor to hasten the seal the king assured him that according to all intelligence the king of spain could ot outlive the month of october william to  august    school   first partition treaty signed though the articles were settled on the nineteenth f august the treaty itself was not concluded in form  the first of october it was signed by the comte e tallard as ambassador of france to the king of england by de briord as in the same capacity t the republic of holland and by the ministers o william and those of the states upon the eventua demise of the king of spain his dominions were to b partitioned to the competitors for his crown in the following manner the dauphin was to possess i italy the kingdoms of naples and sicily the ports o the tuscan shore and the marquisate of final o the side of spain the province of guipuscoa or i more precise terms all the spanish territories on the french side of the pyrenees or the mountains of navarra alava and biscay spain the indies and the sovereignty of the netherlands were allotted for the electoral prince of bavaria and in case of his death to his father the elector who had no pretension whatsoever on the succession of spain the dukedom of milan formed the share designed for the archduk charles the emperors second son de torcy vol i p      its effect on the spanish court the contracting powers mutually engaged to keep the treaty a profound secret during the life of the king of spain this condition though necessary was very difficult to be executed the avowed design of the alliance was the preservation of the repose of europe there was therefore a necessit for the allies to satisfy the emperor at the same tim that they limited his views it was impossible to render him well pleased with a treaty which deprive him of the great object of his ambition it was necessary to terrify him into a compliance william from a persuasion of his own influence with leopold undertook to communicate the treaty to that princ and to gain by prudential considerations his consen but when these views were in agitation intelligenc of the treaty of partition was conveyed by some mea or other from holland to madrid the king  spain resenting a division made of his dominions  foreigners called a council of his whole ministry the result was a will instituting the electoral prince  bavaria his universal heir according to the testame of philip the fourth in favor of the descendants  his second daughter in exclusion of the house of bourbon the king himself unexpectedly recovered in some degree from his illness and the hopes and fears of europe were suspended for the year  a new parliament william having remained in holland till the first of december arrived on the fourth of the month at kentington the parliament had been frequently prorogued to wait the kings return the people became discontented at his long absence as he had not now the excuse of business and war the new parliament met at westminster on the sixth of december journals dec    the commons chose sir thomas littleton for their speaker the king approved their choice on the ninth of the month and made a speech from the throne he doubted not he said but they were met with hearts fully disposed to provide for the safety and to preserve the honor and happiness of the kingdom two things he told them seemed to demand their consideration to acquire that desirable end what strength ought to be maintained at sea what force to be kept up by land he observed that the flourishing of trade the supporting of credit the quieting the minds of the people at home and the weight and influence of england abroad depended upon the opinion the nation and foreigners should form of the security of the kingdom he recommended to the commons to make some farther progress in discharging the debts contracted in a long and expensive war and he concluded with observing that as the things he had mentioned were of common concern he could not but hope for unanimity and dispatch dec     resentment against the kings speech william however was soon convinced that his hopes of unanimity in favor of his own views were illfounded the bad grace with which he had yielded to the reduction of the army in the preceding year his evasive execution of the act passed for that purpose his long absence from the kingdom without any important reason a jealousy arising to his people from his apparent neglect of sea affairs which he owned he never understood burnet   his known predilection for land forces his fresh demand for an increase in their number in england the care he took to continue the military establishments in his other kingdoms were all calculated to raise the resentment and to awaken the fears of parliament the commons in particular were so much incensed at his speech that contrary to the usual custom of their house they voted no address even the lords agreed not to their address till the twentysecond of december and when presented jan         it was found to be conceived in very general and undecisive terms his own servants seemed to have deserted william upon the present occasion the current of the nation against a standing army ran extremely high the ministry therefore were unwilling to expose themselves to the rage of the people by gratifying the king  the army reduced to seven thousand men when the affair of the army came under debate in the house of commons the ministry produced no estimates and they made no proposals the whole business devolved on the countryparty they proposed seven thousand men as a sufficient establishment for guards and garrisons and they carried their motion with little difficulty on the seventeenth of december it was resolved that all the land forces in england in english pay and these naturalborn subjects should be forthwith paid and disbanded that all the forces in ireland excepting twelve thousand men and these also naturalborn subjects maintained by that kingdom should be likewise disbanded a bill was immediately brought in upon this resolution and prosecuted with ardour it was provided by the first enacting clause that the army in england and wale should be reduced on or before the twentysixth o march then ensuing except such regiments troops and companies not exceeding seven thousand men as before the first day of the same month should b particularly expressed in a proclamation under the great seal the lords exhibited the same spirit an zeal with the commons an opposition to the bi was made by some of the adherents of the crown b the attempt was so feeble and illsupported that it threw disgrace on the cause that was meant to be served burnet vol ii   william displeased threatens to abandon the kingdom the opposition made by the friends of william tended only to furnish his enemies with an opportunity of being severe on his character and conduct they insinuated that he neither loved the nation in general not placed any confidence in englishmen that he left the kingdom in the preceding summer without any apparent excuse for his absence that he was employed neither in the concerns of the people as king nor in the affairs of the states as stadtholder that he went merely to enjoy a lazy privacy at loo with a few favorites and creatures in a manner unworthy of his character and unsuitable to his dignity burnet vol iii  these open complaints and insinuations of the same kind rendered fretful the mind of william naturally peevish melancholy and severe his deportment when he was humoured the most was stiff ungracious and cold but now his resentment had so far overcome his prudence that he alternately yielded to fits of passion or sunk under a load of despondence he is even said to have formed a resolution of abandoning the kingdom and that he had prepared a speech in which he was to request of the two houses to name such persons as they should think fit to manage a government that he himself was resolved no longer to hold       he yields to the commons this speech intended to be pronounced on the fourth of january was never publicly made the private insinuations of the king were little regarded as they were not deemed sincere he had twice since his expedition into england derived advantage from the same threat but the expedient was now too seal either to alarm the fears of the people or to gain the favor of parliament prudence at length overcame some part of the resentment of william he resolved to comply with a measure to which the two houses seemed determined to adhere on the first of february he came to pass the bill for disbanding  solicits them for his dutch guards in vain the commons in some measure complied with williams desire with regard to the security of the nation though they were inflexibly resolved to reduce the landforces they increased to fifteen thousand men the establishment by sea feb     the necessary orders were in the mean time issued for disbanding the army but his predilection for his favorite dutch guards recurred again to the kings mind on the eighteenth of march he sent a message written in his own hand to the house of commons by the earl of ranelagh paymastergeneral of the forces march     he told them that the necessary preparations were made for transporting the guards who came with him to england that he intended to send them away immediately from the kingdom unless the house out of consideration to him should finds means to continue them longer in his service a measure which his majesty journals feb        would construe into an act of great kindness this condescending expedient produced no favorable effect on the commons the question that a day should be appointed for considering the message was carried in the negative a committee was appointed to frame an address representing the reasons why the commons could not comply the address was accordingly presented on the twentyfourth of march the answer of william contained a recapitulation of his own services to the nation his confidence in their fidelity to his person and his resolution to preserve entire the constitution which he had restored march      parliament prorogued the provision made by the commons for the effectual reduction of the army was the last business of importance in this refractory session the two houses however continued to sit till the fourth of may though william yielded to his prudence he could neither conceal his resentment nor suppress his complaints for the unkind treatment which he had received from the commons he furnished an example of both in his speech from the throne when he prorogued the parliament in any light in which the subject is viewed the king had little reason to be pleased but the sallies of passion into which he is said to have fallen require better authorities than those by which they are supported to be implicitly believed his disappointments throughout furnished matter of triumph to his enemies but they dwelt with most malevolence on the supposed meanness of his message to the commons in favor of his dutch guards the conduct of the commons cannot however be disapproved though no danger ought perhaps to be apprehended from such an insignificant number of foreigners there was a kind of necessary dignity in

been made by a secret stipulation to substitute the father in the place of the son upon the eventual death of the latter that article of the treaty as it was founded upon no pretensions possessed by the elector was equally disregarded by both the contracting powers france showed an inclination to propose a new convention to the king of england on the plan of the former treaty but though william entertained a design of renewing his engagements the moment he heard of the death of the prince de torcy vol i  his embarrassment with regard to the disagreeable proceedings of parliament drove all other thoughts from his mind during the sitting of that assembly  william ens to another the leisure necessary for the settlement of foreign affairs was fought after by william in holland having made several changes in the ministry and declared a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence he left kensington on the first of june and in the evening of the third arrived at the hague on the twenty second of june he left that place and retired to loo where and at dieren he spent the most part of the season in his favorite diversion of hunting tallard who had managed so successfully the treaty of the preceding year was ordered by hi court to repair to loo in the beginning of july to ttle measures as they were called for preserving the tranquillity of europe william very early in the year had given orders of the same kind to his ambassador at paris he approved therefore with little difficulty of the scheme proposed by de tallard that spain and the indies should be left to the archduke that the duchy of milan should be added to the portion intended for the dauphin and that the netherlands should be settled in such a manner as might entirely prevent any jealousy in england or umbrage in holland de torcy vol i   intelligence of his views sent to spain this negotiation though committed only to a few individuals continued not long a secret from the world the spanish ambassador at the hague sent intelligence by a courier to madrid the court was alarmed the king himself in the midst of his weakness was highly offended at a measure which hurt his pride he remonstrated in the strongest terms against the behavior of william to his ambassador at madrid he ordered the marquis de canailles his own minister at london to represent in england his high displeasure at the indignity offered to himself and his crown the marquis in his memorial to the lords of the regency followed the dictates of his own malignity more than the interest of his sovereign he told them that his master had been informed that william the dutch and other powers were actually hatching new treaties for the succession of the crown of spain and what was equally detestable contriving the division and repartition of the spanish territories that his majesty had given orders to represent the injustice of their king to the ministers and lords of england that if such things were allowed no nation no dominion could be safe against the ambition of the strongest and the deceits of the most malicious that should strangers be permitted to put their hands in the lines of succession of kings no statutes no municipal laws would be observed that no crown could be free from the attempts of aliens and the crown of england less than any crown that were men to lie watching for the indispositions of sovereigns no health could be constant no life secure memorial august        an insolent memorial by the spanish ambassador the marquis descended from general observations to particular facts he informed the lords of the regency that it ought not to have been presumed that the king of spain had not taken proper measures against all accidents that might disturb the public peace and break the repose of europe that unless a stop should be put to these sinister proceedings these clandestine machinations these unjust projects an universal war must be the consequence throughout europe that such a misfortune would be highly prejudicial to the people of england who had lately tried and felt the inconvenience of novelties and the insupportable burden of the consequent war that this latter circumstance was so obvious that the memorialist doubted not but it must be owned by the parliament the nobility and all the english nation that the same nation must consider their own interest their trade and their treaties with spain the danger arising to these from a division and separation of the spanish monarchy and that nothing can prevent these misfortunes but their disappointing the project already begun at loo and their determining not to help forward novelties ever supremely hurtful to all sovereignties and empires he concluded with assuring the regency that the king his master would render manifest to the parliament of england when that assembly should meet the just resentment which he now expressed to their lordships  he is ordered to depart the kingdom this insolent memorial was transmitted to william before any answer was made by the regency the king was not of a complexion either to admit of appeals from the prerogatives of the crown to the representatives of the nation or to suffer any reflections against his own right to the throne he ordered mr secretary vernon to signify to the spanish ambassador that he must depart the kingdom precisely in eighteen days that in the mean time he should confine himself to his house and that no writing should be any more received either from himself or any of his domestics the king at the same time ordered his ambassador at the court of madrid to complain of the affront offered to his person and the reflections thrown on his government he endeavored to exempt the king of spain from having any share in the outrage committed by his ambassador but that prince made himself a party in the dispute by ordering the english ambassador to depart the kingdom within the same space of time that had been limited by william to the marquis de canailles  affairs of the north these disputes between william and spain neither hastened nor retarded the second treaty of partition which that prince concluded the next year with france his attention was not confined to the subject of the spanish succession though the declining health of charles the second threatened europe with those miseries which it then feared

fourth of september was succeeded in the throne by his son frederic the fourth frederic inheriting the resentment and pursuing the designs of his father against the duke of holsteingottorp began to make great preparations both by sea and land to reduce that prince to those terms which he pretended to have a right to exact the duke on the other hand had strengthened his interest by a marriage with the princessroyal of sweden he himself was commander in chief of the troops of that kingdom and he had obtained a force from his brotherinlaw charles the twelfth to defend himself against the designs of denmark william in his double capacity of king of england and stadtholder of the united provinces considered himself as guarantee of the treaty of altena and to secure the tranquillity of the north he proposed that the swedish troops should retire from holstein the king of sweden and the duke accepted the proposal of the mediator but the king of denmark having privately entered into an alliance against sweden with the king of poland and peter alexiowitz czar of muscowy exacted terms so exorbitant that it was apparent he meant nothing less than to preserve the peace hist de suede tom

military stores for service some provisions and twelve hundred men a council of seven was appointed to direct the expedition they were bound to the isthmus of darien in america to make an establishmen

sent orders to the governors of the colonies to iss proclamations forbidding his subjects in america to gi any assistance to the adventurers upon pain of his dpleasure and of suffering the severest punishme there was a degree of inhumanity and a palpa injustice in this conduct the king himself had given his assent to an act and signed a royal charter for the establishment of the company the spaniards had not yet complained of any encroachments on their territories william by evasive answers to the representations of the scots had in a manner prevented them from providing against a hardship which no subjects acting under the authority of the law had any reason to fear from their sovereign to complete the misfortune the king listened to the complaints of the spaniards may

humanity of the inhabitants the supply which the rigid edicts of government had denied they sailed to jamaica they directed their course from that island to new york they found no relief in either place and they prosecuted their voyage to europe the company and the whole scottish nation were inflamed at once with resentment and disappointment the first sent an address to the king they followed the address with a petition for a session of parliament neither of the papers produced the desired effect the king in his answer by his secretary the earl of seafield regretted the loss which the kingdom and the company had lately sustained he told them that upon all occasions he would protect and encourage their trade that the subjects of scotland should always enjoy the same privilege as sormerly to trade with the english plantations but as for the parliament that he had adjourned that assembly to the fifth of march and that they should be assembled when he judged the good of the nation required their meeting this new repulse was consted into a fresh injury despair was added to rage and resentment and a general ferment seemed to threaten a general revolt enquiry into the causes of the miscarriage at dari   william returns a change in the ministry the king embarked for england on the thirteenth of october and having landed on the seventeenth at margate arrived the next day at kensington the obstructions attending the service of the crown in the last session of parliament had either prevailed with william to make a change among his servants or induced some of themselves to resign the earl of orford retired from the admiralty the earl of jersey succeeded the duke of shrewsbury a secretary of state the duke of leeds was removed from the head of the council

on the sixteenth of november the king mad an elaborate speech to the two houses full of expressions of affection for his parliament and care of the public good no     he however seemed to have still retained a sense of his dissatissaction with the proceedings of the commons in the last session the commons on the other hand brought back to the house the illhumour in which they were prorogue in the place of an address of compliments and thank as had been usual on such occasions they presented  the king but after a long interval dec    a remonstrance they beseeched william from the necessity of a mutual confidence between himself and his parliament to show marks of his highest displeasure to such persons as should presume to misrepresent their proceedings they promised in return to discourage all false rumors and reports reflecting on his majestys person and government as tending to create misunderstandings between the king and his subjects william chose to soften the rage of his commons rather than to gratify his own resentment he seemed as if he understood not the illhumour of the address and his answer though guarded was full of an appearance of kindness dec      inquiry into irish

considerable weight in parliament the illhumour the industry and the eloquence were all on the opposing side all the debates and most of the resolutions of the commons were violent and hostile they had appointed n the last session of parliament seven commissioners o inquire into the state and grants of the forfeited states in ireland the lower house had repeatedly assed bills for applying those estates to the public serce but the bills had been defeated in the house of rds by the influence of the crown and the interest  such as had obtained grants from the king the position founded sanguine hopes of distressing the ourt on a subject so popular they called therefore  a report of the inquiry which was accordingly laid fore them by mr annesley one of the commissiers journals   report of the commissioners in this singular report it appeared that three thoud nine hundred and twentyone persons had been outlawed since the thirteenth of february      that all the lands belonging to forfeited persons amounted to more than one million and sixty thousand acres that the annual rent of these lands amounted to two hundred and eleven thousand six hundred and twentythree pounds which by computing six years purchase for a life and thirteen for inheritance amounted to the full value of two millions six hundred and eightyfive thousand one hundred and thirty pounds that some of the lands had been restored to the old proprietors by the articles of limerick and galloway and others by a corrupt reversal of outlawries and by royal pardons obtained by the favorites of the king that sixtyfive grants and custodiams had passed the great seal of ireland that the most considerable of these grants were made to persons born in foreign countries to keppel to bentinck to ginckle and to rouvigny who had been all dignified with peerages in one or other of the two kingdoms that besides a grant had passed the great seal to elizabeth villiers now countess of orkney a woman peculiarly favored by william of all the private estates of the late king james containing ninetyfive thousand acres worth twentyfive thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive pounds a year and that upon the whole the value of irish forfeitures amounted to three millions three hundred and nineteen thousand nine hundred and fortythree pounds journals     00 violence of the commons the commons having examined this report resolved unanimously on the fifteenth of december dec         that a bill should be brought in to apply all forfeitures in ireland from the thirteenth of february      to the use of the public a clause was also ordered  be inserted in the bill for erecting a judicature  determining claims touching the said forfeitures but at the same time the house came to a resolution  to receive petitions from any person whatsoever the uncandid mode of proceeding in the majority offened the dispassionate while it alarmed the court an digusted the king while yet the bill remained i journals jan   00   they tack the bill of resumption to the supply though the courtparty were almost in every question the minority they endeavored to defeat in part the bill of resumption by proposing a clause for reserving a proportion of the forfeitures to the disposal of the king the house not content with putting a negative on this motion resolved that the advising procuring and passing the grants for the forfeited estates and others in ireland had been the occasion of contracting great debts upon the nation and laying heavy taxes on the people and that the passing of these grants highly reflected on the kings honor jan     while the commons exhibited this spirit of refractoriness the affair of the supply for the current service commanded a part of their care the and forces were continued on the same sooting as in the preceding year but the seamen were reduced to seven thousand men the ways and means were chiefly a land tax of two shillings in the pound with a borrowing clause of near a million with the surplus of the old subsidy ending on the twentyfifth of december together with that of the funds for the civil list which were to terminate at the end of the present year in a narrow inspection of every branch of the revenue a great loss to the public was discovered in the collection of the excise a clause was inserted in the bill of supply to enable his majesty to farm that branch of the revenue and it was at the same time provided that no excise or customhouse officer should be capable for the future to sit in the house of commons journals   their resolutions hostile to secure the assent of the king to the resumption of the irish forfeitures the bill was called a bill of supply and tacked to that for the grants of the year the money to be raised by the sale of the lands was appropriated to the discharge of the transportdebts the arrears of officers the sums due for clothing the interest upon tallies orders tickets and exchequerbills during the debates on these subjects the commons in a grand committee considered the state of the nation feb     in a question which tended to an animadversion upon the kings servants the courtparty prevailed but the house resolved on the fifteenth of february to represent to his majesty in a address their resolutions relating to grants of the forfeited estates in ireland williams answer expressed some part of the resentment which he entertaine against the harsh proceedings of the commons h told them that he was not only led by inclination b even by justice to show favor to such as had serve him well that their service in ireland was wit peculiar propriety rewarded out of the estates forfeied by the rebellion in that kingdom and that the lesening of the national debt by just and effectu means would in his opinion best contribute to t honor safety and interest of the kingdom feb   t commons were so much ossended with this reply t they resolved that whoever had advised the answ to their address had used his utmost endeavor  create a misunderstanding and jealousy between the king and his people feb      and proceedings displeasing to the king this session of parliament was throughout hostile to the king the grand committee for trade had examined into several piracies committed in the east indies by one captain kidd and his crew on this examination it appeared that william had inadvertently made himself a kind of party in the affair by signing a warrant for the granting of piratesgoods to the earl of bellamount and several others the commons sent an address to the throne that kidd who was ordered home from america should not be tried discharged or pardoned until the next session of parliament this conduct in the house showed a distrust of the king which raised his resentment as it hurt his pride an enquiry into the state of the commissions of the peace and lieutenancy produced an address april    that was not grateful to the king the house represented that to restore gentlemen of quality and estates to these commissions would much conduce to the good of the kingdom and they desired that neither men of small estates nor dissenting from the church of england should either be continued or appointed journals  these proceedings were more disgustful to the king in their manner than in themselves repugnant to his authority or hurtful to his character  they carry their point against him though a majority of the lords seemed to be in opposition to the measures of william the peers treated him with more complaisance than the commons the complicated bill comprehending the resumption and supply met with great opposition in the upper house some had been gained by the servants of the crown many disapproved of the precedent of tacking a foreign clause to a moneybill as reducing the peers to a subserviency to the factions and views of the commons but the force of both parties when joined was not sufficient to reject the bill amendments were however made with regard to the irish forfeitures but these amendments were unanimously disapproved by the lower house conference succeeded conference the commons were in a ferment they spoke of impeaching the earls of portland and albemarle they shut themselves up after the second conference with the lords till ten at night and seemed determined on the harshest means to force the courtparty into compliance in this important interval the house resolved to address the king that no person not a native of his dominions except prince george of denmark should be admitted to his councils either in england or ireland april  0  william was not of a complexion to give a favorable answer nor was he in a condition to refuse the demands of the exasperated commons he sent a private message to his friends among the lords to suspend their opposition the bill was immediately passed without amendments and to prevent the falling of the threatened storm he came suddenly to the house gave his assent to the act of resumption and prorogued the parliament april     without any speech from the throne  affairs of the scottish company while william was harassed in one of his kingdoms by a violent and successful opposition in parliament he was perlexed in another by vehement instances for redress on the fourth of december      the councilgeneral of the scottish company informed the secretary of their nation in england that they has prevailed upon the lord basil hamilton to make a journey to london to address the king in behalf of more than thirty persons wrongfully detained prisoners at carthagena by the spaniards william seldom capable of concealing his resentment exhibited it upon the present occasion in a manner unsuitable to his dignity he ordered the chancellor of scotland to acquaint the councilgeneral that he had refused acce to lord basil hamilton as he had not waited upon him when he was formerly in london and that h had never since given any public evidence of his loyalty chancello letter to the directors  he however promised to demand in t terms of treaties the release of the prisoners at carthagena that it was his firm intention to advance the trade of scotland and that the subjects of that kingdom should enjoy the same liberty of commerce that others enjoyed in the english plantations the company however were resolved not to relinquish their purpose they wrote to the chancellor they sent a letter to lord basil hamilton they requested the first to use his best endeavors for obtaining admittance for the noble person whom they had employed they approved of the conduct of the latter and ascribed their disappointment to a dislike to their own cause more than to any objection entertained by the king against his person letter to the chancellor   opposed by the king embarrassed with complaints and teazed by entreaties william endeavored to get rid of the scots with the sanction of the english parliament the commons being so refractory the first application was made to the lords neither the influence of the crown nor the prejudices of the house against the new company were capable of carrying the point against the scots without violent debates and long delays an address was at length sent down to the commons for their concurrence but the commons were not in the humor of being complaisant to the king the enemies of william were pleased to see his affairs embroiled some apprehended that there was a design to involve the two kingdoms in a quarrel that the king might derive from the necessity of the nation that increase of the land forces which had been so often denied to his earnest solicitations to parliament the leaders of opposition were by no means inclined to remove the general discontent which had soured the temper of the scots against the king the disaffected members in the mean time propagated a report that the opposition of the king to the scottish company proceeded neither from a regard to foreign treaties nor domestic advantage but from an affection for the dutch whose trade along the spanish main was in danger of being ruined by the establishment of a new colony at darien burnet vol iii  the commons upon the whole refused their concurrence to the address and soon after they rejected a bill sent down from the lords for appointing commissioners to treat with the scots concerning an union of the two kingdoms journals   a petition in the name of the whole scottish nation the ferment continuing to rage in scotland the marquis of tweedale presented a petition to william in the name of the whole nation mar    00  they recounted the hardships of the company both at home and abroad their own feelings upon a subject so melancholy and the promises of the king to favor protect and support the general trade of the kingdom they requested him to order the parliament to sit as nothing could more conduce to the support of the credit and interest of a company in whose misfortunes and prosperity the whole nation were concerned than the meeting of the representatives of the people they reminded him of his promise of permitting that assembly to sit whenever the good of the nation required that measure and they assured him that the good of the nation could at no time require their meeting more than on the present occasion this irregular petition produced nothing but an additional disappointment the king made answer that the parliament should not meet till the fourteenth of may but that then it should meet for the dispatch of business the discontents of the scots were inflamed into a species of madness upon this fresh instance of the kings disregard to their complaint a general revolt might have been apprehended ha the power of the kingdom borne any proportion to the resentment of the people  the king disgusted though the king had extricated himself from present trouble by the sudden prorogation of the englis parliament he was still far from having freed himse from the storm which had shaken in some degre his throne his own conduct during the session w more apt to inflame than to soothe the minds of the by whom he was most opposed he made no secret of his displeasure at the proceedings of the commons he was at no pains to conceal his resolution to defeat the bill of resumption by refusing his assent should it pass the house of lords he became sullen melancholy and discontented his resentment broke forth frequently in a manner inconsistent with his prudence he either apprehended not the dangers in which the votes of the commons might terminate or he was not much concerned where they might end burnet vol iii  he even seemed indifferent about possessing the name of king after the authority which he deemed to be inherent in that capacity had vanished from his hands and had not the safety of those whom he favored most depended on his compliance he would not probably have suppressed the rage against the commons which his enemies hoped he was to have carried to extremity they perceived that should he quarrel with the commons he would lose what still remained of the affections of his people his going constantly beyond sea after every session of parliament furnished his opponents with an opportunity of impressing the minds of the nation with an opinion that he even hated the company and society of his english subjects ibid   a change in the ministry the recess of parliament as it freed william from daily mortifications encouraged him to endeavor to prevent the return of the disagreeable measures which had so much disturbed his repose he found that in the course of the session the commons had expressed great animosity against his ministers particularly against the lord chancellor summers who was the most ble of his servants and considered as the head of the whigs summers had gained a considerable degree of he kings confidence by his ability in business and he modesty of his manner in tendering his advice william however resolved to dismiss him from his ervice from the hopes which he had entertained at a man disliked by the commons would carry in this retreat all the unpopularity that had of late atnded the measures of the crown when summers who labored under an illness during the winter had recovered health sufficient to appear at court he was told by the king that it was necessary for the pubblic service he should resign the seals summers excused himself from making the delivery of the seals his own act as that circumstance might be construed by his enemies into either guilt or fear the earl of jersey was sent with a warrant to demand the seals in form and they were accordingly returned to the king  character of the lord summers summers though meanly descended swifts ms notes on macky  rendered himself respectable by talents which he knew well to improve to his own advantage he was a man of abilities in his profession but his parts were more solid than brilliant or even clear he was rather a good chancellor than a great statesman his integrity and diligence in office were with reason commended he was too diffident and too compliant with the king to make any splendid figure beyond his own line of the law his complaisance to the kings humor his flattering him in his very errors his feeble manner of recommending what seemed right to his own judgment bore more the appearance of a convenient than of an able servant upon the whole he seemed more calculated to smoothe the current of business by amending and softening measures already adopted than to propose and execute those spirited and manly expedients which times of faction seem to demand at the hands of a great minister the difficulty which william encountered in supplying properly the place may  0 of summers argued that his dismission of that lord was a precipitate measure while at the same time he was justly censured for throwing a kind of disgrace on a servant who had served him with fidelity in perilous times but the king had concluded from the late opposition to all his measures that the tories only were capable of carrying forward with facility the public business  second treaty  partition during the violent heats in parliament william turned a part of his attention to the affairs of europe the negociations for the second partition of the dominions of spain proceeded but a desire of persuading the emperor to enter into the same engagements long prevented the king and the states of holland from signing the treaty though the articles had been settled in the month of october the emperor after various evasions formally rejected every treaty of partition whatsoever yet neither the king of england nor the states showed any eagerness to close with france upon the disposition already agreed with regard to the spanish succession in the beginning of january in the present year the king of spain declined so manifestly that his death was daily expected this circumstance hastened the conclusion of the treaty which was signed at london by the earls of portland and jersey and the comte de tallard on the twentyfirst of february and at the hague on the fourteenth of march by briord the french ambassador and by the plenipotentiaries of the states de torcy vol i   concluded between william and france the second partition of the spanish dominions differed materially from the disposition made by the former treaty

and the province of guipuscoa were to fall to the share of the dauphin together with the duchies of lorrain and bar which their native prince was appointed to exchange for the duchy of milan in this summary disposal of territories and kingdoms the king of england was not forgetful of his friend the prince vaudemont to whom the country of binche was to remain a sovereignty to present the union of spain and the imperial crown in the person of one prince provision was made that in case of the archdukes demise the king of the romans should not succeed to the throne and in like manner it was particularly stipulated that no king of france or dauphin should ever wear the crown of spain a secret article provided for the contingency of the emperors refusing to accede to the treaty and against any difficulties which might arise from the duke of lorrain with regard to the projected exchange of his native territories for the duchy of milan de torcy vol i   treaty with sweden while william seemed to provide for the repose of the south of europe he extended his care to the tranquillity of the north the young king of sweden apprehensive of a storm which already began to break on his dominions entered into a new defensive treaty with the maritime powers the contracting parties became reciprocally guarantees of all their dominions charles the twelfth engaged to furnish the king of england with ten thousand men to be paid by the latter prince should he find himself obliged to take arms in support of the treaty of riswick england and the states as guarantees of the treaty of altena between the king of denmark and the duke of holsteingostorp seem to have agreed though not in an express article to aid charles with a strong squadron of ships of war when attacked by his enemies the treaty was signed on the thirteenth of january and the requisition or rather the application for the ships was made in march hist du nord tom ii  william in a bad humor with his refractory parliament gave orders for preparing a squadron without either communicating to them his intentions or demanding a supply the first would be imprudent in the untoward humor of of the times as england was little concerned in the affairs of the north and the latter would most certainly be refused considering the general resolution formed by the commons for diminishing the expenses of the nation  copenhagen bombarded but before william took any avowed part in the affairs of the north he went to holland and his favorite retreat at loo having appointed a regency june     for the administration of government in his absence he left hampton court on the fourth of july and on the sixth arrived at the hague the assiance formed against sweden began to show itself in the motions of the confederate powers the russians poles and saxons entered livonia and ingria the danes led by the duke of wertemberg invaded holstein and having seized some inconsiderable forts sat down before tonningen the strength of the place the conduct of the governor the unskilfulness of the besiegers an unsuccessful assault and the march of the troops of brunswicklunenburgh who had passed the elb induced the danes to relinquish their designs on tonningen and to retreat toward their own frontiers a combined squadron of english and dutch men of war with fireships and bombvessels under the admirals rooke and allemonde arrived on the twentieth of july at the mouth of the sound july  0  the fleet of sweden commanded by the king in person having joined the allies the danish ships retired under the guns of

allies july  0   denmark forced into a peace his active spirit suggested to the young king of sweden the means of putting an end with one decisive stroke to the war he resolved to besiege copenhagen

copenhagen the enemy was in the heart of his doinions he could derive no hopes but from submissin and negotiation the count de chamilli ambassador of france offered his own mediation in the name of

tranquillity of the north may be ascribed in a great degree to the decisive measures of the king of england but when he was securing the peace of foreign nations tumults discontents and clamours prevailed in a part of h own dominions on the twentyfirst of may the parliament of scotland had met at edinburgh and the kings letter containing the usual excuse for no opening the session in person being read the duk of queensberry as lordhigh commissioner perceiving the bad humor of parliament adjourned the house for three days when they met on the twentyfourth petitions addresses and representations  particular as well as general grievances were pour in upon them from every side the councilgene of the indian and african company as they had sfered most were the loudest in their complaints  motion was made that the colony of caledonia  darien was a legal and rightful settlement and the the parliament would maintain and support the sam the commissioner perceiving that this embarrassi vote was on the point of being carried suddenly ajourned the house for three days this circumsta added fuel to the flame when the house met the resumed their motion and the commissioner ag adjourned them for twenty days may  0   parliament address against an adjournment the conduct of the commissioner was consider by a great majority as an arbitrary breach upon  freedom of voting in

wherein it was provided that nothing should be done or commanded that might either directly or indirectly prevent the liberty of free voting and reasoning of the estates of parliament they affirmed that the second adjournment was a manifest infringement on the claim of rights which had accompained the very act that had placed the king on the throne they concluded with entreating his majesty to permit his parliament to meet on the day to which it was then adjourned and to sit as long as might be necessary for redressing the grievances of the nation a deputation was sent with this address to the king he declared june    that he could give no answer at the time to their petition but that they should know his intentions in scotland the parliament was in the mean time further adjourned by proclamation  a general ferment though the earl of seafield and other servants of the crown had been for a whole year employed in gaining with promises and pensions the members of the scottish parliament the clamours of the people made more proselytes than the bribes employed by he king the current ran rapidly in one way whilst the disaffected added their own force to the vioence of the stream the general cry was that the reedom of debate was most effectually ruined the laim of right invaded and a private power usurped ver the parliament the king they justly observd assumed more than a negative by these unconstituonal adjournments a bill is defeated by the first y the latter the right of giving advice one of the reat ends of all parliaments is utterly prevented and verturned in

indecency and his authority with contempt a national address was in the mean time encouraged on every side and transmitted to every borough and county for signatures and names  violence of the discontented to add to the general ferment advices arrived from spain that several of the adventures in darien had been sent to that country and condemned as pirates that the chief proofs brought against them were the proclamations of the governors of the english colonies by the express commands of the king containing a formal disavowal of the legality of the settlement together with words disclaiming the undertaking of the scots expressed by william himself to the spanish ambassador and transmitted in writing by that minister to the council of the indies in the midst of the clamours raised upon this fresh intelligence william endeavored in vain to soothe the scots into some temper by a letter to the duke of queensberry the national flame continued to increase the discontented members talked of sitting by force and of forming themselves into a convention they even affirmed that the army was ready to join their cause against a government which by denying protection had no right to obedience that they wanted nothing but money to declare the throne vacant to restore the late king or to confer the crown on some other prince more inclined than the present to support the

regaining his crowns to the resolution of transporting himself into england he seems to have still adhered had william as was generally apprehended yielded to the disorders that had long threatened his dissolution but though he had resigned all hopes with regard to himself james never doubted but his son would one day recover the crowns which he himself had lost he thought that the objections to himself proceeded either from the views of a few leading men or the terrors of the populace who were animated with an enthusiasm similar to his own he deemed the lineal succession so essential and even necessary to monarchy that things must in course fall back to their old channel when the terrors of his own return and the pressure of williams ambition were both removed from the nation contin

disorder and he expired at windsor on the night of the twentyninth of the month though as is usual with regard to princes who die in youth much has been said of his parts and acquirements he was little lamented by the nation and less by the king the people were discontented with the government and rendered areless of its concerns through the different views f the parties into which they were divided and william who had never any affection for the moher was not perhaps much displeased to see her nfluence weakened by the death of the son a preailing report that the princess had sent very clanestinely an express to notify the demise of her son  her father might contribute to lessen the concern of william for the loss which the kingdom had sustained lamberty tom i   death of the k of spain the king having passed three months in holland returned on the nineteenth of october to england unwilling to meet a parliament that had opposed hi in all his views he prorogued that assembly to the twentyfirst of november and after a further prorogation dissolved them before the end of the year the face of affairs in europe had suffered in the mean time a very important change charles the second king of spain having so long struggled wit distempers yielded at length to their force and died on the first of november the resentment which h had conceived against the authors of the second treaty of partition seemed to have hastened the death of tha feeble prince while at the same time it produce the most decisive measure in all his reign having resolved to prevent the projected partition of his dominions the only difficulty lay in the appointment of a universal heir his inclination pointed to the famil of austria but the pope whom he consulted by letter and afterward the clergy of spain at the instgation of the cardinal portocarrero induced that sperstitious prince to nominate the duke of anjou the second son of the dauphin his successor in all his dominions de torcy tom i   his will in favor of the duke of anjou in the will which was dated on the second of october the king acknowledged the right of his sister the infanta maria theresa queen of france and mther of the dauphin he also acknowledged the right of his aunt anne of austria the mother of the french king and consequently the right of the daphin as the only heir by the laws of the kingdom to prevent an alarm in europe at the union of su extensive dominions to france the dauphins seco son was called to the throne of spain until t prince should arrive at madrid and even till he  of age a council of regency with the queen at the head were nominated for the administration of affa upon the demise of charles the regency wrote to  french king and at the same time ordered the will to be delivered to that prince by the spanish ambassador residing at his court lewis consulted his council in which it was resolved to drop the second partition treaty and to adhere to the testament of the late king of spain a war it had been always foreseen was the inevitable consequence of the death of that prince and the court of france wisely concluded that it was much easier to keep possession of the whole kingdom by virtue of the will than to conquer and retain the share allotted to the dauphin by the treaty concluded with england and the states de torcy tom i   lewis xiv accepts the will lewis the fourteenth joined to these reasons one other of equal weight should he refuse the bequest made to his grandson of the crown all the dominions of spain must have fallen into the hands of the emperor the hereditary rival of the power of his family the very courier that brought the will to france had been ordered in case of the refusal of that court to proceed to vienna with a tender of the throne to the archduke this circumstance would have again revived the power possessed by the house of austria in the days of charles the fifth when the united weight of spain and the empire had almost proved fatal to the french monarchy these reasons coinciding with the ambition of lewis he flattered himself that the war which must otherwise have been kindled in europe was least to be dreaded on the grounds which he now had chosen the resolution adopted for accepting the will in france was followed by the precaution of formng alliances abroad lewis entered into a treaty with e king of portugal with the dukes of savoy and mantua the latter of these princes received a rench garrison into his capital the allies of france  the side of germany were the duke of brunswick wolfembuttle the duke of saxegotha and the ishop of munster the elector of bavaria then vernor of the netherlands and his brother the ector of cologn were uncles to the new king  spain and resolved to maintain his right to the own ibid   resentment of the emperor the king of england and the states of the united provinces affected to be highly offended at the breach made by lewis the fourteenth on the second treaty of partition but they were in no condition to support at present their resentment with any decisive measure they observed therefore a cautious silence while the emperor possessed of less power of revenge than either made a great deal of noise stanhope to manchester dec  0  perplexed and rendered undecisive by his disappointments leopold was for some time uncertain what measures he should adopt to possess himself of an object of which he had been unexpectedly deprived he at length fixed on the milanese which he claimed as a fief of the empire on the twentysecond of november he issued his mandate to the inhabitants of that duchy which they were to obey on pain of being considered as rebels this resolution was more calculated to raise the ridicule than the terror of the house of bourbon on that side he was in want of every resource of war without money at home without alliances abroad and as irresolute in his conduct as he was destitute of power and full of pride stan to manchester manchester to vernon dec      william disposed to preserve a good understanding with spain but though the french king had nothing immediately to fear from the resentment of the emperor hi own precautions against a war hastened its approach during these transactions one schonenburgh a flemish jew resided at madrid in the double capacity of agent for england and the states of holland the chief view of william being to preserve the barrie in flanders in the hands of the dutch and to preve the netherlands from being annexed to the crown  france he ordered schonenburgh to signify to the regency his earnest desire of living on the footing  their former amity with the court of spain and  insinuate at the same time his expectations that t barrier in flanders should be preserved in its prese form the regency or as they were called  junto had abandoned the fate of spain to the arbittion of france they knew the weakness of the snish dominions in all quarters and the utter inability of the kingdom to defend itself on any side they therefore requested the french king to accept in a manner of the generalship of their monarchy they commanded the viceroys of the provinces to obey his orders and under the pretense that the states were making preparations for war they empowered the court of france to take possession of the barrier in flanders with french troops jan     0   though william might have been jealous of proceedings contrary to the principles which he had long avowed he was induced for various reasons not only to acquiesce at present in the forward measures of france but afterward even to acknowledge the duke of anjou as lawful sovereign of spain april      state of affairs at home the untoward situation of the kings affairs at home had greatly contributed to his present want of decision abroad the refractoriness of the last session of parliament their supposed insults to his person and actual opposition to the crown had convinced william that either he must change his servants or his measures the first suited best his temper he had removed the chancellor before his departure for holland the death of lord lonsdale in the month of july had made a vacancy in the office of privy seal the department in the secretarys office had been long vacant the king took advantage of these circumstances to gratify the tories who he deemed could serve best the measures of the crown without offending by displacing the whigs the earl of tankerville removed into the office of privy seal gave room at the head at the treasury to the lord godolphin dec     co  sir charles hedges was taken from the board of admirality and ade secretary of state nov    the earl of rochester onsidered as a leader of the tories and highchurch rty was nominated in council lord lieutenant of  ireland montagu who had suffered a degree of nominy in the house of commons through his own dec    the king manifestly trimmed between the two parties he hoped to divide the whigs by retaining some of them in office he expected to soften the opposition of the tories by admitting a few of their leaders into the vacant departments of the ministry  the scottish parliament reconciled while the king was making preparations for meeting the new representatives of england on good terms his ministers in scotland were employed in reconciling the parliament of that kingdom to the views of the crown the national address for the meeting of parliament which had been promoted with such eagerness by the discontented was defeated by the kings ordering that assembly to meet before the address was presented on the twentyeighth of october the parliament met accordingly and the kings letter was in every respect well calculated to allay the ferment which had so long prevailed in the nation it was conceived in the most soft and insinuating terms the king promised his resolution to give his assen to all acts for the better establishing the governmen of the church the security of personal liberty an more especially for repairing the losses and promoti the interest of the african and indian companies h laid the want of protection which they had experienced before on the necessity imposed upon himself by the state of europe but as that state was no changed he was determined to support to the utmos their rights and their claims though this condescending expedient had at first no visible effect  the indignant humor of the scots yet by the concurrence of secret practices on the members it contributed to sooth at last the parliament into a per compliance with the views of the crown the ger the session continued the more ground was gain by the ministry till at length in the month of jnuary the storm which threatened the repose of btain was entirely laid  a new parliament in england on the sixth of february the new parliament met at westminster but under the pretense of giving time to the members to arrive in town they were adjourned to the tenth of the same month the commons having presented mr harley whom they had chosen for their speaker the king made a speech to both houses from the throne he told them that the great misfortune of the nation in the death of the duke of gloucester had rendered it absolutely necessary to make a further provision for the succession in the protestant line he earnestly recommended that measure to their earliest care as the happiness of the nation and the security of religion depended on an immediate and proper settlement of the crown the death of the king of spain he said and the declaration of his successor had made so great an alteration in foreign affairs that he desired the parliament to consider very maturely their present state and that he doubted not but their resolutions would conduce to the interest and safety of england the preservation of the protestant religion and the peace of all europe these things he continued were of such weight that he had called a new parliament to obtain the more immediate sense of the kingdom in such an important conjuncture he recommended to the commons to provide for the late deficiencies and the unfunded debts to inspect the state and augment the strength of the navy and to deliberate on the regulation and improvement of trade  mutual animosities of the whigs and tories the animosities of parties the prospect of advantage which arose to the members of the lower house from the very misfortunes of their constituents and above all the importance which the commons had lately acquired by their successful opposition to the crown had rendered seats in parliament uncommon objects of contest during the late elections bribery and corruption perhaps never absent entirely from such occasions had arrived at a pitch too indecent to be overlooked had even those who were rivals for the suffrages of the people been less inflamed against one anothers conduct the first care of the commons as is usual in new parliaments was turned to undue elections but the matter of right was decided by favor more than by its merit every dispute becoming rather a trial of the force of parties than the object of impartial decision the tories having discovered their superiority by the election of a speaker of their own party are said to have used their power in a manner less suitable to justice than to their own prejudices against the whigs and to have thus weakened still more their opponents by depriving many of them of their seats in the house but the charge of injustice might probably have been transferred to the other side had their power equalled their animosity against their rivals the passions of all being inflamed by these contests the great business recommended by the king was for some days either entirely forgotten or commanded only the secondary care of the commons journals   steps toward a war notwithstanding this seeming inattention to the business of the nation the parliament had not yet discovered any part of that animosity which their predecessors had exhibited against the king on the fourteenth of february they resolved to assure his majesty that they would support his government and take such effectual measures as might best conduce to the interest and safety of england the preservation of the protestant religion and the peace of europe though the king in secret wished and had probably determined when circumstances should arise to quarrel with france for departing from the second treaty of partition he durst not avow his inclinations for a war upon a foundation universally unpopular he however took advantage of the general assurance made by the commons and with his answer to their address laid before them a memorial which he received from the envoyextraordinary of the states o holland this memorial fabricated perhaps i conjunction with william himself contained surmise of the hostile disposition of france by the motions o her troops on the side of flanders together with the eventual requisition of the succors from england stipulated by treaty the king demanded the advice o his commons on the first part of the memorial and as to the latter he desired their assistance feb      all parties eager for it on the fifteenth of february the commons with a view to the treaty of partition had addressed the king to lay before them all the treaties concluded between his majesty and any other prince or state since the late war but when they received the answer to their general address they demanded the treaty between england and the states signed on the third of march      together with all the renewals of the treaty since that period the king complied and the house addressed him on the twentieth of february feb  0  to enter into such negociations in concert with the states and other potentates as might conduce to the preservation of the peace of europe they assured him at the same time of their support and assistance for the performance of the treaty concluded in the year      between england and the states of the united provinces william seized with eagerness the general assurances made in this address he thanked the commons in terms expressive of his approbation of their conduct and he seems though his designs were then unknown to have used great address in reconciling the nation by degrees to a war  melforts letter before the houses to secure the assistance of parliament by exciting their fears from france the king had communicated a few days before an intercepted letter from the earl of melfort to his brother the earl of perth concerning some wild and exploded projects for replacing james again on the throne melfort having incurred the dislike of the adherents of the late king on account of his violence and absurdity had been dismissed from the service of that prince james was now directed in his councils by the earl of middleton a man of moderate principles in politics a protestant in his religion and possessing considerable abilities in business the letter alluding chiefly to past transactions contained no material information though the lords deemed it worthy of an address to the king the commons with more dignity passed it over with the contempt it deserved they however resolved upon other considerations to place the navy on a respectable footing they voted unanimously feb     that such persons as should advance five hundred thousand pounds for the service of the fleet should receive six per cent interest and be repaid the principle out of the first aid to be granted in the present session they also resolved on the twentysixth of february that thirty thousand men should be employed in the service of the year feb      settlement of the crown though the settlement of the crown was a matter of the utmost importance to the nation the lower house were neither early in their attention to that business nor expeditious in bringing it to a conclusion on the third of march the commons resolved that to preserve the peace and happiness of the kingdom and to secure the established religion there was an absolute necessity for making a fresh declaration of the limitation of the crown in the protestant succession and that provision should be made for the security o the rights and liberties of the subject march    the latte part of the resolution was suggested by the tories who had been uniformly accused by their rivals o high principles of monarchy they affirmed tha the nation was in so much haste when they settled the present government that many securities were overlooked which might have prevented much mischie they therefore moved that the conditions of government should be settled before the person should b nominated lest what really was meant for the good o the subject should be ascribed to any dislike to the prince on whom the election should fall this satary expedient was construed by the whigs into a dsign of defeating the measure by protracting the busness but the motion was so popular in itself and  consonant to the principles which they themselv professed that they could not oppose it though  came from their political enemies  articles for the security of the subject in a committee of the whole house the commons came to further important resolutions which were reported and with a few amendments approved on the twelfth of march they resolved that all affairs with regard to government cognizable in the privy council should be transacted there and signed by the members that no person whatsoever not a native of england scotland or ireland or dominions belonging to these kingdoms or who was not born of english parents beyond seas though such person is naturalized should be capable of receiving any grant from the crown or office under the king that in the event of the crowns descending or being transferred to a foreigner the english nation should not be obliged without the consent of parliament to enter into any war for the defense of territories not depending on the crown of england that whosoever should come to the possession of the throne should join in communion with the church of england that no pardon should be pleadable to any impeachment in parliament march      the princess sophia placed in the succeson to these votes they added others which seemed to reflect on the reigning prince while they provided securities against his successors in the throne they resolved that no person who should hereafter come to the crown should go out of the dominions of england scotland or ireland without the consent of parliament that no person who should possess an office under the king or receive a pension from the crown should be capable of serving in the house of commons that the commissions of the judges should be rendered permanent and their salaries ascertained and established that the princess sophia duchessdowager of hanover should be declared the next in succession to the crown of england after the reigning king the princess of denmark and the heirs of their respective bodies that the further limitation of the crown should be restricted to the princess sophia and the heirs of her body being protestants and that upon these resolutions a bill should be brought in before the house ibid  the bill was accordingly presented by mr conyers on the last day of march and though it met with obstruction from various incidents it passed on the fourteenth of april and was sent up to the lords journals april      as the protestant near est to the crown the princess sophia thus eventually elected to succeed to the throne of england was the nearest person of the royal line who was not already under a legal incapacity of possessing the crown an express act of parliament had excluded all roman catholics from the succession and all the descendants of charles the first except william and the princess of denmark were of the popish persuasion the parliament therefore were obliged to return to the posterity of james the first in another line and to sophia as granddaughter to that prince by his daughter elizabeth who had been married to the unfortunate king of bohemia though the same power which conferred on the princess the succession of the crown might with equal justice have placed any other person on the throne the parliament chose to adhere in some degree to the royal blood as committing the least outrage on monarchy to which a majority of themselves were attached from principle a different conduct might for a time have deprived the elected sovereign of the reverence which most men born under monarchies pay to the hereditary line but the influence arising from the disposal of an immense revenue had even then placed the power of the sovereign on a much more solid foundation than the seeble prerogative derived by hereditary princes from the opinion of the people  reflections this consideration had certainly its weight with the present parliament in limiting the force of the executive power in the settlement of the succession as the crown which they conferred was a voluntary gift they had a right if they chose to deprive it of its unnecessary ornaments and even of some of its jewels but power had turned it into another channel and the mounds which were reared became in a manner useless as the waters ceased to rise on that side the crown was destined from the very exertions made by the people against its exorbitant claims to acquire in influence what it lost in prerogative authority by these means lost gradually its terrors and its insolence power had ceased to be splendid but it became permanent and irresistible and mankind may be imperceptibly surrounded with the toils of despotism while they have the vanity to think themselves free  proceedings of parliament the parliament having placed the important business of the succession in a way of being secured began to inquire into domestic mismanagements and the conduct of the crown with regard to foreign powers they had already provided for the credit of the nation they had placed the navy on a formidable footing by granting large supplies it however had been evident that the king wished least for their assistance in the latter line but the majority seemed by no means willing to gratify their sovereign in the point of an immediate increase of the landforces of the kingdom in their measures consequent upon the resolution of adhering to the treaty with the dutch in      the commons made a show of aiding the king without offending the nation they resolved that twelve battalions then in ireland should be made up with new levies to ten thousand men and sent to the aid of the states but they at the same time resolved that no new levies should be made in ireland or elsewhere to supply the twelve battalions now to be transported beyond seas journals of the commons   lords address against the partition treaties the present distrust of the king was followed by animadversions on his former conduct the lords having addressed the throne for the late treaties these together with other important papers were laid before them about the middle of march having in a committee of the whole house examined the treaties of partition they agreed upon an address containing bitter reflections on their tendency they complained that the last treaty with the french king had been huddled up without being laid before parliament though then actually sitting and even without being considered in council circumstances as unjust in their nature as the measures themselves were fatal in their consequences they insinuated that the treaty had probably been the cause of the will in favor of the duke of anjou that the cession of sicily naples several ports in the mediterranean the province of guipuscoa and the duchy of lorrain as stipulated in favor of france by the last treaty was contrary to the pretense of the treaty itself the professed object of which was the peace and safety of europe they requested his majesty to require and admit for the future in all matters of importance the advice of his natural born subjects and for that purpose to constitute a council to whom all such foreign and domestic affairs as concerned either his majesty or his dominions might be referred journals of the lords  the kings answer was moderate and prudent it contained a brief evasion conceived in handsome terms he owned that the address contained a matter of very great moment and that he would take care that all treaties he might conclude should be for the honor and safety of england ibid   the kings prudent management of the commons the king having perceived at the beginning of the session that the current of parliament was likely to set powerfully against his measures had resolved to fall down with the stream he had filled the vacant offices with some of the highchurch party he was now determined not to exasperate as he could not soothe the commons they had already in various resolutions rendered manifest their disapprobation of the kings late measures and exhibited a distrust of his future conduct william however exhibited publicly no symptom of displeasure at the conduct o the majority he had now turned his thought wholly upon war in several messages to the commons he communicated the negociations abroad i terms which plainly insinuated that they were at onc ineffectual and near their end he was supported i his present views by the leaders of the whigs at home and through his own management by the dut from abroad the first expected to regain the advantages which they had lost in the confusions of war and the latter were either led by the influence of the king in their councils or swayed by views of their own memorial regularly followed memorial to william and he as regularly with message after message plied the commons journals march      several lords impeached a majority however being equally averse with their constituents from a renewal of war the commons resolved without one dissenting voice upon a vote of advice to the king instead of agreeing with his message march     that all negociations seemed to be at an end they requested the king to carry on the negociations in concert with the states and they at the same time promised to enable effectually his majesty to support the treaty concluded in the year      with the united provinces upon a debate on the treaties of partition they expressed their highest disapprobation of both in resolutions as well as in words they addressed his majesty to remove the earl of portland april  the lord summers april     and the lord halifax from his presence and councils for ever having ordered them to be impeached at the bar of the house of lords these violent measures as they were called by the whigparty produced a counteraddress from the lords a majority of whom had been gained by the joint influence of the court and the persons accused the king to avoid any contest with the commons passed over the address of the peers in silence the first proceeded on articles to maintain the impeachments in which the piracies of captain kidd under the sanction of the broad seal and his being manned and furnished by his majestys ships was not the least extraordinary journals   proceedings of the commons while the king chose to make no reply to the lords he prudently returned a soothing answer to the commons but though they presented an address of thanks they were not to be entirely gained to support their own resolutions to enable the king to adhere to the treaty of      they voted three shillings in the pound on land but they applied the savings on the civil list to the current service the fifty thousand pounds allotted as a dower to king jamess queen had been hitherto retained by william in his own hands under various pretenses and more than twenty thousand pounds had reverted to the crown by the death of the duke of gloucester these sums making in all near one hundred thousand pounds were applied after a violent contest with the adherents of the court toward the payment of the public debts during transactions so unfavourable to the views of the king men who wished to regain his favor and secure his confidence endeavored to rouse the nation to a desire for war a difference between the two houses had been somented to favor this design but the people had been hitherto unconcerned spectators of the contests which agitated the parties in parliament  artifice of the court in all governments that have any tincture of freedom the voice of the nation is generally the standard to which public measures are formed juntos in office as well as excluded factions adapt their conduct to this great criterion and when the nation are not rouzed to forward the private views of either by means of favorite prejudices they both endeavor to excite the clamours of the populace or to gain them to their respective parties through the channel of their fears though the resolutions of the house of commons were hitherto calculated to please the nation the exclude party together with some of those servants who were best acquainted with the kings mind infused gradually into the people a wild suspicion of their representatives that assembly who had evidently secure the liberties of the subject by the limitations in the act of settlement were censured as attached to a sytem of arbitrary power those who called a protetant successor to the crown were accused of favouri the popish line and men who endeavored to appe as good husbands of the

and other gentlemen and freeholders had assembled at maidstone on the twentyninth of april and through the management of the adherents of the king presented to the house of commons what was deemed a

upperhouse and that a mittee from each of the houses should meet to st the time manner and order in the intended trials the lords refused the first demand as it seemed to include a condemnation before conviction to the second they replied that as the sole right of judicature was in themselves they had also the sole right to appoint the time manner and order of all trials on impeachments these differences filled the end of the month of may and almost the whole of june with altercation contest and noise the peers had appointed days for the trials the commons refused to appear and the impeached lords were acquitted the king in the mean time observed a prudent silence though he was not displeased at the current which had turned against the commons he avoided to irritate that assembly and he dismissed them by prorogation on the twentyfourth of june in apparent good humor though he perhaps even then had resolved never to meet the same house again  reflections on the conduct of the commons though no house of commons had ever fallen under the displeasure of party writers in a degree equal to the present they certainly deseved to meet with mo praise than censure that several members had private views to promote in their opposition to the crown cannot well be denied but that the cond of the whole seemed calculated to discharge the du of the representative of the people to their count is equally true their chief demerit in the eyes  those who favored the views of the king was t pursuing every measure calculated to prevent the non from being engaged as a principal in a contin war and the party who abetted the notions of  court had the address to rouse the resentment of  vulgar in their own cause some of the proceed of the lower house it must be

that of the king the conduct of william during the session was as suitable to prudence as it was to the designs that without acknowledging them he had adopted the whigs and tories were inflamed against each other to such a degree of inveteracy and they were also so equally poised that without declaring for either he had a prospect of commanding both parties some leaders of each side were still in office but he chose to make no advances to the whigs nor to gratify the tories the two factions took different ways to obtain the management of government the first departed from their principles in their endeavors to gain the king the latter seemed rather inclined to owe their influence to their sovereigns fear of their power william all the while observed a profound silence and

beginning of august had put an end to even the show of treating with france for the preservation of the tranquillity of europe a fair field was now left for the negociations of the emperor that prince in proportion as he perceived the inclination of the maritime powers for war rose in his demands with regard to the terms of the projected alliance he was determined at first to be satisfied with nothing less than the whole spanish monarchy but the king of england and the states being resolute to undertake for no more than the recovery of flanders as a barrier for holland and the duchy of milan for the security of the emperor the latter prince thought it prudent to depart from his vast schemes all difficulties being thus removed the treaty which afterward obtained the name of the grand alliance was signed on the seventh of september the design avowed in the articles was the procuring satisfaction for the empero in the spanish succession and sufficient security for the dominions and commerce of the allies it wa also stipulated that the king of england and the states might retain for themselves whatever lands an cities their arms should conquer in both the indies vid tret

by the rest of europe on acco of the late accession of his family to such vast domions could scarce permit him to enjoy his good fotune in peace but the truth is he was cured of  former ambition the caution of age had come up  him with its inactivity and weakness his people had scarce time to breathe after immense exertions that had drained their coffers exhausted their strength and depressed their spirit the commerce which had been interrupted by the late war had not yet returned to the old channel his own unadvised policy had also contributed to impoverish his kingdom his raising and lessening the value of money had left his people in such a state of uncertainty with regard to their property that they exported their specie into other countries whilst he himself assisted the general waste by remitting great sums into flanders and italy to maintain his armies and into germany to gain the favor of princes who soon after deserted his cause hist de france de torcy   and spain to render his situation still more critical the dominions of his grandson destitute of the means of defense became a burden instead of an aid to france the spanish monarchy vulnerable on every side presented to the enemy a weakness proportionable to its own magnitude the finances were at a very low ebb the spirit of the people had declined with the resources of the nation they could protect themselves from none though they were destined to be the prey of all their state was so wretched that in the present year the court of madrid were scarce able on the requisition of france to equip two men of war and to send two thousand five hundred men into andalufia for the security of that province schonenburgs correspondence  to alleviate these distresses at home the french king endeavourd to strengthen himself with alliances abroad he ad attempted to secure the duke of savoy with erms of great advantage to himself and the marriage of his second daughter to the young king of spain he had also concluded a treaty with the king of porugal on the eighteenth of june but neither of those princes was sincere in his engagements the rst betrayed the councils and armies of france in he very first campaign and the latter deserted her alliance when her affairs began to assume an unfavourable aspect  death of king james the steps taken by william and the states against the house of bourbon were no secret at the court of france but intelligence of the conclusion of the treaty could not have arrived at versailles when an incident happened which induced lewis perhaps too precipitately to declare himself in opposition to england the unfortunate king james having ever since the peace of riswick lost every hope of being restored to the throne had resigned himself to all the austerities of religious enthusiasm his constitution though vigorous and athletic had for some time begun to yield to the infirmities of age and to that melancholy with which superstition as well as his uncommon misfortunes had impressed his mind in the beginning of september when he was according to his daily custom at public prayers he fell suddenly into a lethargy and though he recovered soon after his senses he languished for some days and expired on the sixth of september the french king with great humanity paid him several visits during his sickness and exhibited every symptom of compassion affection and even of respect ms account of king jamess death   lewis xiv promises to own his son lewis being under a difficulty how to proceed upon the expected death of james called a council to take their advice whether he should own the prince o wales as king of great britain and ireland the king himself had hesitated long on this delicate poin but the dauphin the duke of burgundy and all the princes of the blood declared that it was unbecomin the dignity of the crown of france not to own the the titles of the father devolved immediately upon the son continuation of the life of james ii  lewis approving of a resolution to which he had been of himself inclined resolved to inform the dying king in person of the determination of the council when he arrived at st germains he aquainted first the queen and then her son of his dsign he then approached the bed in which jam lay almost insensible with his disorder when james rouzing himself began to thank his most christian majesty for all his favors the latter interrupted him and said sir what i have done is but a small matter but what i have to say is of the utmost importance the people present began to retire let no person withdraw he said i come to acquaint you sir that when god shall please to call your majesty from this world i shall take your family into my protection and acknowledge your son as then he will certainly be king of great britain and ireland continuation of the life of james ii   who is declared king of great britain and ireland the voice of a divinity could not have made a greater impression on the unfortunate servants of james who were all present than this unexpected declaration from the french king they burst at once into a murmur of applause which seemed to be tinctured with a mixture of grief and joy some threw themselves in silence at his feet others wept aloud all seemed to be so much affected that lewis himself was melted into tears james in a kind of extacy halfraised himself on the bed and endeavored to speak but the confused noise was so great and he so weak that his voice could not be heard the king himself as if unable longer to bear this melancholy scene retired but as he passed through the court of the palace he called the officer of the guard and ordered him to treat the young prince as king whenever his father should expire ibid  though james survived this declaration but one day he sent the earl of middleton to marli to thank his most christian majesty for his kindness to himself and his promised protection to his family upon his death his son was acknowledged by the court and the nation lewis himself visited him in form and treated him with the name of majesty but the adherents of the nominal king chose not to proclaim him with the usual solemnity not knowing how the title of france would be taken by that prince who was the only support of his cause manchester to blathwayte   preparations for war though the marquis de torcy in the name of lewis endeavored to convince the english ambassador the earl of manchester that this transaction was no infringement on the treaty of riswick the insult to william was too flagrant to be borne with patience he accordingly recalled his ambassador from the court of france and sent directions to the lords justices to order poussin the french envoy to quit england preparations for war were in the mean time made on every side the king of denmark ordered the troops stipulated by the treaty of subsidy to march through holstein and hanover toward flanders the dutch entered juliers with a considerable force the french possessed themselves of the towns on the rhine as auxiliaries to the circle of burgundy nothing but the more form of a declaration was now wanting to constitute a war the king of england having determined to take the field early in the spring settled with the united provinces in the capacity of stadtholder the state of the war for the following year he was pressed in the mean time by the emperor to break immediately with france but he had lately suffered so much from the refractoriness of the english commons that he prudently declined to enter upon hostilities without their approbation and aid  king declines in his health and returns but the feeble constitution of william was now become unequal to the great exertions of his mind worn out with vexation as well as with the vigilanc necessary for the management of the affairs of a nation who amidst all their professions of regard were in a great measure averse from his manner of governing his health never settled and vigorous had lo begun apparently to decline the weak state t which he was now reduced had rendered him almo invisible at loo while he was in fact the center rou which the affairs of europe turned but now t alliance into which he had entered and the measure in consequence he was forced to adopt rendered his presence necessary in england having brought to great forwardness a perpetual alliance between the english and the dutch for the recovery and preservation of flanders he embarked on the fourteenth of november and landed the next day at margate in england during the kings absence nothing remarkable happened except the ferment which the transactions of the preceding session had raised between the parties having carried their contests into the press the people as is usual when their passions are inflamed were vehemently agitated between the arguments and declamations of the two great parties the whigs and the tories publications of the times   contests between parties the whigs however more active or more determined than their opponents had the address to turn the opinions of the people to forward their own designs the declaration of the french king for the title of the prince of wales was an incident too favorable to their views to be dropped without being used the vulgar were easily persuaded that those who opposed the measures of the crown in parliament were enemies to the king and they were loud in their complaints against the proceedings and conduct of the house of commons the severity of that assembly to the kentish petitioners their contests with the lords their animadversions on the foreign transactions of government were magnified and introduced as proofs of their attachment to the exiled family the late settlement of the crown in the protestant line the limitations highly favorable to the liberties of the people imposed upon the eventual succession of a foreign family were either entirely forgot or totally misrepresented addresses to william upon the insult offered by france were transmitted to him in holland flattery absurdity and folly as is usual abounded in these unmeaning productions but they served the purpose of the king who had resolved to meet no more a parliament that had already shown so much aversion to the war in which he was now irrecoverably engaged  affairs of the north on the thirteenth of november the parliament was dissolved by proclamation and writs were issued for another to meet at westminster on the thirtieth of december the contests usual in all elections were carried to a height proportionable to the violence and animosity of parties acting on the prejudices of the vulgar noise and tumult filled every corner of england while every state in the north and west of europe were indefatigably preparing to take arms the kingdoms of the east were still engaged in the war which charles the twelfth of sweden had kindled in the preceding year to frustrate the unjust combination of his neighbors against his kingdom the defeat of the russians in the battle of narva had rendered that active and gallant prince a conqueror the more formidable that he seemed eager with new exploits to eclipse the glory of the old his victories in poland were as rapid as the march of his troops the russians were every where routed as soon as seen and the king himself having passed the duna in the sight of the enemy and totally defeated the saxons formed at birzen the resolution of depriving king augustus of the throne of poland hist du nord tom ii   a new parliament the new parliament met on the thirtieth of december and the commons from their first measure seemed to have brought into their house all the animosities which had inflamed their constituents during the election but though every art had been used by the whigs and several tories had in consequence been deprived of their former seats the latter seeme still to form a majority the first trial of the force o the parties was made in the choice of a speaker si thomas littleton nominated by the whigs was rejected on a division and harley abetted by the tories was placed in the chair     against      the king wh favored littleton was deserted in the vote by suc tories as were in his service they preferred the influence of their party to the countenance of a princ whose reign was apparently drawing to its end their conduct however had already been so much resented by the king that he resolved to place his whole confidence in the whigs he dismissed sir charles hedges from the office of secretary of state in which the earl of manchester lately returned from his embassy in france was placed the earl of carlisle supplanted the lord godolphin at the head of the treasury the earl of pembroke supposed to be a whig though he had actually corresponded with king james stuartpapers  was soon after made lord highadmiral of england and the duke of somerset not much more averse to the old cause succeeded pembroke as president of the council  kings speech the commons having presented their speaker the king made a speech to both houses from the throne he promised himself he said that they were met together full of a just sense of the danger of europe and a high resentment of the late proceeding of the french king he expatiated upon the indignity offered to himself and the nation in owning and setting up the pretended prince of wales as king of england and he recommended to them to consider what further effectual means might be used to secure the succession of the crown in the protestant line he complained that the french king by placing his grandson on the throne of spain had furnished himself with the means of oppressing europe and that he had surrounded his neighbors in such a manner that though the name of peace had still continued other states were put to all the inconvenience and expense of war he enlarged on what england had to fear from the power of the house of bourbon and he informed the houses that o obviate the general calamity which threatened christendom he had concluded several alliances acording to the encouragement given him by both houses f parliament he told them that the eyes of europe were turned toward their deliberations and that every thing abroad was at a stand till their resolutions should e known having flattered them with their impornce he demanded supplies from the commons for a great strength at sea and such a strength by land as were expected from the late alliance by the allies he concluded his speech with various arguments for their unanimity and he hoped as he himself was desirous of being the common father of all his people they would on their side lay aside parties divisions and animosities journals dec        0  proceedings of parliament though the two houses were as much as ever divided into parties such was the management of the king and the disposition of the times that they vied with one another to forward the ends proposed in his majestys speech the lords addressed the king in the warmest and most affectionate terms the commons without one dissenting voice voted the supply instead of being offended at the treaty which was to engage the nation in an immediate war they addressed the throne that no peace should be made with france till reparation should be made to the king and the nation for her owning and declaring the pretended prince of wales king of england journals jan  0   0  on the second of january they brought in a bill for the attainder of of that prince they introduced another bill on the ninth for the further security of his majestys person and the succession of the crown in the protestant line jan    the next day they resolved that the proportion of landforces to act in conjunction with the allies should in terms of the treaty be forty thousand men they voted forty thousand seamen for the service of the year but when the common thus gratified the king they were not negligent in their duty to their constituents they regulated the number of soldiers to be employed in every regiment of foot and troop of horse they examined with great exactness the state and condition of the navy the animosity of parties seemed to be lost in an attention to business and when disputes and contest were most to be feared all were unanimous and seemingly composed  the king falls from his horse during proceedings so friendly to the designs of the crown the king himself became sensible that he was not destined in person to carry into execution the great schemes which he had formed he however endeavored to conceal the declining state of his health to accomplish with more facility his favorite views a fortunate coincidence of circumstances had thrown the opinions of the people into the same channel with his own the parties in parliament were so well poised that in a mutual fear of each other they both courted the king the animosities which had always embroiled and embarrassed his measures were suspended and he had the satisfaction to have one glimpse of serenity in the evening of a tempestuous reign to continue a calm so favorable to his scheme of embarking england in the war he spread reports of his recovery but an accident accelerated that dissolution which was apparently advancing though by slow degrees on the twentyfirst of february willing still to continue his usual diversion of hunting he mounted his horse though in a languishing state of health and riding out from kensington toward hampton court the horse fell and in his fall his majesty broke his right collarbone he was carried to hampton court and the bone was set but contrary to advice he returned the same evening in his coach to kensington  his death this accident though it might have hastened the death of william bore for some time no appearance of proving fatal on the twentyeighth of february the gazette declared in express terms that the king was perfectly recovered and on the same day he sent a message to both houses concerning an union between the kingdoms of england and scotland on the first of march the bill for attainting the pretended prince of wales received the royal assent by commission on the second day of that month such symptoms appeared that all hopes of the kings recovery were lost a defluxion fell upon his knee the asthma to which he had been always subject increased he breathed short and he was restless and feverish the two houses in the mean time continued to sit the council was assembled to receive the reports of the physicians but even in that extremity it was maliciously remarked that no englishman of quality had any access to the kings chamber about five in the morning of sunday the eighth of march his majesty received the sacrament from the hands of the archbishop of canterbury and at eight he expired in the arms of one of his pages some papers which might throw considerable light on the history of this prince were with his last breath consigned to the hands of the earl of albemarle and they were probably destroyed by that lord albemarle whose original office was that of a transcriber of letters had been employed in the preceding month on a service of the same kind he had returned on the seventeenth of february from holland with all the secret correspondences which had passed between the king and the pensionary under the supposition that the latter was also dying  reflections though the character given of the prince of orange vol i p      in an early period of his life ran through the whole conduct of king william when he sat on the throne of england some new and striking features were called forth by the extraordinary events which filled his reign his political conduct and the disposition of his mind have been variously and oppositely represented a thing not surprising in a country where writers have not been able to divest themselves of the prejudices and partialities incident to party in such a jarring state of opinions this prince must have been too much praised by the one side and by the other as extravagantly condemned the nearest path to truth must certainly lie between these two extremes but that path though obvious has not hitherto been trod by historians who have uniformly yielded to the prejudices of others or have been swayed by their own their proximity to the period concerning which they wrote may form for many a complete excuse the passions of party came glowing down on the current of the times authors caught the heat of those with whom they themselves were most connected in life and became inadvertently and sometimes designedly partial through a weakness which they unjustly dignified with the name of principle  his person william the third king of great britain and ireland was in his person of a middle size illshaped in his limbs somewhat round in the shoulders lightbrown in the color of his hair and in his complexion the lines of his face were hard and his nose aquiline but a good and penetrating eye threw a kind of light on his countenance which tempered its severity and rendered his harsh features in some measure agreeable though his constitution was weak delicate and infirm he loved the manly exercises of the field and often indulged himself in the pleasures and even sometimes in the excesses of the table in his private character he was frequently harsh passionate and severe with regard to trifles but when the subject rose equal to his mind and in the tumult of battle he was dignified cool and serene though he was apt to form bad impressions which were not easily removed he was neither vindictive in his disposition nor obstinate in his resentment neglected in his education and perhaps destitute by nature of an elegance of mind he had no taste for literature none for the sciences none for the beautiful arts he paid no attention to music he understood no poetry he isregarded learning he encouraged no men of leters no painters no artists of any kind in fortificaon and in the mathematics he had a considerable egree of knowledge though unsuccessful in the eld he understood military operations by land but e neither possessed nor pretended any skill in marime affairs  and private character in the distribution of favors he was cold and indicious in the punishment of crimes often too sy and sometimes too severe he was parsimonious here he should be liberal where he ought to be ring frequently profuse in his temper he was ent and reserved in his address ungraceful and ough not destitute of dissimulation and qualified  intrigue less apt to conceal his passions than his signs these defects rather than vices of the mind combining with an indifference about humouring mankind through their ruling passions rendered him extremely unfit for gaining the affections of the english nation his reign therefore was crowded with mortifications of various kinds the discontented parties among his subjects found no difficulty in estranging the minds of the people from a prince possessed of few talents to make him popular he was trusted perhaps less than he deserved by the most obsequious of his parliaments but it seems upon the whole apparent that the nation adhered to his government more from a fear of the return of his predecessor than from any attachment to his own person or respect for his right to the throne  his public conduct these harsh features of the mind of king william presented themselves only to those who took a near and critical view of his conduct to men who observed him at a distance and as a principal object in the great scale of europe he appeared a respectable a prudent and even a great prince during the last twenty years of his life his abilities by a dextrous management of the events of the times raised him to an influence in christendom scarce ever before carried by a prince beyond the limits of his own dominions peculiarly fortunate in the success of his political measures he obtained his authority through channels the most flattering because the most uncommon he was placed at the head of his native country as the last hopes of her safety from conquest an a foreign yoke he was raised to the throne of great britain under the name of her deliverer from civ tyranny and religious persecution he was considere in the same important light by the rest of europ the empire spain and italy looked up to his councils as their only resource against the exorbita ambition and power of lewis the fourteenth a france herself when she affected to despise his power the most owned his importance by an illiber joy upon a false report of his death    0   reflections on both but if the private character of william has be too critically examined here the praise bestowed  his public conduct ought to terminate though he was brave in action and loved war as an amusement he possessed not the talents of a great general and he was too prodigal of the lives of men though he obtained the name of a deliverer in england and though in fact he might be considered in that light with regard to europe more is owing to his own ambition than to a general love of mankind in holland where he obtained the chief authority in a time of public distress he frequently exercised his power in a manner inconsistent with the rights of a free state davaux  in england he scarce adhered in any thing to the moderate declaration which paved his way to the throne though he obtained the crown by election he showed no disposition to relinquish any of its hereditary ornaments and though he affected to despise royalty no prince was ever more fond of the distinction paid to a king his intrigues to expel his uncle from a throne which he himself intended to mount were by no means suitable with any strict adherence to virtue james ii davaux mss      dalrymples append  to gain to his interest the servants of king james may not have been inconsistent with those allowances generally made for ambitious views but there was a considerable degree of immorality in his being accessory to the suggesting of those unpopular measures which he turned afterward with so much success against that unfortunate as well as imprudent monarch davaux mss       upon the whole if we must allow that king william with all his faults was a great prince it ought also to be admitted that virtue was never an

the death of the late king was made known assembled and unanimously congratulated the queen upon her accession to the privy council who met at the same time she made the customary declaration and ordered all the lords and others who had served the late king in council to take the oaths to herself in the same capacity march   she was proclaimed in the afternoon of the eighth of march with the usual solemnity amidst the applause of the populace the two succeeding days were employed in receiving the addresses of the two houses of parliament the felicitations of the church and the congratulations of the city of london the late king unpopular while he lived was almost forgot as soon as dead and the people with their usual eagerness for novelty turned all their thoughts toward the first measures of the new reign  state of parties though the late king had no reason to be pleased with either of the two parties who had divided between them the nation he had some months before his death thrown himself and his affairs into the hands of the whigs the hopes derived by the tories from the declining state of his health had prevented that violence which they might have otherwise exhibited in parliament on account of their being excluded from power the unanimity in the two houses with regard to foreign affairs proceeded probably from the same cause the whigs could deny nothing to the crown as their leaders were in office and the tories were not averse to a war which they themselves were sure to manage after the expected demise of the king the two parties had pledged themselves too far to retreat from their engagements and therefore though a change of ministry was naturally to be expected from the accession of a princess whom the coldness of her predecessor and the disrespectful conduct of the party now in power had evidently thrown into the arms of the tories there was no reason to apprehend any change in the great line of the measures of government  annes first speech march    the queen in her first speech to parliament furnished a proof that she was led by councils very different from those of her predecessor in the throne though she paid a compliment to his memory in the beginning she concluded with a kind of censure upon his conduct she assured the two houses that as her own heart was entirely english she would agree to every thing that they could either expect or desire for the happiness and prosperity of england the expression manifestly regarded the too great attachment to his own countrymen for which king william had been blamed but to this allusion to the predilection of the late king for foreigners she added words that seemed highly to reflect on his moral conduct in confirmation of her promise to both houses she assured them that they would always find her a strict and religious observer of her word the first part of the queens speech contained the usual assurances of a new reign she agreed she said in sentiments with with the concurrent addresses of the two houses that too much could not be done for the allies to reduce the exorbitant power of france she recommended an union with scotland as necessary for the peace and security of both kingdoms and she desired that the revenue for the support of the civil government should be renewed in a manner suitable to her own honor and the dignity of the crown journals march      0    proceedings of the commons though the queen was at no pains to conceal her attachment to one party the other could not oppose her measures in parliament without deserting their own the eagerness which she discovered to adhere to the measures of king william with regard to foreign affairs would render an opposition to the necessary supplies too inconsistent with the late conduct of the whigs they made a merit therefore of complying with what they could not prevent the commons pursued with a show of unanimity and zeal the affairs recommended from the throne they settle upon her majesty march    during life the revenue possessed by the late king for the support of the civil government they ordered a bill to empower the crown to appoint commissioners to treat for an unio between england and scotland provision had been already made for the eventual expense of a war during the succeeding summer and the queen instead of demanding supplies from the nation found an opportunity of alleviating a part of their burden when she came to the house of lords on the thirtieth of march to give the royal assent to the bill for the establishment of her own revenue she made a speech from the throne calculated to gain popularity she told the two houses that though the funds for the civil list might greatly fall short of what they formerly produced she would give directions that one hundred thousand pounds of her own revenue should be applied to the public service of the year journals march  0   the queen engages to support the allies while anne was rendering herself popular at home she gained the esteem of her allies abroad by showing a warm zeal for their cause two days after the death of william she condoled with the states of the uuited provinces upon that event in a letter she assured them that as she had succeeded the late king in his throne she would also succeed him in the same inclination to a constant union and amity with their republic as well as adherence to the late alliances that she would concur with the allies in general in measures necessary for the preservation of the common liberty of europe in reducing the power of france within proper bounds that she should always look upon the interest of england and those of the states as inseparable and united with such ties as could not be broken without the greatest prejudice to the two nations the earl of marlborough was probably the adviser of measures which he afterward executed with ability the attachment which this nobleman had uniformly shown to the queen when she was little respected by the nation and persecuted by the court had either excited sentiments of gratitude or created principles of obedience to his inclinations in her mind the first honors and even the first considerable office conferred in the present reign were bestowed on the earl march     on the thirteenth of march he received the garter the next day he was appointed captain general of all the forces to be employed by the queen in conjunction with the troops of the allies and the week thereafter he was dispatched to holland in the character of ambassador extraordinary to the states life of marlborough vol i   a ferment without doors the victory obtained by the tories over the whigs by the succession of a sovereign of their own principles to the throne produced a ferment without doors though all things bore a face of harmony and unanimity within violent men of both parties carried their own prejudices with indecent freedom to the press and disgraced their conversation with mutual reflections of the worst and most dangerous kind the whigs were openly accused of aiming at the establishment of a commonwealth by endeavoring to deprive the reigning queen of the succession to the throne the memory of the late king was attacked with open assertions of the same kind though it is highly probable that prince was very indifferent about what person should mount after him the throne an enquiry by the lords into this idle tale produced only a negative proof of its not being founded in fact they voted upon an examination of king williams papers by a committee that nothing appeared that tended to the prejudice of her majesty or her succession to the crown the lords followed this unmeaning vote with animadversions upon injurious reflection printed against the whigs may   the tories in the mean time failed not to annoy their opponents in the same way they procured a vote that a book reflecting on king charles the first was a scandalous an villainous libel that tended to the subversion of monarchy and as such they ordered the book to b burnt by the hands of the common hangman may      a new ministry on the twelsth of april the late king was privately interred and on the twentythird of the sam month the queen was crowned with the usual solemnity at westminster the tory party who a ready governed her councils in private were now admitted without reserve into the public departments of the state the offices of the household were filled with men of high principles for monarchy the lords summers and halifax together with other leaders of the whigs were excluded from the new privy council april    and their places supplied with eminent tories the marquis of normanby remarkable for his attachment to her family was raised to the office of lord privy seal by the queen but the most important promotion of all was that of the lord godolphin to the staff of lord hightreasurer of england though godolphin was well qualified for this important station he owed his office more to the influence of the earl of marlborough than to his own merit the connection which had long subsisted in political views between these two noble persons had been lately more closely cemented by the marriage of the son of the former with the eldest daughter of the latter their private interests being thus united they carried forward with harmony as well as abilities the business of the public  marlborough and godolphin in correspondence with st germains the accession of anne to the crown had removed to a distance the hopes of the court of st germains but they were not entirely quashed till the appointment of her servants though marlborough had been raised by king william in the preceding year to the command of the british troops in flanders he listened after the death of james the second to the solicitations made in favor of the son of that unfortunate prince stuartpapers   0   a kind of principle in favor of the family of stuart had been mixed with this noblemans aversion to william and there is scarce any doubt that had their restoration to the throne suited equally with his own private interest but he would have preferred them to any other race of sovereigns godolphin had been long attached to the same cause though he had promoted the views of the prince of orange he soon changed his opinion with regard to king william he had listened with attention ever since the expulsion of james to all overtures made by the adherents of that prince and upon his death he expressed the same attachment and regard to his so the natural timidity of his disposition prevented hi formerly from making any vigorous exertions in favor of the excluded family and after the demise of william the thing itself became more difficult and besides his own zeal was rendered more cool by the prospect of advantage which he derived from the ne reign  state of opinions with regard to the queens accession the state of opinions had actually changed in england with the

and spain was debated in the privy council the earl of rochester maternal uncle to the queen is said to have proposed that the english nation should only engage in the measures of the allies as auxiliaries and that the chief weight of the war ought to rest on those who had most to fear from the power of france the earl of marlborough who had returned from holland after settling the projected operations with the states declared himself vehement for an immediate declaration of war to be issued by england as a principal the measures taken by himself during an embassy of a few days in holland rendered in some degree necessary the measure which he supported the states upon the assurances made by the queen had agreed to all the proposals of her reputed favorite they had raised him to the chief command of their troops the allies had furnished with alacrity their several quotas and every thing was actually prepared for a vigorous and active campaign a majority of the council yielded either to the influence or reasons of the earl of marlborough their resolutions were communicated the same day to the commons and war was declared in form on the fourth of may  parliament prorogued the commons had agreed to all that the court desired with regard to war before the death of the king they had therefore no opportunity of showing their iberality in that respect to the queen the pubic

different parties to the new queen induced them to overlook an informality in the commission conferred on her consort he was permitted to choose a council for his information and assistance in the execution of his office this circumstance was considered as the creation of a new board a thing not allowable according to the opinion of many but by act of parliament but the respect of the nation

the king unwilling to remand them to a choice of a ne representative though the old parliament had frequently proved refractory he knew that they had ther yielded to the current of the times than to eith their regard to the interests of their constituents  their dislike to his own government besides his sevants had through a long habit and experience dcovered the secret channel to the vote of every member they made such good use of this knowledge that the serment concerning darien had unaccounably subsided at once in the january of   0  and  kind of surly tranquillity prevailed among the peop during that whole year mem of scotland   a great serment the conduct of anne upon her accession to t throne of scotland was by no means calculated to tinguish the discontents which lay lurking in ev corner of that kingdom unwilling to offend  whigs whom her ministers considered as the most powerful party they continued all the servants of her predecessor in the higher departments of the state the joy therefore which her elevation had raised among the discontented soon declined they applied through their leaders for the dissolution of the conventionparliament but they were opposed by the ministers who were afraid to venture upon the new choice of a people already inflamed the queen suffered herself to be persuaded by the arguments of the latter or to be swayed by her own fears she continued the old parliament which was appointed to meet on the ninth of june to add to the discontents of those who called themselves the country party the duke of queensberry highly obnoxious to the people in general was appointed commissioner prior to the meeting of parliament the queen endeavored to allay the bad humor of the malcontents and to sooth the people into an acquiescence with regard to her own measures she wrote a letter as early as the twentyfirst of april to the parliament full of assurances of her protection to the rights of the people and the interest and independence of the kingdom she expressed her regret at the disappointments of the african company she promised her concurrence in every ing for the encouragement of the commerce of the ation in general and for repairing the losses of the dventurers in particular she recommended at the ame time the union between the kingdoms and that e should think the bringing to perfection a measure  salutary the greatest happiness

met at edinurgh the duke of hamilton before her majestys ommission was read rose in his place and protested against their sitting he offered his reasons in a short eech to the house and communicated a paper to e same purpose containing his own protest and that  such members as should adhere to his opinion he immediately went out of the house eighty members following his example seceded at the same time and were received in the streets with the loudest acclamations of the populace who had assembled on this extraordinary occasion the members who remained in the house notwithstanding this great secession considered themselves a legal parliament after the commission and the queens letter were read they adjourned for two days and when they met again on the eleventh of june they appointed the usual committees and proceeded to business overtures were received immediately for various acts of importance one of these declaring the present meeting a legal parliament and discharging all persons from disowning its authority under the penalty of high treason was unanimously passed and touched with the scepter the next day june      an act for settling the crown rejected the dissenting members endeavored in vain to justify their own conduct to the queen though she admitted their messenger the lord blantyre into her presence she absolutely refused to receive their address she signified at the same time to the sitting members that she was resolved to maintain against al opposers their dignity and authority as a legal parliament the session accordingly proceeded with a appearance of vigor amidst all the clamours of the people they granted an immediate supply to the queen they reprimanded the faculty of advocates for declaring that the protest and conduct of the seceded members was founded on the laws of the kingdom they passed an act for enabling the queen  appoint commissioners for an union between the tw kingdoms june     but notwithstanding their unanmity upon these points an overture made by the chancellor the earl of marchmont for the settleme of the crown in the protestant line and for abjuri the pretended prince of wales was rejected t commissioner having received no instructions upon that head from england laid his commands upon marchmont not to proceed but the vehemence  the latter overcame his respect for the authority of the former  causes of that circumstance the queen herself and her english ministers were at the time extremely averse from this measure they had various reasons for wishing to keep the succession open in scotland they wished to retain a check upon the whigs and to awe the family of hannover who from a near prospect of the crown might extend their intrigues to the affairs of the kingdom they favored at the same time the excluded prince besides the regard which anne may be naturally supposed to have entertained for a brother she had given a thousand assurances to her father to do every thing in her power to restore the succession to the ancient channel even before the death of her own son the duke of gloucester the demise of that prince her own despair of progeny her respect for the memory of a father and some affection for her own family had probably rendered her inclined to transfer the crown at her death to the pretended prince of wales her chief minister godolphin and her greatest favorite the earl of

malcontents but though comssioners were appointed for an union between the o kingdoms both parties showed so little inclination to finish that important treaty that the whole fell for the time to the ground the majority of the scots had in their disgust at the conduct of the late king with regard to their commerce forgot those terrors for their religion which had induced them to place the crown on his head the highlanders especially who were never enthusiasts had always suffered their high notions of hereditary right to overcome their attachment to presbytery the accession of anne by bringing the throne nearer to the old stock had established in their minds a kind of certainty that things were to return to their former channel the assurances given by them of supporting upon a proper

feeble state of the latter was balanced by the unprepared condition of the former who except england and holland were not furnished with the means of acting with any vigor the military operations of the season began on the part of the allies with the siege of keyserswaert which the elector of cologn had placed in the hands of the french april     the prince of baden assembled in the mean time an army on the upperrhine to cut off the communication between the country of alsace and landau which he resolved to besiege the french found themselves unable to relieve either of those important places keyserswaert surrendered to the allies after a siege of fiftynine days july     and landau having been gallantly defended for three months fell into the hands of the king of the romans on the tenth of septembe the duke of burgundy having under him the marshall de boufflers made an attempt in vai upon nimeguen june     and the earl of marlborough having taken the command of the allied army in flanders on the second of july was disappointed in all his endeavors to bring the enemy to battle he however reduced venlo sept     ruremonde oct    and the citadel of liege oct     and having thus opened the navigation of the maese and the communication with the town of mastricht put an end with reputation to the campaign on the side of flanders  in italy and on the rhine the principal effort of the emperor was made in italy where prince eugene who commanded his forces was opposed by the combined armies of france and spain eugene as early as the first of february had surprised cremona but he was instantly expelled from the place chiefly by the valor of the irish troops in the french service the marshall de villeroi was however taken by the germans and the command devolved on the duke de vendome the young king of spain took the field in person having left the government in the hands of the queen assisted by a council he had passed into naples and took the nominal command of the army which was actually led by vendome a body of five thousand under the general viscomti were defeated at santa vittoria on the twentysixth of july prince eugene was forced on the first of august to raise the blockcade of mantua and he was in soem degree worsted on the fifteenth of the same month at luzara this advantage obtained by the french in italy was folowed by a victory on the upper rhine the maruis de villars having been detached from the army ommanded by the marshall de catinat defeated he imperialists under the prince of baden though ushed with the conquest of landau to sum the whole of this campaign the french lost the greatest umber of towns and gained most advantages in the eld  operation at sea the operations at sea were less favorable to france and spain than the campaign by land the confederate fleet consisting of fisty ships of the line thirty english and twenty dutch commanded in chief by sir george rook sailed on the first of july from st helens they carried twelve thousand troops on board nine thousand english and three dutch under the command of the duke of ormond detained by calms and contrary winds they arrived not in the neighborhood of cadiz which place they intended to attack till the twelfth of august having landed the troops the duke of ormond took fort st catharine and port st mary which last place was plundered by the licentious soldiery contrary to the intentions and commands of their general after a vain attempt on fort matagorda the troops were reimbarked in the middle of september the confederates steered then their course to vigo where the spanish galleons under the convoy of thirty french ships of war commanded by chateaurenaud were just arrived and having expectedly and almost unperceived come to anchor before the place they resolved to attack it with the utmost vigor  success before vigo the french and spaniards had carried up their vesels beyond a straight defended on the one side by a castle on the other by platforms mounted with cannon together with a strong boom formed of masts cables and chains thrown across the entrance the duke of ormond having landed some troops took the castle oct     vice admiral hopson in the torbay broke through the boom he was followed by the dutch squadron under vandergoes the french admiral perceiving the boom broken the castle and platforms taken the enemy in the same basin with his own squadron ordered his ship to be se on fire his example was followed by all the res but when the enemy were thus employed in destroying their own fleet the english and dutch endeavoure to extinguish the flames six men of war were taken seven sunk and nine burnt of thirteen galleon nine sell into the hands of the confederates and for were destroyed though the greatest part of t treasure on board the galleons had been removed  the enemy the english and dutch made an immense booty and the spanish marine was annihilated from that moment the duke of ormond having thus amply recovered at vigo the laurels he had lost before cadiz returned to england and was received at london with great marks of favor by the queen and with the loud acclamations of the populace  war in poland in poland the war was carried on with vigor between charles the twelfth of sweden and king augustus the first advancing to warsaw with rapid march put a sudden end to the polish diet assembled at that place augustus fled precipitately to cracow whither he was pursued by the swedes the king of poland in the mean time having posted himself advantageously at clissow with thirty thousand men chiefly saxons charles marched toward him and without permitting his troops to rest a moment though much inferior in number attacked routed and put to flight the enemy four thousand saxons lay dead on the field a great number of the poles were also slain two thousand with all the artillery and baggage of king augustus fell into the hands of the swedes cracow though provided with the means of defense surrendered without resistance but an ccident which befell the conqueror stopped his own rogress and encouraged his enemies to renew their fforts having fallen from his horse in marching ut of

du nord tom ii   a new parliament during these transactions abroad the queen made  progress through part of the kingdom she visited xford she spent some time at bath she accepted  an invitation to bristol she was received every where with the marks of public joy indiscriminately bestowed by the populace on all princes but it appeared in the new elections for she had dissolved the parliament on the second of july that from her avowed principles in favor of the highchurch she was extremely popular the toryparty when the votes depended on the free suffrages of the vulgar prevailed the new parliament after two prorogations met at westminster on the twentieth of october and the commons having unanimously chosen mr robert harley for their speaker the queen as usual made a speech to both houses from the throne having expressed her satisfaction at meeting a new parliament she demanded such supplies as might enable her to comply with engagements already made and such others as might be deemed necessary for the encouragement and support of the allies to induce her subjects to bear with cheerfulness the necessary taxes she desired her parliament to inspect all the accounts of receipts and payments and to punish abuses she observed she said with a degree of concern that the funds for the year had in some measure failed and that though she had paid and applied the hundred thousand pounds which she had promised to the last parliament yet that sum had not supplied the deficiency oct      proceedings of the commons the lords congratulated her majesty in general terms upon the success of her arms under the earl of marlborough oct     but the commons showed the principles that prevailed in their house by comparing with advantage the present reign with the last the queen had mentioned in her speech her great concern at the disappointment before cadiz and the commons in their address made light of that misfortune when compared with the wonderful progress of her arms in flanders under the earl of marlborough who had signally retrieved the ancient honor and glory of the english nation this reflecti on the memory of the late king was opposed by the whigs in a manner which showed only the gre superiority of the tories when the house was divided upon the question oct     the same day a supply was unanimously voted for the war the commons resolved on the thirtieth of october that forty thousand seamen should be employed for the service of the next year they voted on the sixth of november nov    that the english proportion of land forces to act in conjunction with the allies should be forty thousand men they granted a supply of eight hundred thousand pounds nov  0  for maintaining these forces three hundred and fifty thousand for the guards and garrisons including five thousand men to be employed by sea and fifty thousand pounds for subsidies to her majestys allies  a dispute between the houses in the midst of this good humor in parliament intelligence of the success before vigo arrived at london the queen acquainted the two houses that she had appointed the twelfth of november as a day of thanksgiving for the signal successes of her arms she accordingly went in person to st pauls on that day nov  attended by the peers and commons a slight dispute between the two houses interrupted for a moment the general harmony and unanimity which seemed to prevail on a complaint made to the commons by sir john packington nov     against the bishop of worcester for an undue interference in the late elections they addressed her majesty to remove that prelate from the office of lord almoner the lords offended at the proceedings of the commons against a member of their body presented a counter address to the queen she however chose to comply with the request of the commons whom she knew to be devoted to her service she had told the lords with a degree of spirit that though she had not yet received by proof of the complaints against the bishop of worcester she considered it as her undoubted right  continue or displace any of her servants at pleasure that prelate was accordingly dismissed immediately om the office of almoner nov     his disgrace proceeded more from the resentment of the highchurch party for his having adhered to their opponents than from any undue influence used in the election for worcester  an eventual pension settled on the prince of denmark the readiness shown by the queen to gratify the commons produced a return of complaisance on the part of that assembly in consequence of a message carried to the house by secretary hedges they resolved that the yearly sum of one hundred thousand pounds should be settled on the prince of denmark should he happen to survive her majesty nov     but to an application made by the queen in favor of the earl of marlborough they paid not the like regard that nobleman having finished with great reputation the campaign in flanders had in the beginning of november quitted the army and resolved to return to the hague having embarked on the maese at mastricht he was taken prisoner by a part of the garrison of guelders the only place now remaining to the french in spanish guelderland the good fortune which had attended the earl in the field did not desert him on the present occasion producing a fictitious pass to the enemy he was dismissed in a few hours without being known and having settled measures with the states he arrived in england in the end of november nov      one refused to marlborough two days nov  after his arrival a committee of the house of commons presented the earl with the thank of that assembly for his great and signal services on the second of december her majesty informed the council that she intended to raise him to the rank of  duke and on the tenth of the same month she sen a message to the commons to request them to settle upon him and his heirs for ever five thousand poun a year which she had granted him out of the pos office during her own life dec  0  the private charater of marlborough notwithstanding the brilliancy  his public transactions was not calculated to ga friends an inordinate love of money had induced hi frequently to stoop to acts of meanness that were  inconsistent with the conduct of a gentleman as they were unworthy of his great talents his political delinquency was at the same time brought to his account by the two great parties which divided the nation the tories had not yet forgot his desertion of his benefactor king james the second and those who favored the revolution remembered to his disadvantage his conduct toward the late king the queens message was received at first with astonishment and silence a violent debate at length arose much was said of the merit of marlborough but the house informed the queen that they could not comply with a precedent to alienate the revenue of the crown dec      his intrigues with st germains the duke foreseeing from the complexion of the debates that their result would be unfavourable prayed the queen to withdraw her message this circumstance however hindered not the commons from presenting their address the tories who now formed a great majority contrived to convey a reflection on the late king in their refusal of a settlement on marlborough they complained that the revenue of the crown had been already too much reduced by the exorbitant grants of the last reign to bear any further alienation the adherents of the excluded branch of the family of stuart seemed to be most inclined to involve marlborough in the censure passed upon king william though he was known to have uniformly opposed the power of that prince he was not deemed sincere in his professions and promises to his rival his zeal it is certain had greatly abated since the accession of anne to the throne he however kept upon fair terms with the court of st germains he endeavored to ascribe to the multiplicity of his affairs that want of attention which actually proceeded from a change of his own views he had throughout the preceding summer expressed frequently a warm attachment to the cause of the pretended prince of wales and as a proof of his zeal he granted passes to the agents of that prince when they wished to transport themselves into france to inform their master of the state of his affairs in england stuartpapers   0   but though he exposed himself to the laws of his country by this conduct he had not the good fortune to satisfy those whom he affected to serve  a motion for resuming king williams grants should a judgment be formed of the principles of the present house of commons from their disposition to animadvert upon the conduct of the late king they might be concluded to have been extremely averse from the change which that prince had made in the succession to the crown the commissioners for public accounts made strict enquiries into the application of the public money in the last reign journals dec  sir edward seymour who had distinguished himself in the debate against marlborough moved for leave to bring in a bill for resuming all grants made in king williams reign and for applying them to the use of the public dec     this motion was carried by a very great majority   0 against     but another made by mr walpole that all grants made in the reign of king james should be resumed passed in the negative the prevailing party consisting chiefly of the landed interest followed their victory with another important motion they procured an order for bringing in a bill to prevent all persons to be members of the house of commons except such as should be found possessed of real estates these motions however seemed rather intended to show the power of the party than meant seriously to be carried into laws the bill of resumption in particular was deemed so severe that it was actually dropped afterward by those who had carried the motion for its being introduced with so high a hand journals  the lords  and the bill for members to possess real estates wa thrown out by the lords feb      0    a bill to prevent occasional conformity while the tories carried every thing in the house of commons their violence was considerably checked by the predominancy of the opposite party in the house of peers the act passed in the first year of william and mary in favor of protestant dissenters had bee always disliked by the highchurch party the influence of the court joined to the zeal of the whigs had prevented any attempt to repeal this act as long as william sat upon the throne but the party who favored the church finding themselves so powerful in the house of commons under a queen who adhered to their principles passed an order on the fourth of november for bringing in a bill to prevent occasinal conformity the bill was accordingly prepared and introduced by mr bromley and mr st john the latter afterward well known under the title of bolingbroke on the ninth of december the bill was a third time read passed and sent to the lords though the latter rejected not the bill they made several amendments to which the commons would not yield a conference between the two houses upon the subject produced nothing but a more firm adherence on both sides to their respective opinions the commons ordered at length feb    their proceedings upon this whole affair to be printed their example was followed by the lords and the bill was dropped    0  a division between the houses the bill to prevent occasional conformity furnished not the only cause of dispute between the two houses the commissioners appointed for the inspection of public accounts proceeding with their enquiries the commons resolved that the lord halifax auditor of the exchequer had been guilty of a breach of trust and great mismanagements in his office the lords having called for the accounts came to a resolution diametrically opposite to that of the commons they voted that the lord halifax had performed the duty of his office as auditor of the exchequer in transmitting the impressed rolls to the queens remembrancer the commons in a conference denied the right of the lords to examine any accounts as they could neither supply deficiencies nor apply any surplusage he grant of all aids being inherently vested in the commons that even in their judicial capacity the lords ould only proceed against mismanagements upon the feb      parliament prorogued the commons equally irritated reduced the arguments advanced by their committee into votes of their house a second conference rather increased than diminished the heats on both sides but a sudden prorogation put an end to the dispute and the session the queen came to the house of lords on the twentyseventh of february and made a speech from the throne she thanked the two houses for the dispatc they had given to the public business she thanke the commons in particular for their great supplies and for their readiness in making a provision for the prince of denmark to gratify the tories and i adherence to her own principles she declared herse strongly in favor of the established church she hoped she said that such of her

lord keeper by her comma prorogued the parliament to the twentysecond  april feb      conduct of the whigs the queen and those who led her councils had some reason to wish for new restrictions on the license assumed by the writers of pamphlets and periodical papers though the whigs on the accession of anne turned their thoughts more to their own danger from their opponents than the possession of power their hopes of regaining the influence which they had lost gradually arose in the house of commons their opposition had been hitherto languid and feeble the prejudices of those without were therefore to be raised to second efforts that might prove successful within the press was employed with great assiduity by the adherents of the party and a people naturally jealous of their rulers began already to catch the flame the new reign however was still too popular to be shaken by aggravated complaints the terrors of the nation for popery had altogether subsided in their knowledge of the queens firm adherence to the protestant religion the war had been carried on with a vigor and a success unknown in the preceding reign and the spirits of mankind being raised by the flourishing aspect of affairs public credit that had languished long was in a great measure restored  queen favors the tories the lowchurch party it ought to be confessed had some reason to wish for a change in the measures of the court with regard to themselves their conduct toward the princess of denmark was neither forgot nor forgiven by queen anne and her resentment had joined with her principles in throwing her completely into the hands of the highchurch party the whigs were in a manner proscribed and debared from office and the power which they still retaind in the house of lords seemed to demand their being xcluded from honors on the ninth of march they ere furnished with a proof that the current of royal vour was set another way to secure a majority in e upper house for the party

proceeding from a design of defeating ultimately the succession of the crown in the family of brunswicklunenburgh a coincidence of circumstances it is certain had thrown the churchparty in some degree into the scale of the excluded branch of the house of stuart they concluded that the more violent whigs were from principle attached to a republican system of government they apprehended that those whom their own ambitious views had joined to that party would either from interest or revenge abet the religious opinions and civil prejudices of the dissenting protestants upon the event of the accession of a foreign prince to the throne besides the attachment to the hereditary descent o the crown when ingrafted on the first principles o the church of england had weighed much with thos who were most zealous for her doctrines the dangers and the apprehensions arising from poperty ha vanished the terrors which had seized the nation on that head at the revolution were ascribed to the arts

abjuration were suggested a abetted by the determined adherents of the pretende prince of wales the first of those bills had failed through the prevalence of the whigparty in the house of lords and the latter through an amendment of the peers became a further security for the succession which it was intended to defeat two clauses were added with such art to the bill that the highchurch party durst not oppose them without endangering their influence with the nation and declaring themselves too precipitately for a measure which time only could gradually accomplish to endeavor either directly or indirectly to defeat the succession as now limited by law was declared high treason and the oath of abjuration a circumstance neglected in the first bill was imposed on the whole irish nation journals of the lords   applications of the court of st germains the court of st germains derived great hopes from the friendly disposition of the english house of commons but they turned their eyes with most attention to the duke of marlborough and the lord godolphin the first by possessing the command of the army might have effectually served their cause had his professions been sincere the latter though timid in his councils was a man of abilities and uniformly attached to the excluded branch of the royal family marlborough whose great influence in the measures of the court was

impracticable in the present disposition of the parliament  so marlborough the servants of the pretended prince at the same time endeavored through marlborough to reconcile the queen herself to their views by applying to her feelings and proposing various expedients they insinuated that considering the justice and piety of anne it was not to be supposed that she would obstruct the eventual succession of her brother a measure which they said she owed to her own glory the memory of her father and her solemn engagements to that prince they affirmed that it was not to be thought she would

the house the open and avowed jacobites were the least dangerous as they made no secret of their real design but the country party as they affected to call themselves consisting of men of more

and informed him that he mself and his party had resolved to move for an act to ratify the late revolution and to confirm the presbyterian system of church government this measure was so contrary to the principles of those who had proposed to grant an immediate supply that the commissioner requested the duke to forbear the latter refused to comply and dexterously insinuated into the mind of queensbury such a jealousy of the growing weight of the duke of hamilton that he deserted at once his own professions and the interests of the countryparty the marquis of tweedale in the mean time made an overture in the house that prior to all other business the parliament should proceed to form conditions of government and regulations in the constitution of the kingdom to take place after the demise of her majesty  act of security the party who endeavored to defeat the supply opposed it with this overture which was likely to command the whole attention of the house on a debate touching the competition between tweedales motion and the consideration of the supply the party who supported the first prevailed the marquis of athol in consequence of the overture offered an act for the security of the kingdom in case of her majestys decease may     this important business filled the greatest part of the session with violent debates it was stipulated by the act that on the twentieth day after the queens decease the estates of parliament should meet and that in the intermediate time the executive government should devolve on such members of the house as should happen to come to edinburgh it was provided that no papists should b members that no englishman or foreigner enjoying a title in scotland and not possessed of one thousand pounds sterling of yearly rent in that kingdom should be

throne  violent debate arose a member urging that h majestys letter to the parliament encouraged the to expect her concurrence in any thing calculated to secure public freedom was answered with a censure by the commissioner the member replied with great asperity and concluded with affirming that nothing could save scotland from slavery but withdrawing herself after the decease of the queen from the dominion of an english prince in an additional clause to the act it was provided that the nomination of a successor was left by the act to the estates of parliament who should assemble after the queens death but it was enacted that the successor to be named should not be the successor to the crown of england unless such conditions of government should be settled in this session of parliament as should secure the honor of the kingdom the independence of the crown the freedom frequency and power of parliaments and the religion liberty and trade of the scottish nation from english or foreign influence printed act   act for the house of hannover fiercely rejected while the house were employed in the act of security several laws of considerable importance were passed with less difficulty on the seventh of june the house proceeded to the consideration of an act offered by the duke of argyle ratifying the parliament which had continued to sit during the whole of the preceding reign several laws with regard to commerce were passed and one to encourage the african and india company toward the end of the session the earl of marchmont presented an act to the house for settling the succession on the family of hannover which was ordered to be read when the clerk came to the paragraph where the princess sophia was menoned by name the house flew at once into a flame ome moved

expressed themselves on the a it was carried by a majority of fiftyseven voice that the very memory of it should be expunged from the minutes of parliament sept     royal assent refused to the act of security the commissioner showing no inclination to touc the act of security with the scepter a motion wa made that the house should address the queen t give the royal assent but this intention was overruled by a suggestion that the commissioner himself should be first questioned whether he had been instructed to pass the act his grace observing an obstinate silence the house flew into a new flame several members proposed new bills of limitations bu the most insisted that the old act should be carried into a law the next day however the commissione told the house that he had received her majesty pleasure and was now fully empowered to give the royal assent to every act excepting only to that called an act for the security of the kingdom h scarce had ended his speech when many member arose and in succession inveighed in the bitteres terms against the servants of the crown who were called perhaps with justice the slaves of the englis ministry and calumniators of the scottish parliament some denied that the right of a negative was inherent in the crown they affirmed that the third ac of the first parliament of charles the second the only act upon which the negative was founded declared indeed that the royal assent was necessary to give the force of a law to a vote of the house but that from thence it could not be inferred that the assent could be refused to an act passed and solemnly offered by parliament mem of scotland   violent heats during these uncommon heats no supply for the support of either the civil or military establishmen had been granted to the crown when the lordtreasurer represented to the house the defenseless state  the kingdom they reminded him of the security denied to the nation by the refusal of the royal assent  an act calculated for that important and necessary purpose no session of parliament ever met in scotland in which more abilities more eloquence and perhaps more violence and animosity were displayed than in the present the whole nation were interested spectators of a contest which they were taught to believe was to determine their independence as a free people or to subject them for ever to those foreign councils to which they had with some reason ascribed the late misfortunes of the kingdom the eagerness of the populace was transfused into parliament when the commissioner proposed that the supply should take place of all other business the opposition stated the vote overture for subsidy or overtures for liberty the commissioner still insisting on his point the earl of roxburgh arose and said that if there was no other way of supporting the natural and undeniable privilege of parliament the friends of their country were resolved to demand justice with swords in their hands a general rage transported the house into a degree of fury the commissioner became apprehensive of the safety of his own person having promised that the overtures for liberty should be the first business of the next session and having touched the bills that were ready with the scepter he suddenly prorogued this refractory parliament sept      observations on the state though the zeal of the jacobite members contributed to increase the flame in the house many not confined to such narrow principles were great promoters of this vehement opposition in parliament they were no strangers to the abject dependence into which their country had fallen ever since their native vereigns had added the weight of the crown of engnd to their prerogative in scotland they perceivd that the distance of the prince himself from a overnment carried on in his name subjected his uncils to the imposition of the ignorant or the art d malice of the designing they saw that the sernts of the crown by resorting to london were her gained by the english ministry to forward eir own views or awed by their influence into a subserviency which when it degraded themselves disgraced and even ruined their country the sovereig himself was even likely upon all occasions to prefer the interests of his more powerful kingdom to the prosperity of a country which from the nature of its soil and climate as well as from the peculiar circumstances of its government had hitherto contributed little either to support his grandeur or to increase his power  of scotland with regard to england the situation of affairs in england had accidentally furnished scotland with the only opportunity the latter ever possessed of emancipating herself from the influence and oppression of the former or of being received into an union of government upon equal and even advantageous terms the english legislature had settled the succession of the crown on the house of hannover king william either careless of the interests of that family or what is more probable indifferent concerning the fate of the crown after his own death had neglected to recommend to a parliament whom a long habit had rendered subservient to his views the settlement of the crown of scotland in the protestant line this circumstance actually left the fate of england in the disposal of the scottish nation should the latter declare for the eventual succession of the prince of wales a title then not illegal in scotland there can scarce any doubt be formed but considering the party which still adhered to the exiled family in england he would have with great facility recovered the crown of that kingdom some men of abilities in the scottish parliament who were by no means attached to the hereditary line perceived this advantage and they seized it with an eagerness proportionable to their zeal for their country  character of the most distinguished among these lovers of their country was andrew fletcher of salton whose warm but manly genius had been improved by an extensive knowledge of books and of men possessed of a mind too daring and independent to bear or even to permit the haughtiness of superiors he uniformly wished for that equality among mankind which speculative patriots hope to find in a republican government to that dignified disposition of soul which abhors whatever is mean he joined a steadiness of mind that no advantage could sway no solicitations move no dangers shake a strict observer of his word devoted to the most rigid laws of honor cautious of giving offense to others as he was resolved to resent even the appearance of insult to himself resolute to a degree of enthusiasm in a manner fiercely brave in his public conduct he was the avowed enemy of all despotism vehement in his love for his country determined to support her independence as necessary to his own dignity in his private life he avoided vice on account of its meanness he adhered without deviation to virtue as essential to his own pride  fletcher of salton his peculiar opinions on the subject of government suiting ill with the despotic maxims adopted in scotland during the reign of charles the second he opposed the ministry and was persecuted in return to avoid the malice of his enemies he forsook his country but being summoned in his absence before the privy council he was so much enraged at the injustice of those in power that he embarked in the cause of the duke of monmouth and accompanied that unfortunate nobleman when he invaded england having been outlawed upon this occasion he retired to holland and came over with the prince of orange whose declarations were favorable to those political principles to which he had invariably adhered he soon perceived what he might have foreseen that the possession of the crown of england was the chief object of the expedition fletcher therefore left king william when that prince seemed to desert the principles upon which he came and he afterward opposed him with  vehemence suitable to that disappointment having een chosen a member of the new parliament which et in the may of the present year he found an oportunity for exerting his talents and for exhibiting his rinciples though an enemy to monarchy he enertained such an aversion to english influence and an nion that he adhered to the country party and would ven have supported the succession of the exiled family rather than yield to measures which he deemed destructive to the honor and independence of his country lockharts mem   affairs of ireland the affairs of ireland had for several years remained in that state of tranquillity and want of importance which attends dependent governments when carried forward with any degree of attention and precision the earl of rochester whom king william had placed in the office of lord lieutenant resigned his commistion through some disgust soon after the accession of his niece to the throne of england he was succeeded in the government by the duke of ormond a name popular in ireland on account of his family in a parliament which met in the autumn of the present year a great unanimity appeared in favor of the measures of the queen they granted a supply to her majesty to make up the deficiency of the revenue and to support the necessary branches of the establishment for two years ending at michaelmas   0  in examining the public accounts the commons found that more than one hundred thousand pounds had by misrepresentation beer charged unjustly as a debt on the nation and they ordered a committee to examine into the cause of this intended fraud on the public  proceedings of parliament in a representation to the lord lieutenant the commons complained with reason of the proceedings o the trustees appointed by the parliament of england for managing and selling the forfeited estates in ireland that had been resumed for the use of the public they averred that the charges incurred by the subjects of that kingdom in defending such just right and titles as had been allowed by the trustees ha exceeded in value the current cash of ireland they complained that the state of trade at home was s low that many protestant families had been constrained to remove to other kingdoms especially to scotland while foreign commerce and its returns were under such restrictions as rendered them altogethe unprofitable they affirmed that many civil officer were arrived at such a pitch of corruption through the hopes of impunity that vast estates were acquired by them in a short time in a poor country that others neglecting their personal attendance in the country made sinecures of their employments and drained the kingdom of its money which they spent in other lands having insinuated that nothing but frequent parliaments could either prevent or reform those evils they concluded with the warmest and most affectionate wishes for the happiness of her majesty and the long continuance of her reign over ireland the lord lieutenant

to enter tyrol at once to open the communication with the french army in italy and to stop the common passage of the imperial reinforcements to their troops in that country the duke de vendome who commanded the french forces in italy endeavored on his side to enter tyrol to join the elector had this project succeeded it might have ruined the emperors affairs but the valor of the peasants of tyrol the conduct of some imperial detachments placed in that country and the want of concert between the french and bavarians defeated the only measure which seemed calculated to support the affairs of the house of bourbon on that side  operations in swabia and italy the duke de vendome having despaired of joining the bavarians and being recalled to italy by the open defection of the duke of

harm at sea besides the loss sustained by private persons sixteen ships of the royal navy were cast away the damage done in london and westminster alone was estimated at a million sterling but as the calamity was not universal the country suffered not in the same proportion the commons addressed her majesty upon the occasion they told her that they could not see a diminution of her navy without

debates on that subject a circumstance arose that greatly contributed to the victory which the former party obtained the queen acquainted the two houses on the seventeenth of december   0   that she had received unquestionable informations of designs carried on against her government in scotland by the agents and emissaries of france the two houses received differently this intelligence the lords led by some whigs of ability and eagerness grasped at every thing calculated to raise the jealousy of the nation against the tories the majority of the commons being composed of the latter party

have given various and opposite accounts of an affair too frivolous to command the attention of the public had not the minds of mankind been previously inslamed by the animosities subsisting between two powerful factions  character of simon fraser the principal actor in this political piece and perhaps its author was captain simon fraser afterward well known to the world by the title of lord lovat born with insinuating talents but rather forward than agreeable in his address he exerted his whole force upon mankind through the channel of their vanity his flattery though too obvious to escape even the observation of the weak was too strong to be resisted entirely by men of sense he seemed so eager in bestowing praise that those who approved the least of his manner ascribed his adulation to his want of judgment with regard to others more than to his own designs destitute of principle and despising veracity as useless he accommodated all his actions to his immediate interest and all his words to the purpose of deceiving the credulous into his views habituated through time to this abandoned conduct he became in a manner incapable of deviating from it and thus his profligacy by being generally known carried its own antidote in itself in the execution of his own projects though generally formed with little judgment he was bold and fearless he neither understood those laid by others nor pursued then either with spirit or with attention though unsteady in his disposition and hourly varying his schemes he never swerved from the great line of selfinterest and thus notwithstanding his natural levity and inconstancy he succeeded by perseverance  his crimes some actions that brought upon fraser the highest animadversion of the laws in scotland had made him famou in that kingdom before his intrigues attracted the notice  the parliament of england being descended though a some distance from the family of the lord lovat chi of the clan of frasers in the

simon fraser entered with an armed force the house of the widow of the lord lovat seized her person ordered the marriage ceremony to be pronounced in the midst of the sound of a bagpipe with which he endeavored to drown the ladys cries and having stripped her naked by cutting off her stays with his dagger forced her to bed and consummated the pretended marriage amidst the noise and riot of his

him into his presence lockharts mem stuartpapers  despairing of success with the abdicated family he resolved to assume the merit of betraying their councils to the reigning prince in consideration of present or promised services he obtained through the means of the noted carstares one of king williams chaplains and a kind of favorite a pardon of his rebellion and other public crimes the rape upon the widow of the lord lovat not being mentioned in the pardon fraser was prosecuted for that crime by the lady and her friends he was forced again to retire to france in the year   0  but not perhaps without instructions for his conduct in that kingdom from mr carstares and men of great rank of the same party the duke of argyle in particular was his patron and friend from an hereditary feud between his family and that of athol which last on account of the rape were the enemies of fraser  flies again to france the earl of middleton who then possessed the most credit at st germains had adopted the bad opinion entertained by the late king james of the character of fraser the latter therefore applied to queen mary through sir john maclean and as that unfortunate princess grasped at every vain hope held forth to her son she treated fraser with kindness and recommended him to the popes nuncio stuartpapers  having gained the confidence of that prelate by reconciling himself to the church of rome he was introduced by him to the marquis de torcy as a person that promised to be serviceable to the views of the court of france lewis the fourteenth himself is said to have had an interview with fraser but either distrusting his incredible promises with regard to an insurrection in scotland or unwilling to hazard either his men or money without further security he made him a present of five hundred louis dors and desired him to return to his own country to bring credentials from those persons over whom he pretended to have so much power but as the king could not altogether rely upon the credentials procured by such an unknown adventurer he first resolved to send along with him a frenchman the sending of a frenchman to scotland lying under insuperable objections lewis found himself obliged to apply to the court of st germains for a suitable person a native of that kingdom  returns and is made use of by queensberry the request of the french king

gentleman arrived in london he directed his course to scotland and was met on the borders of that kingdom by the duke of argyle he was from thence conducted by that nobleman to the duke of queensberry who held as commissioner a parliament at edinburgh the commissioner having deserted the jacobite faction in the house to whom he had vowed fidelity perceived that by their joining with the country party they possessed the power as well as the inclination of being revenged he therefore grasped with eagerness at the informations which fraser either from vanity or malice gave against his enemies he knew that even to fix a suspicion of a correspondence with france upon the leaders of opposition would not only ruin their credit with government but destroy their influence with the nation to enable fraser to execute his instructions with facility and freedom he granted him a pass to secure him from being seized in obedience to the letters of fire and sword which had been issued against him on account of the rape lockharts mem   goes over to france to procure proof fraser finding such a powerful support in queensberry resolved in serving his patron to gratify his own revenge having

enemy the duke of athol stuartpapers   0   the commissioner having conceived an aversion to the lord tarbat lately created earl of cromarty fraser dexterously contrived to ascribe the declaration of indemnity obtained in the preceding year from queen anne to his lordships correspondence with the court of st germains the duke of hamiltons principles were already known but no accusation of consequence could be carried home to him on the present occasion fraser in the mean time was permitted  roam through the highlands to endeavor to extort omises from the chiefs to rise in arms for the pretended prince of wales his success was not equal either to his romises or the expectations of his patron when the parliament of scotland was adjourned on the sixteenth of september he repaired to london and his allegations not amounting to a sufficient proof he was provided with money and a pass under a borrowed name by the duke of queensberry who applied for that purpose to the earl of nottingham secretary of state with the pass he transported himself safely to holland and from thence found means to convey himself again to paris his design was to procure such letters to queensberrys

always doubted the honesty of fraser was convinced of the imposture he amused him however with cold but polite letters while at the same time he wrote to the marquis de torcy expressing his doubts concerning his fidelity and signifying his wishes that he might be secured captain james murray who had been sent to scotland to discover the truth of frasers interest and connections in that kingdom returned in the mean time to st germains the accounts which he gave of the state of the country and operations of fraser were so diametrically opposite to that presented by the latter to the exiled queen that no doubts remained of his treachery repeated intelligence from england of the discoveries made by the parliament and privy council strengthened the proof to such a degree that fraser after having amused middleton with a series of letters concerning his own importance his influence in scotland and his loyalty to the excluded family was thrown at length into the bastille ibid    by

more experienced plotter the latter perceiving his character suspected his integrity understanding at the same time from fraser himself that he was often in conference with the ministry of scotland and having seen the pass which he had obtained from the earl of nottingham through the influence of the duke of queensberry he wrote his suspicions to the duke of athol one of the noblemen accused the

her majestys hands and in a most extraordinary manner taken the examination which belonged to the queen and council solely to themselves the plot from this moment became obviously a topic of animosity and dispute between the whigs and tories but the heats between the parties were not sufficient to keep long depending this matter especially on an evidence which could carry home no wellgrounded charge of treason to any particular person the curiosity and fears of the nation were soon dissipated and the whole affair sunk into the oblivion which it deserved journals of both houses   disputes

white mayor of ailesbury for refusing to admit his vote in the election of members to serve for that borough in parliament the cause was carried by appeal before the house of peers where judgment was given in favor of ashby the interference of the lords in matters of election threw the commons already offended into a violent flame they asserted their exclusive right to the sole cognizance of all matters concerning elections and their votes were answered by counter resolutions of the lords to put an end to disputes which seemed daily to increase through the inveterate animosity between the parties the queen closed the session on the third of april with a speech from the throne having thanked the commons for their large supplies she recommended that unanimity between the house which had

those at blenheim to fall upon the rear of the enemy when they should pass the brook and so place them between two fires such was the situation of the french on the morning of the thirteenth of august

a considerable time against the english foot but the duke in the mean time having charged home with his horse the french cavalry already wavering drove them in their flight into the danube and most of those who had escaped the sword were drowned in that river the ten battalions of the enemys foot were at the same time charged on all sides and cut to pieces prince eugene who commanded on the right had attacked the elector of bavaria and the marshall de marsin the prince however could make no impression on their line but when they perceived that tallard was defeated they threw themselves into three columns and quitted the field with great dexterity and expedition had they now fallen on the flank of marlborough whose troops were employed in pillaging the camp of tallard the victory might have been recovered or at least the troops stationed in the two villages might have been saved those at aberclaw found means to escape in the confusion but the twentyeight battalions of foot and

in their own cause they had long observed that neither the duke nor the lordtreasurer had ever yet even in appearance renounced the pretensions of the prince of wales their object therefore was to gain the duke to the protestant succession by a marriage between his daughter and the electoral prince but this with other schemes of the like kind were dropped as difficult and uncertain sir rowland

compliance with her promise to the house of peers made no secret of her design to propose to the parliament of scotland the settlement of the crown of that kingdom on the house of hannover to pave the way for this important business some changes were made in the administration the duke of queensberry who had rendered himself obnoxious by his patronage of frarer and the plot was dismissed to soften

of parties prior to the meeting of that assembly the different factions used every art to strengthen themselves by gaining their opponents the duke of hamilton considered as the head of the jacobites associated himself with the countryparty and sent a deputation of their number to london to oppose the designs and influence of his mortal enemy the duke of queensberry the persons chosen for this kind of embassy were the earls of rothes and roxburgh together with baillie of jerviswood men less attached to the principles of their party than to their own private interest having arrived at london and joined their efforts with the duke of athol the accomplished the dismission of queensberry but contrary to the intention of their confederates the jacobites they promised in return to the english ministry to support in parliament the succession of the house of hannover the duke of hamilton and his party though not ignorant of the designs of their agents resolved to pursue with undeviating perseverance their own they affected to appear ignorant of the agreement made between the members of the deputation and the court of england while at the same time they gained the adherents o the duke

affairs the parliament met at edinburgh on the sixth of july the queen recommended in her letter unanimity of councils and the settlement of the succession in the protestant line and demanded an immediate supply for maintaining the civil and military establishments of the kingdom the commissioner the chancellor and the earl of cromarty now sole secretary of state supported as usual the demands of the queen in a succession of formal speeches their eloquence produced so little effect on the house that they scarce had finished when a motion was made that the house without naming a successor should stand by and defend her majestys person and government but that the house should agree on such conditions and limitations to take effect after the queens death as should effectually defend scotland against all english influence the house adjourning without debate on the motion the duke of hamilton made an overture on the thirteenth of july that the parliament should not proceed to name a successor to the crown until the scots should conclude a treaty with england in relation to commerce and other important concerns when a motion was made for resuming the consideration of the overture july     mr fletcher of salton laid in a pathetic manner before the house the miseries and hardships which the scots had suffered since the union of the two crowns and the impossibility of mending their condition without preventing the continuance of the same menoirs of scotland   act of security receives the royal assent the eagerness with which these motions were received convinced the courtparty that the project for settling the succession was ill timed to allay the ferment which had prevailed in the nation ever since the queen refused her assent to the act of security her english ministers had advised her to gratify the scots upon that subject besides the opposition had resolved that till the act of security should receive the royal assent no supply should be granted an act in substance the same with that which had passed the house the preceding year was read for the first time on the twentyfifth of july and on the fifth of august it was touched with the scepter though the duke of hamilton was in close correspondence with the court of st germains some of the adherents of the excluded family had formed a suspicion of his having views of his own on the crown the act of security they said chiefly carried by his zeal and industry contained a clause which pointed out the duke himself for the throne of scotland a provision was made that the successor should be a protestant and of the royal line of scotland but that the person appointed should not be at the same time successor to the crown of england next the family of hannover who were in a manner excluded by the clause the duke of hamilton himself was the nearest protestant of the royal line being lineally descended by a daughter from the first branch of the house of stuart who reigned in scotland  parliament prorogued though the adherents of the excluded family had gained to their own cause the votes of the adherents of the duke of queensberry with a promise that the plot which had made so much noise in england in the preceding year should not be discussed in parliament it was brought into debate by the lord belhaven august    in a digression from the subject of his speech his lordship gave a full account of the proceedings in the english house of peers concerning that supposed conspiracy this circumstance induced mr fletcher of salton to present a resolve to the house which he desired might be read and voted the purport of this overture was that the english house of lords by their examination of the plot and by addressing the queen in relation to a successor to the crown of scotland had unduely interfered with the concerns of scotlmen and had encroached upon the honor sovereignty and independency of the nation this motion was opposed with great warmth by the court party and even by many who had hitherto been considered as members of the country party the thing itself was however too popular not to pass the carrying of this resolution and another for addressing the queen for laying before the house the evidence and papers relating to the plot finished the business of the session which was closed by a prorogation on the twentyseventh of august proceedings of the scot parl   reflections the refractory disposition of the parliament of scotland alarmed the favorers of the protestant succession in england though the minister the lord godolphin was by no means of that number the natural timidity of his disposition rendered him in some measure averse from a conduct which he secretly approved he perceived that things could not long remain in their present unsettled condition and to prevent a crisis of affairs which he had not courage to encounter he deserted his principles there is no reason to believe that he privately encouraged the malcontents in scotland to reject the proposal for settling the crown in the house of hannover but he had not yet opened that scene of corruption which afterward quieted the turbulence of the scots and which was perhaps necessary for the peace and safety of the two kingdoms the duke of hamilton who knew the principles of godolphin expressed his own fears of his want of courage stuartpapers   0   he supposed before the parliament of scotland met that many of the members were to be gained with money by the lordtreasurer of england and to meet him in the line of corruption he demanded a large sum   000l from france for the purpose of purchasing votes stuartpapers   0    secret negociations and though the duke of hamilton was unjustly accused in frasers plot as being privy to a descent from france in the preceding summer he had in the present year seriously advised that measure should matters come to a rupture between the parliament of scotland and the english ministry he sent a message to the court of st germains recommending that a force should be held ready on the coast for an emergency he assured the exiled family that their party in scotland in conjunction with those who adhered to the independence of their country were resolved rather than submit to the succession of the house of hannover to throw every thing into confusion and leave the decision of the contest to the sword he gave it as his opinion that five thousand men would be sufficient to reestablish the excluded line on the throne of scotland and eventually to raise them to the sovereignty of england but before any descent should be attempted he desired to be informed concerning the views and promises of the adherents of the excluded prince in the latter kingdom as the force necessary for a successful invasion ought to be greater or smaller in proportion to the quality and number of his english friends the marquis of montrose the earls of errol marshal breadalbin and panmure the viscount stormont the lord balmarino the deprived bishops and many of the chiefs of the highland clans expressed the same inclinations and adhered to the same sentiments with the duke of hamilton stuart papers   0    intrigues of the exiled family the victory obtained in parliament over the proposals of the english ministry and the condescension of the queen in giving the royal assent to the act of security prevented that rupture for which hamilton signified his inclination to be prepared the ministers of the excluded prince were however either incapable or unwilling to obtain from the court of france an armament for the invasion of scotland and they made therefore their application for a descent in england on the twentysecond of june a memorial for that purpose was presented to the marquisses de torcy and de chamillart they signified to those ministers that an attempt on england would be less impracticable and more decisive than to carry the war into scotland though the majority in that kingdom were in the interest of the exiled family they averred with reason that the possession of england would insure the submission of ireland and scotland and that the former was now destitute of troops or only left under the protection of a few guards and some new levies dispersed over the face of the country they represented that the month of march was the most proper time for a descent before the supplies were levied o the fleet armed they concluded with affirming tha nothing then should remain to oppose their master but  weak princess a timid minister and a mercenary general who would make a merit of fulfilling their forme promises to ensure their own interest and safety ibid   parliament of england meets during the ideal projects formed between the court of st germains and their adherents in scotland the parliament of england met at westminster on the twentyfourth of october the queen having expatiated on the great and remarkable success of the campaign informed her parliament that she assured herself they were all disposed to provide for every thing necessary to prosecute with vigor and effect the war she insinuated that nothing was more obvious than that a timely improvement of the present advantages would enable them to procure a lasting foundation of security for england and a firm support for the liberty of europe to accomplish these desirable ends she demanded a supply from the commons she told them that she believed they would find some charges necessary in the succeeding year which were not mentioned in the last and that some extraordinary expenses had been incurred for which no provision had been made having assured the two houses of her confidence in their affection and her own unalterable love for her people she earnestly recommended

liberal in furnishing the supplies the whole business was carried forward with such harmony cheerfulness and facility that on the ninth of december all the moneybills received the royal assent the

the lordtreasurerer though a tory himself and even a jacobite had permitted a caution which his enemies called timidity to supersede his principles in the arrangement made in the departments of government at the close of the last session of parliament to trim between the two great parties who divided between them the nation he had placed moderate whigs in places possessed by violent tories he had the misfortune to lose the latter and not to gain the former the possession of power under the specious name of a difference in opinion had long been the motive of contest between these factions and their mutual animosities had ascended to a height that disdained a divided authority in the kingdom the trimming whigs admitted by godolphin into office had promised to manage both parties by playing their prejudices against one another this conduct to make it succeed required the utmost dexterity and address though the parties were so poized that the weight of government could give to either side at pleasure the victory their contests especially in their present inflamed state were certain of embarrassing if not capable of entirely obstructing the public business  bill against occasional conformity deserted friends became frequently through pride the fiercest enemies the tories though as much offended with marlborough as with godolphin resolved to attack only the latter as the high reputation obtained by the former had rendered him an object too great to be assailed the bill against occasional conformity which had been twice lost before in the house of lords was again introduced by the church party into the house of commons nov     to embarrass the ministry and to distress the whigs who abetted the dissenters a motion was made for tacking the bill to the land tax bill the house of lords having no power to alter any moneybill but either to pass it entire or reject the whole that assembly would either have been obliged to agree to the bill or to put an end to the war which depended on the supplies the ministry especially secretary harley himself a dissenter procured by his own address and the weight of government a majority in the lower house against the motion nov     the bill however was passed by the commons without being tacked but again it was thrown out by the lords this new disappointment increased the animosity of the tories against the lord godolphin as they ascribed their defeat in a favorite project to the weight which he had thrown into the hands of the opposite party  conduct of parties the two parties during the remainder of this session of parliament seemed to have made an exchange of principles could a judgment of their private views be formed from their public conduct when the act of security which had been passed in scotland in the preceding summer came to be debated in the parliament of england the whigs and tories complained against it with equal warmth the first endeavored to derive advantage from a circumstance so favorable to their avowed principles the latter pretended from the like motives to guard against its consequences the tories in their arguments in the house of commons urged that the passing the act of security tended to defeat the succession in the house of hannover but when this proposition was reduced into a motion it was rejected by the whigs though they had professed themselves the only friends of the descent of the crown in the protestant line the two parties however agreed that some vigorous efforts must be taken in england to obviate the dangers arising from the proceedings in scotland the violent on both sides were however wellpleased at bottom with measures which seemed equally calculated to promote their respective views the republican part of the whigs looked upon the act of security as highly favorable to their own principles and the warm jacobites among the tories considered the exclusion of the house of hannover as a great step toward the restoration of the excluded branch of the family of stuart  proceedings of parliament the house of lords were the first who entered into ebate on the means of obviating the inconveniences which were likely to arise from the acts passed in the receding summer in scotland they resolved on the venth of december that no scotsmen not residing in ngland and ireland should enjoy the privileges of englishmen until an union should be made or the succession settled as in england that the bringing in of cattle from scotland should be prevented that her majestys ships should be ordered to seize

these resolutions ordered the judges to reduce them into bills an act for appointing commissioners for treating with the scots concerning an entire union was read a third time on the twentieth of december and sent down to the commons for their concurrence the lords a few days before had addressed her majesty to put the town of newcastle in a state of defense to secure the port of tinmouth and

stationed on the borders toward scotland and in the northern parts of ireland ibid dec     concerning the scottish act of security the bill formed by the lords upon their own resolutions was rejected

of february   0  sent it to the lords who returned it four days after without any amendment though the commons found themselves under a kind of necessity to pass a bill expressive of their jealousy of

services in the name of the lords by the lord keeper sir nathan wright the commons at the same time ordered a committee of their body to wait upon him with their thanks for the success of his late negociations in the cabinet as well as for his victories in the field dec     they followed these expressions of respect with more solid marks of their favor   0  having appointed a day for

her attachment to the court of st germains and her knowledge of the dukes connexions with the servants of the prince of wales encouraged her to remind him of his former promises and to suggest her expectations from his future services he answered her in general terms but when she urged him to agree on particulars he solemnly assured her that without descending to circumstances or fixing the time he would do every thing which honor and justice demanded at his hands stuartpapers jan     0   the lord godolphin himself though proscribed by the tories as affecting the principles and views of

an opportunity to pay a part at least of the arrears of the jointure due to the exiled queen ibid   yet favors the whigs notwithstanding this appearance of their favoring secretly the views of the excluded family marlborough and godolphin in their public conduct seemed willing to break with the tories who were deemed the enemies of the succession in the protestant line though sir george rooke

borough of aylesbury brought their actions against william white the mayor of that corporation for having refused to receive their votes in the election of members to serve in parliament the commons ordered these men to be committed to newgate for a breach of privilege but the prisoners brought their habeas corpus into the court of queens bench and provided themselves with council who pleaded upon various grounds that they ought to be discharged the lord chief justice holt who presided on the bench was of the same opinion declaring that neither house of parliament nor both jointly without the concurrence of the sovereign have any power or right to dispose of the liberty or the property of the subject he affirmed admitting that the commons possessed a right of punishing persons with imprisonment for a breach of privilege that commencing of a suit was no breach of that kind that a just cause of action grounded on the common law could not be construed into a contempt without

severity and terror to remove the prisoners from newgate the house of lords proceeding in the mean time on the petition for the writs of error came to several important resolutions they voted that neither house of parliament had any power to create new privileges inconsistent with the known laws and customs of parliament that every subject of england who thinks himself injured has a right to seek redress by an action at law and that the house of commons in committing the men of aylesbury had entrenched on the constitution of the kingdom by pretending to give to their own declaration the force of an established law printed case   march counterresolutions of the commons to these resolutions against the commons the lords added others declaratory of the general rights of the people they resolved that every englishman who is imprisoned by any authority whatsoever has a right to apply for and obtain his habeas corpus and that the commons in encroaching by their ammadversions on that undoubted right had made a breach on the statutes provided for the liberty of the subject the lords followed these resolutions with two writs of habeas corpus returnable before the lord keeper in

now the treasurers head in a bag the expression was coarse but it had all its weight with the minister the lord haversham represented to him his danger in a set speech in the house of lords to save himself from their resentment he made great advances to the party during the session and when it was closed in the middle of march he performed his engagements by admitting some into office and opening to others a prospect of preferment the duke of newcastle though during the late reign secretly in the interest of the excluded family and in correspondence with the court of st germains stuartpapers       was considered by the nation as one of the principal leaders of the whigs and as such he was raised march    to the office of lordprivyseal vacant by the dismission of the duke of buckingham who was known to adhere to the principles of the tories some other changes of less importance convinced the latter that the current of preferment ran in a channel very different from their own  parliament dissolved the whigs now favored by the court were soon after furnished with an opportunity of securing to themselves effectually the advantage which they had extorted from godolphins fears the present parliament in consequence of the triennial act being near expiring the queen to preserve the ancient prerogatives of the crown chose to dissolve it by proclamation on the fifth of april the tumult clamor and confusion that commonly attend general elections were now raised to an unusual height by the contests and animosities between the parties the whigs more active than their antagonists applied themselves to the prejudices of the vulgar they had the art to render the tories odious where the returns depended on the humors of the populace and having the countenance of government together with the moneyed interest on their side they were enabled to awe the timid and to gain the venal besides the principles which they held forth to the public were better qualified than those of their opponents to gain the independent part of mankind as they flattered their pride the result of the whole was that the elections in general went in favor of the whigs especially in boroughs and thus the tories found themselves at once divested of a power which they had neither the courage to exert with spirit burnet vol iv  nor the prudence to use with moderation  campaign of   0  during these domestic transactions the war was carried on abroad with a degree of ardour the duke of marlborough arrived in holland in the beginning of april and having concerted the operations of the campaign with the states took the field in the first week in may his great object was to improve the victories of the preceding campaign by carrying the war by the moselle into the heart of france with the same number of troops as in the last year he marched through the country of limbourg and being joined near treves by the prince of hesse he crossed the moselle and the saar marched to the defile of taveren and advanced to elst the french apprized of the designs of marlborough had assembled an army of seventy thousand men on that side under the command of the marshall de villars who occupying a strong camp at sirk resolved to remain on the defensive the prince of baden who commanded the imperialists either from a personal dislike to marlborough or unprovided with the means of taking the field disappointed him in his promise of joining the allies with the german troops and thus the duke remained inactive in his camp for the space of a month in daily hopes of a reinforcement that never arrived hist dallemagne tom vii   death of the empeor the death of the emperor leopold which happened on the sixth of may changed in nothing the face of affairs that prince born with a degree of virtue was destitute of talents the apparent line of ambition which passed through his whole conduct was rather the disposition of his court than any passion of his own his son who had been several years before created king of the romans succeeded him in the imperial dignity that prince inherited his fathers ministers as well as his dominions and the same counsels continued to act under the name of joseph that had uniformly prevailed in the reign of leopold the succession to the spanish throne the increase of the imperial power on the ruins of the authority of the german princes and the reduction of the insurgents in hungary were the principal objects of the present as well as of the late emperor but joseph was better calculated than his father to succeed in these views his mind was active and full of fire his disposition vehement his character enterprising and to an industry which ran violently from one scheme to another he added a firmness of soul that disdained to yield either to accident or misfortune  slow meafares of the german the new emperor however was incapable of infusing his own fire into the sluggish germanic body already languishing for repose destitute of resources at home he could not even animate into action his hereditary troops or furnish his part of the strength employed by the allies against the common enemy this inability in the court of vienna combining with the envious and obstinate disposition of the prince of baden forced marlborough to abanden his designs of carrying the war into france by the course of the moselle during the time that general remained at dellt the french under the elector of bavaria and the marshall de villeroi had taken hui june  and were on their march to liege the states alarmed at the progress of the enemy requested the duke to quit the moselle and to hasten back to their aid on the side of flanders having decamped in the night he repassed the dangerous defile of taveren without being molested and directing his march toward liege joined the dutch under auverquerque which induced the enemy to retire beyond their lines hui was retaken on the twelfth of july and the duke resolved to retrieve with some enterprise of consequence the glory lost by the prior inactivity of the campaign  of marlborough   marlborough forces the french lines to accomplish his purpose he formed a scheme of forcing the french lines and encamped within a league of the enemy the elector and the marshall de villeroi perceiving the design of the allies drew their armies together leaving only small detachments to dsend the lines on either side the mehaigne ran about half a league on the right on the left they had two barriers for the convenience of the people of the country at the distance of three leagues on the seventeenth of july n s the duke commanded the dutch to march toward the mehaigne by way of a feint while at the same time he ordered ten thousand men to form on his right and to lie down there on their arms when it grew dark this body marched toward the barriers they were aollowed close by the army under marlborough and the dutch facing about hastened the same way the elector of bavaria at length apprized of the dukes design ordered the left wing of his cavalry to march to prevent the allies from passing the barriers he himself followed with the infantry but the enemy had already formed within the lines after a fierce shock between the duke and the bavarian infantry the latter were obliged to give way but ten battalions throwing themselves into a hollow square marched off in spite of the cavalry of the allies and protected as they retreated their flying friends hist de france kanes mem  the french and bavarians having after the action retired behind the dyle the rest of the

hombourg surrendered on the twentysixth of the same month to the marquis de conflans but the marshall enfeebled by detachments was however unable to defend the lines of haguenau against the prince of baden who though he could not on account of the advanced season recover hombourg found means to extend his quarters into the enemys country on the side of germany the campaign could not be said to have been unfavourable for france in italy their arms were in general attended with success villafranca fell into their hands in march march    the town and port of nice was taken on the ninth of april the conquest of this place became important as it cut off from the duke of savoy every prospect of relief by sea the duke de vedome after an obstinate siege of six months became master of verue

the twentythird of april he had the mortification a few days before to be an eyewitness of the defeat of de pontis whose ships consisting of five men of war were surprised in the bay and all taken or destroyed by an english squadron under sir john leake the campaign on the confines of spain and portugal opened favorably for the archduke and the allies the siege of gibraltar having forced the french and spaniards to draw the best part of their forces to that side the confederates were encouraged to enter the enemys country on the frontiers of beira and alantejo the portugueze reduced the principal places in the province of estramadura salvatierra valencia dalcantra may    and albuquerque may     fell into their hands the progress of the spring campaign was however stopped by a body of french and spaniards who forced the marquis das minas who commanded the portugueze to retire within the limits of his own country in the end of autumn the portugueze and the other allies who had quarrelled about the projected operations opened at length the campaign with the siege of badajox but the marshall de tesse having thrown a reinforcement of a thousand men into the place the enemy

the allies look up their quarters in the heart of the kingdom earl of peterborrows conduct  though this campaign upon the whole was much less unsavourable than the preceding to the house of bourbon it is apparent that they owed more to the langour of some of their enemies than either to their own force or their conduct  affairs of poland the war in poland produced some events of importance during the present campaign the good fortune which had hitherto attended his enterprises ceased not to favor the active spirit of the king of sweden but neither the success of his arms nor his own abilities and perseverance were capable of restoring to peace and order that distracted kingdom the cardinal primate having issued the universalia a diet was held in the month of july at warsaw under the protection of a body of swedes the saxons in endeavoring to disturb the deliberations of that assembly were defeated by the enemy and forced to retire with considerable loss while in the same month the russians were routed by the swedes in courland with the loss of six thousand slain but notwithstanding these advantages the king of sweden found it impossible to decide the fate of the war the czar after the defeat of one army poured a still greater force into courland and reduced the victorious swedes to the necessity of retiring under the cannon of riga mittau itself fell into his hands

acts of royalty under the protection of his maker the king of sweden hist du nord   affairs of scotland during these transactions abroad the parliament of scotland met at edinburgh june     the late obstinate and determined conduct of that assembly had involved the english minister in difficulties from which he could only extricate himself by gaining through motives of advantage to themselves the most active and vindictive of his political enemies to prevent the return of dangers which he had just escaped he resolved to use all the power and influence that his office had placed in his hands to promote the protestant succession and the union of the kingdoms measures which both he himself and the duke of marlborough had secretly opposed stuartpapers   0   in the preceding year to effectuate his purpose the lord godolphin through the dictates of his own caution and the advice of his friends came to a resolution of placing the management of the affairs of scotland in other hands the duke of queensberry raised to the place of lord privy seal was considered as the acting minister and the duke of argyle an active forward and spirited young man succeeded the marquis of tweedale as commissioner to the parliament a general change in the inferior departments was made and all the privycounsellors laid aside by the preceding ministry were restored except lockhart of carnwath and sir james foulis of collington mem of scotl   a session of parliament the removal of the late ministry formed a new party in parliament which from throwing its weight alternately in the scale of the jacobites and in that of the favorers of the revolution acquired the cant name of the flying squadron these without any fixed principle on either side endeavored by balancing the two other parties to seize again the reins which had been struck from their hands the views of each being fixed on their respective objects the public business was opened with reading the queens letter to the house she recommended with great earnestness the settling the succession in the protestant line and an union between the two kingdoms to induce them to apply heartily to the first she promised to give her assent to such provision and restrictions as should appear necessary in such a case and she signified her desire that the means of promoting the latter might be followed through the same line with that marked by the parliament in england queens letters  the lord commissioner and the earl of seafield who had been appointed chancellor enforced in their speeches to the house the important matters recommended in the letter from the queen  proceedings the first motion made in parliament july     proposed that prior to all other business the house should proceed to the consideration of such limitations and conditions of government as should be deemed necessary to circumscribe the royal authority under the next successor in the protestant line this overture however was superseded by a motion for entering prior to any other matter upon the trade of the nation to supply the kingdom with money two proposals for establishing paper currency were laid before the house these were upon a debate rejected but some other overtures regarding commerce were passed into a law a council of trade was at the same time appointed to put the laws of commerce in execution and to bring the exports and imports of the nation into a balance to be laid before the next session of parliament during the dependence of this bill the duke of hamilton presented july    a resolve that the nomination of a successor should be postponed till a treaty with england could be obtained with regard to the commerce and other concerns of the scottish nation though the flying squadron if a cant name may be used joined their votes to those of the adherents of the court this motion was carried by a great majority  intrigues of the jacobites act of limitation though the cavaliers in conjunction with the country party were successful in this important question the first had formed no great hopes of succeeding to their wishes in parliament they had some time before the meeting of that assembly solicited the court of st germains stuartpapers   0   for twelve thousand french as a more powerful argument in favor of their cause than idle resolutions which they knew were destined to be defeated by the great weight which the ministry of england had thrown into the opposite scale the pressure of the allies on every side of the dominions of the house of bourbon had rendered such an expedition impossible in the eyes of the court of versailles and therefore the jacobites were left to their own address and influence in the scottish parliament encouraged by the success of his last overture the duke of hamilton moved on the thirtyfirst of july that in preference to an act for treating with england the house should proceed to the consideration of limitations with regard to the successor to the crown overtures for various acts to that purpose were accordingly introduced and several were passed that in a manner annnihilated the power of the sovereign among other securities provided for the subject an act for trinnial parliaments was agreed to by the house but notwithstanding the solemn promises of the ministry that it should be touched with the scepter when they obtained the act for a treaty with england the royal assent was refused to the triennial bill  act for treating with england passed there is however reason to believe that the ministry through the aid of their friends in england were now enabled to convince the parliament with arguments more solid than vague promises of procuring the royal assent to the triennial bill the temper of the house suffered suddenly such a manifest change that the secret distribution of english money was much suspected by those persons who remained firm to their former views the jacobites and country party perceiving an alteration in the sentiments of many members when the bill for treating concerning an union with england was brought under debate endeavored to defeat by conditional clauses a measure which it was now vain to oppose the duke of hamilton moved a clause importing that the proposed union should no ways derogate from any fundamental laws ancient privileges offices rights liberties and dignities of the scottish nation this overture was so popular that but for the negligence of the dukes own party seven or eight of whom happened to be absent it must have certainly been carried and when it even came to the vote it was lost only by two voices the other attempts made by the cavaliers to clog the act were impotent and illsupported the act for treating with england was passed without any considerable amendments and the parliament having finished this important business and granted the demanded supplies were adjourned on the twentyfirst of september  october new parliament of england meets on the twentyfifth of october the new parliament of england after various prorogations met at westminster the great success of the whigs in the late elections appeared in the choice of a speaker for the house of commons the highchurch party having proposed mr bromley who had distinguished himself in the debates on the bill against occasional conformity as a zealous adherent of toryism the whigs opposed him with the nomination of mr smith upon a division smith carried the office of speaker by a great majority     against  0   and on the twentyseventh of october he was approved by her majesty according to the usual form the queen addressed to the two houses a speech penned by cowper the new lord keeper which though suitable to the times showed that the measures of the court were no longer guided by tory principles she urged with earnestness the necessity of prosecuting the war to restore the balance of power which she said the possession of spain by the house of bourbon had destroyed she demanded the necessary supplies for supporting the operations of the allies as well as for exerting the force of her own kingdoms she informed them of the act passed in scotland for treating concerning an union and she concluded with taking an obvious part with the whigs by declaring that the church was in no danger a circumstance urged with vehemence by the tories to arm the prejudices of the populace to favor their own designs  november a supply pretenses of parties this speech was so suitable to the sentiments of the prevailing party and the subject in general so popular that an address of thanks was voted by the commons without either debate or one dissenting voice nov    the supplies for the next year amounting besides the ordinary revenue appropriated to the civil list and the payment of interest for debts to more than five millions were voted with the same unanimity and seeming zeal nov  0  the war was not the topic upon which the contending parties resolved to try their force public pretenses were invariably used throughout this reign by the leaders of the two parties to cover their own private designs upon office and the possession of power the leaders of the tories on the one hand expressed the utmost solicitude for the church of england those of the whigs discovered a wonderful zeal for the succession of the crown in the protestant line they both assailed the weakness of their less intelligent followers through these channels and arming themselves with the prejudices of the populace endeavored alternately to take the cabinet by storm the tories having been deserted by the ministry applied themselves to the people papers publications and pamphlets were written with zeal and propagated with ardour and the nation were perpetually alarmed with insinuations of secret conspiracies and open attacks made by the ministry and whigs upon the doctrines and even against the very being of the church of england  inconsistency of the tories though the whigs yielded not to the tories in bespeaking the favor of the populace against their opponents the latter were guilty of inconsistencies which threw discredit on their party to harass their sovereign to embarrass their political enemies perhaps to gain some popularity for themselves and above all to vent their resentment against the minister they had long before the meeting of parliament stuartpapers   0   resolved to propose either by bill or address to demand from the queen that the princess sophia should be invited into the kingdom as the next heir of the crown a proposal of the same kind when urged by the whigs had been rejected by the tories themselves when possessed of power but neither the inconsistency of the measure nor its contrariety to their own private opinions could prevail with them to forego a motion from which they hoped to derive less advantage to their own views than a kind of malignant pleasure in disconcerting their enemies on the fifteenth of november the lord haversham chosen upon the occasion to be the mouth of the party after having in a set speech inveighed against the conduct of the allies in the last campaign and by implication blamed the duke of marlborough concluded with a motion that her majesty should be addressed to invite the presumptive heir according to the act of settlement into england havershams speech nov    0    their motion for inviting the protestant heir rejected haversham was supported in his motion with great warmth by the duke of buckingham and the earls of nottingham and rochester the resentment of these oblemen against the government and the party now in ower induced them to contradict not only their own seet principles stuartpapers paslim  but even those which they had unirmly avowed to the world they urged that as they ad sworn to maintain the protestant succession they ere obliged to adhere to the motion as the best means  ensure the possession of the crown to the heir establish by law they affirmed that it appeared throughout the annals of former times that the prince who f came to england had always carried the crown of the kingdom they insinuated that the pretending scessor might be in london in three days while three weeks would at least be necessary for bringing the declared successor to that city to these arguments they added others of little weight as they themselves were deemed insincere the whigs by a strange reverse were forced to oppose the motion to preserve their own influence with the queen they alleged that it was neither safe for the crown nor secure for the nation that the presumptive heir should not be in an entire dependence on the reigning sovereign and they urged with propriety that the rivalship between the two courts would inevitably involve the kingdom in all the distractions incident to the animosities of counteracting parties and interests burnet vol iv   bill of regency the weight of the party in power contributed however more to the rejecting of the motion than the force of argument but if the tories were not sincere in their professions in favor of the house of hannover they were at least the means of strengthening the security of the succession of the crown in that family the lord wharton having with a happy irony congratulated the house on the manifest miracle that ha so suddenly changed the principles of the tories an der was made that the judges should prepare and present to the lords a bill for the further security of the protestant succession this bill by forming an eventual regency of the first officers of state upon the death  the queen effectually secured the kingdom by pviding a continuation of legal government till the scessor should arrive and assert his own authority b those who seemed most to urge the invitation to the prsumptive heir were least inclined to the bill of regenc the tories opposed it in every clause and proposed ditions apparently more designed to gain the populac than either necessary or even useful in themselves o of their amendments was manifestly calculated to def the intention of the bill by rendering it ridiculous  was offered as a limitation on the regency that the should possess no power of repealing the very act of settlement burnet vol iv  for the security of which they themselves were to be invested with that authority  a vote that the church is not in danger the vehement and inconsiderate measures into which their own resentment had betrayed the tories furnished their opponents with another opportunity of mortifying their pride a cry that the church was in danger had been propagated with such industry without doors that the whigs resolved to check the panic which had spread among the people by a declaratory vote in parliament the lord halifax having moved for a day to examine into the pretended danger of the church a debate ensued more expressive of the violence of the parties than suitable to the subject the act of security in scotland the loss of the bill of occasional conformity in england the absence of the next successor to the crown beyond seas the increase of presbyterian academies and the licentiousness of the press were produced by the tories as proofs of the danger of the church the whigs argued on the other side that the scottish act of security regarded only temporal concerns that the absence of the successor was supplied by the act of regency that the bill of occasional conformity having been considered and rejected by the house the question was now determined and that the presbyterian academies were scarce more numerous than those taught by nonjurors they agreed with the tories that the licentiousness of the press had been carried to extremities but by none further than by the pretended friends of the church of england a vote was passed with which the commons concurred that the church was in a safe and flourishing condition and that whoever should suggest that the established religion was in danger was an enemy to the queen the church and the kingdom dec     0    progress toward an union during these disputes between the parties with regard  the internal affairs of england the two houses proeeded almost without debate in the business of the nion with scotland the parliament of the latter kingom had addressed the queen against any progress in that important treaty till the english act which conditionally declared the scots aliens should be repealed journals nov     the whigs having first moved for that compulsatory law the tories imagined that they would still adhere to their own work they resolved therefore to press them on that ground by promoting an immediate repeal burnet vol iv  but their opponents yielding prudently the point without opposition they were disappointed in their views the act declaring the scots aliens by a certain day was not only reversed the whigs went still further and moved that the act relating to the manufacture and trade of scotland should be also repealed these measures by opening a way for an immediate treaty were as popular as they were necessary though a majority of the parliament of scotland were already gained by private means the body of the people were still inflamed to a degree of fury with regard to their independence as a nation any backwardness in the parliament of england on the subject of the compulsatory laws would have brought matters to extremities and considering the party in favor of the lineal succession among the english a war could scarce terminate in any event short of a subversion of the settlement of the crown in the protestant line  unanimity with regard to the war the same unanimity which was observed with regard to scotland was pursued without deviation in whatever concerned the effectual prosecution of the war though the campaign in flanders was neither splendid nor followed with striking consequences the reduction of a considerable portion of spain through the sole efforts of the english nation had raised among the people an eagerness for continuing hostilities which imparted itself to their representatives in parliament the duke of marlborough having visited vienna where he was raised to the dignity of prince of mindelheim by the emperor arrived in london on the thirtieth of december   0  january though he received the thanks of the house of commons january     0   for his services in the last campaign some attacks but indirectly were made in the house os lords on his conduct by the excluded party the disappointments o the moselle were by an implication laid to his charge and though the blame of the inactive campaign in brabant was placed to the account of the dutch it was apparent that the tories had circumstances become more favorable intended to pass a censure on the duke of marlborough  march proceedings of the two houses though the remaining part of the session was distinguished with no business of importance the animosities between the two parties filled every debate with altercation and noise the people without doors were not disinterested spectators of the transactions within they were roused with libels and pamphlets which zealots on both sides poured daily from the press and they suffered themselves as usual to be deceived by the designing or inflamed by the violent and weak among the publications concerning the proposed invitation of the presumptive heir of the crown to england one commanded the attention and incurred the censure of parliament sir rowland gwyne a busy selfish forward and intriguing man violent in his principles suspicious through weakness deceiving others and perhaps deceived himself by seeing objects through the muddy medium of a clouded understanding had repaired to the court of hannover to gain the favor of the electoral family by alarming their fears concerning the succession of the british crowns upon the subject of the invitation to the princess sophia gwyne wrote a letter to the earl of stamford which found its way to the press this illworded unmeaning and confused performance though it seemed to approve of the principles of the whigs severely censured that party for refusing their consent to the proposed invitation of the princess sophia into england the commons on the eighth of march voted gwynes letter a scandalous false and malicious libel the lords concurred with them in an address upon this occasion to the queen who replied that being fully sensible of the pernicious tendency of the paper which they had censured she would comply with their request and give orders to prosecute the printer and author march     parliament prorogued the great business of the nation being finished the parliament was prorogued on the nineteenth of march hannoverpapers   act of regency etc sent to hannover the princess sophia herself either suspecting the sincerity of queen anne and her ministers or misled by the representations of the new english who resorted to the court of hannover entertained little hopes that her family should ever mount the throne she even seems to have placed no value on the acts of regency and naturalization which passed in the present session ibid  she probably soon after changed her sentiments on the fourth of april her grandson the electoral prince was made a knightcompanion of the garter the lord halifax accompanied by clarencieux king at arms was sent to hannover to carry the ensigns of the order to the prince and to present the act of naturalization to his family the current began to run with vehemence in that channel the lords who could claim any merit in promoting the acts in savor of the house of hannover made their court with letters full of expressions of attachment and zeal the whigs adopted chiefly this mode of removing the unfavourable impressions made on the minds of the electoral family by the inconsiderate insinuations of sir rowland gwyne and other zealots of the same kind hannoverpapers   observations the strife between the whigs and tories in showing an appearance of zeal for the family of hannover proceeded more from the selfish views of their respective leaders than from motives of public good to secure the good opinion of the people in countries possessed of liberty is the shortest way of gaining and the surest means of retaining power in the political farces too frequently exhibited by parties the populace are the spectators and those who suit their antic gestures best to their prejudices carry the most applause two principles had long been predominant in the minds of the english nation a fixed aversion to france and a zeal which bordered on enthusiasm for the protestant religion the manly spirit which undeviatingly looks forward to public freedom independent of common prejudices fell only to the share of a few the pretense to that spirit though a stale imposture seldom failed to impose on the world the whigs when they affected to give the great security to the protestant succession paid their court to the populace in a manner inconsistent with the avowed principles of their party they repealed in the bill of regency the limitations which the tories had imposed on the successor in the act of settlement and with a frankness scarce consistent with common prudence boasted openly that they restored to the crown all its former prerogatives the spirit of party however had been carried to such a pitch that every measure calculated to annoy their adversaries was deemed not only justifiable but even laudable by both sides  secret conduct of godolphin though the happy timidity of the lord godolphin had much contributed to give the great security to the protestant succession he was too much attached to the excluded family to take any merit to himself with their rivals his actions were even at variance with his principles in his public conduct in his private capacity with an odd inconsistent species of sincerity he avoided to make professions where he wished not to be of service when he promoted in the face of the world the succession of the house of hannover he continued his intercourse with the family of stuart through their agents stuartpapers   0   his fears of impeachment however prevailed over his affection for the excluded race though the duke of marlborough had promised ibid  in his name to the agents of the court of st germains that no money should be given to gain votes for the union in the parliament of scotland the terrors of godolphin returned and he opened the treasury to the avarice of the venal and the necessities of the needy the secret spring which moved the great measures of his administration lay in a defect of his mind and by a singular piece of good fortune to his character his country ascribed to his distinguished parts a line of conduct which sprung from his political cowardice  campaign of   0  during these important transactions at home preparations were made abroad for opening with vigor the campaign on every side the duke of marlborough having left the hague on the ninth of may joined on the twentieth of the month the united armies of england and the states between borchloen and groszwaren france in an evil hour for herself had resolved to act offensively in flanders the marshall de villeroi issuing from the lines which he had formed behind the deule advanced to tirlemont and without waiting for the arrival of the elector of bavaria with whom he was joined in the command pushed forward precipitately to ramillies when his front had advanced to the heights where rises the little geette he perceived the allies on full march appearing in sight he immediately formed his army in order of battle the geette and an impassable morass running along its banks covered his left wing and prevented it alike from being attacked itself and from charging the enemy the village of ramillies situated in a plain near the source of the geette was advanced before his center which consisted entirely of infantry the village of tavieres on the banks of the mehaigne covered his right wing and an open and level space between tavieres and ramillies about a mile and a half in length was filled with one hundred squadrons of horse in this narrow aperture the battle of ramillies was fought on the twentythird of may n s mem du marq de feuquiere   battle of on a rising ground opposed to the left of the enemy along the swampy side of the geette the duke of marlborough formed his right his line extended through the plain to the left which was covered by the river mehaigne having by a feigned attack on the right of the french which was in fact impracticable deceived the marshall de villeroi he obtained his purpose of obliging the enemy to thin their left which introduced a confusion while it weakened their line in the only place where they could be attempted with advantage the duke in the mean time ordered auverquerque with the dutch infantry to begin the battle on the left while he himself covering his motions with the rising ground fell at once on the center of the enemy with all the foot that formed his own the french making a gallant resistance marlborough ordered all his cavalry to make a home charge but in the hurry he himself being a bad horseman falling to the ground was in danger of being trampled to death by his own squadrons being remounted he pursued his plan of attack

settled while the present year was rendered remarkable abroad with military transactions of great importance and renown it was distinguished at home by an event equally memorable in the civil line the queen in consequence of powers vested in her person by the parliaments of england and scotland had appointed commissioners of both nations to meet and treat concerning an union of the two kingdoms they met accordingly for the first time at the cockpit on the sixteenth of april and having continued their sittings at intervals to the twentythird of july they presented the articles upon which they had agreed to her majesty the most material of these were the following that the two kingdoms should be united into one by the name of great britain that the succession of the united kingdom should remain to the princess sophia and the heirs of her body being protestants that the whole people of britain should be represented by one parliament in which sixteen peers and fortyfive commoners chosen for scotland should sit and vote that the subjects of the united kingdom should enjoy a full freedom and intercourse of trade and navagation and a reciprocal communication of all other rights privileges and advantages belonging to the subjects of either kingdom  views and but though the commissioners had settled without much difficulty the articles of union there was reason to apprehend that the treaty would meet with great opposition in the parliament of scotland the body of the people either swayed by the adherents of the excluded family or yielding to the dictates of their pride were utterly averse to a measure which annihilated them in a manner as a nation the hopes of the court of st germains rose in proportion to the violence which prevailed among the scots relying in some degree on the promises of the duke of marlborough stuartpapers  that no money should be sent from the treasury of england to gain votes in scotland they hoped that the treaty would he rejected by a majority in parliament and they extended their views to an immediate advantage to their own cause from a certainty of the disturbances that were to ensue their party in scotland endeavored in the the mean time to be provided against the worst events conscious of the venality of many of their own number they could not trust the fate of the measure to their avowed principles they therefore demanded succors om france and resolved to appeal from parliament to e decision of the sword having long foreseen what afterward happened they had opened a communication with lewis the fourteenth whose interest they knew especially in the untoward state of his affairs was intimately connected with their cause  secret intrigues the eagerness with which the whigs in england pressed the ministry of that kingdom to accomplish an union with scotland had greatly increased the number of the friends of the excluded family in the two preceding years the jacobites had made frequent proposals to the french king to which he paid little attention as long as the misfortunes of the war had left him the power of giving effectual aid to satisfy himself however concerning the solidity of the assurances transmitted repeatedly from scotland he sent one hook an english catholic and a colonel in his service with letters from himself and the pretended prince of wales to the leaders of the malcontents in that kingdom hook arriving in the month of august   0  executed his commission in a manner calculated to defeat his own views attaching himself to a particular set of the cavaliers he offended the rest while his extreme vanity and arrogance disgusted some and rendered all unwilling to trust themselves in his hands they however made general assurances of their fidelity and promised their utmost exertions in favor of the excluded family should the french king land the pretender in scotland with a force sufficient to protect his person till his friends should assemble in arms stuartpapers lockharts memoirs   of the jacobites hook having received these general assurances returned to france and the jacobites unanimously made choice of one captain stratton as their agent to inquire into the real disposition of the court of versailles they had previously sounded the tories in england particularly the duke of leeds and the lord granville but they found them more cautious than themselves and unwilling to agree to any attempt in favor of the pretended prince of wales during the life and reign of his sister queen anne the scots however were not discouraged urged by their violent principles and beyond measure averse to the union they resolved to hazard every thing to accomplish their views stratton was well received by the court of versailles but the battles of ramillies and turin had disconcerted all their measures lewis declared that he could spare neither men nor money in the present untoward state of his affairs that however he would search for a more favorable conjuncture and effectually support the cause of the excluded family with these assurances and with letters from the pretender to the leaders of his party stratton returned and the jacobites found themselves obliged to abandon the fate of the union to their efforts in conjunction with the countryparty in the approaching session of parliament  oct   parliament meets they however entertained no hopes of success nor had they reason to expect it in a legal way they were strangers neither to the venality of the members nor to the effectual measures taken by the court of england to gain a majority through the channels of ambition and avarice the repeated promises of the duke of marlborough stuartpapers   0    0   to the court of st germains that no money should be sent to scotland were little regarded by godolphin his fears for himself had overcome his attachment to the excluded family and though he seemed from the wretched pittance he bestowed in some measure unwilling to ensure success no sum was too little for purchasing the votes of the scottish members a great majority being thus procured the parliament to which queensberry was appointed commissioner was suffered to meet on the third of october the treaty of union being read was ordered to be printed and the house adjourned for seven days the people who had been hitherto soothed with favorable reports of the articles became outrageous finding themselves as they thought deceived the interval of the adjournment was filled with tumults clamor and confusion without doors but within a determined resolution was formed to adhere to the articles of the treaty lockharts memoirs   a great majority for the union the members in opposition endeavoring to protract measures which they could not prevent moved for a day of fasting and prayer to procure the direction of the almighty in the important affair of the union the motion being overruled together with another for a delay of eight days the house proceeded to the consideration of the treaty article by article on every vote a majority of more than two to one appeared for the union the peers who gained the least by the treaty were the most eager for its being approved many of that order in particular the earl of roxburgh sacrificed their former zeal against an union to promises of being advanced to higher honors others yielded to their necessities or listened to their avarice some who perceived the violence of the jacobites abetted through principle a treaty which was likely to put an end to the romantic schemes of that restless party a few tired of the unmeaning factions which had so long distracted the kingdom favored the union from a view of repose all seemed to be flattered with the hopes of extending in time over great britain those privileges and honors which were now confined to a narrow corner of the island these motives combining with that subserviency to the views of the reigning prince which peers derive from the crown with their patents threw the weight of the nobility of scotland on the side of a treaty that seemed calculated to render their order insignificant if not contemptible  tumults in scotland the whole month of october proceedings of scot parl was spent in reading and debating article by article the treaty of union though no decisive vote was yet proposed the people perceived from the complexion of the house that the whole would be approved by the parliament during the debates the mob rose at edinburgh and committed every species of outrage and extravagance the members who favored the union the servants of government and the commissioner himself were menaced and insulted those who opposed the treaty were received with the acclamations of the populace every where and denominated the friends patrons and even saviors of their native land but when in the beginning of november the parliament proceeded to approve of the articles addresses against the union were poured in from every side the populace roused to a degree of fury throughout the kingdom threatened to come in a body to edinburgh to dissolve a parliament which they said was ready to betray their country in glasgow in particular the inhabitants took arms drove their magistrates out of the city insulted such as favored the union and hung in effigy the commissioners who had agreed to that treaty the uncommon rigor of the season could only save the parliament from the vengeance of the people who had they not been prevented by the inclemency of the weather were determined to pour from every quarter to edinburgh to tear to pieces the obnoxious part of their representatives mem of scotland   debates in the house while the populace exhibited such symptoms of sury without doors the countryparty endeavored to rouse the spirit of the members within mr fletcher of salton the lord belhaven and particularly the duke of hamilton used upon the occasion all the force of their pathetic eloquence on the subject of the unequal representation of scotland the latter expressed himself in terms full of animation and force shall we then in an hour he said yield with a vote what our fathers maintained for so many ages with the sword am i now heard by none of the descendants of those illustrious patriots who aided bruce to restore the constitution to revenge the treachery of england to overturn the mean usurpation of baliol where are the douglasses where the campbels where are the peers and where the barons once the bulwark of our nation have they left no posterity either to improve on their glory or to defend the rights which they have transmitted from ancient times the children of those who aided them in the pursuit of honor are more faithful to the reputation of their ancestors the people have neither forgot nor contemned the freedom which their fathers preserved with their blood but the nobles a degenerate race are ready to stain the honors though they bear the titles of their ancestors shall we then tamely give up the independence and sovereignty of our country when we are entreated and even commanded to preserve them by those whom we represent shall we yield to our fears or if possible to meaner motives when we are assured of the support of a whole nation roused to rage by indignity and shame  arguments to these declamatory apostrophes the duke and other members added arguments of a more solid kind mem of scotland  they averred that all the advantages from a participation of government with england and the repose that might be expected from an union with a powerful kingdom were but mean considerations for the spirit which the people must lose with their independence as a nation they argued that though individuals might profit by the change the country in general must suffer decay from the removal of the seat of government which like the heart in the human frame threw life and vigor from the center to the extremities of the kingdom they affirmed that instead of bringing a part of the commerce of england into scotland the union would ruin that of the latter kingdom by carrying away from their native country to which they would probably never return the most enterprising and the most industrious of its inhabitants they said that imposts already laid on the trade of england would more than counterbalance the present disadvantages of that of the scots whose imports and exports were less burdened and they affirmed that though some change for the better might happen with regard to commerce in some particular places that circumstance ought rather to be ascribed to an increase of industry in a few individuals than to the general prosperity of the country  against the union they descended from these more obvious arguments to speculative observations they affirmed that scotland as an independent kingdom ought to have met england on equal ground they said that an union which deprived any subject of the rights which he already possessed looked more like terms obtained from the indulgence of conquerors than a treaty voluntarily concluded between free nations for mutual advantage they averred that the scottish peers by relinquishing the right of their order to sit and vote in parliament had betrayed the honor of their country and actually altered its constitution and that the small number of the representatives of the people had effectually thrown the nation under the dominion of strangers while it deprived many individuals of the honor and advantage of having a share in framing laws by which they were to be governed they derived an argument against the union from the dangers in which it might involve even the freedom of england and consequently that of scotland as united with that kingdom in its misfortunes rather than in its advantages the representatives of the scots they said would inevitably become a poor and despicable race depending on the purse and consequently on the will of the crown and having shown so little concern for the support of their own constitution it was not to be expected they would pay any regard to that of another nation  the articles approved on the other side it was urged with vehemence that the union in the present state of affairs was necessary and that no better terms could be obtained from the english nation to this the duke of hamilton fiercely replied that he thought the scots being on the same continent with the english might furnish their own commissioners with a very decisive argument on that subject a profound silence followed these words oct     none offered to make any reply to an observation which was in fact unanswerable though scotland had been long torn to pieces with violent factions and obstinate parties the union had become much more necessary for england than for that kingdom had therefore the parliament of scotland regarded their own future interest more than a trival advantage at present there is scarce any doubt but they could have commanded terms more consonant to the independence which they claimed in the name of their country but though the jacobites ascribed the passing of the act of union to the venality of the members they might with equal justice accuse their own want of spirit and folly the duke of hamilton himself who showed so much vehemence in speaking yielded when matters demanded action to a happy timidity more decisive with regard to the union than all the purchased votes of his opponents mem of scot annals of q anne  having settled with all those who opposed the treaty to quit under a protest the house in a body he shrunk unexpectedly from his own scheme the countryparty and most of the jacobites in disgust or despair left the town in the beginning of january and such articles as had not been hitherto approved were carried with little opposition mem of scot   the presbyterians resolve to disperse the parliament the prudence timidity or according to the jacobites the treachery and private views of the duke of hamilton by disconcerting the opposition were the chief springs on which the success of the union turned hookes negociations  the lower sort of people throughout the kingdom were inflamed to a degree of madness at the thoughts of being subjected as they construed the consequences of the union to the government and tyranny of the english nation the act of security by placing arms in their hands two years before had rendered them fit for war the nobility and chiefs of clans under the sanction of law had for two successive summers called their vassals to the field formed encampments and established a degree of discipline the presbyterians of the west who had suffered much under the government of the house of stuart were now the most violent to forward their cause by defeating the union and consequently the succession in the family of hannover they sent to inform the duke of hamilton that they were preparing to march to edinburgh to disperse to use their own expressions a wretched parliament who by suffering themselves to be purchased to the betraying of the honor prosperity and independence of their country had forfeited their right to determine for their constituents and had become an assembly of lawless and abandoned robbers letter of the lord of kersland ms  the duke of hamilton opposed neither the justness of their opinions nor the propriety of their designs but he prevented the execution of the latter by showing them that it was not yet the proper time the earl of strathmore and the viscount stormont made the same violent offers for the counties of perth and angus but they were also disappointed by the duke of hamilton  they are prevented by the duke of hamilton this mysterious conduct of hamilton requires to be explained he was in his principles a violent jacobite from the revolution to the end of the second year of queen anne his undeviating adherence to the interest of james the second his industry and negociations in that princes favor in england till the affair of darien had rendered scotland a more promising field for intrigue had gained to the duke an unbounded confidence from the court of st germains he conducted himself according to their instructions and they paid the utmost deference to his advice when the countryparty in conjunction with the jacobites had carried repeated resolutions in parliament that the successor to the crown of england should not mount the throne of scotland a gleam of royalty seems to have opened on the duke of hamiltons mind this cooled his zeal for the family of stuart and disconcerted his own measures by being an object too great and too difficult for his limited capacity though after the posterity of james the first of england the duke was the next protestant heir to the crown of scotland he was by no means qualified to gratify his ambition his estate was not great and he was overwhelmed with debt he had few vassals and scarce any followers except such as looked up to him as the head placed over them by the court of st germains when he hesitated to join in their violent schemes against the union he lost their confidence his most intimate friends deserted a man who was believed to have betrayed his party he was openly accused of treachery and venality and the reflections of others combining perhaps with his own regret for having abandoned what fortune had placed in his hands threw him into a violent illness which threatened his dissolution lockharts mem hookes negociations stuartpapers   0    reflections though the terms of the union were by no means calculated to flatter the pride of the scots as an independent people no expedient could be deemed unfortunate that put an end to their own government as it then stood there were radical defects in the constitution of the kingdom which in the best times and in the ablest hands could not fail to be productive of perpetual evils to the nation the estates of parliament by meeting in one house and voting promiscuously in all debates created a confusion and promoted a jarring of interests more likely to embarrass than to transact the business of the public with regularity and precision the number of the peers the poverty of that order and their consequent dependence on the crown by carrying every vote in parliament left the body of the people in a manner without a representative the weight which the possession of england threw into the scale of the sovereign had improved his authority before the revolution into an almost uncontrollable tyranny the crown was absolute though government was permitted to retain its ancient form the blow which the royal prerogative received in scotland in the memorable year      established licentiousness rather than freedom in that kingdom the parliament were placed in a situation to make the most for themselves at the hands of the king while the people felt nothing from the alteration in government but a change of tyrants  on the union notwithstanding this untoward picture of the affairs of scotland the period of time between the revolution and the passing of the act of union produced men of eminent talents in that kingdom the freedom of debate which was introduced by the revolution into parliament furnished many with the means of discovering their own parts and animated them with an eagerness which mankind mistook for public spirit in an evil hour for the nation they were divided into many and irreconcilable factions a circumstance hurtful in any country but particularly ruinous where the field of contest is too small while they watched the motions of one another the golden opportunity of mending their own constitution at home or of incorporating themselves upon honorable and advantageous terms with england was for ever lost the peculiar situation of the latter kingdom had placed the fate of her monarchy in some measure in the hands of the scots and the latter could scarce be called unreasonable should they insist upon meeting their more powerful neighbors upon a footing of greater equality but in the animosity of parties all regard for the public was lost and a kind of mean selfishness which scarce deserved to be dignified with the name of avarice took possession of every breast and marked the age with indelible infamy  peace offered by france while the great event of the union between the british kingdoms was ready to secure the tranquillity of england at home she preposterously rejected proposals for restoring upon the most honorable terms for herself the general peace of europe the french king broken with the misfortunes of the campaign on every side began seriously to think of putting an end to a war which had already fallen so heavy on his subjects and even threatened the monarchy of france with danger if not with dissolution having privately made some ineffectual applications of this kind to the states of the united provinces he resolved publicly to signify his earnest desire of peace and he for that purpose ordered the elector of bavaria to write letters to the duke of marlborough and the fielddeputies of the states to propose the opening of a general congress oct     as a proof of his sincerity he mentioned at once the terms he offered the dominions of spain in italy to the archduke charles a barrier in the netherlands to the states and a compensation to the duke of savoy for the waste made by the war in his territories in return he expected that the territories of bavaria should be restored to their native prince and that his grandson

considering the expense of treasure and blood they were not likely to prove agreeable to those who led the counsels of the allies the duke of marlborough was fond of the emoluments as well as of the glory of war prince eugene besides being actuated by similar motives carried an irreconcilable aversion to france into all his views and the pensionary heinsius who had the address to lead the counsels of the states in acting in subserviency to the two generals yielded to his own interest these three distinguished persons were the great springs that now moved the grand alliance besides the people of england animated with the success of the war were unwilling to put an end by a peace to the amusement arising from further victories the emperor having the good fortune to have his war supported by the benevolence and generosity of strangers had relaxed his exertions to a degree that suited his convenience and he was indifferent how long a contest in which he might gain much and could lose nothing might continue the king of portugal and the duke of savoy were so little considered that they were not consulted and from all these various causes europe was destined to remain for several years more a scene of carnage distress and confusion the whigs who were now possessed of the whole power of government in england insulted common sense in the reason which they gave for

ministry beyond the power of any successful attack the churchparty therefore prudently fell down with a stream which they could no longer oppose the two houses in congratulating the queen on the successes of the war neglected not the duke of marlborough they thanked him for his important services as a more solid and to the duke a no less grateful mark of their esteem they passed a bill to perpetuate his titles to his posterity in the female as well as in the male line and they continued to his family for ever the five thousand pounds a year which the queen had granted during her own life journals of both houses   union approved by both houses with the same unanimity and zeal the commons made provision for an extraordinary debt to the amount of eight hundred thousand pounds contracted by the march     this sum though perhaps ill applied was intended for the recoinage of the money of scotland to discharge the public debt and to repay to the african company all their losses with interest as the misfortunes of that wretched body of adventurers were the source of the disturbances which subsisted among the scots for the last ten years so the prospect of repayment was a great inducement to their reconcilement to the measure which annihilated their government when the act of the scottish parliament confirming the treaty of union was laid before the english commons they passed it without opposition in the house of lords it furnished a subject for debate but the minority was so insignificant that the arguments against the treaty deserve not to be recorded

signified by proclamation that the first parliament of great britain should meet on the twentythird of the next october the union of the kingdoms being to commence on the first of may that day was appointed for a public thanksgiving and the queen went in state to st pauls a ceremony of which to judge by its frequency she seemed to be extremely fond but though the union of the kingdoms had now commenced in the eye of the law it could scarce be considered as an entire and incorporating union the privy council of the kingdom the officers of state and the whole ministry were still maintained

embarrassed his counsels and thrown his kingdom into the utmost distress and consternation the only circumstance in which he could not blame his fortune was that a very favorable season had provided his people with plenty of grain political annals   0   but he was in great want of money to pay his troops as well as to provide his armies with those implements of war which he had lost on every side to the enemy in the preceding summer to obtain a kind of remedy to this evil he fell upon an expedient which distressed the nation while it ruined the credit of government in imitation of the exchequerbills circulated by the government of england he issued bills upon the mint to the amount of seventy millions of livres ibid  but in refusing to take these bills in payment of the revenue he threw them into such discredit that after all expedients to raise their value had been tried they remained at the discount of near sixty per cent  her preparations notwithstanding this domestic distress lewis contrived to make considerable preparations against the efforts of the enemy he extended a line of militia along the coast of the ocean and the shore of the mediterranean he formed an army in flanders under the duke de vendome another was assembled by the marshall de villars in the neighborhood of strasbourg a body of men was ordered to rendezvous in navarre another in roussillon and reinforcements were sent to the army commanded by the duke of berwick in spain the year began with one instance of success on the part of france majorca was retaken by the count de villars on the fifth of january but this transitory gleam of good fortune was soon obscured by fresh disasters in italy the french and spanish troops were forced to evacuate lombardy by a capitulation signed on the thirteenth of march modena feb  0 and milan surrendered themselves successively to the allies the whole kingdom of naples was reduced either by the treachery of the inhabitants or the force of the

passed the river xucar they advanced to almanza the duke of berwick who had just arrived at the place hesitated not a moment to give them battle the action extended from wing to wing the english infantry penetrated the center of the enemy but the portugueze foot giving way and berwicks cavalry having at the same time thrown the horse of the allies in disorder the battle was soon decided in favor of the french never victory was more complete six thousand of the allies either lay dead on the field of battle or were slain in the pursuit five general officers seven brigadiers twentyfive colonels above eight hundred other officers and nine thousand soldiers were either taken prisoners or being surrounded in the mountains were forced to surrender all the cannon standards colors

on the side of germany the affairs of the confederates wore the same gloomy aspect the usual sluggishness and backwardness of the princes almost subjected the empire to the same misfortunes from which it had been relieved by the battle of blenheim the continuance of the rebellion in hungary combined with the habitual inactivity of the court of vienna had rendered the efforts of the house of austria extremely languid on the upper rhine the margrave of bareith who succeeded to the command of the imperialists upon the death of the prince of baden led an army inconsiderable in point of numbers and illprovided with necessaries for the field the french army under the marshall de villars having passed the rhine at strasbourg forced the lines at stolhoffen laid the duchy of wirtimberg under contribution entered swabia and penetrated to the danube but when villars was meditating measures which might change the whole face of the war he was forced to weaken his army by great detachments into france itself which was now attacked within its limits by the allies toward the end of the campaign the elector of hannover took the command of the army of the empire and count mercy having surprised the marquis de vivant at offembourg the marshall de villars was forced to abandon all his schemes and to repass the rhine hist dallemagne tom vii hist de france tom iii   dictatorial

plausible pretenses for a quarrel with the court of vienna he complained of an insult committed by count zobor chamberlain to his imperial majesty on the baron stralenheim the swedish envoy though all reasonable satisfaction was given by the emperor the king of sweden with an obstinacy suitable to his character increased his complaints and multiplied his demands he peremptorily reuired that five hundred russians to whom the court of vienna had given refuge in the austrian dominions should be delivered into his hands he insisted that the emperor should immediately decide the affair of the election of lubec in favor of the administrator of holstein that the protestants of silesia should be indulged with the free exercise of their religion according to the treaty of westphalia that his imperial majesty should relinquish all pretensions to the quota which the king of sweden had neglected to furnish according to the tenure by which he held his dominions in germany and that the whole swedish army in their return through silesia and poland should be maintained at the charge of the court of vienna hist de suede   0    he thrown wantonly the balance of europe from his hands the court of vienna was by no means in a condition to refuse these dictatorial terms but the queen of england and the states were alarmed lest the pride of the emperor joseph should overcome his attention to the interest of the allies queen anne therefore had determined early in the season to order the duke of marlborough to repair to saxony to sooth the king of sweden and to gain the ministers of that prince the duke no stranger himself to the power of money over mankind consulted the elector of hannover hannoverpapers   0   about the sums to be given as annual pensions to the counts piper and hermelin who conducted the counsels of charles the twelfth the elector advised that two thousand pounds sterling should be secured for the first and one thousand for the latter and that one years pension should be paid in advance ibid  the duke arriving at altranstadt where the king of sweden held his head quarters was received with a degree of politeness considering the harsh and uncomplying character of that prince whether marlborough gained piper and hermelin through the channel of their venality is uncertain as well as unimportant his negociations by the event seem to have been crowned with the desired effect though it is more likely that the king of sweden yielded more to his own resentment against the czar than to the influence of corrupted ministers england and holland having guaranteed the promises of the emperor to the demands of charles that prince after having for more than a year kept the allies in suspense and actually held the balance of europe threw the whole at once from his hands and repassing the oder entered poland in pursuit of fruitless victories hist de nord tom ii   siege of toulon the most memorable event of the year was the siege of toulon and the miscarriage of the allies before that important place the reduction of the spanish dominions in italy and the capitulation signed at milan in march by which the french army abandoned that country left the duke of savoy and prince eugene at freedom to carry the war into the enemys country in concert with england and holland a project was formed either to destroy or take toulon and marseilles an enterprise if crowned with success which could not fail to be highly beneficial to the maritime powers as well as of great importance to the confederates in general the duke of savoy and prince eugene having for some time amused the french with marches and countermarches turned suddenly toward the shore of the mediterranean forced the passage of the river var advanced along the coast of provence

of august with great slaughter the number of troops in toulon and in neighborhood the bad condition of the confederate army and the intelligence received of the motions of the french on every side

fit for service in that rocky country the iron for shoes expected from genoa having been detained by contrary winds had the confederates therefore remained ten days longer before toulon they would in all likelihood have been obliged to surrender prisoners of war such was their own weak condition and the activity used by the french to disappoint the design ms anecdo tes  having bombarded the place

campaign the french under the duke de vendome prudently avoided an action and they managed their motions so well that they furnished the enemy no opportunity of attacking them with advantage the principal operations at sea were confined to the fruitless siege of toulon the chevalier de forbin had the good fortune of taking two english men of war with twenty merchantmen and what was still more fortunate for himself to make his escape after an engagement with a superior squadron some advantages were obtained by the english on the coast of north america but they sustained a very great loss in the shipwreck of sir cloudsley shovel that admiral on the twentyninth of september sailed from gibraltar with a fleet of fifteen ships of the line and some frigates having arrived in the mouth of the channel on the night of the twentysecond of october by a mistake in his course he steered directly on some dangerous rocks to the westward of the islands of scilly the association the ship in which the admiral sailed struck and foundered at once not one of the crew being saved the same melancholy fate attended the eagle and romney and of the sailors on board the firebrand another ship driven on the rocks only twentyfour and the captain were saved naval hist  the fate of shovel was lamented by all he had raised himself by his industry and merit from a common sailor to the head of the fleet in

 0  though in some degree favorable to the house of bourbon scarce suspended their misfortunes the conquest of naples balanced the benefits derived from the victory obtained at almanza and the siege of toulon though unsuccessful on the part of the allies was extremely detrimental to france the enemy in their march and retreat through provence ruined a great extent of country the attempt defeated the projects of france on the side of germany by dividing her forces villars having penetrated to the danube was forced to repass the rhine and to relinquish to an enemy who could not meet him before in the field all the advantages of a campaign that seemed to threaten to change the whole face of affairs a degree of mortification was added to the misfortunes of the court of versailles the duke of savoy whose capital was besieged by a french army in the preceding campaign was at the head of a powerful invasion in the dominions of france in the present year but the conduct of the court of france was now as feeble as her misfortunes were numerous the salique law seemed to have been made in vain in a country destined to be governed and ruined by women madame de maintenon though advanced in

their own political existence the generality of the scottish nation either swayed by their pride or yielding to their prejudices were loud in their complaints and wanted nothing but leaders to appeal

was still more destitute of counsels than of power instead of listening to the earnest solicitations of the malcontents in sending the pretender with a force sufficient to protect his person to scotland they dispatched colonel hook into that kingdom with instructions more calculated to depress the spirits of the jacobites than to rouse them to arms hook arriving soon after the recess of parliament made a secret progress through the northern counties and presented to the leaders of the jacobites letters from the king of france as well as from the pretender the dukes of gordon and athol the earls of errol marishal panmure and strathmore the viscount stormont and in general all the nobility and gentry to the north of the forth and many whose estates lay to the south of that

was apparent hookes object was to engage them in every thing and the french king in nothing they signed a general memorial referring implicitly the expected aid from france to the generosity of lewis the fourteenth  hookes negociations in this memorial after a complimentary preamble to the french king they signified their earnest desire that the pretender should be immediately sent to scotland they affirmed that upon his arrival he should be received without opposition as king and that the established government would instantly vanish without making the least effort for its own support out of the great number of men that were to be led by his adherents to his standard they proposed to select twentyfive thousand foot and five thousand horse these they promised to clothe to arm and to provide with provisions till they should march into england but upon that event they insinuated that a monthly subsidy ought to be paid by france should the war be prolonged for any time by the resistance of the english nation to the person whom the memorialists called their lawful king they solemnly assured the most christian king that the whole kingdom from an aversion to the union were unanimous in their wishes for the restoration of the exiled family and that as they threw themselves under his majestys protection they were confident he would effectually support their cause they however left the time the manner and the strength to be sent entirely to himself the whole strain of the memorial was spiritless though vehement it expressed an enthusiasm for an immediate

memorial hook was charged with letters from the leaders of the malcontents to the pretender and the french ministry having arrived in france in the month of july he laid the substance of his negociations before the court of versailles the earl of middleton who managed the affairs of the pretender attempted to add the weight of argument to the offers and solicitations of the scots he endeavored to establish the probability of the success of an insurrection in scotland by the recent and stillexisting resistance of the hungarians against the forces and efforts of the court of vienna he mentioned as an example of the same kind the insurrection in the cevennes where a few peasants without any succors from abroad maintained themselves so long against regular troops commanded by mareschals of france he averred that nothing was so well calculated to terminate a war as to carry it into the enemys country the king of sweden he said after a series of victories for five years in poland found new enemies rising as it were from the blood of the slain till by making a sudden irruption into saxony he put at once an end to the war and the reign of king augustus he affirmed that

middleton and the repeated and vehement solicitations of the scots themselves were lost on the court of versailles happily for great britain the measures of the french ministry were too much disconcerted with an invasion of their own country to think of carrying the war into that of the enemy the sullen silence which arose in scotland from the anxious expectations of the discontented was in the mean time mistaken by the superficial for an acquiescence in the union between the kingdoms the affairs of england in like manner wore the face of tranquillity the attention of the people being turned to the operations of the war the bickerings between parties were either forgot or neglected but to those who from judicious observations on the past could penetrate into the future a storm seemed to be gathering behind the transient sunshine which to use a metaphor enlightened at present the kingdom the lordtreasurer thinking perhaps that he had gone too far in opposition to his principles in accomplishing the union seemed from his conduct little anxious about its continuance every measure calculated to exasperate the scots against that treaty was adopted though the revenue of scotland had fallen under the management of the treasury in england on the first of may no care had been taken to issue commissions for new officers  suspected of a design to break the union the whole trade of the kingdom was suspended for two months through this negligence while in consequence of an act lately passed seizures were made o foreign goods imported from scotland under a pretenc that they had been sent to that country to avoid the payment of duties from which all imports from thence had been exempted by the treaty of union burnet vol iv  these measures calculated to irritate the scottish nation against the english were accompanied with an internal relaxation of government which raised a suspicion that the minister if not the court was in the interest of the exiled family the correspondence maintained between france and scotland was no secret but it passed without animadversion and no notice was taken of public rejoicings celebrated at edinburgh and other parts of scotland on the birthday of the pretender the scots considering all government in a manner dissolved by what they called the illegality of the union were at no pains to conceal their sentiments yet such was the supineness of the minister that he seemed to court an insurrection and even an invasion stuartpapers   marlboroughs secret intrigues during this suspicious conduct of godolphin he and the duke of marlborough continued to make their usual assurances of fidelity and attachment to the court of st germains stuartpapers   0   the duke in particular seemed to insinuate to their agents that one cause of rejecting the proposals of peace offered by france was their not comprehending any stipulations in favor of the exiled family stuartpapers april   0   the conduct of marlborough with regard to that unfortunate race is unaccountable except on the footing of principle neglected by the french and without resources themselves they were scarce worthy of being deceived should they even have the weakness to place any confidence in promises so often and so ineffectually made had their conviction of marlboroughs sincerity been equal to the opinion which the world had formed of his power they might at least suppose that their own misfortunes were drawing to an end the queen was in the possession of his duchess the affairs of the nation were either in the hands of his friends or in his own the lordtreasurer who guided the whole line of internal business was inseperably connected with the fortune of his family the earl of sunderland his soninlaw as secretary of state was possessed of the secrets of the kingdom and either the splendor of his own actions or the art of his conduct had rendered parliament in a manner subservient to his views  intrigues in the cabinet notwithstanding this appearance of firmness in the fabric reared by marlborough it was secretly undermined in a manner that threatened its fall the whigs either suspecting the principles of godolphin or what is more probable from views upon his office and influence were preparing to attack his measures in parliament duke of hamilton to the pretender may   0   they were no strangers to his political cowardice and they were determined to derive some advantage to themselves from his weakness but when preparations were making against him without he was privately attacked within the cabinet a new female favorite had in a great measure supplanted the duchess of marlborough in the affections of the queen or rather in the dominion which she had established over the mind of that timid and easy princess mr harley who had been secretary of state for some years had gained a considerable degree of credit with the queen to strengthen his own interest he secured the confidence and assistance of the new favorite the great weight and the almost irresistible power which marlborough and the connexions of his family had established could not have failed to raise in some degree the jealousy of the queen who was actually a mere cipher in their hands she therefore listened to the suggestions of harley who presuming on the manifest change in the mind of the sovereign began to act no longer in dependence on the minister burnet vol iv   opposition formed while harley employed his intrigues in the closet against marlborough and godolphin a formidable opposition to their measures was preparing against the meeting of parliament as long as the people were amused with splendid victories abroad they complained not of the burden of the war at home but when the progress of conquest was stopped by the misfortune at almanza and the raising of the siege of toulon a general inclination for peace appeared in the nation the whigs offended in the person of one of their leaders encouraged this pacific disposition among the people the lord wharton forgetting the animosity between the whigs and the tories in his own resentment against the ministry had paid a visit to the earl of nottingham with propositions to join the highchurch party to humble marlborough and godolphin the latter noblemen from views of their own were highly averse to pacific measures but the current ran violently against the war till marlborough returned to the kingdom the chief reason opposed by the duke to a peace was that france presuming on her success at almanza had receded from the terms which she had offered the preceding year he pretended that lewis the fourteenth had then promised to restore spain and the indies the recovery of the whole spanish monarchy out of the hands of the house of bourbon he knew had been the chief object of the english nation in their warm prosecution of the war from the hopes that they had conceived of the great mercantile advantages resulting from a treaty already concluded with the house of austria the duke insinuated that to obtain that great object there was a necessity for continuing the war and this argument though founded on a misrepresentation of the fact had great weight with the trading part of the nation stuartpapers hooks negociations   first parliament of great britain during these intrigues on both sides the first parliament of great britain met at westminster the queen coming to the house of peers on the twentythird of october directed the commons to choose a speaker many considered this ceremony unnecessary as the parliament had not been dissolved but dropped and afterward renewed by proclamation in terms of an act for that purpose all disputes concerning the legality of the election of a speaker were prevented by smiths being again placed in the chair on the sixth of november the queen as usual made a speech from the throne to a brief detail of the state of affairs abroad she annexed the customary demand of supplies and concluded with exhortations to affection toward her own person and government and unanimity among themselves the commons having approved of the queens speech voted an address of thanks on the tenth of november the house of peers however were not equally complaisant the discontents of some disappointed lords joined several votes to the standing party against marlborough and godolphin when an address to the throne was moved a motion for considering first the state of the nation was carried a zeal for the redress of public evils arose in proportion to the height of private resentment whigs and tories were promiscuously in opposition the leaders of the first had been too much neglected in the distribution of places the latter had neither forgot nor forgiven the means that had been used to deprive them of power ms of the times   great opposition in the house of lords though many followed the bent of their own passions in the opposition with which the session was opened in the house of lords it must be confessed that there was matter of just complaint the duke of marlborough with all his abilities and success in the field suffered acts of meanness selfishness and avarice to stain the fame which he had acquired in the world the earl of godolphin though a man of abilities carried the indolence illtemper and peevishness of his private character into his public conduct the reputation which both had acquired with a degree of justice in their respective departments had a visible effect on their own minds the selfsufficiency which is seldom separated from success had rendered them negligent of men who possessed abilities to support their measures in parliament instead of permitting the places and emoluments of government to run in the channel of parliamentary interest they gratified their own friends and dependents and thus by excluding the ambitious from office they furnished them with leisure as well as with resentment to oppose their own measures  inquiry into mismanagements in the admiralty the lords resolving themselves into a committee of their whole house to consider of the state of the nation a petition was presented in the name of more than two hundred merchants of london complaining of great losses at sea for want of cruizers and convoys in the prosecution of the inquiry great abuses were discovered in the department of the admiralty which was managed by a council in the name of the prince of denmark who bore the name but not the power of lord admiral the committee having made a very unfavourable report to the house it was transmitted to the prince of denmark an answer was returned in his name which attempted to justify the several charges contained in the report but the most remarkable part of the paper was its conclusion which contained very severe strictures on the management of sea affairs in the late reign in the war carried on by king william it appeared that four thousand merchantmen had been taken by the enemy which at a medium fell little short of five hundred ships every year the truth is that during the two reigns which immediately succeeded the revolution naval affairs were much neglected great fleets were equipped to second the operations by land while the trade of the nation was left a prey to flying squadrons and privateers journals of the lords   affairs in spain examined though the prince of denmark was neither blamed in the debates nor mentioned in the report of the committee the queen was highly offended she however made a general answer to the address of the lords and promised to protect the trade of her subjects the inquiry into the state of naval affairs was succeeded by an examination into the military operations in spain where the first success of the english nation had terminated in loss and disgrace the earl of peterborough who had performed signal services in that kingdom had been recalled in the preceding august the tories in opposition to the earl of galway magnified the merit of peterborough while the whigs made severe remarks on his conduct a written complaint against peterborough had been transmitted by king charles to england the paper was laid before the two houses but peterborough in his own justification produced such a number of witnesses and papers that the parliament aster spending two weeks on the subject were so much tired of spanish affairs and the earl that they dropped both without any animadversion ibid   proceedings on scottish affairs the commons less censorious and refractory than the lords granted without hesitation the demanded supplies             they turned at the same time their attention to matters of more importance than inquiries which were scarce intended even by those who promoted them to procure redress to abate the resentment of the scots against the union they addressed the queen journals of the commons nov  to issue a noli prosequi to discharge the several informations with regard to goods imported customfree into scotland before the first of may they however introduced a bill for repealing the famous act of security with had so much inflamed the scots and alarmed the english nation in considering that part of her majestys speech which required the parliament to make the union more complete they came to several important resolves they voted that there should be but one privy council in great britain that the militia of scotland should be placed on the same footing with that of england that the powers of justices of the peace should be the same throughout the united kingdom that for the better and more expeditious administration of justice the lords of justiciary should go circuits twice a year and that the writs for electing members to serve in parliament for scotland should be returned in the same manner as in england dec     a bill brought in upon these resolutions passed with little difficulty the two houses  an universal zeal for continuing the war during these proceedings the warmest and most universal zeal for carrying on the war with the utmost vigor was exhibited by the two houses the lords resolved that no peace could be safe or honorable for her majesty or for the allies should spain and the west indies remain in the power of the house of bourbon the commons having concurred with the lords in an address containing this resolution the two houses presented the same in a body on the twentythird of december dec     the queen in her answer assured her parliament that she was fully of opinion that no peace could either be sase or honorable till the entire monarchy of spain should be restored to the house of austria she at the same time promised in compliance with the other articles of their address to continue her most pressing instances to the emperor to hasten further succors for spain under the command of the prince of savoy the court of vienna however were not equally sanguine with their very generous allies in their own cause the instances if made were ineffectual the languor and undecisive measures of germany continued england with the true spirit of knighterrantry squandered her blood and exhausted her treasures in prosecuting a war from which it was not even pretended she was to derive either territory or power  intrigues of harley though this vehemence for continuing the war with such vigor was highly suitable to the inclinations of the duke of marlborough and consequently to those of the earl of godolphin they still found themselves uneasy in their departments the intrigues of harley in conjunction with mrs masham the new favorite had already disturbed their counsels in the cabinet the effects of this secret influence had even extended themselves to the two houses of parliament burnet vol iv duchess of marlboroughs con  harley who perhaps was not entirely ignorant of the attachment of marlborough and godolphin to the exiled family found means to raise the jealousy of the

principles sacrificed his opinions to his love of power and by flattering the prejudices of the queen in favor of the excluded party hoped to govern the nation through their support and assistance but though he was possessed of courage to undertake the administration of affairs on these terms the times were not yet ripe for so precipitate a change the duke of marlborough and the earl of godolphin

greater number of english forces had not been in spain and portugal at the time of the battle of almanza the answer of the queen was delayed to the eighteenth and when it was received it was deemed unsatisfactory the lords continuing their inquiries into the state of naval affairs presented a long address against the mismanagements in that department upon the whole the complexion of both houses seemed greatly altered with regard to the ministry the weight of government had secured hitherto a majority upon the most trying questions in the house of commons but the tories in conjunction with the disappointed part of the whigs contrived to carry motions in the house of lords highly disagreeable to those who had the chief management of public affairs journals   an invasion threatened from france a sudden alarm from abroad by terrifying at once the sovereign and the people strengthened the hands of the ministry and disappointed the views of the discontented the court of france had almost always been averse to an invasion of great britain and particularly in the preceding summer they however suffered themselves in appearance to be reconciled in the winter to that measure through the vehement solicitations of the scots and the pressing instances of the excluded family a squadron of small men of war consisting of five ships equipped for action and two fitted for transports together with twentyone frigates were prepared at dunkirk while several battalions were ordered to march to that place from the garrisons of calais st omers bergues air and lisle hookes negociations  the preparations were carried on with expedition and secresy and when they came first to be known it was uncertain where the storm was to fall men could scarce believe that an invasion of great

public intelligence   preparations in great britain general cadogan who resided at the hague in quaty of ambassador from the court of great britain obtained the first intelligence of the real destination of the armament preparing at dunkirk the information given by cadogan to the ministry was confirmed by the news of the arrival of the pretended prince of wales at dunkirk in the end of the

carabines the weather becoming calm the squadron was forced to come to an anchor before newport during two days of bad weather which detained them in that place three frigates having made signals of distress bore away for dunkirk having eight hundred land forces on board weakened by this desertion the admiral called a council of war to consider whether they should continue their voyage to scotland the chevalier himself decided in the affirmative they accordingly sailed in the night of the eighth of march with a brisk and favorable gale on the twelfth they discovered the coas of

proved of the utmost importance to the safety of government as it then stood the state of scotland was in every respect favorable to at least the temporary success of the design the most of the nobles fourfifths of the gentry and perhaps a greater proportion of the common people were inflamed into a degree of despair at what they deemed the indignity of the terms of union between the two kingdoms the injudicious violence with which the new laws for collecting the revenue were introduced into scotland bore the appearance of a design in the minister to rouse the inhabitants to some desperate attempt to break a treaty which he himself had accomplished with such appearance of zeal swarms of surveyors collectors and other officers were sent from england these executed the new regulations with a rigor more suitable to the indignities that accompany conquest than to the rights of a free people the friends of the excluded family fomented with success the public resentment against the english government many formerly averse to the restoration of the stuarts now desired it with the utmost vehemence as the only means to avoid a yoke which they deemed the more grievous and

felt not the supposed grievances of the union were from a national pride attached to a race of princes whom they deemed their countrymen the officers of government in scotland were so sensible of the untenable condition of that country that they had already made preparations for taking refuge in the town of berwick the immediate submission of the whole kingdom and a general acknowledgment of his

their assistance the evil only ceased with the terrors of the nation  parliament dissolved the two houses continued sitting during the alarm of the invasion but nothing important was transacted after the moneybills had passed for the service of the approaching campaign on the thirteenth of april the parliament was prorogued and two days after dissolved by proclamation the messengers of government

the twentyninth of march arrived the next evening at the hague where he was met by prince eugene of savoy these two generals having settled with the states the operations of the summer repaired by different roads to hannover to reconcile the elector to the regulations which they had settled without his communication with regard to the army which his highness commanded in the close of the preceding year on the upperrhine the duke of marlborough having placed himself at the head of the confederates in the neighborhood of ghent in the end of may the french took the field on that side with an army superior to the allies in point of number they were commanded in the name of the duke of burgundy by the duke de vendome though they were possessed of strength sufficient to cope with the enemy in the field they chose rather to rely on stratagem and surprise than on the more uncertain success of open force the elector of bavaria during his long government in flanders had gained an influence among the flemings which he retained after the greatest part of the country had been lost to the allies in the fatal battle of ramillies he either obtained by his intrigues or purchased with the money of france an absolute promise from the magistrates of the cities of ghent antwerp and bruges to open their gates to the troops of the house of bourbon the extortions of the allies of which neither marlborough nor his friend cadogan had been unconcerned spectators mem of the generality of ghent ms  contributed to this projected revolt as much as the intrigues of the elector of bavaria

the fifth of july bruges surrendered itself the next day in like manner to another detachment of the same army the duke of marlborough accused perhaps very unjustly of being privy to the treachery from interested views was incapable of preventing its effects though much inferior in force to the enemy he offered them battle which they avoided by passing the dender in the night july    the opportunity which the french generals now denied to the enemy was soon offered by their own disputes returning from the dender they directed their march to the scheld but the duke of marlborough who had been joined by prince eugene had already passed that river and lay between the french and their lines the enemy could no longer decline battle the scheld with several enclosures covered their left a morass ran along their front and on a rising ground on their right they placed their cavalry interlined with bodies of foot mem du marq de feuquiere   french partially defeated the infantry of the allies advancing across the morass were received with great resolution and spirit by the enemy but the british cavalry broke those of the french at the first shock while the foot intermixed with the squadrons were cut to pieces on the plain the infantry behind the morass stood their ground for some time against all the efforts of the allies to avoid however being flanked by the british horse who were now victorious they sheltered themselves in the enclosures on the banks of the scheld the battle however was by no means decisive but the fears and bad conduct of the french yielded to the allies all the consequences of a complete victory no baggage no cannon were lost it was the repulse of a party rather than a general rout the allies expected nothing but the renewal of battle upon better terms the next morning but the french retreated through five different routes in the night the general confusion and panic which prevailed in this disgraceful and disorderly retreat by breaking the spirits of the soldiers disconcerted all the measures of the french generals for the rest of the campaign french writers passim   their retreat and the siege of lisle discomfited in their own minds the french instead of retrieving the honor which they had lost plunged themselves deeper in disgrace and misfortune they retired from ghent under tournay and under ypres they permitted prince eugene whose reinforcement of germans from the moselle was now arrived to form the siege of lisle that city fortified with all the art of vauban was considered as the key to france itself on that side the marshall de boufflers defended in persons with a numerous garrison the capital of his own government the particulars of sieges are not interesting at any considerable distance of time the duke of vendome attempted in vain to relieve the place by endeavoring to cut off the convoys of the enemy from beyond the scheld and from ostend in attacking a party of english at winnendal a french detachment was defeated with the loss of their cannon and all their implements of war in attempting to attack the enemy before lisle though joined by the duke of berwick with a great reinforcement vendome was twice disappointed after a fruitless cannonade the city in the mean time was gallantly defended by the marshall de boufflers after a siege of three months it was however forced to surrender oct     boufflers retired with the remains of the garrison into the citadel which he held till the eighth of december  observations no fortified place was ever more vigorously attacked none more gallantly defended than the important town of lisle the besiegers carried no part of the works without a regular and obstinate battle and they were scarce masters of one place when they were driven from another and put in danger of being forced to yield the advantages which they had gained with so much valor and blood but the difficulties of the allies were not ended with the conquest of lisle they had lost between eighteen and twenty thousand men before the place which had rendered their army much inferior to the french they were at the same time under the necessity of repassing the scheld or to distribute the troops in winter quarters in the small space of country comprehended between lisle menin and courtray to pass a river whose banks were occupied by an enemy superior in number was dangerous as well as difficult to remain in the neighborhood of lisle for the winter would have been to abandon the rest of flanders the province of brabant guelderland and a part of the territories of the states to the mercy of the french the duke of marlborough who always treated fortune as if she had made an agreement to favor all his designs attempted at once the passage of the scheld and he succeeded without drawing a sword nov      siege of brussels raised ghent and bruges recovered the raising of the siege of brussels was the first consequence of marlboroughs passing the scheld the elector of bavaria had sat down before that place the day before the allies had crossed the river had his highness invested brussels when the enemy were fully employed at lisle the city must have fallen into his hands but upon the approach of the allies he decamped with the utmost precipitation leaving behind him all his cannon ammunition and wounded the cities which the french had recovered through the treachery of the magistrates were again lost to the enemy the retaking of bruges and plassendal followed immediately the passage of the scheld ghent surrendered after a feeble resistance about the middle of december at the close of a campaign where every motion of the french was marked with some loss or some error the duke of vendome went to versailles he durst not pass through paris dreading the consequences of the public hatred which his conduct had raised irritated by his cold reception at court he retired to one of his estates being the fifth marshall of france whom marlboroughs success had driven from the service  corrupt practices of marlborough the glory acquired by the duke of marlborough in recovering the towns which their respective magistrates had betrayed to france was much tarnished by his own avarice a vice to which of all others he was most subject when in consequence of the battle of ramillies the greatest part of flanders was reduced by the allies the chief management of the conquered country fell into the hands of general cadogan who succeeded mr stepney as ambassador from england to the states of holland ms memorial to queen anne original papers  cadogan a man of a profligate and avaricious character had recommended himself to the protection and friendship of the duke of marlborough by giving him the largest proportion of the contributions which he had privately raised from the magistrates of ghent under the promise of his own and the dukes protection marlborough who had received at that period six thousand pistoles in specie was so well pleased with the magistracy that at their request he reversed by his own authority the regulation for the government which had been signed by himself and the deputies of the states of holland on the sixth of october   0  these regulations it seems interfered with the perquisites of those who had been so liberal to himself their gratitude and his protection continued the

magistrates formed the worst opinion of the patrons of persons so unjust and profligate they believed though probably without foundation that marlborough and cadogan were privy to the measure of betraying ghent and bruges to the french from interested views of their own ibid  the conduct of these generals after retaking the two cities was calculated to justify suspicions of the worst kind though they knew perfectly the treason and were fully informed concerning the traitors they not only procured for them a general pardon but continued them notwithstanding the murmurs of an oppressed people in their former offices and authority ibid  a favor so great was not without an immediate and suitable reward two hundred thousand guelders are said to have fallen to the share of marlborough ibid  cadogan the intermediate agent in this lucrative transaction received ten thousand pistoles a magistracy so generous deserved to be supported they were therefore permitted to remain in their departments during the war though they were known to be in correspondence as well as friendship with france and though according to the customs and privileges of the country they ought to have been

which soon after arose to an extraordinary height began already to appear in the debates of both the houses in one singular address to the throne an unusual unanimity appeared the queen as head of the church had ordered on the thirteenth of january that the form of prayer for issue of her body to succeed her in the throne should be discontinued after the eighth of the next march the anniversary of her accession to the crown mr watson son to the lord rockingham moved in the house of commons on the twentyfifth of january that an address should be presented to her majesty to moderate her grief and to entertain thoughts of a second marriage though the motion seemed to convey a degree of ridicule it passed the commons without opposition and received the concurrence of the lords the queen herself considering her constitution and even her years could scarce look upon the address in any serious light her answer however was full of propriety she said that the provision which she had made for the protestant succession would always be a proof of her wishes for the happiness of the kingdom but that the subject of their address was of such a nature that she was persuaded they did not expect a particular answer journals   capital of the bank doubled the commons had with great alacrity and unanimity voted the supplies but the funds upon which they could be charged were not so easily found the ministry at length fell upon an expedient which answered their necessities they proposed to double the capital of the bank and to prolong to one and twenty years its time which was otherwise to have expired on the first of august      the terms obtained by government for these advantages were four hundred thousand pounds at six per cent and the circulation of two millions four hundred thousand pounds in exchequerbills books were accordingly opened for subscriptions so eager were the people for employing their money on such advantageous terms that in less than four hours the whole sum was subscribed though the rapidity with which the subscription was filled was rather a proof of the necessities of government than of the wealth of the people the facility with which such a great sum was raised was calculated to give a high opinion of the flourishing state of the kingdom to foreigners they perceived with a degree of astonishment that after such great exertions in a war of many

during measures calculated for the vigorous prosecution of the war serious proposals for reestablishing the public tranquillity were made by the french king the rout at oudenard the taking of lisle a famine in his kingdom the consequent deficiency in the revenue the general discontents of the people and the contests between his servants forced lewis the fourteenth to offer terms of peace at once suitable to the melancholy situation of his own affairs and proportionable to the success of the allies the envoy of holstein gottorp first sounded the states general on the subject the president rouille was sent in the beginning of the year to antwerp where he had several conferences with the deputies buys and vander dussen he proceeded soon after to the hague the states cautious of making any advances in an affair of such importance without the participation of the allies sent expresses to the courts of vienna and great britain the prince of savoy and the duke of marlborough who had managed with such astonishing success the war were fully empowered by their respective sovereigns to treat with the minister of france and to settle the terms of peace they arrived for that purpose at

strictest intimacy with prince eugene formed a kind of triumvirate on whom the grand confederacy and consequently the fate of europe depended the two generals having gained so many battles and succeeded in all their arduous and important undertakings had acquired as much influence with the allies as they had excited of terror among their enemies heinsius had been the depositary of the secrets of king william he had been raised by that prince to the place of first minister and had the good fortune to preserve the authority which he had received by being the chain which united the states with the grand confederacy formed by his late patron against the house of bourbon all the three seemed to have a personal interest in opposing the peace the duke of marlborough besides the thrist of glory which was probably common to him with other men had an opportunity by a continuance of the war to gratify a passion still more predominant in his mind the love of money prince eugene being a soldier of fortune had no business with tranquillity in which generals are commonly laid aside to rust with their swords heinsius besides the dread of losing his importance at home by breaking the line which connected him with foreign powers was absolutely under the dominion of marlborough whose address in the cabinet was still more irresistible than his conduct in the field  the french form hopes on the characters of marlborough and heinsius the court of france with their usual refinement hoped to derive advantage toward the necessary peace from those very passions and reasons which seemed to render marlborough and heinsius invariably attached to war they were no strangers to the true state of the first they built much upon the prudence of the latter and the character of patriotism which he had already acquired they knew that marlborough while he possessed such credit and authority abroad was secretly undermined by his enemies at home they were told that a great part of the british nation were offended at seeing the power influence and emoluments of government so long divided between the duke the earl of godolphin and their friends that the mind of the queen by the secret artifices of a latent faction was greatly alienated from the interest of her general and uneasy at the uncontrouled power of her treasurer they were assured that the influence of the first was already in a tottering condition they supposed that his prudence would suggest to him to provide for the worst and therefore they derived hopes from his known love of money that he would be glad to receive a reward from france in proportion to his merit in delivering her from the calamities of a war which threatened her with apparent ruin the authority of heinsius was by no means on the same precarious footing with that of marlborough but the french supposed that directing chiefly his attention to the interest of his country he would seize with ardour the very advantageous conditions which were to be offered by lewis the fourteenth for extinguishing a war the burden of which lay so heavy on the republic m de torcy tom i   but they are deceived the french however found themselves deceived in the hopes which they had formed upon the condition of marlborough and the character of heinsius though neither of these two great men durst avowedly show their want of inclination for

on the part of the allies and the president rouille in the name of the french king the terms offered by france were to the last degree humiliating to that monarch but in proportion as the french minister augmented his concessions these haughty republicans rose in their demands in the name of their allies while affairs were in this unpromising condition the duke of marlborough whose opinion of his own situation at home agreed not perhaps with the hopes the french had formed on that subject put at once a stop to the conferences he informed the states that he had orders to prevent all further advances toward a treaty should france refuse to extend her offers in favor of the emperor and great britain m de torcy tom i  prince eugene insisted that the entire cession of the spanish monarchy

severely felt throughout europe was succeeded in france by a sudden thaw that destroyed all the grain the spring came on but the weather continued severe not the least promise of maturity was made by

supply the absence of force with an indignant pride when the relation of the last conference between rouille and the deputies of the states was read in council at versailles the french ministry resigned themselves to pusillanimity and fear instead of assuming courage from despair they yielded to all the melancholy reflections which misfortunes suggest to the timid and weak the campaign was

of great britain in the protestant line to restore every thing to the duke of savoy and to agree to the cessions made to the king of portugal by his treaty with the allies printed preliminaries   rejected by the allies the obstinacy of the two generals and the haughtiness of the dutch who were elevated beyond measure at having the management of a treaty which reduced the french nation so low prevented the conclusion of a peace as honorable to the allies as it was humiliating to the house of bourbon though the entire cession of the spanish monarchy or what was virtually the same the withdrawing all the aid of france from philip the fifth was the whole object of the war they broke off the conferences by demanding terms nugatory in themselves as they could not be executed by the french king the utmost that he could promise was to leave the king of spain to the protection of such as should adhere to that prince of his own subjects but he was not permitted to sorm the most

contained the dictatorial language used by conquerors to the vanquished the plenipotentiaries of france yielded to thirtyfive the other five were referred to the decision of lewis the fourteenth the marquis de torcy repaired for that purpose to paris but not withstanding the consternation of the french king and his council they had the spirit to reject terms of peace scarce less ruinous and disgraceful than the evils apprehended from a continuance of hostilities ibid  the court of france however derived some advantage from the conferences at the hague they found means to remove the despair of the people by raising their indignation they made public the whole negotiation they explained their own enormous concessions and the haughty terms prescribed rather than proposed by the allies the king himself wrote to all the governors of the provinces a moving relation of the transactions the pride of the french being roused by what they deemed an affront they prepared themselves for new efforts in the war hist d france tom iii   marlborough savours the pretender in the course of the negociations at the hague the marquis de torcy instructed by the court of st germains mentioned the concerns of the pretender to the duke of marlborough the duke with a want of caution inconsistent with his usual prudence expressed a strong desire of serving effectually the son of a king for whom he said he would have spilt the last drop of his blood he told m de torcy at the same time that he believed it was the interest of the prince of wales for so he called the pretender to remove entirely from france that he ought to fix his residence where he pleased enjoy perfect security and to be the master of his own motions and journies to whatever country he pleased the article of subsistence was a matter of greater difficulty the payment of her dowry to his mother was proposed by the marquis de torcy as the best expedient marlborough desired him to insist strenuously on that article to the viscount townshend that lord said marlborough is a kind of inspector over my conduct he is an honest man but of the whigparty i must speak like an obstinate englishman in his presence i wish however i could be of service to the prince of wales i hope your solicitations will furnish me with the opportunity which i so much desire hist de france tom iii  the result of the

had she been willing to aid the cause of the pretender he had long signified his desire that that unfortunate prince should remove from the french dominions the duke himself and the earl of godolphin who was still more sincere in his attachment to the exiled branch of the stuarts perceived that the greatest obstacle to the accomplishment of their views proceeded from the unsurmountable aversion the people entertained against the having a king imposed upon them by france the lordtreasurer in particular affirmed that his own inexplicable conduct in turning the tories out of office was to facilitate the assuring the succession to the pretender whom he dignified with the name of king he knew the tories he said to be passionate unsteady and unfit for business he therefore resolved to bend gradually the whigs to his purpose men who regarded less the person of the successor than the certainty of possessing in his name the power of the crown he hoped he said by management to extricate the pretender from the hands of france and by gradually reconciling the people to his character and person to ensure his succession to his sisters throne stuartpapers    0   views of the pretender himself seemed to have been fensible that his remaining in france was by no means favorable to his expectations and designs when he returned from his expedition to the coast of scotland he attended the duke of burgundy in flanders and served under that prince in the preceding campaign during that period he sent repeatedly to scotland to announce his fixed resolution of passing in a hired vessel into that kingdom and to place himself in the hands of his friends if he could not establish himself in the south he intended to retire to the fastnessess and inaccessible valleys of the highlands under the protection of the clans the nobility in scotland who were in his interest discouraged a project which they deemed would inevitably throw himself into the hands of his enemies and totally ruin his friends besides though france was in no condition to support his pretensions she would not probably dismiss his person should he retire clandestinely from that kingdom lewis the

probably a sincere answer from that princ lewis told him that though he had all the inclination in the world to serve his family and ultimately himself by forming a diversion for the arms of the most powerful of his enemies the thing was absolutely impracticable in the present distressed condition of his affairs the pretended prince laid aside for the time all hopes of transporting himself into britain he acquainted his adherents in scotland that they had nothing to hope from the court of versailles his servants in the mean time endeavored to comprehend some part of their own interest in the negociations then carried on at the hague they proposed that the pretender as a mark of his gratitude to the french king should retire to any country the allies might choose except the popes dominions or the swiss cantons they earnestly insisted upon a general indemnity to the adherents of the excluded family they mentioned on various foundations the dowry still owing to queen mary deste the pretenders mother to all these demands they received favorable answers could the polite carriage and promises of marlborough be deemed sincere but though marlborough seems to have advised the removal of the pretender from the dominions of france as necessary to the success of his hopes of the british throne that prince disliked his proposal that great britain should in such a case charge herself with his maintenance he deemed it to use the words of his minister the earl of middleton a design to make the world believe that he renounced his pretensions for a pension stuart papers   0

defeated by his removal from office the violence of the duchess of marlborough who seemed inclined to retrieve by force the power she had lost with the queen contributed to confirm the influence of her rival with that princess harley through the means of the favorite had frequent access to the closet duchess of marlborough  he owed no favor to the ministry and he is said to have embarrassed their measures but had they retained the confidence of the people they might have been in some degree independent of the changed affections of the sovereign the nation felt the grievous burden of the war and they began to wish ardently for peace the terms proposed to the french king or rather imposed upon that prince in the conferences of the preceding may though humiliating to france contained no satisfaction no concession of territory to britain the power that had most contributed with troops with valor and with treasure to subdue the enemy was admitted to no share in his spoils cities provinces and monarchies were transferred to the rest of the confederates britain was forced to rest satisfied with the glory of giving kingdoms away publications of  times   and open complaints these general observations made by the people were inflamed into complaints by men who had an interest in opposing the ministry the tories who had been long borne down by the splendid measures of marlborough and godolphin began again to rear their heads and to rail at their conduct their retainers carried to the pulpit and press such accusations of their opponents as suited their own views though many circumstances were exaggerated there was certainly much ground for complaint a want of attention to the interests of the nation in defeating its hopes of peace upon terms honorable to britain and profitable to the rest of the allies a neglect of the war in spain an exclusive attention to that in flanders the inactivity of the fleet the decay of trade for want of protection from the private armed vessels of the enemy were all brought to the great account with which the ministry were charged with some color of justice to these accusations they added others more to alarm the prejudices of the weak than convince the sensible part of the nation the cry that the church was in danger was renewed in all its force and this circumstance was advanced with a confidence that induced many to believe the intelligence true publications of the times burnet vol iv   parliament meets nov    but though the current began to turn its progress was hitherto slow the success of the campaign in flanders had flattered the people into a kind of forgetfulness of their own complaints they were again reconciled to a war from which the kingdom derived so much renown on the fifteenth of november the parliament met at westminster the queen who on account of the death of her husband had not made her appearance in the preceding season opened the present session in person the speeches of princes are the echoes of the voice of their principal servants the queen expressed the usual sentiments concerning the war and demanded the usual supplies she complained that france had made use of all her artifices to amuse the allies with false appearances and deceitful insinuations of her desire of peace journals nov     though the contrary was certainly the fact the assertion was necessary to justify the continuance of the war the commons with great unanimity and zeal proceeded on the supplies more than six millions were demanded and granted the whole was placed on good and sufficient funds journals passim   doctor sacheverell the unanimity of the commons was suddenly destroyed by an affair trivial in itself but important in its consequences a brief detail of facts will throw sufficient light on a subject rendered tedious and perplexed by the zeal of contending parties henry sacheverell who kindled this new flame between the whigs and tories was a clergyman neither eminent in his character nor obscure in his profession vehement by nature a warm zealot from principle attached to the most extravagant doctrines of the highchurch a determined enemy to dissenters to occasional conformists and their abettors the whole party of the whigs having distinguished himself in the country by his zeal and even by his violence he was called by a popular election to a church in southwark having a more extensive field for propagating his doctrines he became soon to be generally known and followed by those who favored most the principles of the highchurch on the fifth of november of the present year the anniversary of the gunpowderplot having obtained the pulpit at st pauls he delivered a sermon before the lord mayor and the court of aldermen full of those expressions of complaint and jealousy which were common to him with his whole party in this discourse he inveighed with passion if not with indecency against the dissenters and the moderate part of the church of england and at the same time conveyed severe strictures upon those in power he inculcated also in strong and vehement terms the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance which in its greatest latitude was inconsistent with the late revolution journals dec      his extraordinary sermon the majority of the court of aldermen being attached to the principles of the lowchurch refused to thank sacheverell or to desire him to print his sermon a compliment usually paid to those who preach before them on solemn days the lord mayor was of the opposite party he encouraged the doctor not only to publish the discourse but to present it to him in a dedication conceived in the same vehement strain with the sermon the nation was composed of such combustible materials that the least spark was sufficient to kindle the whole into a flame the contests between leaders for places of trust profit and power had been improved into a settled principle among their respective adherents the two parties beyond the hope of conviction had been long persuaded that their antagonists were determined to run into the most dreadful extremities and to ruin the nation the tories believed that the whigs intended to establish a republican system of civil government and to destroy the church the whigs were convinced that the tories were resolved to persecute the dissenters and to place the pretender on the throne the reception given to the sermon and to the opinions formed of the doctor were suitable to the extravagant passions of the two parties the tories extolled him as a person who stood alone unsubdued in desence of the church now on the brink of ruin the whigs gave him the name of a popish persecutor an enemy to the revolution a devoted friend to the pretender the vehemence of both excited to such a pitch the curiosity of the whole people that forty thousand copies of the sermon were circulated in the space of a few weeks publications of the times   he is impeached the ministry in an evil hour for their own power suffered their passions on this occasion to overcome their prudence the earl of godolphin in particular who was personally attacked in the sermon was extremely irritated against the preacher the leaders of the whigs in general showed great eagerness to punish severely the man who attacked with such boldness those principles which they had held forth so long to the world the crown lawyers were consulted they declared that the offense was not punishable by common law the more moderate part of the ministry proposed that the sermon should be only burned by the order of both houses and the author confined during the session the most violent declared that a more solemn punishment was necessary to stigmatize a crime of such dangerous tendency they proposed therefore an impeachment as the most dignified mode of proceeding against a man in whose person they resolved to punish his whole party complaint of the sermon was accordingly made in the house of commons dec      0   sacheverell was ordered to attend on the fourteenth of december he was taken into custody and instantly impeached the highchurch party flew into the most violent resentment the whole people were roused to attention many were alarmed the emissaries of the two parties spread the flame with successful zeal they neglected their private concerns the business of the public was neglected all looked forward with eagerness to this one point as if the fate of the nation depended on the issue of sacheverells impeachment     0 articles against him a general fermet the year ended in the midst of the serment raised by this extraordinary affair on the ninth of january    0 the commons exhibited the articles being four in number against dr sacheverell they affirmed that the doctor suggested and maintained that the necessary means for effectuating the late revolution were odious and unjustifiable that the toleration to dissenters was both unreasonable and unwarrantable that the church of england was in danger under the queens administration publications of the times   feb his trial to give the more solemnity to a matter on which according to the opinions of a majority of the people the fate of religion depended the commons resolved to assist in a grand committee at the trial to accommodate this numerous body westminster hall was prepared at a great expense of money and time at length on the twentyseventh of february the trial began during three weeks the time it continued london was a scene of riot anarchy and confusion the populace daily attended sacheverell from his lodgings in the temple to westminster hall and rent the air with acclamations of applause they were even animated to such a pitch of fury that they pulled down several dissenting meetinghouses threatened several peers of the opposite party with violence and insulted such members of the house of commons as were most eager against their favourite the tiral in the mean time proceeded as the docto had acknowledged himself the author of the sermon  witnesses were produced and the whole time was spe in altercation and argument the managers appoint by the commons consisted chiefly of men in office the distinguished themselves by desending the late revoluon with obvious and at any other time popular guments sacheverell was principally defended by his council by showing that his expressions without being wrested from their true meaning could not be applied to the crimes of which he was accused when the counsel had ended the defense sacheverell himself concluded with reading a speech in which he justified his doctrines with some energy and a great deal of heat expressing his approbation of the revolution and his respect for the reigning queen and her government printed speech   debates of the lords when the accusation and defense were ended the lords entered into warm debates the arguments on both sides partook more of the nice distinctions of the schools than of that manly and decisive reasoning more to be wished for than expected among great bodies of men none defended absolutely the doctrine of nonresistance but several though they avowed their concern in the late revolution affirmed that those who examined it least were its best friends a bishop said that a veil ought to be thrown over that transaction that men should rather call it a vacancy and an abdication than receive its benefits as the consequence of resistance the duke of leeds improved on these puerile refinements in a very long and labored speech he owned that he had a great share in the revolution but he never thought he said that things would have been driven so far as to settle the crown on the prince of orange he affirmed that the prince had often told him that he himself had no such thoughts that a distinction ought to be made between resistance and revolution that vacancy or abdication was the subject of the debates of the convention and that resistance a word both dangerous and odious ought for ever to be forgot he observed with peculiar sagacity that had not the attempt succeeded it would have certainly been rebellion and that for his part he knew no other but hereditary right parl debates publications of the times   sacheverell found guilty though the arguments on the other side were neither new nor perhaps conclusive they were more intelligible and manly the lords as the result of the debate declared that the articles exhibited by the commons were proved but they found it difficult to determine what censure should be passed on sacheverell those who argued most against his doctrines seemed least inclined to be severe the populace were already inflamed to a degree of fury many dreaded personal insults some were afraid of commotions which the enemies of the kingdom might improve to their own advantage a few who thought they had gone too far from a prudent regard to their own interest began dexterously to fall down with the tide the sentence therefore which was passed if not unequal to the guilt of sacheverell was certainly unsuitable to the dignity of his accusers and the solemnity of his trial he was suspended for three years from preaching and his sermon was ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman the famous decree of the university of oxford passed upon occasion of the ryehouse plot in the year      was also burned by a vote of the lords this decree in an uncommon strain of servility recognized the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance in the most unlimited sense of the words owned the absolute and indefeasible rights of kings and the unalterableness of the hereditary succession to the crown printed decree   preliminaries of peace offered by france while the whole attention of the british nation was engaged by the prosecution of dr sacheverell the french continued to make earnest solicitations to the allies for the restoration of the public tranquillity the opening made by pettekum the envoy of holstein in the end of the year induced the court of versailles to offer the sending plenipotentiaries to any part in holland or flanders the states general should appoint to enter into immediate negociations of peace they proposed instead of the preliminaries signed by the allies in the preceding year to reduce their own concessions into a more comprehensive but an equally ample form the french king engaged himself to acknowledge charles the third as king of spain to withdraw all succors from his grandson to forbear sending him any future assistance to forbid his subjects to inlist in his service to consent that no part of the spanish monarchy should ever be united with france to the emperor and empire he promised to restore the city of strasbourg the town of brisac to content himself with alsace in the literal sense of the treaty of munster to cede the town of landau to raze all his fortifications on the rhine from basil to philipsburgh to acknowledge the king of prussia and the elector of hannover with regard to great britain he engaged himself to acknowledge queen anne and the protestant succession to restore newfoundland and to demolish the fortifications and ruin the harbor of dunkirk to consent that the pretender should leave the dominions of france to the states he promised to yield the barrier specified in their own preliminaries to confirm his former offers with regard to their trade to the duke of savoy he granted all the demands of the allies but in return he expected that the electors of bavaria and cologn should be restored to their territories and dignities de torcy tom ii   conferences at gertruydenberg these proposals being rejected by the allies france made additions to her concessions having obtained passes from the states the court of versailles dispatched the marshall dhuxelles and the abbe de polignac as her plenipotentiaries to conclude a peace these ministers arrived at moerdyke on the ninth of march after various conferences with buys and vander dussen the deputies of the states they opened on the twentieth of the month a serious negotiation of peace at gertruydenberg during repeated conferences with the intervention of several expresses sent by the plenipotentiaries to versailles for further powers the french departed from almost all the reservation they had made in the preliminaries sent in the beginning of the year to holland they agreed to relinquish every demand of an equivalent for the cession of the spanish monarchy they offered even a subsidy of a million of livres a month to the allies till king philip should be driven from spain they relinquished even alsace to the emperor and as a security for the performance of the articles of the treaty engaged to deliver the fortified towns of french flanders into the hands of the allies the haughtiness of the states who had the management of the negotiation induced their deties to rise in their demands in proportion as france creased her concessions they insisted that lewis the fourteenth instead of paying a subsidy toward the war against his grandson should assist the allies with all his forces to expel him from the throne de torcy tom ii   are fruitless in this untoward state of the negotiation the duke of marlborough and prince eugene at the request of the dutch came to give their advice concerning the object of the congress men who profited fo much by the war were not likely to facilitate the conclusion of peace their influence with heinsius who had established a kind of unlimited power over the councils of the states facilitated the completion of their views safe in a person in whom they had reason to place an unbounded confidence they contrived to induce the emperor and the queen of great britain to throw the whole negotiation into the hands of the republic the characters of the dutch deputies who managed the conferences at gertruydenberg were more calculated to embarrass any negotiation than to bring it to a happy conclusion buys was a vain confident and tedious man he mistook his own loquacity for eloquence and being passionately fond of displaying this talent involved his subject in figures and unmeaning declamation vander dussen was worse than a mere cipher in this conference as his silence by being taken for assent confirmed his colleague in his impertinences ibid tom i  in the hands of such men it was not likely that any negotiation however favorable the terms might have been to the allies could be be brought to any degree of forwardness before the season proper for commencing the operations of the campaign  campaign  flanders while ineffectual conferences for restoring peace continued at gertruydenberg the allies carried on the war in flanders with an appearance of vigor the duke of marlborough and the prince of savoy having assembled the army near tournay in the middle of april entered the french lines without resistance and sat down before douay in the beginning of may arras would have been the shortest way to the heart of france there being no place of strength between that city and amiens the capital of picardy but the generals of the confederat determined on the siege of douay as that place cover lisle and the rest of their conquests in flanders t city strong in its situation but ill fortified was garrisoed with eight thousand men the trenches were open in the first week in may and the siege was not ended till the twentyninth of june the enemy having assembled near peronne advanced toward cambray with a force sufficient to relieve douay but the defeat of one army might endanger the fall of the state and therefore the marshall de villars who commanded the french after having advanced within cannon shot of the allies thought proper to retire leaving douay to its fate  several places taken by the allies he observed the same line of prudence throughout the whole of the present campaign the confederates took successively bethune august     st venant sept     and air nov    the long resistance made by those towns comprehended the whole operations of the war on the side of flanders the allies gained three places of importance and conquered twelve leagues of a fine country but they lost twentysix thousand men by the sword half their infantry was ruined by wounds diseases and fatigue hist angleterre  the french experienced but one instance of good fortune in the present summer the garrison of ypres cut off a convoy with military stores carried in boats along the lys under the command of the earl of athlone having gallantly defended himself for some time his whole insantry consisting of more than one thousand men were either slain or taken the cavalry were broken and dispersed the boats and stores were taken the victors having carried away whatever was portable set fire to the magazine of powder the explosion was so violent that some neighboring villages were overturned the earth trembled all the way to valenciennes and even to st quintin and the lys was separated into two channels by the opening of the ground and its navigation interrupted  affairs of germany and savoy the same inactivity which disgraced former campaigns continued throughout the summer on the banks of the rhine the french were weakened by detachments to their army in flanders the army of the empire slow as usual in its motions and unprovided with the means of war were either incapable or unwilling to convert to their own advantage the opportunity offered by the feebleness of the enemy the elector of hannover justly judging of the unprepared state of the imperialists by their unpardonable negligence in former campaigns declined a command in which nothing could be expected but disgrace the war on the side of savoy produced no action of any importance the disagreement between the emperor and the duke still continuing the latter refused to take the field in person count thaun commanded the army he was opposed on the side of france by the duke of berwick the vigilance activity and conduct of the duke disappointed all the advantages which the allies might have reasonably expected from their superior force but the discontents of the duke of savoy seemed to have extended themselves to his army they were cold and languid in all their motions and hovered throughout the summer on the frontiers of dauphine without making any effort that deserved to be named  operations in spain battle of almenara the campaign in spain was rendered memorable by the alternate defeats of the two pretenders to the throne of that kingdom philip the fifth with an army consisting entirely of spaniards took the field in the beginning of may having passed the segra he sat down on the fifteenth of the month before balaguer and raised batteries against the place but upon the approach of count staremberg he repassed the river and retired to lerida where he waited for a reinforcement of troops from every side king charles having in the mean time resolved to meet his rival in the field joined the army near balaguer in the beginning of june philip willing to bring the contest to a decision passed a second time the segra the two armies directing their route to almenara came to a battle in the neighborhood of that place july     the charge was furious on both sides but the victory was soon decided the cavalry of philip were dispersed in the first shock his infantry were driven from the field he retired with his broken army leaving his artillery and greatest part of his baggage to the enemy his loss in men was inconsiderable and he found means to collect seventeen thousand of the fugitives under the cannon of lerida hist dangleterre tom iii hi despagne tom ii   battle of sarragossa the rout at almenara was but a prelude to a greater misfortune which soon after fell on the arms of philip the fifth that prince to cut off the communication between the enemy and castile passed the cinca and marched toward sarragossa on the eighteenth of august he fixed his camp within a league of that city the count de staremberg one of the most able generals of the age commanded the allies the marquis de bay being recalled by philip from the province of estramadura was placed at the head of the spaniards the first sought earnestly after an opportunity of giving battle the latter avoided it in vain the spaniards were again routed with the loss of three thousand men they however found means to save their artillery and baggage though they retired in great disorder to tudela the british troops under general stanhope bore the chief share in a victory which threatened to decide the fate of spain the victors marched straight to madrid philip quitted a second time the capital to his rival and retired to valladolid the religious enthusiasm of the spaniards together with a rooted aversion to the house of austria under whose feeble tyranny they had languished for near two centuries was of greater benefit to philip than their arms they considered charles the third as a king imposed upon them by heretics and their attachment to his rival rose in proportion to his misfortunes hist despagne tom ii etc  general stanhope who had possessed himself of madrid was better calculated to defeat an enemy than to gain the affections of the vanquished the army lived at large upon the people without order without moderation and without discipline they raised contributions on private persons they pillaged the churches and sold publicly the utensils of the altar the ravages of the allies combining with the obstinacy of the spaniards created such a dearth of provisions in castille that seventeen thousand men the number of which the victors consisted found themselves incapable of subsisting in the kingdom hist dangleterre   genesis stanhope taken prisoner with  000 british troops the inconsiderate severity of the allies contributed to increase greatly the affections of the castilians for the house of bourbon on the other hand the duke de vendome whom the caprice of the duke of burgundy had rendered useless to france assumed at the request of philip the chief command in spain the nobility crowded from every side with their followers round the standard of a general in whose conduct they could confide to these were joined thirtyfive battalions of french foot with twentyeight squadrons of horse detached from dauphine by the duke of berwick the army under vendome before the end of october amounted to thirty thousand men another army of french under the duke de noailles assembled in roussillon were preparing to enter catalonia these efforts on the side of philip were seconded by dissentions among the allies the latter retreated in a kind of confusion toward catalonia whither charles had already retired they divided themselves for the benefit of subsistence into two bodies staremberg commanded the most numerous and marched in front stanhope with five thousand british troops brought up the rear the latter stopped on the eighth of december at a small unfortified town called briheuga he was ignorant that hope gives wings to soldiers as well as fear the duke de vendome had swam across the tagus with all his cavalry he was just at the heels of stanhope when that general had the imprudence to shut himself up in full security in the village of briheuga he was invested without hopes of escape before he perceived his danger he defended himself with great spirit but he was at length forced to surrender at discretion printed accounts   battle of villaviciosa the count de staremberg apprised of the danger of general stanhope returned to his relief with his whole army but this circumstance instead of serving the cause of the allies was productive of fresh misfortunes he came too late to disengage his friends he had advanced too far to retreat with safety from his enemies the duke de vendome met the allies at villaviciosa about two leagues from the place of stanhopes misfortune he searched for an opportunity of engaging the enemy staremberg could not avoid an action the battle was fierce bloody and obstinate the gener of the confederates displayed all the courage of the sodier with the talents of a consummate commander after his lest was broken and routed he maintained the fight with a single battalion in the midst of which he had placed himself night at length more than the efforts of the enemy forced him to make his retreat the field of battle with twenty pieces of cannon two mortars and some wagons of provisions and ammunition remained to vendome three thousand of the allies were slain in the action and as many were taken in and near the field but it was rather a retreat than a flight staremberg had his trophies as well as vendome the honors of victory were even disputed by the former but the progress of the spaniards after the action ascertained that their claims were better sounded the duke de noailles made a considerable progress in catalonia the efforts of the marquis de bay were attended with some success in estramadura he prevented the junction of the portugueze with the count de staremberg and extended his ravages and contributions into the very heart of the kingdom of portugal hist de portugal dangleterre et despagne   naval affairs the fleets of the maritime powers according to custom in the present war cost a great deal and did little service their chief employment during the summer was the transporting of feeble succors to catalonia and portugal to weaken by making a diversion on the coast of france the reinforcements destined to march from that kingdom to spain a descent was made upon the coast of languedoc on the twentieth of july the confederate fleet under sir john norris and the dutch admiral somelsdyke sailed from barcelona they arrived on the twentyfourth before the town of cette which fell into their hands the next day the duke de noailles having upon the alarm of the descent marched hastily from roussillon with two thousand dragoons having each a footsoldier behind the enemy thought proper to quit their conquests and to reimbark their troops the french court in the mean time incapable of fitting out a fleet permitted almost all their great ships to lie idle under the protection of the forts which desended their harbors the armed vessels of their subjects and a few squadrons of royal frigates interrupted the commerce of the maritime powers in a greater degree than in the preceding year the merchants carried their complaints to the board of admiralty but they excused themselves by alleging that the whole navy was employed in carrying succors to spain and in keeping open an uninterrupted communication with the army in flanders  affairs of the north the affairs of the north which suffered so great a change by the defeat of the king of sweden at the battle of pultowa in the preceding year continued to wear a face of importance the swedes deserted by their king were surrounded with foes on every side the czar made an alarming progress in livonia he took webourg in finland on the twentyfifth of june riga surrendered on the eleventh of july the fort of dunemonde on the twelfth of august and revel on the first of november the king of denmark profiting by the misfortunes of sweden had invaded that kingdom and the calamity of a destructive pestilence was added to the ravages of war the swedes assuming courage from despair opposed the danes with a body of militia their regular troops being employed against the czar the general steenbock commanded the new levies of the swedes on the side of denmark he had the confidence to come to battle with the enemy march  0  the danes were totally routed they lost eight thousand men besides wounded on the field of battle their baggage theirtents their artillery passed into the hands of the victors and thus sweden rendered herself again formidable to her enemies after a long and

hold by the means of party the power which they despaired to possess by the inclination of the sovereign as long as they retained the affections of the queen the confidence which their splendid measures had acquired from the people were sufficient to support them against the irregular attacks of the two irreconcilable parties that had harrassed the nation for such a number of years with their contests and their noise but when the violence of the duchess of marlborough had destroyed that influence which she had extended into a kind of tyranny over the timid mind of her mistress they found it necessary to strengthen themselves by forming a connection with the whigs they gained therefore the leaders of that party by admitting them into places of trust and profit and fortified by this political alliance they held their sovereign in chains the queen unable to extricate herself from this species of captivity affected to adopt measures which she was not permitted to guide  steps toward a change in the ministry though harley and the followers of his fortune were no strangers to the state of the queens mind they could form no reasonable expectations on any exertion of that princess for the recovery of her authority they perceived that a change in the sentiments of the people was necessary to render effectual the efforts of the sovereign the populace for many years had been uniformly gained to the views of party by the constant alarms given from time to time to their zeal for the protestant religion the whigs by harping judiciously on this string had frequently taken the cabinet by storm they had often triumphed over their political opponents by the means of popular clamor even when that party had formed a great majority in the houses of parliament the tories made repeated efforts to take possession of a engine that had so much annoyed themselves the opinion that the church of england was in danger from the dissenters and men of levelling principles had bee propagated with great zeal ever since the beginning of the present reign the eloquence of the pulpit had been joined to the polemical arguments issued from the press the established clergy themselves began through use to believe the doctrine which had been first propagated for the purposes of party the vulgar gradually gave credit to what they heard so often and so vehemently urged the queen herself with a credulity not unsuitable to her sex was alarmed at a tale which she thought was too often repeated not to have some foundation in fact  the imprudence of godolphin the imprudence of the earl of godolphin was the means of setting fire to a train that had been laid for several years persecution is always more successful than persuasion in confirming speculative tenets in weak minds the attack upon dr sacheverell the solemnity and length of his trial the vast inequality between the accusers and the accused the vehemence of the whigs in throwing the whole weight of government in the scale against a private person raised the pity of the people and that passion was improved into acts of violence by the art perseverance and clamours of zealots of the highchurch party the current which had been long changing ran down with a force that levelled every thing in its course harley and his followers added their own weight to its violence the queen herself encouraged by the noise of the populace fell gradually down with the stream she had been long disgusted with the behavior of marlborough she hated the tyranny and feared the violence of his wife she considered herself s a kind of prisoner in the hands of a family who had n a manner clothed themselves with the whole authority f the crown and struck the scepter from her hands with a passion natural to all princes she was averse o the levelling principles held forth by the whigs and for the same reason she abetted those of the tories  and obstinacy of marlborough though the nation was not inflamed against the whigs  a degree sufficient to deprive them of power till the lemn trial of sacheverell the queen assumed some urage from the color of the times in the beginng of the present year mrs masham the new savoute hid a brother colonel hill who had distinguished himself in the battle of almanza the influence of his sister more perhaps than his merit had recommended hill to the attention of the queen and she showed an inclination to raise him to the command of a regiment of dragoons vacant by the death of the earl of essex the duke of marlborough who had uninterruptedly possessed the disposal of all military promotions opposed with obstinacy the advancement of hill as the brother of a woman who had rendered herself odious to himself and his family he retired to the country he threatened to resign the command of the army he employed his friends to terrify the queen and her favorite with addresses from the parliament the earl of sunderland the dukes soninlaw then secretary of state had formed a design to procure a vote of the commons to remove mrs masham from the queens presence and service jan       0  apprized of this intended violence hill entreated the queen to desist from her purpose in his favor she complied with his request for the time but it became evident that she was resolved to seize the first favorable opportunity of ridding herself of servants whom she now considered as tyrants hist dangleterre ms      hasten the fall of the party the flame which had seized the nation upon the trail of sacheverell soon furnished the enemies of the family of marlborough with the means of divesting them of their power harley and his associates having free access to the queen through her favorite turned events as they gradually rose to their own advantage the changes which soon after became general were begun in the middle of april the duke of shrewsbury who had distinguished himself in the debates concerning sacheverell against the ministry was made chamberlain april     in the room of the earl of kent who had resigned that offic upon his being raised to the dignity of a duke the promotion of shrewsbury was considered as a prelude to the fall of the ministry the people were industriously prpared for an important change the principles of the whigs were every where represented as dangerous  monarchy and destructive to the church the

that the highchurch maintained nonresistance as a tenet of religion and that the hereditary descent of the crown is a law so fundamental that it cannot be changed by act of parliament that the lowchurch instead of arguing against these principles affirmed that the consequence of the first is that the government ever since the revolution was an usurpation and that the pretender must be acknowledged lawful king is the inference to be drawn from the second the people he continues are mere spectators of this polemical contest they conclude that both are in the right and that the queen

professions of the earl of godolphin they lost the chief support of their cause when that minister was forced to retire his attachment to the family of stuart though cautiously and successfully concealed from the world was certainly next to his inherent timidity the ruling passion of his mind he is said to have only regretted his disgrace as it deprived him of the power of serving effectually the excluded line he declared to his intimate friends that he had been always in unhappy circumstances that being first distressed by the tories he was forced to throw himself into the hands of the whigs that his whole ministry had been spent in a struggle with the latter party and when he saw himself entirely master of his measures he was turned out of his office by an event as trivial as it was unexpected he hoped however he said that harley would restore the king for so he called the pretender but he will make france necessary to that measure i designed to have done the

and in appearing in that country at the head of a numerous body of his adherents the reduction of the army to a small number upon the restablishment of peace would have left the kingdom in a state sufficiently defenseless to justify the minister in entering into a treaty with a person whose claims were favored by a very great party in the nation the natural moderation of his own character his want of ambition his prior engagements with marlborough and godolphin stuartpapers   0   and even the improbability of his prevailing by force alone would have induced the pretended prince to accept such terms as the queen and the nation might choose to impose he was by no means so jealous as his father with regard to the hereditary descent and indefeasible rights of the crown he would have been well pleased to have received it as the gift of the people he would have been contented to accept of the throne of scotland or to have his name joined with that of anne in the royal title of great britain ibid  while the whose authority should remain during life in her hands he would perhaps have rested satisfied with an acknowledgment of his title as prince of wales and the eventual succession of the crown upon his sisters death mss   his character had his secret designs and intrigues remained unknown to the world the earl of godolphin might have been transmitted to posterity with an unblemished character he was born with extensive talents a long experience had in a particular manner qualified him for the great line of business he understood the interests of the kingdom the genius of the people the secret views of particular men as well as the disposition of parties in his public capacity he was stugal of the money of the nation without cramping its exertions with penury an oeconomist of his private sortune without the least tineture of avarice though forbidding in his address through the stern gravity of an habitual silence and an ungraceful manner he gained mankind by the apparent sincerity of his character he never kept suitors in an unprofitable suspense he promised nothing that he was not resolved to perform he considered dissimulation as an unmanly breach on veracity he refused with frankness where he could not serve with generosity in the common line of business he showed such an undeviating attention to justice that those who were disappointed by his decisions could not withold their esteem from his impartial conduct though he found it necessary to disguise his own principles he never affected to possess those of others to gain either their support or their favor political timidity was the greatest defect of his mind that passion overcame frequently in his public transactions that sincerity which he uniformly observed in his private conduct the weakness which induced him to adhere in his opinions to the excluded branch of the house of stuart was a kind of virtue he was first placed in the line of fortune and ambition by that family and their confidence in his fidelity and attachment contributed to continue that gratitude which he owed for their many and great favors  observations though the timidity of godolphin was highly unfavourable to the family of stuart it was also productive of bad consequences to his country that weakness being generally known to the leaders of the two parties their clamor and presumption

that the aversion of the queen to his duchess was not to be overcome he carried a surrender of all her places to the foot of the throne on the the anniversary of the birth of the queen he did not as

however were not to commence till the end of five years the funds being so distant the parliament engaged themselves to make an annual provision for the interest in the intermediate time together with this interest the monopoly of a supposed trade to the south sea or coast of peru in america was granted to the proprietors the possessors of the navybills and other public securities were incorporated for this purpose this scheme which was received with eagerness by the commons flattered extremely the vanity of harley himself in his attention for the house of hannover he advised the elector to take stock for the nine thousand pounds due to his family of king williams subsidy his electoral highness excused himself from being concerned in a mercantile company as inconsistent with his dignity he at the same time insinuated to harley that ready money would suit better with the state of his affairs than any concern in public stocks and commerce subjects which he neither studied nor understood hannoverpapers    0  the proposal seems to have raised some doubts in the mind of his highness whether harley intended ever to pay the money he therefore sent particular instructions to kreyenberg his resident at london how to proceed with the chancellor of the exchequer in that affair elector to kreyeberg hannoverpapers    0   affair of the abbe de la bourlie though harley had rendered himself in some degree popular by his conduct in the treasury his seeming backwardness in turning all the whigs out of office had disobliged the highflying part of the tories a kind of opposition was ready to be formed against his measures when an accident which threatened to be fatal raised him beyond the reach of the enemies of his power the abbe de la bourlie a frenchman who had assumed the title of marquis de guiscard had made his escape from his own country for some crime which merited the ultimate animadversion of the law having passed some years before into britain he had the address to persuade the servants of the crown that he could form an insurrection in france that might greatly favor the operations of the confederates against that kingdom thi profligate fellow pretending a zeal for public freedom was encouraged either through the vanity or credulity of the whigministry and gratified with a regiment which served in spain the professed design of this needy adventurer was to restore his country to her ancient liberty to contribute to the execution of his purpose he was placed on board the euglish fleet in the year   0  when a descent under the earl of rivers was intended to be made on the coast of france this assertor of the cause of freedom was however found to be such a tyrant in command that sir cloudesly shovel thought it necessary to set him on shore before the expedition was laid aside publications of the times   or marquis de guiscard the regiment assigned to the pretended marquis having been cut off in the battle of almanza his pay as colonel soon after ceased he long solicited a settled pension in vain his profligacy having recommended him to mr henry st john they lived together for some time in mutual confidence and a community of pleasures a dispute about a mistress or rather concerning a child which neither chose to own had interrupted their intimacy before st john had been advanced through the fall of the whigministry to the office of secretary of state the latter therefore was hardly prevailed upon by his french friend to recommend him as an object worthy of the generosity of the crown he however mentioned the case of guiscard and five hundred pounds a year was ordered for him by the queen harley not only reduced the pension to four hundred pounds but even declined to place it on any fixed establishment the pretended marquis endeavored to obtain redress from the queen but all access to her person was denied reduced to distress by his profligacy and offended at men who had been once his friends he endeavored to reconcile himself to his own country by betraying to the court of france the counsels of the british ministry he entered into correspondence with one morreau a banker at paris to cover his design he sent his letters to portugal enclosed to the earl of portmore who commanded the british troops in that kingdom the earl suspecting some treachery opened the packet and finding that it contained some dangerous intelligence sent it through the hands of his lady to mr harley publications of the times   he stabs harley the marquis was apprehended in st jamess park on the eighth of march by virtue of a warrant from st john as secretary of state ignorant of the laws of the country and conscious of his own crime he thought he could not escape a death of ignominy he fell into a fit of despair in the midst of his disorder he was carried to the cockpit before a committee of the council having possessed himself unobserved of a penknife he resolved to be revenged on those whom he deemed accessory to his ruin when he sound himself completely discovered by his own letters he requested to speak aside to st john but the secretary suspecting his design from the violence of his aspect refused to comply the marquis approaching furiously toward the table stabbed harley right in the breast with the penknife the point meeting by accident the bone the blade broke short near the handle guiscatd insensible of this circumstance redoubled his blows st john starting in the mean time from his chair drew his sword and wounded him in several places the messengers rushing in at the noise threw the assassin on the ground and having bound him carried him to newgate where he soon after died of his wounds hist dangleter    0   harley made earl of oxford and lord treasurer though harleys wound was but slight the very attempt on his life raised a kind of pity that disarmed his enemies the commons addressed the queen upon the occasion in terms highly flattering to the minister when after his recovery he came first to the house he was congratulated at their desire by the speaker in a speech expressive of their high sense of his power if not of his merit to these testimonies of affection from the commons the queen added favors of a more substantial kind she raised harley to the double title of earl of oxford and mortimer on the twentyfourth of may and on the twentyninth of the same month he received the white staff as lordhightreasurer of great britain though his lordship was considered in the double capacity of favorite and minister before this period these new honors and promotions rendered him still more an object of the public attention the adulation of men in office kept pace with his good fortune when he took the oaths in the court of chancery on the first of june sir simon harcourt the lord keeper addressed him in a set speech paying him great compliments on the antiquity of his family his love and encouragement of letters his great abilities in managing the finances of the kingdom and in restoring and preserving public credit printed speech   parallel between him and the earl of rochester the death of lawrence hyde earl of rochester which happened on the second of may was said to have facilitated the sudden rise of harley to the rank of a peer and the office of lord treasurer though rochester on account of his high principles in church and state was by no means agreeable to harley the latter found it necessary to fortify himself against the whigs with his lordships abilities and influence their characters however were so dissimilar that those who knew best the secrets of the cabinet thought they already perceived a mutual coldness rochester was an avowed enemy to all dissimulation harley threw a veil of secrecy importance and reserve even upon trifles the first avowed his attachment to the tory principles the latter suppressed his zeal for whigism as it might defeat his ambitious views rochester loved monarchy and the government of the few over the many and avowed it to the world harley had a bias toward republicanism but carefully concealed it even from his friends the one was haughty and overbearing though a man of sense experience and abilities the other was sensible of his own talents but he was rather conceited than proud though the first complied with the government ever ce the revolution he openly called that event ch a breach upon the constitution as

advantage to their common enemies which might prove fatal to their power menagers negociations passim   coldness between harley and st john but though the death of the earl of rochester delivered harley from one dangerous friend he was still connected with another who endeavored to supplant him in his influence and power this was mr henry st john then secretary of state st john was hated by mrs masham and detested by the queen for the profligacy of his life but he found means to render harley uneasy even in the height and plenitude of his credit and power the slenderness of the tenure upon which he held his office had hurt his pride the minister having resolved upon the scheme of a peace st john became necessary to the accomplishment of his views he was the only person about the court that could speak the french language stuartpap       there was therefore a necessity for retaining him in office to serve in the capacity of interpreter this slight advantage had created in hi mind a contempt of harley suitable to his own vanit and pride an incident had happened in the month o april which placed st john in a kind of independenc on the minister an expedition being planned in the cabinet for the conquest of quebec and the reductio of canada harley refused to gratify mrs masham i some affair relating to the expedition which she mean to turn to her own advantage she resented

excluded family was apparent from their sending to parliament those very persons who had been carried prisoners to london on account of the invasion threatened two years before they affirmed that the kingdom was left naked of troops that upon the first news of an invasion the bank would stop and the funds fail that no tax could be raised no money obtained on the securities established by

effectually prevent that religious jealousy which they deemed the only obstacle to his mounting the british throne stuartpapers        court of st germains and their friends violent measures were

to sound her upon the subject ibid  though she knew his principles she was afraid of explaining herself upon a point so delicate the more violent jacobites however continued to urge that it was the

a prince possessed of virtue and his reign was one continued series of success and good fortune he saw all lombardy conquered by his arms piedmont delivered hungary pacified naples and a great part of the netherlands reduced to obedience his death suddenly changed the whole state of affairs the war undertaken by the grand alliance for preserving the balance of europe was now likely to destroy it

their counsels ever since they possessed themselves of ower the nation ceasing to be amused with unprotable victories began to feel the weight of the war the public debt had grown to a magnitude that terrified peculative men with the approach of public ruin the ppropriation of the produce of severe imposts had derived the people of every prospect of relief from their resent burdens to prevent the increase of these burens was all that could now be expected men therefor in general began to wish sincerely that an honourble end might be put to the war but though the miistry were sufficiently apprized of this disposition in the nation they were afraid of the violence of their political opponents they knew that france encouraged by the death of the emperor would recede from the terms offered to their predecessors and they were no strangers to the advantage which their enemies would derive from such a circumstance they began therefore to feel the ground as they went with great caution and address the queen in an extraordinary message informed her parliament of the death of the emperor and of her own resolution to make the election fall upon his brother the king of spain she told at the same time to the two houses that she hoped to be soon in a condition to put a happy end to the war by a lasting and honorable peace journals april  0   the allies bent on war the intentions of the queen were well understood by her parliament they promised therefore to support her in all her measures for the restoration of the public tranquillity the news of the emperors death had not raised the same pacific disposition in holland a resolution was formed on the contrary to prosecute the war with still greater vigor the minister of the late emperor those of savoy portugal and the german princes were all eager for a continuance of hostilities the emoluments derived from the war were greater than their expectations from peace the generals and those who furnished the troops were equally interested upon this subject the first were swayed by glory and perhaps the less dignified motive of advantage the latter yielded to profit alone the interest of both was another name for the common cause this was the great chain which kept together the confederacy and not the preservation of the balance or the liberties of europe the money of the maritime powers and chiefly of england more than the territories of the house of bourbon was the grand object of those petty tyrants who fed on the blood of subjects whom they let out for slaughter  campaign of      flanders but though great britain had discovered an inclination toward a peace the war was carried on with a degree of vigor on every side the duke of marlborough having left the hague in the end of april assembled hi army near douay in the beginning of may the project of the allies on the side of flanders was to open the campaign with the siege of arras and of cambray the taking of those two important places would have laid open picardy to the banks of the sum the army destined at first for the service might have been sufficient to accomplish that great design but the death of the emperor while it hastened the approach of peace obstructed the operations of war a wellgrounded fear that the french and the partisans of the electors of bavaria and cologn might endeavor to disturb the election of a new emperor obliged the prince of savoy to march with the greatest part of the german troops to the banks of the rhine the marshall de villars strongly posted behind his lines at arleux disappointed all the efforts of marlborough for bringing things to the decision of a battle the duke on bad terms with the ministry foresaw his own disgrace was near he therefore wished earnestly either to overwhelm his political enemies with the splendor of a great victory or at least to retire under the shelter of an action of renown the strong position of the french the resolution of their general not to abandon the fate of the kingdom to the event of a battle deprived the duke of the opportunity which he so much desired having possessed himself of arleux a place considerable only from its commanding the scarpe he was driven from thence by the enemy but he sat down before bouchain in sight of the enemy and took that important place on the thirteenth of september the armies remained in

hist de portugal tom ii  a general languor prevailed on every side of the war both parties fatigued with fruitless hostilities seemed willing to transfer their contests from the field to the cabinet as the death of one prince of the house of austria had roused all europe to arms so the demise of another was destined to restore it to peace on the first of october charles the third king of spain was chosen emperor by the unanimous consent of all the electors the wretched situation of france prevented her from making the least effort against the elevationof her greatest enemy but had she even had the power she ought not to have the inclination to frustrate the election the imperial crown seemed actually to exclude the new emperor from that of spain the great motive of the war was removed from all the confederates it was not the interest of the german princes to place in the hands of their master the power of oppressing themselves it was not to be supposed that either britain or the states after having expended their blood and treasure in breaking the power of one family would raise that of another on its ruins  naval affairs the operations by sea were less important if possible than those by land naval history  the combined fleet of the maritime powers was as usual numerous inactive and expensive the extraordinary charge of the navy of great britain during the war had amounted to twenty millions sterling little advantage was derived from this expense except the reputation of commanding the seas but the glory of a nation it must be confessed can never be purchased at too high a price an expedition intended against quebec and canada failed because the navigation of the river st lawrence was then unknow the squadron employed in that service was persecute

however made by either side to establish conferences to restore the public tranquillity france had derived nothing but an increase of demands from all the proposals she had hitherto laid before the allies the death of the emperor joseph an event of the utmost importance to the house of bourbon had induced the court of versailles to remain on the defensive during the campaign and to trust their fate to the favorable circumstances which might arise in the course of time though the barrier had been broken in a great measure in flanders they found that the progress of the enemy could be still checked by a judicious position of their army behind their lines in spain the aversion of the people to the house of austria and their consequent affection for philip the fifth had raised a domestic force sufficient to check if not to disappoint all the efforts of the allies the nation in an uninterrupted series of hostilities for ten years had caught a martial fire from their very misfortunes the very poverty to which they had been reduced by their own exertions and the depredations of the enemy had rendered them more indifferent about the terms of peace as they had nothing to lose by the

mortifications and to retain in his hands the only means that could render him formidable to his opponents  advances made by them the british ministy had very early become so eager for peace that scare any obstacle remained to obstruct their views but a safe secret and sufficient way to communicate their sentiments to the french king during the embassy of the marshall de tallard to king william one gaultier a priest attended him to england and read mass in the ambassadors chapel at london this man having insinuated himself into the family of the earl of jersey whose lady was a romancatholic remained in britain after the departure of tallard with a professed intention of becoming an useful spy for france during the war which was then apprehended on account of the spanish succession gaultier regarding his own safety more than the interest of his country gave no intelligence of consequence he continued therefore without being suspected in london and divided his time between the duties of his function in the imperial ambassadors chapel and his attention to the family of the earl of jersey that nobleman being connected with the new ministry recommended gaultier as a man whose discretion they could trust and whose obscurity was sufficient to prevent all suspicion of their design m de torcy tom ii   toward a peace the ministry having agreed to the proposal of jersey employed the earl to give verbal instructions to gaultier and to send him immediately to france they signified their own inclinations toward a peace they affirmed that they thought the restoration of the public tranquillity highly necessary to the welfare of great britain they at the same time explained the impossibility of their entering into private and separate negociations with france but they promised that should proposals be made by the french king for renewing the conferences with the states general the british ambassadors should receive such orders as should deprive the dutch of the power of hindering the conclusion of a gneral peace the abbe gaultier having left london in the first week in january arrived in a few days at versailles his proposals were received with an eagerness suitable to the distresses of france but the servants of lewis the fourteenth justly judging that they had more to hope from the facility of the british ministry than from the haughty obstinacy of the states returned a prudent answer they charged the abbe gaultier to inform the earl of jersey that the king would hear no more of peace by the way of holland but that he should be extremely glad to put an end to the war by the interposition of great britain m de torcy tom ii   a memorial from france the abbe having brought back to london this answer the ministry agreed to grant the request of the court of france they however signified their hopes that lewis the fourteenth would not offer conditions to great britain less advantageous than those he had proposed to the states general at the late conferences of gertrudenberg a memorial was accordingly drawn up in form by the court of versailles the british ministry received it in the end of april and transmitted it to the states as a foundation for a general peace the cession of spain to the house of austria was neither promised by france nor insisted on by great britain the death of the emperor had given a new turn to the opinions of the speculative with regard to the balance of power besides the spaniards found themselves capable to defend themselves against the efforts of the allies after the advantage at baheuga

wantonly a war that ceased to have an important obct state of the times ms   preliminary demands though the british minister was eager for peace the egociations were in some measure suspended by the

restoration of the ublic tranquillity the states having complained that the memorial of the court of france was too general to be admitted as a proper foundation for the renewal of the conferences mr prior was sent in company with the abbe gaultier to the court of versailles he was directed only to communicate the demands of great britain which pursuant to the new method lately introduced by the allies were called preliminary articles the memorial which he presented contained the pretensions of the confederates in general and the advantages expected in particular by the british nation sufficient barriers were demanded for the empire and the states on the side of the rhine and in flanders the dutch were to receive security for their commerce the strong places taken from the duke of savoy were to be restored and that prince was to be permitted to possess himself of such towns and districts in italy as were particularly mentioned in the treaties between him and the allies m de

in the protestant line the demolition of dunkirk a new treaty of commerce the cession of gibraltar and portmahon the negrotrade in america some towns as refreshing places for the ships employed in the transportation of slaves to that part of the world the british ministry also demanded that the advantages in commerce already granted or hereafter to be allowed by spain to the most favored nation should be extended to the subjects of great britain that france should either restore or cede the island of new foundland and hudsons bay and streights these articles were by particular desire to remain a profound secret not to be revealed but by the mutual consent of the contracting parties three other conditions of a more general nature were prefixed as absolutely essential to the conclusion of peace a security that the crowns of france and spain should never be united on the same head that satisfaction should be given to all the allies in their just demands that commerce should be thoroughly reestablished and permanently maintained report of the secret committee   menager sent privately to london the powers granted to prior were extremely confined he was only to communicate these preliminary demands to the french ministry and to bring back their answer he insisted therefore on a positive answer in writing containing an absolute consent or a downright refusal to grant either was deemed equally dangerous by france a consent would ruin the trade of that kingdom a refusal might break off the negotiation and involve the house of bourbon in all the miseries of a war which had already been unfortunate beyond the example of former times to avoid those inconveniences the french king proposed to transfer the negociations to london he informed prior that since he was not sufficiently authorized to treat in france he intended on his own part to send a person thoroughly instructed to great britain to treat directly with the ministry under the immediate inspection of the sovereign menager deputy from the city of rouen was the person to whose prudence and knowledge the court of france resolved to trust this important business the terms which menager was instructed to grant were to be confined with regard to the empire to a bare renewal of the treaty of riswick but the french king demanded as an essential condition the restoration of the electors of cologn and bavaria to their dominions honors and dignities he pretended for himself to the restitution of lisle tournay air bethune and douay de torcy tom ii   the negotiation becomes public the journey of prior as well as its object remained a secret from the public till he returned to england accmpanied by menager in the first week of august having landed from a small vessel at deal he was detained by the customhouse officers till he was released by orders from london one mackay was the person whose intemperate vigilance made this unseasonable discovery this busy man having imposed himself upon king william as a spy upon the court of st germains had been gratified with a commission to direct the packetoats at dover in gratitude for what he had received and perhaps in expectation of more he held a constant orrespondence with the secretary of states office mixng a great deal of conjecture with a small portion of intelligence when prior passed clandestinely from dover to calais mackay wrote to mr secretary st john that an english gentleman had taken his passage to france st john to conceal the affair from the public desired mackay to keep the thing a secret and to watch the mans return  by accident these instructions were better followed by mackay than st john intended that officious servant employed all his people between the forelands to watch the return of prior he at length had advice that a vessel had landed at deal three persons with secretary st johns pass he made haste to canterbury and met there his old acquaintance matthew prior under a feigned name mackay dispatched immediately an express to the duke of marlborough then besieging bouchain with this important intelligence he informed also the earl of sunderland of what he had heard and seen and that nobleman

the heavy burdens of an unprofitable war they affirmed that the death of the emperor had changed the whole face of afairs that the dangers which the war was intended  prevent were now likely to arise from its success that a prince of the house of austria succeeding to the empire and the hereditary dominions of his family and possessing already the spanish territories in italy would be a more formidable king of spain than any prince of the house of bourbon when excluded from the succession of france that the balance of power in europe would be effectually destroyed by such a measure that the only thing to be expected from a peace that should place charles the third on the spanish throne would be a renewal of hoftilities that to restore the balance which such a measure must inevitably destroy the whole fabric built at the expense of so much treasure and blood must be destroyed by the same hands by which it was raised to reconcile the nation to the cession of spain to the house of bourbon they affirmed that the dependence of philip the fifth on french councils would certainly cease at the death of his grandfather an event not far distant considering the great age of that prince and they closed their arguments with observing that the total cession of the spanish monarchy to the house of austria was now a thing impracticable as that monarchy was actually dismembered by the

infidious and insufficient the peace to be expected from them unsafe and dishonorable but neither oxford nor his associates were now to be intimidated from the prosecution of their pacific designs to testify at once to the world their resolution to adhere to the preliminaries offered by france they ordered the imperial minister to come no more to court and to make preparations for quitting the kingdom the precipitate vehemence of that minister rendered in some measure necessary a proceeding which was as unusual as it was severe he spoke in open and high terms again the measures of the

peers of great britain in every respect except in voting in the house of lords or sitting in judgment on a peer that having transferred their right of voting to sixteen of their own number they had

alleviation in the characters of mankind some allowances must be made for their passions and frailties the attention to interest which passed through the whole conduct of marlborough might suggest to his prudence to quit the fortunes of a man apparently destined for ruin his spirit might induce him to oppose king william as the cold reserve neglect and aversion of that prince might offend his pride in this state of mind his lordship could hardly separate the interest of the kingdom from that of the king and he informed the french court of the expedition against breast more with a design of

victories yet his conduct has been much less praised than his good fortune some affirmed that he was not fond of exposing his own person in action swifts four years  others said that his apparent perturbation of spirits in the hour of battle was as little consistent with his usual carriage as it was with true courage but neither of these charges seem to be well founded an uninterrupted chain of success through a course of many years cannot justly be ascribed to chance alone and personal courage can never be denied with justice to a man who has been accused by his enemies to have delighted in war publication of the times queens speech dec         in his political capacity the duke was certainly timid his misfortunes proceeded from that very defect of his character in his principles for notwithstanding what his enemies affirm he had some he was certainly a high tory he possessed a subserviency of manner a habit inseparable from men bred in courts that suited the most extravagant pretensions of royalty to this circumstance more perhaps than to gratitude ought to be ascribed his manifest attachment to the excluded branch of the family of stuart to a sincerity in this respect was owing in fact his continual professions to the court of st germains they were in themselves neither an object of hope nor of fear and therefore they were little calculated to gratify either ambition or avarice he was distrusted by them perhaps more than he deserved had he been possessed of a daring boldness suitable to his great influence fame and power he might probably have placed the pretender on the throne all his passions at length were either subdued or extinguished by the love of money and to that unhappy circumstance must be ascribed the ruin of his reputation upon the whole if marlborough is less to be admired than some other distinguished statesmen and generals it is perhaps because his secret intrigues and actions are better known  reflections the fate of his reputation after his fall may be considered as a kind of proof that too much was known even then of his private conduct the news of his dismission was received like a common occurrence no tumults no clamours excepting the complaints of the writers of some pamphlets succeeded that event the greatest subject in europe sunk into a private station without the sound of his fall being heard his consequence with his own party vanished with his commission his own usual good temper forsook him with his good fortune he became querulous wrathful violent revengeful from directing the affairs of europe he sunk into an inferior tool of a faction the preeminence which he possessed when in office ceased when he became a private man his wealth his former reputation his splended actions only contributed by their contrast to render his present condition more abject the vulgar though sometimes more generous than their superiors instead of applauding his conduct persecute him with insults

satire fly without intermision even the most invulnerable fame must give way besides the duke himself was conquered in his ow mind instead of that dignified coolness that was deemed a part of his

 stuartpapers hannoverpapers   he is unjustly censured for prosecuting though marlborough showed less apathy than was expected from his former character his enemies furnished him with sufficient reasons for his resentment the accusation which chiefly ruined his credit with the nation now appears to have been malicious and unjust he was said to have sacrificed the war in spain to his own operations in flanders to gratify his ambition and to glut his inordinate avarice his enemies in parliament alluding to the strength of the french barrier made use of a vulgar phrase which made a great impression on a people who were heartily tired of the war they said that to endeavor to subdue france by attacking her strong towns on the side of flanders was taking the bull by the horns that instead of expelling philip the fifth from spain the troops and treasure of the confederates were thrown away on unimportant sieges and attacks upon almost impregnable lines that the prince of savoy himself as he profited like marlborough by hostilities in flanders had contrived to unite with him in influencing through the pensionary heinsius the councils of the states and that all the three meant nothing by the undecisive campaigns in flanders but to protract their own power which was likely to terminate with the war  the war in flanders there is nothing however more certain than that to push france on the side of flanders was the infallible way of depriving the house of bourbon of the crown of spain the war in the latter kingdom had been carried on always with a degree of spirit and often with great success but at the end of ten years philip the fifth was more firmly established on the throne than at the beginning of the contest the distance of the consederates from the place of action the necessity of conveying every thing by sea the sterility of the country itself the indolence of the inhabitants which deprived their enemies as well as themselves of the necessaries of war the religious prejudices of the native spaniards against a prince supported by troops whom they called heretics had all combined to confirm the knowing and judicious in the opinion that spain was no to be conquered within its own limits on the other hand though the strong barrier of france in flanders must necessarily have cost to the confederates much time a great deal of treasure and a multitude of lives the work was at length almost finished another campaign would probably have enabled the allies had they continued united to penetrate into france and even t advance to paris the fate of the french monarch itself must have depended perhaps on the issue of a single battle lewis the fourteenth to save his crown would have been obliged to pull his grandson in a manner with his

his professions were considered as so many baits to deceive but in a happy enthusiasm for his own religious opinions or perhaps ultimately to gain the favor of that family most likely to succeed he seemed determined to exclude all resentment and to show that he was a much more sincere friend than his adversaries to the succession of the electoral family  he discovers by an accident in this disposition of mind the earl of oxford was as much afraid of the tories as he was of the principal whigs his great desire when he assumed the administration of affairs was to retain the most moderate

endeavored by large promises to gain the emperor to his measures through his ambassador at london that minister however construing oxfords advances to his inability of supporting himself advised his master to reject his proposals and to adhere to the whigs he affirmed that there was no reason to apprehend the tories durst conclude a separate peace with france or offend the populace by giving

court of vienna being known to one netterville and to pen the noted quaker he informed the earl of oxford by their means of the discoveries he had made he placed the papers to the number of twentyfour in his hands among other matters of importance they contained the resolution of the duke of savoy to adhere to the pacific measures of queen anne together with a letter from the king of portugal to the emperor importing that he was resolved to put an end on his part to the war they contained also a scheme for dethroning the queen and another in case that should sail for continuing the war for two years these papers being laid by the treasurer before her majesty made such an impression that she instantly resolved to conclude a separate peace with france ibid   and whigs the earl of oxford apprized opportunely of these intrigues paid no attention to the complaints and representations of the count de galas plunket finding that minister dejected on account of his being slighted by the queens ministers endeavored to gain him over to the interests of the pretender but the whigs having formed many visionary projects for disappointing the peace the count resolved to adhere to their party plunket having failed in gaining his favor resolved to alarm his fears he told him that a design was on foot for marrying the pretenders sister to charles the twelfth of sweden that charles from a prospect of the succession to the british crown in the right of his intended spouse would assist the pretender with a protestant army that there would be no difficulty in transporting troops from sweden to scotland and that a prince of charless high military reputation and genius would find little difficulty in establishing his brotherinlaw in a kingdom where he had so many and so zealous friends the ambassador carried this intelligence to the whigs they were alarmed beyond measure they sent to the court of hannover for an agent capable of supporting in concern with themselves the interests of the electoral family the baron de bothmar arrived accordingly in london in the month of november in company with the duke of marlborough and the memorial presented in the name of the elector against the peace was the result of conferences between the ministers of that prince and the leaders of the whigparty stuartpapers      mss passim penes    oxfords prudence had not the attachment of the earl of oxford to the electoral family interfered this measure might have proved fatal to the succession according to the act of settlement the whole body of the tories the house of commons and above all the queen herself were to the last degree offended the dukes of buckingham and shrewsbury together with the majority of the cabinetcouncil proposed to send bothmar in the custody o a messenger out of the kingdom stuartpapers       the earl of oxford perceiving the danger of this resolution opposed i with address and effect he represented that the peac was not sufficiently advanced to trust the terms to the court of france that the mob alarmed by their habitual fears of popery would become clamorous and joi the whigs that the jacobites would turn insolent and that in short the whole kingdom would become a scene of anarchy and confusion the whigs perceiving that bothmars memorial produced no effect flew with the usual vehemence of party into another scheme they sent to the prince of savoy to come immediately to london the object of his journey was to lay before the queen and the parliament the necessity of continuing the war he was also to provide himself with proofs that france had bought peace from the british court for money upon this accusation the whigs having a majority in the house of lords were to send two or three of the cabinetcouncil to the tower plunket having received intelligence of these schemes from his friend the emperors agent then at the hague conveyed the whole to the earl of oxford stuartpapers        whigs send for prince eugene his character though the intelligence furnished by plunket was the principal reason for the resolute measures of the earl of oxford he owed the preservation of his power and perhaps ultimately his life to the happy but unaccountable delay of prince eugene though a caution which his enemies called political timidity might present the duke of marlborough from adopting violent measures there was no security against the schemes of the prince a man of great abilities unconfined by principle sanguine in his views as determined in the execution of his designs as he was bold in undertaking the most desperate measures he kept one great object his own ambition perpetually in view he pushed forward in one direct line to that distinguished point he regarded obstacles only as to their difficulty of being removed he valued little the means he used as he was taught by his pride that every thing calculated to extend his own greatness was allowable if not just in this disposition of eugenes mind the only safety of the ministry consisted in his absence from london but the slow counsels of the house of austria proved according to custom highly favorable to their enemies the prince was detained at the hague till the season of his being useful in london was past the earl of oxford apprized of the designs of his enemy had time to fortify himself against his attacks and thus by the incontinence of a secretary and the address of an obscure jesuit much mischief was prevented and europe ultimately restored to tranquillity  a majority made in the house of lords the earl of oxford long perplexed with difficulties became at length resolute through his very fears he dismissed the duke of marlborough from all his employments but this measure was not sufficient to secure him against the designs of the whigs though the house of commons were subservient to his wishes there was also a necessity of gaining a majority to the measures of the court in the house of lords the excluded party had acquired courage as well as reputation under the approbation of one branch of the legislature to deprive them of that advantage was to pursue with effect the victory already gained by the ministry by the removal of the duke a sudden resolution was taken to command the deliberations of the house of lords by the creation of twelve new peers the measure was deemed arbitrary and dangerous but it could not be called illegal it served only to show the party that an opposition is formed in vain against the crown in an assembly whose number of members depends on the will of the prince the lords having met on the second of january the new peers were introduced they had scarce taken their seats when they were called upon service a motion was made to adjourn the house to the fourteenth of the month the day to which the commons had adjourned upon a division the majority for the court appeared to be thirteen    against     the violence of the party increased with this reverse of fortune though the means used to defeat their efforts in the house of lords were obvious and might have been foreseen they had derived hopes that the prerogative could not be exerted from the timid characte of the queen stuartpapers        prince eugene in london three days after the untoward discovery made by  whigs of their own weakness the prince of savoy s long and so eagerly expected by the party arrived i london the ministry knowing his designs resolve to watch his motions the earl of oxford sent o drummond a dependant of his own to meet him in the river st john dispatched upon the same service a mr brinsden an oculist an agent in whom he could confide the prince obtained an audience of the queen but he was coldly though politely received she referred him for business to oxford and st john the only persons present at their interview the whigs were much elevated at the arrival of his highness in a conjuncture so critical to their affairs even such tories as carried their principles to the height of jacobitism were not displeased they were no strangers to the principles or rather the views of the earl of oxford in favor of the family of hannover they knew that to defeat the peace was to ruin the minister nothing but the fear of falling into the hands of the whigs had induced them to support the court had the leaders of the latter party followed a more moderate line of conduct the earl of oxford must have fallen by the hands of his supposed friends in the preceding autumn the adherents of the excluded family had discovered that they could form no hopes to their cause on the favor of the lordtreasurer neither the queen nor her favorite now lady masham were ignorant of this circumstance but both dreaded what they called the tyranny of the whigs should the lordtreasurer by the desertion of the tories be forced to resign  his projects the prince of savoy had formed no doubt of being able to defeat the treaty of peace by embarrassing the british ministry with splendid offers of advantage for continuing the war he had resolved to propose in the name of the emperor to leave great britain in absolute possession of the commerce of spain and america to induce the king of denmark and the czar of muscovy to join in the grand confederacy to make up the imperial forces in spain to thirty thousand men to pay one million of crowns out of four to be expended in the military operations on that side should either house of parliament accept these terms in opposition to the ministry the elector of hannover was to have passed into great britain with an army de torcy tom ii stuartpapers      mss penes me  a revolution to be made in favor of that prince would enable him to carry on the war to the last extremity against the house of bourbon but when prince eugene perceived that the commons were firm in their support of the ministry that a majority had been secured in the house of lords that the duke of marlborough was disgraced and rendered incapable to second his views that the whigs though obstinate in their opposition were divided in their councils that men of influence and property were inclined to a peace that the mob of london were only clamorous for war he resolved to spare no sort of violence to accomplish his views  schemes of marlborough in forming his measures the prince of savoy resolved to consult chiefly the duke of marlborough and the baron de bothmar the hannoverian envoy extraordinary at the court of london the duke at their first interview chided the prince for the unfortunate delay in his journey his arrival he said might have been of great advantage to the party about a month before he ascribed his dilatoriness to that austrian gravity which had been often fatal to the affairs of the imperial family he told him that at the opening of the session their friends had a majority in the house of lords that they could have sent two or three of the opposite party to the tower without any difficulty that their vacant places might be supplied with men willing to continue the war that now the whole state of affairs was changed that twelve new peers had been created that the scottish peers were arrived that they must have recourse to violence or drop altogether their design that three or four persons together with the lordtreasurer who possessed the confidence of a silly woman hannoverpapers       and governed her at pleasure must be removed that the prince must in the mean time behave himself with great moderation and discretion that he should endeavor to gain the good opinion of the minister and induce the commons to grant ample supplies and that the whole party should watch such accidents as might arise in the progress of time m de torcy tom ii stuartpapers        and of the baron de bothmar the duke descended from these particular facts to reflections more general he affirmed that the state of the kingdom at present resembled its situation at the late revolution that the disorders were similar and demanded the same remedies that should a prince of the electoral family appear in great britain under the cover of a manifesto setting forth that the pretender was coming with a popish army the mob might be deceived and queen anne like her father would steal away to france that then the crown might be settled by the whigs and the war be carried on with redoubled vigor these observations devolved the discourse on the baron de bothmar he averred that though the disorders might be the same the same remedies were impracticable that the nation was not sufficiently prepared for a revolution that the prejudices of the vulgar the great engine in such daring enterprises were still upon the side of the enemy that though the queen was suspected of favoring a popish successor she herself was a strict protestant that the jealousy concerning religion was too feeble on account of the distance of the danger that though circumstances had even been more favorable the experiment would be extremely dangerous that a miscarriage would inevitably ruin the undertaking load the family of hannover with the public hatred and exclude them from the succession to the crown the duke of marlborough suffered himself to be argued out of his observations by the eloquence of the baron de bothmar but he is said to have proposed another project more safe and equally effectual he suggested that bands of ruffians should be sent through the streets by night to insult the inhabitants to raise disturbances and to excite mobs that should people become accustomed to these nocturnal alarms there would be no difficulty in assassinating such persons as the party might wish to remove and to throw the whole blame on a licentious band mem de torcy tom ii stuartpapers        prince eugenes violent proposal though prince eugene rejected this project his own was not distinguished with more humanity he proposed to set fire to london in different places in the night particularly to the palace of st jamess where the queen resided he showed that the proper time for the execution of this design was when the guards on duty were commanded by an officer whom the party could trust that in the midst of the confusion the duke of marlborough should appear at the head of a party in arms that he should first possess himself of the tower the bank the exchequer that then he should seize the person of the queen force her to dissolve the parliament to call a new representative to make a free inquiry into the clandestine correspondence with france to punish the guilty with death mem de torcy tom ii mss passim  the lords summers cowper and halifax were consulted upon this scheme they refused at first to declare their own opinion but they at last absolutely rejected the violent proposal of the prince they signified their inclination to proceed in the legal and ordinary way they advised bothmar to present a second memorial in the name of his master more clear more positive and more comprehensive than the former but though bothmar agreed to all the schemes in which the whigs were only concerned he shrunk back when it became his own part to act he told them that by presenting such a memorial without the express orders of the elector he should risk his head that therefore he was resolved to extend his aid no farther than to compose a writing containing the strongest expressions against the peace and that this anonymous paper should be printed in holland and published and dispersed in london ibi   his further schemes disappointed disappointed in his views by the caution of the whigs and the timidity of bothmar the prince of savoy laid before his party another plan he proposed that the elector of hannover should be appointed commander in chief of the troops in flanders and governorgeneral in the netherlands that to strengthen the whigs the electoral prince should pass into england to awe the ministry by appearing at the head of their enemies marlborough and godolphin opposed this measure wit great vehemence they affirmed that the tories t a man were enemies to the electoral family tha should the prince of hannover come over whilst they ar in possession of the government the abrogation of the act of settlement would be the necessary consequence an that a civil war might arise perhaps as fatal to the nation as that between the houses of york and lancaster but the duke of marlborough was urged by stronger motives than the miseries to be entailed on his country the credit of his enemies daily increased his own declined he had already felt a change of fortune he was afraid of further vicissitudes the emperor had provided him with an estate in germany out of the spoils of the elector of bavaria he had dignified him with the title of prince but though this settlement had secured a quiet retreat it was not sufficient to satisfy his ambition he had turned his eyes to the command of the imperial troops in flanders with the title of vicar general of that country he therefore could not approve of a project that placed the elector in a station which he wished to obtain for himself mem de torcy tom ii mss passim   disgusted with the conduct of the whigs the prince enraged at the difficulties raised against all his projects declared that he perceived the whigs were no more friends to the house of hannover than the tories that they were enemies to all regal government and biassed in favor of a republic ibid papers  but that if he judged aright they were as unfit for establishing that form of government as they were incapable of supporting it with patriotism and unanimity that their proposal to enable the emperor to carry on the war by a loan on the revenue of his hereditary dominions was either captious or visionary that their schemes throughout were either speculative or impracticable that the ideal fabric raised by one was sure of being overturned by the objections of another that they seemed to him like those vain men who were reported of old to employ themselves in building the tower of babel that there were not three among them that agreed either in sentiment or in nguage that sometimes they would have the prince of hannover that at other times they were averse from  sovereigns whether by succession or election to the hrone that he perceived the greatest number longed ore for power and emolument than for any change of easures that without any attachment either to the milies of princes or forms of government they wished to manage the nation by a factious aristocracy that for his own part he was only vexed that they obliged the emperor to make demands from which he should be forced to desist letter from prince eugene feb         stuartpapers        consternation of the queen and ministry the

in the neighborhood some troops were appointed to attend prince eugene under a show of defending him against the pressure of the mob but in reality to watch his motions they were informed that under the pretense of a tumult among the populace some persons employed by the prince and his party were to force their way to the earl of oxford and to assassinate him together with mr st john and the lord keeper sir simon harcourt the queen was terrified beyond measure oxford to protect himself and to encourage his mistress occupied apartments in the palace the lord keeper and the secretary took care not to venture abroad after it was dark but amidst this alarm the minister and his threatened associates conducted themselves with commendable prudence in concealing their apprehensions of danger had they carried the intelligence they had received to the council at large or above all had it been laid before the parliament the nation might have been kindled into a degree of frenzy against the projectors of such dangerous schemes the imprudence of the baron de bothmar in being privy to these consults might have even endangered the succession in the protestant line men would scarce take time to distinguish the assiduous folly of the servant from a settled design in the master to obtain the throne by unjustifiable means  the jacobites wish to lay the whole before parliament the dukes of buckingham and shrewsberry in their attachment to the excluded branch of the stuarts were very unwilling to suffer a discovery so favorable to their principles to pass without being laid before the parliament though the proofs furnished by plunket and others were sufficient to convince mankind of the reality of a conspiracy they were not deemed complete in the eye of the law oxford endeavored to conceal even from the cabinetcouncil the informations he had received against the prince of savoy he subjected them however to the inspection of the queen plunket thinking that eugene should be committed to prison had sent a detail of the whole by the hands of the earl of yarmouth to the duke of buckingham and to harcourt the lord keeper they laid it instantly before the rest of the cabinet the earl of oxford was alarmed he knew their principles and he was afraid of their violence he entreated them to make no motion in the business they affirmed that the thing concerned them too nearly to be dropped without examination they ordered plunket to appear but oxford carried him first to queen anne the duke of buckingham brought him before the cabinet he was examined with strictness they promised to provide for him during life for his services they ordered him to repair to holland to induce by promises the friend from whom he had received the prince of savoys papers to come to london to lay the whole proceedings of the confederates and whigs before the parliament and the nation stuartpapers      ms passim   they are prevented by oxford the earl of oxford opposed this measure with various arguments he said that to employ a roman catholic upon that service would furnish the whigs with a popular ground for clamor that the scrutiny into their conduct would offend the allies in a degree that might prove extremely dangerous that a court that would expose such secrets to parliament could never afterward be trusted that the differences which must ensue between the confederates and the court of london would enable france to prescribe her own terms and that great britain from being the umpire of the affairs of europe would sink into contempt these solid reasons were however rejected the principles of buckingham overcame the art of oxford plunket was sent to holland he prevailed with his friend to consent to come to england upon the promise of a provision for life but he insisted to have that promise under the hand of the secretary of state though the affair belonged properly to the secretarys office the earl of oxford took the whole into his own department plunket informed him of the german agents demands but he kept the letter from the inspection of the cabinetcouncil he in the mean time amused plunket and contrived to employ him in holland as the only means to prevent the cabinetcouncil from making public this disagreeable and dangerous affair stuartpapers      ms passim   his artful and cautious conduct the earl of oxford through the whole of this trying scene behaved like a man whose passions lay subdued by his principles though he was no stranger to the designs of his enemies against his mistress though he was informed of their schemes against his own person though those who supported his measures upbraided him for his conduct he proceeded considering his situation with great moderation and circumspection the violence of the whigs more than the vehemence of the tories had forced him into the measures of which the first of those parties so much complained he was unwilling to disgrace marlborough he was equally averse from persecuting that nobleman in parliament when the commons swayed by toryprinciples animadverted upon the duke and his adherents the earl of oxford had proofs in hands against them that would infallibly ruin their reputation with the people and might even endanger their lives though insulted stigmatized and persecuted by the baron de bothmar though liable to the violence of that imprudent resident and subject to his secret and dangerous conspiracies though distrusted by the princess sophia suspected by the elector and hated by the whole electoral family he seemed to place himself above resentment and to encourage hopes that his conduct would ultimately contradict the misrepresentations of his enemie and gain the confidence and even the gratitude of the presumptive heirs of the crown to accomplish a purpo laudable in itself he made afterward use of a deceptio less consistent with honor than with true or perhaps necessary policy mss passim      stuartpapers hannoverpapers   proceedings of the commons during these secret intrigues dangerous conspiracies and clandestine designs the parliament proceeded along the obvious line of public business the two houses having met on the fourteenth of january were required by a message from the queen to adjourn themselves further to the seventeenth of the month her majesty ordered the secretary of state to acquaint the commons that her plenipotentiaries had arrived at utrecht and had already opened the conferences for the speedy reestablishment of the public tranquillity that to secure the conclusion of peace by appearing provided for war all preparations were made for opening an early campaign she therefore requested the house to give the necessary dispatch to the supplies she concluded with complaining of the licentiousness of the press which was become too great to be restrained by the laws in force and she recommended to the house to find a remedy equal to the mischief the answer of the commons was suitable to their principles and their usual obsequiousness to the views of the queen they thanked her for her promise to communieate to them the terms of the peace they reflected on such persons as had spread groundless and malicious reports against her councils they promised dispatch in the supplies they assured her that they would take the most effectual course to stop the licentiousness of false and scandalous libels journals jan      animadversions on the whigs walpole expelled to these assurances to the queen the commons added animadversions on those who opposed the measures of the crown having taken under consideration the report of the commissioners of public accounts they found that mr robert walpole had been guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption upon the oath of one of his agents it appeared that walpole had received five hundred guineas and a note for five hundred more for two contracts made by him when secretary at war for supplying the troops in north britain with forage though the shameful venality of this man deserved punishment his connection with the former ministry was more the object of resentment than his offense he was expelled from his seat in the house and committed to the tower ibid  the commons passed from the affair of robert walpole to a censure on the duke of marlborough upon examining the charge against that nobleman for having taken money of the contractors for bread and breadwaggons and for deducting for his own use two and one half per cent from the pay of the foreign troops in flanders in the pay of great britain they came to a resolution that the duke in receiving those sums had been guilty of unwarrantable and illegal practices their vote was laid by the whole house before her majesty the attorney general was directed to prosecute the duke but either no prosecution was ever commenced or it was carried on with a languor that defeated its design to throw disgrace on marlborough was more the object of the minister than the refunding of the public money to accomplish the first the commons extended their animadversions to his family and servants adam cardonnel his secretary was soon after expelled the house for practices similar to those of his lord feb      the barrier treaty examined during these animadversions on the former ministry the conduct of the commons was calculated to facilitate the present measures of the crown jan     the viscount townshend whom marlborough had associated with himself in the negociations for peace in   0  had concluded a treaty with the states of the united provinces with regard to a barrier in flanders for the dutch at the end of the war in concluding this treaty townshend in a compliance with the views of his party had exceeded his instructions lisle tournay menin douay and several places on the lys and the scheld were guaranteed to the states the most of those cities were in themselves an essential barrier to france it could not therefore be supposed that she would yield for the portion of her enemies what was necessary for her own security an obstruction to the peace which might ultimately defeat the design of the congress threatened to

ignorant that the whigs and perhaps the states themselves pretended that this perilous period was already arrived stuartpapers debates in parliament   and its authors censured the barrier treaty and the instructions upon which it had been concluded by townshend with all the letters that had passed upon the subject were successively laid before the commons the baron de bothmar with his usual imprudence made his master a party in favor of the treaty he wrote in vehement terms to mr secretary st john printed   he threatened several members of the lower house with the resentment and vengeance of the elector should they proceed to censure the persons concerned though this conduct could scarce be supposed to proceed from instructions from hannover the enemies of that court improved the circumstance to favor their own views the more credulous part of the commons were induced to believe the suggestions of an intended invasion and the reports of a designed revolution the most spirited were offended at this unseasonable interference with the resolutions of a body who had a right to be independent of every external power when therefore the affair of the barrier came to the vote the commons resolved that several articles of the treaty were destructive to the trade and interest of great britain that the lord townshend had neither orders nor authority to conclude these pernicious articles that therefore he who negociated and signed the treaty was an enemy to the queen and kingdom the states interfered in vain in a letter to the queen herself ibid  the ministry having resolved on a peace were determined to remove every obstacle that stood in the way  inquiry into the conduct of the allies in prosecution of this design the commons were encouraged to examine the conduct of the allies with regard to their furnishing their respective quotas for the war this inquiry opened a scene which contributed to increase the great desire of the people for peace it appeared that not one of the confederates except great britain had fulfilled any one of their engagements that the emperor in particular who had most to gain by the was contributed the least toward its expense that the states of the united provinces had not come up in any article to the terms of their treaties that the king of portugal and the duke of savoy made a lucrative trade of the war by extracting from their friends the advantages which they ought to conquer from their enemies the commons came to various resolutions on this important subject the princes and states who composed the confederacy were treated with great freedom in the debates the complaints of their respective ministers were joined by the clamours of the excluded party they affirmed that the emperor who was the acknowledged head of the alliance was attacked with unbecoming disrespect that the duke of savoy to whose spirit and activity the allies owed the conquest of italy was unworthily treated that the states the faithful allies and even the benefactors of the british nation were insulted and all this to facilitate a dishonorable treaty to please a faithless enemy who presumed to dictate the terms of peace after having been almost totally subdued in the war hst dangleterre hist of europe      debate   the whigs carry an address in the house of lords while the ministry carried forward with safety their measures under the protection of the commons an unexpected incident gave to their enemies a transitory superiority in the house of lords the queen in a message of the seventeenth of january had recommended the reconsideration of the duke of hamiltons patent the peers having adjourned the business from day to day seemed at length by dropping their debates without coming to a decision to adhere to their former resolution the lords who represented the peerage of scotland resolved to sit no more in an assembly that refused to acknowledge what they deemed their undoubted right the whigs improved this secession to their own advantage the specific offers received at utrecht by the plenipotentiaries of france on the first of february having found their way into the dutch newspapers were laid before the peers by the lord halifax on the fifteenth of that month he moved that an address should be presented to the queen signifying the indignation of the house against the terms offered by the french king and promising to stand by and assist her majesty with their lives and fortunes in prosecuting the war with the utmost vigor the motion was carried by a considerable majority but this good fortune of the whigs was not destined to last long the scottish peers were induced to resume their seats and their weight turned again the balance in favor of the ministry

conclusion of the peace the prince of savoy whose negociations with the ministry had languished into formal memorials and official answers relinquished all hopes of the object of his voyage to london to preserve appearances mr secretary st john was commanded to lay before the house of commons a proposition made by the prince in the name of his imperial majesty for the support of the war in spain the message represented that the emperor judged forty thousand men would be sufficient for that service that his imperial majesty offered to make up his troops in that kingdom to thirty thousand men and to take upon himself one fourth part of the expenses of the spanish war journals feb     to the great mortification of the prince not the least notice was taken by the house of his proposal the message lay disregarded on the table he himself made preparations for returning to the continent but he remained some weeks after this event in london the queen informed of his secret intrigues with the whigs gave way to all the terrors incident to her sex she considered herself in the utmost danger as long as the prince remained in england repeated messages were sent that the yacht ordered to transport him to holland was ready to sail she at length became so uneasy that she is said to have resolved to send away by force a person so dangerous to her repose stuartpapers       but the prince prevented this disgrace by embarking at greenwich on the seventeenth of march public melligence   congress opened at utrecht during these transactions in the british parliament the conferences for restoring peace to europe were opened at utrecht the plenipotentiaries of great britain and france together with those of the states met in form for the first time on the eighteenth of january though the earl of strafford and the bishop of bristol had received orders to hasten the great work of peace they were not sufficiently instructed with regard to the article of spain which must necessarily form the foundation of the treaty this secret was reserved by the ministry for mr prior who was expected in quality of third plenipotentiary from great britain the british plenipotentiaries confined in their powers conversed still with those of france in the style of enemies they declared that the articles signed by menager ought rather to be considered as propositions than preliminaries that they were neither binding on the queen nor considered in the least as binding on the allies this declaration composed in some degree the spirits of the confederates the emperor himself consented to send plenipotentiaries to utrecht the peace depended not on that prince though the war had been undertaken in his cause the confederates as well as the french perceived that the fate of the treaty was involved in the resolutions of the queen of great britain but an unexpected incident threw to an uncertain distance the tranquillity that was suddenly expected by all the belligerent powers  death of the princes of france in the month of april of the preceding year the dauphin of france the only son of lewis the fourteenth died at the age of fifty he was a prince of a limited capacity fond of tranquillity and averse from business as he was unequal to its toils he was succeeded in the title of heir of france by his son the duke o burgundy a man of more fire greater vivacity an better abilities than his father but he also died on the eighteenth of february having survived only six day his wife the dauphiness mary adilaide of savoy these events so satal to the royal family of france were followed in a few days more by the death of the duke o britany the last dauphins eldest son they were a buried together in the same grave this uncommon mortality was ascribed by the vulgar to the ambition and intrigues of the duke of orleans this perhaps was b an idle report but the profligate pleasures of that prince had induced mankind to form the worst opinion of his morals out of three sons born to the duke of burgundy the duke of anjou a sickly infant only remained the misfortunes of france raised the courage of such of the confederates as were eager for continuing the war the emperor rose in his hopes and increased his demands the states grew more obdurate the british ambassadors became more cool in their zeal the ministry either did not choose or durst not send prior as third plenipotentiary to utrecht they concurred with the rest of the confederates in demanding new precautions for the stability of the peace and for preventing the crowns of france and spain from being joined on the head of the same prince mem de torcy tom ii swifts four years   alternatives offered by great britain notwithstanding these demands on the part of great britain the ministry made no secret of their resolution to conclude a peace the lordtreasurer dispatched a mr harley a relation of his own to utrecht he directed the abbe gaultier who still resided in london to propose different alternatives out of which the french king might form a proposal that ought to satisfy the allies of great britain harley was charged with the like commission the plenipotentiaries stopped the progress of the conferences they said that he had brought such orders as would break off all negotiation unless the court of france should agree to one of the alternatives offered by the abbe gaultier in the name of the queen of great britain the memorial of gaultier represented the just alarm of europe should the person who was actually king of spain ever ascend to the throne of france he showed that this danger was far from being chimerical as this prince was so near the succession of the latter kingdom that the only way to prevent the danger apprehended by the confederates was for philip the fifth to transfer his right to the duke of berry that without this expedient neither the british nation nor their allies would ever consent to a peace which would be in that case not only unsafe but impracticable ibid   arguments of the french king may the french king was embarrassed by an incident which he had actually foreseen he endeavored to elude the demands of the court of great britain to accomplish his purpose he advanced all the trite arguments used by casuists in defense of the hereditary descent of the crown in a letter to the british ministry he affirmed that the king though supreme lord of his dominions has not the power of altering their fundamental laws that the prince next to the crown was the necessary heir that his right is an inheritance which he receives neither from his predecessors nor the people but from the law that when one king dies another succeeds without asking the approbation or requiring the consent of any person that he succeeds not as heir but as master of the kingdom the sovereignty of which belongs to him not by choice but by birthright that he is obliged for his crown to no will of a prior king to no edict to no liberality in another person but to the law that this law is esteemed the work of him who establishes monarchies that god alone can break this first link in the chain which binds together the community that this law can neither be invalidated by agreement nor rendered void by renunciation that should the king of spain renounce his right for the sake of peace that act would only deceive himself and disappoint the allies de torcy tom ii   concerning hereditary right mr secretary st john corresponded with the court of versailles upon this subject he returned an answer less complicated and more decisive he admitted that the french nation might hold that god alone can abolish the law of succession but that in britain most men were of another mind that the most scrupulous on this delicate subject believed that a prince might forego his right by a voluntary resignation that the person in whose favor the renunciation was made might be justly supported by the princes who should happen to be guarantees of the treaty that in short the queen of great britain would put an end to all negotiation unless the french should accept of the expedient proposed that it was neither her design nor inclination to deprive philip either of the title or power of king that she wished upon his resignation of the crown of spain to preserve his right to that of france and to place him on another throne that naples the territories of savoy the duchies of montferrat and mantua should be erected for him into a kingdom that spain and the indies should be conferred on the duke of savoy in place of his own dominions and that upon the event of philips accession to the throne of france the island of sicily should be given to the house of austria de torcy tom ii   june king of spain renounces his title to the french crown though the french king amused st john with arguments in favor of hereditary right he wrote to his grandson to desire him to accede to the proposals of great britain that prince after a delay suitable to the gravity of spanish councils resolved to renounce his precarious prospect of the crown of france for the certain possession of the throne of spain the queen of great britain impatient for various reasons for peace ordered the earl of strafford to return to london the avowed object of his journey was to receive his ultimate instructions to conclude the treaty as soon as the king of spains answer should be received when his answer was accordingly received in the beginning of june the queen agreed to a suspension of arms the conditions of this indulgence to france was the immediate delivery of dunkirk to the british troops and the punctual execution of the article concerning the union of france and spain she proposed at the same time that a dutch garrison should be introduced into cambray the french king deriving spirit from her eagerness rejected this demand with a degree of disdain he declared that he would rather refuse the cessation of hostilities and put an end to all negotiation than admit a clause so contrary to his own honor and the interest of his kingdom the queen anxious for peace receded from her demand st john wrote to the marquis de torcy that to accomplish the cessation of arms he had only to transmit the act of renunciation to the duke of ormond who had succeeded marlborough in the command of the army in flanders ibid  that the earl of strafford had just set out for utrecht that all restraint with regard to the confederates should be laid aside and that the british plenipotentiaries should act in concert with those of france in prescribing laws to such as should refuse to submit to just and reasonable conditions of peace  cause of the anxiety of anne for a peace france owed a change so great and so unexpected to favorable accidents more than to her own policy and intrigues though the british ministry had long perceived that they must either relinquish their power or conclude a peace their late vehemence in carrying on the negociations proceeded from their fears rather than from ambition the queen herself frightened at the real or supposed conspiracies of the whigs was anxious to end the war the support given by the confederates to a party whom she dreaded threw her inclinations in the scale of france and she seemed even willing to derive protection from a prince whose power had been so lately broken by her arms the same attention to her own safety raised her resentment against the presumptive heirs of the crown she was no stranger to the dangerous intrigues of the baron de bothmar she knew that she had been long distrusted by the family of hannover the apprehensions incident to her sex had taken entire possession of her mind though she probably entertained little affection for a brother whom she had never seen though with a zeal suitable to her family she was utterly averse from his system of religious faith and wedded to her own though she was as much afraid of his presence in britain as she was terrified at the coming of a prince of the electoral family she seems to have entered with a degree of warmth into his cause stuartpapers      hannoverpapers        her attachment to the eventual succession the violence of the whigs and the imprudence of the baron de bothmar might have precipitated the measures of anne in concluding the peace but there is reason to believe that her schemes in favor of the pretender were prior to her late fears from the house of hannover when mr menager in the preceding september had finished the business of his master he is said to have endeavored to serve the views of the court of st germains he first opened himself to mr secretary st john he was introduced by his means to mrs masham the queens favorite two articles of importance were settled in this conference the queen desired to be permitted to disown her brother to satisfy the confederates but she agreed that the treaty should not be understood to preclude france from aiding the pretender in case of her own decease mrs masham is said to have declared with freedom the secret sentiments of her mistress she told menager that the queen reckoned it an unhappiness to possess the throne of her brother that she had a secret uneasiness on that head that this was not all her misfortune that she was obliged against her disposition and principles to promote measures calculated to exclude her own family for ever from the throne and that she would be inexpressibly happy to be delivered from the necessity of doing so much wrong stuartpapers   of the pretender to the throne mrs masham at the same time declared that though the queen wished to promote her brothers interest she could fix upon no measure of serving effectually his cause that though a majority of the better sort were attached to the hereditary descent of the crown the common people entertained a mortal aversion to a popish successor that it was utterly impossible to enter into any treaty without confirming the settlement of the crown in the protestant line that she had no hopes but such as arose from the most christian king that she wished to relieve that prince from every obligation of not assisting her brother in case of her own demise that she could not trust her plenipotentiaries but sure said she some reserves may be made for the time to come ibid  sentiments expressed with so little reserve to a foreigner could not have remained a secret to the queens servants such of these as had principles of the same kind were impressed with fears like her own an intelligence so favorable to their views was soon conveyed to st germains the pretender instructed his adherents in both houses of parliament to forward the measures of the crown he was no stranger to the principles of the earl of oxford but he hoped that the bad treatment he daily received from the agents of the court of hannover would at length induce him to oppose their views or at least soften the opposition of that minister to his interest ibid        his party assist the ministry the queen was extremely sensible of the service rendered to her measures by the pretenders adherents stuartpapers       though she had created twelve new peers the majority for government in the house of lords was so slender that every vote was liable to accidents when upon rejecting the duke of hamiltons patent the peers of scotland absented themselves the whigs carried a disagreeable address from the upperhouse to the throne the efforts of the treasurer though he was supposed to have offered weighty arguments upon the subject was not sufficient to recall the refractory scots to their duty in parliament many of them were from principle attached to the pretender resentment had roused others to a determined resolution of opposing all the measures of the whigs a kind of rescript from the court of st germains sent them back to the house of lords ibid  and the opposing party lost all the benefit which they hoped to derive from their shortlived victory the same influence was extended to the house of commons where it was less necessary ibid  the earl of oxford was no stranger to the support he received from the jacobites he resolved therefore to encourage outwardly their views he admitted the agents of the court of st germains into his conversation and intimacy his mysterious character gave an air of importance to his very nods and insinuations he could therefore deceive a race of men blinded by an enthusiastic zeal for their own cause the lady masham adopting the inclinations of her mistress was much in the interest of the pretender her friendship for oxford had long since declined she wrote to m menager on the second of march that the affairs of the court of st germains had fallen into the hands of the treasurer and that he would value himself upon deceiving their hopes and disappointing all their views mss passim   he writes to the queen the pretender himself it must be confessed never believed that the earl of oxford was sincere but he knew that to oppose that minister was to throw the whole into the hands of the whigs the lordtreasurer stood on a dangerous precipice he was detested by both sides the whigs talked of assassination and death the tories threatened to deliver him over to the rage of his political enemies in the midst of this secret ferment the chevalier de st george wrote to the queen he told her that in the present situation it was impossible for him to remain longer silent he put her in mind of the honor and preservation of her own family he assured her of his eternal gratitude should she use any efficacious measures toward his eventual succession to the throne he promised he said the best to himself from her goodnature and humanity he was ready to agree to whatever she might choose to propose for her own interest which he reckoned inseparable from his own the queen was too prudent or perhaps too timid to make any answer to this letter but her inclinations were sufficiently known she even expressed her terror that france would not let him escape from her hands the example of m fourbin who refused to land him in scotland in the year   0  was produced as a presumption that the french king was resolved never to part with a person who might hereafter favor his own designs stuartpapers        artifice of the earl of oxford notwithstanding this anxiety in the queen her fears from the court of hannover seem to have weighed more with her mind than her affection for her brother the intelligence which had been industriously conveyed to her ears concerning domestic conspiracies and foreign invasions had even removed for a time her objections to the popery of the pretender urged by the jacobites and the most violent of the highchurch party she is said to have to resolved to lay before the parliament the secret practices of prince eugene and the dangerous schemes of the baron de bothmar the principles of the earl of oxford had been highly serviceable to the interests of the electoral family though the idle project of an invasion proceeded from the indiscreet zeal of his minister the elector himself had avowed openly his disapprobation of the conduct of the british court the designs of the whigs if these could be proved might by implication be carried home to his highness by his enemies whatever the event of the inquiry might have been the discussion of a matter so delicate would prove extremely disagreeable to the electoral family a nation ever subject to extraordinary panics from plots and conspiracies might be roused to a dangerous resentment upon very weak grounds the earl of oxford foresaw these difficulties and he dexterously prevented the scheme proposed for laying an account of his discoveries before the parliament to soothe the violence of the pretenders adherents he made a show of entering with some zeal into his cause and by insinuating that his succession to the throne could not be prevented contrived to serve effectually the interests of the house of hannover stuartpapers april        he deceives the jacobites the earl of oxford not content with having judiciously prevented an inquiry in parliament concerning the intrigues of the confederates and whigs had made every use of his discoveries to hasten the great work of peace though he disappointed plunket in not encouraging his intrigues in holland he had the address to render that jesuit subservient to his views he was no stranger to the circumstance that plunkets vigilance in detecting the schemes of his enemies proceeded from views of serving the cause of the pretender he therefore employed him in communicating to the court of france the discoveries which had been made and the consequent resolution of queen anne to conclude a separate peace to please the jacobites he held forth a specious tale to that impatient and credulous race of men he insinuated that the pretender could not be immediately served on account of the watchfulness of the whigs and the unsurmountable prejudices of the vulgar against his family and especially his religion but that there was a fixed resolution formed of keeping a good correspondence with france to enable that kingdom to favor his pretensions to the british throne that it was now in the power of the french king by closing with the wishes and demands of the queen of great britain to impose what terms he pleased upon the confederates of whose ingratitude and conduct she had just grounds to complain stuartpapers may        the queen eager for peace during these secret transactions in britain the daughter born to james the second in his exile died of the smallpox at st germains the pretender himself had fallen ill with such dangerous symptoms of the same disorder as deprived his friends of every hope of his life the fears of queen anne for her own person and authority increased in proportion to his danger the proofs which she had received of the designs of the whigs and confederates had made a deep impression on her mind stuartpapers passim       she thought herself defenseless and alone should the check of a pretender to the crown be removed from the supposed views of the family of hannover whom she was taught to regard in the light of enemies and rivals but though these were her inclinations the same happy timidity which gave rise to her anxiety prevented her from entering with effectual eagerness into her brothers cause she rested all her hopes upon the court of france she hoped from the gratitude of lewis the fourteenth for the repose which she alone could bestow a support against the schemes of the confederates and whigs urged by these and similiar motives she could no longer hide her anxiety for peace in the moment that fortune by the demise of the dauphin and his son threatened to throw back the house of bourbon into all the perils of a disastrous war they were suddenly relieved by the timidity of the queen of great britain the ministry roused by terrors for themselves were equally eager for breaking by a separate peace the power of the confederates thus every thing conspired to extricate france with advantage and a degree of reputation out of a war that once threatened the dissolution of her monarchy  she lays the treaty on the sixth of june the queen came to the house of lords and made a speech from the throne she observed that though the making of peace and war was the undoubted prerogative of the crown she was resolved in consequence of her promise to communicate to her parliament the terms of the treaty before the me should be concluded that with regard to the concerns of great britain the french king had agreed to acknowledge her title and the eventual succession of the amily of hannover to the throne that the works and bour of dunkirk should be demolished gibraltar and portmahon remain in the possession of great britain that the island of st christophers should be ceded the streights and bay of hudson restored the island of newfoundland with placentia delivered up and all acadia or nova scotia yielded for ever to the british nation that the trade and commerce of great britain should be settled in the best and most permanent manner and that the assiento or contract for furnishing the spanish west indies with negroes should be granted to the subjects of great britain for the term of thirty years  before her parliament with regard to the states general she told them that france had agreed to almost the same barrier that had been offered in the negociations of the year   0  that the spanish low countries were to be secured to the emperor that the rhine should be the barrier of the empire that brisac and the fortresses of khel and landau should be ceded that the protestant interest in germany should be settled on the plan of the treaty of westphalia that on the side of italy the kingdoms of naples and sardinia the duchy of milan the spanish territories on the tuscan shore should be yielded to the house of austria that the fate of sicily remained still undecided but that all disputes were for ever removed with regard to the cession of that island by the duke of anjou that the difference between the barrier demanded by the duke of savoy in the year   0  and that offered at present by france was very inconsiderable besides that she herself was endeavoring to procure for his royal highness still greater advantages that in return for all spain and the west indies were to remain to king philip but that to prevent the union of the crowns of france and spain upon one head that prince was to renounce for ever in the most solemn manner all pretensions to the french monarchy journals june          arguments against this speech was received by the nation as individual were attached to one or other of the parties that strov for the management of public affairs the adherents o the whigs affirmed that should these conditions o peace be accepted they could not perceive why the war was at all begun that the grand confederacy wa intended to depress the exorbitant power of france b the accession of a prince of the house of bourbon to the throne of spain but that by the present treaty that power was left in the same state as when hostilities commenced that the renunciation of philip offered as a security was rather a matter of ridicule than any serious proposal that the promises and oaths of princes were but weak obstacles in the way of their ambition that france herself had been so just as to own that any agreement of a prince to break the succession of a crown was nugatory as being contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom that should king philip think himself bound by his own renunciation neither his posterity nor the french themselves would allow that he had a power to extend the obligation beyond his own life that however insignificant the rights of monarchy might appear to the people of great britain who had broken the line of succession in their own country the thing was regarded with another eye in france where the descent of the crown was deemed the first link of that great chain which kept together the vast body of the monarchy  and for the peace on the other side it was affirmed that since the commencement of the war the face of things was totally changed that france broken by a series of uncommon misfortunes had ceased to be dangerous that as the state of affairs now stood fresh expedients and measures were not only proper but even necessary that when the war began king charles the third was only a titular monarch without a revenue without power and without importance that the case was now much altered as that prince had obtained the hereditary dominions of the house of austria together with the imperial crown that it would be the height of folly to revive in the person of the present emperor the power which endangered europe in the days of charles the fifth that should the confederates resolve at any rate to place the crown of spain on the head of the emperor the success would at best be doubtful that it would be extremely idle and highly impolitic to throw away blood and treasure on an undertaking which by being accomplished would destroy that very balance for which the maritime powers had so long contended with the house of bourbon that as to philips renunciation though a slender thing in itself it derived great force from the efforts of those who were to enjoy its benefits that as matters were situated the best means had been used for answering the end for which the war began that there was at present but a bare possibility that the succession of france should fall to the share of the king of spain but that there was a certainty of present danger from the union of the spanish monarchy to the power of the house of austria strengthened by the influence derived by that family from an uninterrupted possession of the imperial crown  the commons vote an address of thanks in the house of commons an address of thanks was voted without one dissenting voice journals june         but the lords adjourned the business to the next day and when they met fell into warm debates though the whigs affected to despise the articles of the proposed peace these were well received by the body of a nation already groaning under the burden of an unprofitable war the terms were deemed by the dispassionate favorable to the kingdom in the treaty of the year   0  upon which the excluded party highly valued themselves no specific advantages to great britain were proposed in the present she had not only obtained a security to her commerce but even an accession of territory the truth is that the whole was very inadequate to the expense of the war and unsuitable to its uncommon success no doubt can now be entertained that had the confederates continued to press france on the side of flanders but the crown of spain must have been relinquished by the house of bourbon but it is extremely doubtful whether the british ministry were acquainted with a circumstance which the french only owned when the season for redressing the evil was past the opposition in the house of lords despairing to prevent the address endeavored to clog it with an amendment they proposed an addition to the motion for obtaining the guarantee of the allies to the treaty but upon a division it was rejected by a great majority june    a protest entered by several lords upon this question was after a warm debate expunged out of the books of the house june      other transactions their approbation of the articles of peace was the last business of importance transacted in this session of parliament besides the great business of the treaty and the consequent contests of parties on that subject some other affairs that deserve to be mentioned fell under discussion in the two houses the act for a general naturalization of all foreign protestants was repealed feb    this law which had been passed by the whigs when in power had been always odious to the highchurch party they said that as most protestants abroad differed from the church government established in england so the naturalizing bill was calculated to increase the number of dissenters in the kingdom but after the surmises of a projected invasion were carried to the ministry one other essential reason was added to the former for repealing the act the party affirmed that when that law subsisted no importation of foreign protestants could be deemed illegal that a foreign prince might become when he pleased master of the kingdom by sending judiciously his subjects before him into a country where they became denizens at the expense of a shilling a head the common price of an oath to the government that should such a prince which was likely to be soon the case ascend the throne of great britain he might without any breach on the laws of the kingdom enslave the nation with an army of his native subjects  of parliament the repealing of the act of naturalization was considered by the dissenters in the light of an attack upon themselves but this was not the only invasion on their established opinions of which they chose to complain the commons in their attachment to the church of england extended their protection to the episcopal clergy in scotland a bill was introduced for granting a toleration to all such as should use the liturgy of the church in that part of the kingdom the thing seemed so reasonable that no opposition was made but a clause in the bill required the civil magistrates to execute none of the sentences of the judicatory of the church of scotland the presbyterians were alarmed at a circumstance that annihilated their ecclesiastical authority the bill however passed with little opposition in either house it was followed by another which was contrary to the presbyterian principles the courts of judicature in scotland were commanded by an act to discontinue their sittings during some days at christmas though the observing of holidays is contrary to the tenets of presbytery but the most mortifying act of all was that for restoring patronages which had been abolished in king williams reign in vain was it urged that such an invasion on the church of scotland was a breach upon the union of the two kingdoms by which the rights of presbytery were unalterably secured the bill passed with little opposition notwithstanding the complaints and petitions of several of the scottish clergy burnet vol iv   campaign of      inactivity of ormond while the nation were in a state of suspense with regard to the negociations carried on between great britain and france the confederates took the field in flanders the prince of savoy had received a reinforcement of germans that increased the army to the number of one hundred and twentytwo thousand men the duke of ormond who had succeeded marlborough in the command of the british forces and such troops as were in british pay arrived in the camp near douay in the end of april that nobleman found himself extremely uneasy in the high station in which he was placed he had carried orders from the queen to hazard by no means a battle unless he perceived an apparent and great advantage he was sensible of the extreme difficulty of executing such undecisive orders and at the same time of concealing the real motive of his conduct from the penetrating eye of the prince of savoy he however resolved to obey her majestys commands and to prevent as much as possible the cause of his conduct from being even suspected m de torey tom ii  the strong situation of the french army under the marshall de villars who had posted himself behind the scheld had induced the duke to hope that no action could happen the prince of savoy however finding that the enemy had not occupied with entrenchments the small space between the source of the sum and that of the scheld made dispositions for attacking villars his design was to decide the fate of the war by a battle or to force the french to retire and to leave cambray exposed to a siege he communicated his intentions to the duke of ormond on the twentyeighth of may his grace declining to give an immediate answer confirmed the prince in the suspicions which he had for some time entertained the deputies of the states sent an immediate account of ormonds inactivity to the hague the states sent an express to the court of great britain the whigs brought the affair into the house of lords but the ministry were neither moved with the representations of the dutch nor the majority of the peers persuaded by the clamours of the excluded party journals publication of the times   consternation of the confederates during this state of altercation and suspense the prince of savoy resolved to sit down before quesnoy this siege was but of short continuance the town surrendered after a weak defense and the garrison were made prisoners of war the spirits of the confederates depressed by the inactivity of ormond were greatly exalted by this success but as the proposed cessation of arms between great britain and france was no longer a matter of mere suspicion the former dejection of the allies returned they pretended to make no doubt but that all the troops in british pay would follow the british forces they dreaded that the marshall de villars would take advantage of the separation and attack the prince of savoy the states in particular were afraid of a terrible reverse of fortune at the end of a prosperous war their plenipotentiaries at utrecht reproached the bishop of bristol with the odious conduct of his court they perceived themselves exposed in a desenceless state to the vengeance of an enemy whom they had treated with haughtiness and contempt they exaggerated the perils of their condition they even mixed threats with expressions of despair but their former courage returned then they understood that the foreign troops in the pay of great britain refused to follow the duke of ormond  intrigues of marlborough with the dutch this measure so distressful to the british ministry ceeded from the assiduity of the duke of marlborough that nobleman wrote to the pensionary heinsius and  prince of savoy to hinder the foreign troops from beying the duke of ormond he hoped to prevent by this contrivance the french king from delivering up dunkirk to the british forces that circumstance which was likely to happen would infallibly raise the clamours of the populace against the ministry terrify the tories in parliament and give a plausible pretext to the whigs to send the authors of the ineffectual peace to the tower the duke in conjunction with the lords halifax and summers proposed another scheme more decisive in its consequences but less easy to be accomplished they advised the states to assist the elector of hannover to pass with a force into great britain their project was to spread a report that the pretender at the instigation of the ministry was preparing to invade the kingdom with a french army and at the same time to declare in a manifesto that his electoral highness was arrived to secure the succession of the crown in the protestant line stuartpapers       they affirmed that the people alarmed for their religion and liberty would flock round his standard and that the queen like her father would make her escape to france this plausible project is said to have been transmitted to the princess sophia but the less violent whigs are reported to have advised her clandestinely to refuse her consent as that measure might furnish the tories already averse from the interests of her family with a pretense for altering the succession ibid   the auxiliaries refuse to obey the duke of ormond the refusal of the foreign troops to obey the duke of ormond transferred the perplexity of the other confederates to the british court they had agreed with the french that the queens troops consisting of twentyfive battalions and ninetyfour squadrons should separate themselves from the army under the prince of savoy but when ormond communicated his orders for that purpose to the generals of the auxiliaries they refused to obey one battalion and four squadrons of the duke of holstein and two squadrons of walefs regiment of dragoons of the country of liege were the only foreigner that seemed ready to follow the british general mem de torcy tom ii  the intelligence was received in london by different persons as they were variously inclined to the contending parties the joy expressed by the whigs was unbounded the indignation of the tories was equally excessive reports were spread that a design was formed by the prince of savoy to disarm the british forces and to confine the duke of ormond this question had certainly been agitated at the consults of the malcontents with prince eugene in the month of february stuartpapers de torcy swifts four years  but whether it was ever intended to be put in execution is rather to be suspected than proved  the french refuse to deliver up dunkirk the refusal of the auxiliaries to obey his orders reduced the duke of ormond to a state of the utmost perplexity and uneasiness he delayed his march till he should receive positive commands from his court the ministry were thrown into a degree of consternation by fresh complaints on the subject from the french king they had lost the confidence of the allies they had fallen under the distrust of the court of versailles the principal terms of the stipulated cessation was the delivery of dunkirk and the immediate confirmation of the renunciation made by king philip of his eventual succession to the crown of france lewis the fourteenth informed the queen of great britain that he understood the proposed cessation to be general between the two armies that should he even satisfy himself with a particular cessation he wished to be understood that all the troops in british pay should quit the rest of the confederates that till this condition should be fulfilled he thought proper to suspend his orders for admitting the british troops into dunkirk mr secretary st john soon removed this difficulty by the express orders of his mistress he wrote to the marquis de torcy that the queen was resolved to unite herself effectually with france to defeat this last effort of men who to satisfy their private resentment wished to protract the calamities of war that to show the firmness of her mind and sincerity of her intentions she had commanded him to signify to the ministers from those princes whose troops were in the british pay that should they persist to separate themselves from her native troops they should expect no more of her money m de torcy tom ii  that positive orders were in the mean time sent to the duke of ormond to separate the british forces from allies that neither deserved nor should receive her support  they however yield and a suspension of arms is declared the court of france were too eager for a tranquillity that was so necessary to their affairs not to suffer themselves to be convinced by st johns letter they foresaw that the confederates upon being deserted by great britain would either seriously think of peace or become subject to a sudden reverse in war orders were immediately dispatched for delivering dunkirk to the british troops the obstructions experienced already by the duke of ormond induced the ministry to place the fate of the peace in a kind of independence upon accident they sent sir john leake to take the command of the fleet in the downs they ordered him to provide transports for carrying troops to occupy dunkirk from great britain on the eighth of july brigadier hill took possession of the place two days before this event the prince of savoy separated himself from the british troops and sat down before landrecy the duke of ormond directing his route to avesne le seiq declared at that place a suspension of arms in his march toward ghent which city together with bruges he intended to occupy he was refused by the confederates a passage through bouchain he was treated with the same disrespect and distrust by the garrisons of douay tournay oudenarde and lisle on the twelfth of july the duke took possession of ghent and soon after of bruges and thus by commanding the navigation of the lys and scheld became the umpire of the operations between the contending armies publications of the times   the allies defeated at denain the goodfortune of the confederates ceased at the separation of the british forces from their army in flanders the happy rashness of the duke of marlborough in the preceding campaign had rendered the prince of savoy the only rival of his glory more enterprising having opened the trenches before landrecy he placed a body of his troops at denain to favor the passage of his convoys from marchiennes hist dangleterre  his own camp was fortified and independent of insult but the marshall de villars however had the address to render the prince afraid of being attacked which induced him to weaken the body of troops commanded by the earl of albemarle at denain that lords force at last consisted of fourteen thousand men villars having made a feint of advancing toward his right on the side of landrecy turned suddenly to the left and arriving at neuville in the morning of the twentyfourth threw at once three bridges across the scarpe the prince of savoy apprized of the unexpected march of the enemy hastened to the lines between denain and neuville he reinforced the earl of albemarle with six battalions he went in person to hasten the march of his right wing he had scarce quitted the lines when they were entered almost without resistance by the count de broglio four battalions of palatines and other german auxiliaries threw down their arms and fled the whole french line having passed the scheld were led by villars against the camp of the earl of albemarle he marched up to the enemy without firing a single shot he entered the intrenchments cut those who resisted to pieces and forced the survivors to fly but their retreat was cut off by the precaution of the french general who had occupied a bridge which they had built behind on the scheld  rapid progress of france the loss of the confederates was considerable in an action which decided the fate of the war one thousand were slain in the engagement and flight fifteen hundred were drowned two thousand five hundred fell into the hands of the victors many officers of great distinction were taken killed or lost in the scheld the prince of savoy had the mortification to arrive when his friends were incapable of receiving relief he attempted in vain to force the bridge occupied by the french this however was only the beginning of a long chain of misfortunes marchiennes where all the magazines of the confederates were deposited was taken in three days prince eugene instead of annoying the enemy was not ble to defend himself he raised the siege of landrecy douay august     quesnoy sept     and bouchain oct    were sucessively taken in his sight the taking of marchiennes  depriving the prince of the means of war enabled the nemy to prosecute their operations with vigor a success so uncommon and so unexpected elevated the french beyond measure the joy of the british ministry was equal but less obvious than that of the court of versailles they were glad to see the haughtiness of the whigs humbled their hopes disappointed their opposition to the peace as it were punished in a signal manner their affected contempt of their own nation since they ceased to be commanded by a general of their party all revenged by a defeat which could not fail to be followed by consequences fatal to their views hist dangleterre hist de france kanes mem   campaign in spain italy dauphine and on the rhine the signal events of this campaign were confined to flanders no enterprise of consequence was undertaken no action of renown happened on any other side of the war in italy the imperialists besieged and took porto hercole in spain the count de staremberg though delivered from a formidable enemy by the death of vendome attempted nothing important king philip having a near prospect of peace permitted the war to languish on his side in dauphine and savoy the summer was spent by the contending armies in observing each others motions an inactivity prevailed on the frontiers of portugal the duke of wirtemberg who commanded the army of the empire on the rhine formed a project toward the end of the campaign to force the lines of weissembourg and to penetrate into alsace having detached two bodies of his troops by two different roads they were deceived by their guides and meeting in the night charged one another as enemies and returned in the utmost confusion to their own camp thus ended in misfortune and disgrace the operations of a war which had covered the arms of the confederates with so much renown hist of europe hist de france tom iii   tendency toward a peace the disappointments on the part of the allies diminished their hopes but the time for putting an end to the war was not yet arrived the queen of great britain herself though she appeared anxious for peace endangered the success of that measure by peremptorily insisting upon the cession of the kingdom of sicily in favor of the duke of savoy m de torcy tom ii  mr secretary st john who had been raised to the peerage on the seventh of july by the title of viscount bolingbroke had demanded that article in terms more likely to create a quarrel than to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiation but when the court of france was embarrassed about the answer most proper to be made to his lordship he informed them by letter that he was commanded by the queen to go in person to france he accordingly arrived at paris in the end of the month of august his instructions furnished his lordship with full powers to bring the negotiation to a speedy conclusion but this power was annexed to the indispensable condition of obtaining sicily for the duke of savoy the queen of great britain expressed a particular attention to that prince which might be considered unaccountable upon any other grounds than her deeming his family after herself and the pretender the next in blood to the succession of the crown upon the ancient form but though she insisted upon obtaining an immediate kingdom for the duke her principal object in his favor was the eventual succession of the house of savoy to the throne of spain after the failure of king philip and his posterity  bolingbroke sent to france this sudden resolution of sending bolingbroke to france proceeded from the earnestness for peace expressed upon every occasion by that lord he had advised the queen to prefer a suspension of hostilities as the most certain means of obviating the difficulties which the enemies of peace opposed to a simple cessation of arms the example of great britain he affirmed would be soon followed by the confederates the kings of portugal and prussia he said as well as the duke of savoy and the dutch were too prudent to continue the war after the separation of such a powerful ally as great britain and should the emperor and empire sacrifice their convenience and interest to their resentment he assured her that they would soon drop a contest which they could not maintain with any effect the earl of oxford opposed the advice of bolingbroke to avoid giving offense to the elector of hannover though he was attached from principle to that prince he was apprehensive of being called to an account whenever he should ascend the british throne this event seemed to be at no great distance as the queen daily declined in her health this was the cause of all those delays and uneasinesses which might have been prevented by a definitive treaty between great britain and france this conduct was extremely impolitic in the minister as it gave an appearance of timidity to his measures a circumstance which exposed him to all the machinations and intrigues of his own enemies and those of the peace m de torcy tom ii stuartpapers        terms settled between him and de torcy when bolingbroke arrived at paris he entered into conferences with the marquis de torcy on the object of his embassy the two ministers possessed of unlimited powers from their respective courts soon agreed that the duke of savoy and his descendants should be called to the throne of spain in default of king philip and his male posterity that this substitution should be inserted in all the public acts with regard to the renunciation of philips right to the crown of france that the renunciation itself should be registered in the books of the parliament of paris and admitted solemnly by the cortes or states of castile and arragon that the cession of sicily to the duke of savoy should for the present remain a secret for various reasons but that he should never be suffered to alienate that island for any other territory the article of the barrier to this favored prince was not so easily settled the french minister refused to grant more for that purpose than exilles fenestrelles and the valley of pragelas this whole affair was therefore referred to the general congress at utrecht the two secretaries of great britain and france having settled these terms the viscount bolingbroke had an audience of the french king he was received with the utmost politeness by that prince and was treated by the whole court with a respect suitable to the earnest desire of the kingdom for peace the cessation of arms was prolonged for four months and bolingbroke having left prior to manage the affairs of his nation in france returned to london highly satisfied with the success of his embassy m de torcy tom ii   states eager for peace the change of affairs in flanders had rendered the confederates sensible that they were incapable to maintain the war should great britain desert the grand alliance the dutch who had most to lose by a continuation of hostilities were the first who seriously thought of peace the defeat at denain the subsequent misfortunes the disappointment of the projects of the prince of savoy had blasted their hopes and humbled their pride their eyes were opened to the true state of their affairs they descended at once from that haughtiness with which they had been inspired by the success of the war instead of prescribing terms to the house of bourbon they solicited the good offices of great britain for renewing the conferences which had been long interrupted by their own obstinacy they dropped their pretensions of receiving all the answers of the french plenipotentiaries in writing the latter therefore agreed to renew the conferences upon condition that the queen of great britains speech to her parliament should be admitted as the plan of the treaty the ministers of the other allies were alarmed at the pusillanimity of the dutch count zinzendorff the imperial minister repeated his exhortations and promises he assured them that the prince of savoy was on his march to fight villars that he was sure of victory that as there was no risk in suspending the conferences the states ought to temporize by waiting for the result of events swifts four years de torcy tom ii   an incident interrupts the conferences zinzendorff prevailed the conferences under various pretenses were delayed but when time brought no favorable change the dutch fell into their former fears they redoubled their solicitations for the renewal of the conferences of utrecht a silly quarrel between the servants of m menager one of the french plenipotentiaries and those of the count de rechteren deputy of the province of overyssel interrupted again the great work of peace the french king took advantage of the folly of rechteren as it was not his interest to conset with the allies till he had settled his measures with the viscount bolingbroke the pretense itself was plausible he insisted that the states should declare whether rechteren followed their orders in his insolent conduct or whether he had pursued the dictates of a passionate mind inflamed by the arts of the house of austria if he acted in obedience to his masters there was no safety he said for his ministers at utrecht if he had no guide but his own passion the states were called upon to disavow the conduct of a servant who had abused their confidence the french king therefore told them that rechteren should be recalled by his constituents and another deputy be appointed in his place this dictatorial conduct so contrary to the abject behavior of the court of france in the year   0  was not capable to raise the indignation of the states the haughtiness which assumed the name of spirit at that period had vanished with their good fortune and they suffered an enemy whom they despised to retort upon them their own wanton insolence with impunity  the queen interferes for the dutch the abject behavior of the states was at present of some advantage to their affairs their submission to the french reconciled the court of great britain to their interest the resentment of the british nation ceased with the obstinacy of the dutch the ministry resolved to interfere in their cause they pressed therefore the court of france to a separate peace they desired them to register immediately the renunciations as on them the peace of europe depended that upon the fulfilling of this essential article the queen of great britain should declare that she could obtain no other plan but that offered by france that it was the business of the confederates to determine upon this head that they should have three months to consider but that the french king should be no longer obliged to grant even these terms after the expiration of the time the queen insisted in return with the court of versailles to depart from their claims on the restitution of tournay m de torcy tom ii  that town she said as it was the great object of the states was also necessary to their barrier though lewis had resolved to retain tournay he yielded prudently to her request he sound that by the bad state of the queens health there was reason to fear she might die in the midst of an unfinished war he knew that the ministry must fall with her life that their enemies and his own would again possess themselves of the whole power of the kingdom that a prince who had declared himself averse from peace was to mount the throne and was likely to renew or rather to continue the war m de torcy tom ii   secret views of the queen this prudential concession of lewis the fourteenth smoothed the way for a treaty which was not destined to be soon concluded but though the clandestine measures for restoring peace employed much of the time of queen anne a part of her attention was turned to views that were still more secret those who were most about her person perceiving her inclinations urged her perpetually with regard to the interest of the pretender she seemed willing to favor his views but she perceived obstacles in his way which he himself had not the strength of mind to remove in her own attachment to the church of england she signified her inclinations that the pretender should relinquish popery and place himself in a capacity of being served when she was urged by the duke of buckingham to endeavor to break the succession in the protestant line her answer though it conveyed a regard for her brother was suitable to good sense and prudence how can i serve him she said my lord he makes not the least step to oblige me in what i most desire you know a papist cannot enjoy this crown in peace but the example of the father has no weight with the son he prefers his religious errors to the throne of a great kingdom how therefore can i undo what i have already done he may thank himself for his exclusion he knows that i love my own family better than that of any other all would be easy should he enter the pale of the church of england advise him to change his religion as that only can change the opinions of mankind in his favor stuartpapers july        with regard to the pretender though buckingham had assured the family of hannover that he had been persecuted by the whigs for this attachment to the protestant succession hannoverpapers passim  he conveyed this intelligence to the court of st germains he at the same time seconded the request of the queen but his arguments were lost on the pretender and his servants though that unfortunate prince was in no danger of becoming an apostle like his father he was perhaps equally attached to the romish faith under a pretense that his conversion would be deemed insincere he evaded the request of his friends he affirmed he had so little prejudice against the religion of his country that he intended to carry along with him to the place of his exile a protestant clergyman to officiate to his protestant servants that when he should be permitted to return to great britain he would be ready to hear such arguments as might induce him to change his present faith that it was even the interest of england to have a prince on the throne whose religion would lessen the power which the constitution had placed in his hands that as he was ready to relinquish during his own time the prerogative of nominating bishops and of appointing clergymen to livings no danger could be apprehended by the established church that he was willing the present tests so far as they regarded popery should continue and as he entertained no prejudice against the doctrines of the church of england he was ready to have no servants but such as were of the protestant persuasion stuartpapers        reflections these professions might be honest but they were an irrefragable proof of weakness a man who relinquished his hopes of a great kingdom for a speculative tenet of faith discovered a degree of enthusiasm that ought never to be trusted insincerity itself is less a crime in a prince than folly he who wishes to govern nations must rule them through their principles otherwise his government becomes a tyranny and only lasts as long as it is not opposed among a people accustomed to monarchy the sovereign only is capable of shaking his own throne to differ from his subjects in their religious opinions is almost the only prerogative which he may not without danger employ of all mankind he has the least right to be singular in his faith if he is not willing to go to heaven in the same way with his people they will scaree acknowledge the legality of his authority on earth that public affection which is the chief support of his throne must be changed for suspicion and jealousy a mutual distrust prevails which will soon degenerate into that unforgiving aversion that invariably follows a difference of faith in feeble minds when society is even mellowed down into an indifference which borders on infidelity the worst consequences are to be expected and feared indignation against the weakness of a bigot will even then supply the place of religious zeal and violence itself becomes just in a certain degree when it is opposed to folly  the tories urge the pretender the generality of the tories in their vehement zeal for the hereditary descent of the crown overlooked the attachment of the pretender to the popish faith afraid only of the violence of the common people they recommended to him to make a show of changing his religion they assured him that should he declare himself a member of the church of england without the formality of a public conversion they would endeavor to obtain the repeal of the act of settlement in the present parliament that however the pretender could not be mentioned in the new law that the disposal of the crown according to the precedents of former times should be vested in the reigning queen that however she must be restricted to leave her throne to a protestant that as her affection for her brother was not be suspected they had no apprehensions of her not making a will in his favor that in the mean time to obviate every danger of disappointment he should be permitted to live in scotland that they expected from his own prudence a moderate comportment during his sisters life that considering the bad state of her health the possession of the crown could be no distant object and that an outward compliance with the forms of worship established by law in great britain was only wanting to the completion of the whole design stuartpapers        to change his religion though the hopes of the tories were too sanguine to be so very easily accomplished there was a degree of good fortune in the religious obstinacy of the pretender had he been less prejudiced or perhaps more dishonest he might at this period break or at least greatly endanger the succession of the family of hannover to the crown though men of distinction and eminence have ascribed the success of the revolution and protestant succession to their own abilities and patriotism the benefits of both were derived from the happy zeal of the common people for the established religion though the excluded family ere guilty of many follies they were only odious on  of their popery a popular cry against their bigotry which was far from being illfounded was more fatal to  than the act of settlement the most zealous of their abettors were unable to stop this torrent when they planned their measures in secret for the restoration of their favorite line of kings they were terrified from all their schemes by the clamours of the populace those therefore who wished at this period that the pretender should change his religion were his best friends without reconciling the lower sort in some degree to his person by his adopting their says it is extremely doubtful whether the abrogation of the act of settlement the zeal of his sister or the efforts of all his friends could render him secure upon the throne stuartpapers        designs of the whigs but though the whigs suspected these secret intrigues and conveyed insinuations concerning them to the public with many aggravating circumstances they were not able to gain the people to their views they affirmed that by a secret article of the separate peace between great britain and france scotland was to be immediately ceded to the pretender ibid july       they carried their surmizes with unabated diligence to the press but there they met the enemy upon disadvantageous ground the earl of oxford had the good fortune to be supported before the public by able and persevering writers he owed this circumstance like his power to the state of the times and neither to his own liberality nor conduct the dangers of domestic compiracies from the whigs and even of an invasion from abroad by the confederates were inculcated with vivacity and force though no effectual measures for carrying into execution either of these designs had been taken by the discontented they failed more from the want of opportunity than inclination the excluded party and especially the duke of marlborough who still preserved an influence with the dutcl continued to urge the confederates to continue the war they were even said to have eagerly suggested an attempt similar to that which had proved so successful at the late revolution they affirmed that the fleet and army were both averse from the queens measures and that a change in the throne and consequently an alteration of measures might be accomplished without drawing the sword stuartpapers july      oxford pays court in vain to the house of hannover during schemes formed by the two parties the earl of oxford pursued a secret line of his own perceiving the declining health of the queen he was anxious to stretch beyond her life the term of his power or at least to insure his safety to this point was directed all his care and attention in times sufficiently agitated with more important concerns to accomplish his purpose he endeavored by deceiving the court of st germains with his mysterious conduct to gain the favor of the house of hannover ibid  in both he was equally unsuccessful the jacobites formed some hopes on the necessity of his situation but none upon his attachment to their cause the electoral family swayed by the misrepresentations of the whigs became insensible to all his submissions and earnest professions hannoverpapers  to solicit their good opinion he had ordered mr thomas harley from utrecht to the court of hannover to bespeak a favorable reception harley carried to the princess sophia the act passed in the last session of parliament

of ambassador extraordinary arrived at hannover in the month of july if he was charged with any thing but professions of attachment from the minister he had not the good fortune to succeed the elector continued with all his influence to oppose the peace and made at the same time no secret of his distrust of the queen and her principal servants  duke of hamilton appointed ambassador to france with regard to the latter the elector was certainly deceived but a doubt can scarce be formed that anne herself was extremely averse from the succession of his highness to the throne she was no stranger to the attachment of the lordtreasurer to the house of hannover she knew that bolingbroke had never brought any principle in competition with his own interest she was resolved to trust neither in an affair which seems to have engaged the greatest part of her thoughts with a natural jealousy of her own authority she declined to gratify the jacobites by calling her brother into the kingdom but she was extremely anxious to settle with france some plan to secure his eventual succession after her own death to accomplish her purpose she had very early in the present year fixed her eyes on the duke of hamilton as a proper person to be sent ambassador to the court of versailles bolingbroke who managed the treaty hitherto frustrated this design by taking that province to himself in the preceding summer but soon after the return of that nobleman from paris she appointed the duke her ambassadorextraordinary to the french king  he is unfairly killed in a duel an accident fatal to the duke of

more of the secret intrigues of parties than of transactions that commanded the attention of the public the hopes of the adherents of the pretender and the jealousies of the friends of the house of hannover were encouraged and fomented with great industry by the violent leaders of both sides the year      closed with the arrival of the duke daumont as ambassador from the court of versailles to that of london though the defection of great britain from the grand alliance promised a certain end to the war the progress toward peace was made but by very slow degrees the resolute conduct of the

toward a peace the parliament was prorogued from day to day the queen daily expecting the conclusion of the treaty was willing to prevent all further animadversion on its progress from the opposing party in this state of suspense a kind of unsettled tranquillity prevailed the whigs made in secret every preparation for opening with effect the operations of the political campaign disappointed in their violent measures they resolved to pursue the line of opposition in a less dangerous and more legal way the jealousy which they had raised in the court of hannover continued to distract the councils of the electoral family ignorant of the bigotry of the pretender they were beyond measure alarmed at the report of his intentions to change his religion they were no strangers to the solicitations of the tories to induce him to place himself in a way of being served in parliament should even the report of his conversion prevail they were persuaded that a bill to repeal the act of settlement was likely to be proposed they were informed from paris that the pretended prince by dismissing his popish servants was preparing for an alteration in religion they determined therefore to use every measure that prudence could suggest to defeat his designs on the british throne hannoverpapers        projects of the baron de grote his electoral highnesss resident at london was directed how to proceed in this delicate affair he was desired to consult the leaders of the whigs particularly the lord halifax upon the subject of proposing a bill for excluding the pretender from the throne and his posterity even though he should become a protestant the house of hannover hoped to derive a double advantage from this unnecessary project should the act pass a material point would be gained should the bill be opposed by the ministry that conduct would unmask them to the nation they observed as a great defect in the act of settlement that no clause was inserted for excluding the pretender should he relinquish the romish faith they averred that upon the slightest appearance of a feigned conversion the whole fabric which the whigs pretended to have reared for the princess sophia would fall at once to the ground these fears had made so much impression that they were willing to be reconciled to the earl of oxford though they distrusted his principles and views the lord halifax who was in some degree in his confidence was requested to sound the treasurer on a point which was deemed important to the highest degree hannoverpapers jan           the house of hannover the new act for the security of the succession was not the only subject that was to employ the embassy of halifax to the earl of oxford he was desired to discover his sentiments on the subject of a pension to the princess sophia a provision and even a household to the next heir of the crown was thought neither an extravagant nor unreasonable demand in the present situation of the electors affairs a fresh supply of revenue was much wanted his agents every where complained of their too scanty allowance the whigs with all their patriotism were soliciting for pensions ibid      some lords who were zealous for the protestant succession were it seems too poor to follow their consciences they had sold their votes to the ministry but they would take smaller sums from his electoral highness the earl of sunderland in his attachment to the family of brunswick had advanced three hundred pounds to one of these poor conscientious lords ibid  the earl wished to see this sum repaid though the elector might be willing to gratify such faithful friends he had reason to expect that they would help to serve themselves they were therefore desired to promote with all their influence the pension demanded for the princess his highness was no stranger upon the present occasion either to the abilities or poverty of the duke of argyle the whole world knew his love of money he desired that nobleman and his brother the earl of ilay to promote the allowance to the electress as they might expect good pensions to themselves from that fund honnoverpapers jan           their jealousy of the queen and ministry the bill for establishing the pension for the princess sophia was to furnish another trial of the intentions of the lordtreasurer but in the opinion of the electors servants no further trial was necessary they were already convinced of that ministers attachment to the pretender had his professions in favor of the succession been even sincere the court of hannover concluded that he was too far engaged with france and the queen to retreat they supposed that his prudence and even his safety dictated a firm adherence to the cause of the pretended prince of wales the queen they said was too much attached to her brother to be ever brought back to proper measures should oxford attempt to change her views he must fall like godolphin and marlborough he had too much regard they thought for his own interest not to profit by the misfortunes of his predecessors he must not they thought be trusted they affirmed therefore that the friends of the succession ought to ruin his power by exposing his conduct to the nation that no measure was better calculated for this purpose than the new bill of exclusion and the pension but what need have we of further proofs they said we have long known that oxford is irrecoverably devoted to the pretender his cousin endeavored to impose on the electress and the electoral prince with empty professions of zeal but though he might deceive them his treachery could not escape the penetrating eyes of the elector  both oxford and bolingbroke says robethon to grote are inviolably attached to the prince of wales but the sentiments of these two jacobite lords ought not to be attributed to the memorial of the baron de bothmar ibid feb             elector indifferent about the succession while his servants entertained such suspicions of the british ministry the elector himself seems to have become indifferent concerning the succession of his family to the throne teazed by the unmeaning professions of the tories and harassed by the demands of the whigs he dropped all personal correspondence with both parties he suffered his servants to continue their intrigues in london he listened to their intelligence but to the requisitions of his whiggish friends for money he turned a deaf ear he was however persuaded at length to order six hundred pounds to the lord fizwalter to enable that needy peer to repay a debt of three hundred pounds to sunderland hannoverpapers feb          he allowed forty pounds to the author of a newspaper for conveying to the public paragraphs favorable to the protestant succession ibid feb        he added ten pounds to that sum after various representations from his council and servants the difficulty with which he was brought to grant such trifles furnishes a strong proof that his highness was either disgusted with such pitiful demands or very indifferent with regard to the throne  marlborough a spy on the pretender whilst the elector was harassed with demands of money from london the duke of marlborough suggested another article of expense from his retreat at antwerp he informed his highness of the necessity of having a spy in the pretenders court to observe the motions of that prince he offered for fifty louisdors a month to find a proper person to execute that important service he took in the mean time a part of this necessary function upon himself ibid feb          he conveyed some intelligence to the court of hannover but his want of information seems to prove that his grace was no longer trusted with the secrets of the excluded family the servants and the friends of the elector were ill informed concerning the pretender they were persuaded that he was resolved to enter into the communion of the church of england they heard that he had left all his roman catholic servants at st germains when he retired to chalons sur marne that none but protestants were in his train but the earl of middleton who had yielded to convenience more than to conviction in his conversion to the romish faith their sears increased in proportion to their ignorance of the pretenders bigotry they could not for a moment suppose that he would sacrifice his prospect of the british throne to a speculative tenet of religion hannoverpapers march     the excluded party in great britain harassed at the same time the elector with proposals of his invading the kingdom with a body of troops they suggested that should the dutch refuse a squadron of men of war some ships of force might be obtained from denmark but the elector rejected the scheme as utterly improper as well as impracticable ibid march     secret views of the pretender and of the treasurer during these intrigues on the part of the court of hannover the agents of the pretender were equally busy and still more anxious in their negociations and intrigues he himself had retired from st germains in the preceding summer having obtained a safe conduct from the emperor and the duke of lorrain he now resided at bar though he entertained suspicions of the earl of oxford upon much better grounds than the house of hannover he built much on the affections of the queen and the zeal of the tories the lordtreasurer however broke artfully the designs of the first he frustrated the schemes of the latter by dividing their councils while the dukes of shrewsberry and buckingham remained in the cabinetcouncil he deemed justly that the protestant succession was in danger but he had removed the first by appointing him ambassador to france the second was broken with infirmities and weighed down with years oxford endeavored in the mean time to gain the most moderate whigs he laid schemes for obtaining a moderate parliament the sheriffs pricked for the counties were of the lowchurch party he endeavored to impress the electors with the necessity of choosing such representatives as should favor the succession in the protestant line though he was on the point of losing the tories by this conduct he was so unfortunate as not to gain the whigs while he made the most vehement professions to the electoral family they were firmly persuaded that he was an obstinate and determined jacobite though he was courted by the pretender that prince knew him to be an inflexible whig  peace of utrecht these secret intrigues on both sides fill a period remarkable for no public transaction the parliament continued to be prorogued as the tedious negociations at utrecht had not yet been brought to a close great britain who first began the negotiation was destined to conclude the treaty the duke of shrewsberry and the marquis de torcy settled the plan of a general peace at paris which a courier carried to utrecht in the middle of march the portuguese and dutch had already agreed to put an end to their part of the war others prepared to follow their example on the twentyseventh of march the lord privy seal and the earl of stafford acquainted the ministers of the allies that they had appointed the thirtyfirst for signing a treaty of peace and one of commerce between the queen of great britain and france they requested therefore the plenipotentiaries of the confederates to be prepared at the same time to sign their respective treaties the conditions of peace to be allowed to the emperor and the empire had been settled by the queen of great britain and the french king these were delivered in form to the count zinzendorff his imperial majestys minister but the emperor yielding to his resentment resolved to continue the war the british and french plenipotentiaries were the first who signed for their respective sovereigns their example was followed in the space of a few hours by the minister of the duke of savoy and by those of portugal and prussia the states were the last who

war could suggest no demands that were not likely to be granted by an enemy reduced to the last extremity the french nation unsuccessful in all their efforts were broken by disasters their sovereign destitute of resources for action became timid and undecisive in his counsels he had implored the pity of the confederates in a manner that by exposing his own weakness contributed to augment their demands instead of deriving spirit from indignation and despair the court of versailles yielded to those unmanly complaints that deprive even misfortune itself of regret in this untoward state of their affairs the fate of the house of bourbon depended upon the queen of great britain and as the humanity which ought ever to be extended to private distress is frequently sacrificed to utility in public transactions she could scarce be blamed for making a more rigorous use of the advantages which fortune had placed in her hands  and reflections but though more splendid conditions might certainly have been obtained the peace of utrecht was neither dishonorable nor disadvantageous great britain it is true bore the greatest part of the weight of the war but she was manifestly the sole arbitress of peace she imposed terms on the victors as well as on the vanquished without gratifying the pride of france she checked the insolence of the confederates she favored those the most who first acquiesced in the plan she proposed she treated with neglect or punished with disappointment such as were either obstinate or slow the advantages which she obtained for herself though neither adequate to her victories nor her expense were solid and even splendid she secured the dominion of the mediterranean by obtaining gibraltar and minorca she strengthened her limits and extended her dominions  america she forced france to relinquish all pretenons to new soundland to cede hudsons bay and to eld st christophers she obliged the french king  acknowledge the protestant succession and to cease  protect and even to abandon the pretender she reed him to the humiliating necessity of destroying unkirk whose very ruins were to remain as a moment of his disgrace as the last triumph over  pride she terrified him into the greatest concessions to the duke of savoy whom of all the allies he hated the most  on the peace of utrecht with regard to the confederates the most of them were highly satisfied and none had any great reason to complain the king of prussia obtained all his demands the duke of savoy was recompensed beyond his most sanguine hopes he had obtained the cession of savoy the district of nice with all that he had received in italy from the emperor leopold he was raised to the regal title and to the throne of sicily and he was eventually to succeed to the crown of spain in default of philip the fifth and his issuemale the king of portugal had contributed little to the carrying on of the war and his demands from the peace were few and without hesitation granted luxembourg namur charleroi together with the other cities already in their possession were given as a barrier to the states their commerce with france was placed on the foundation established by the tariff of      with regard to the empire the rhine was to form its limits on the side of france all fortifications either possessed or raised by the french beyond that river were to be restored to the emperor or destroyed the kingdom of naples and the duchy of milan were ceded for ever to his imperial majesty and the rest of the dominions of italy that had changed masters in the course of the war were to return to their former sovereigns there was a considerable difference it must be confessed between these terms and those offered by france in the year   0  but a change of circumstances may justify an alteration of sentiments without abandoning the project of reducing the too great power of the house of bourbon the british ministry might allege that there was an equal necessity for prescribing limits to the vast claims of the family of austria  perilous situation of the earl of oxford the lordtreasurer obtained a triumph over his enemies by concluding the treaty of utrecht but he still stood upon very dangerous ground distrusted equally by both sides he was destitute of friends and his whole security rested in the implacable jealousy of the two parties who were alike his enemies in this tottering situation he endeavored to support himself by flattering the tories in private and by taking publicly the ground of the whigs in the political farce he was in some measure the sole actor and the populace were the spectators who were to decide his merit and even his fate to the common people the appeal of the rivals for power had been made for many years the terrors of the vulgar for popery and their principles in favor of the protestant religion had been the great support of the established form of government the bulk of the nation were hitherto favorable to the ministry to retain their confidence was a matter of the last importance to the earl of oxford as by the triennial act the present parliament was near its end the whigs to influence the approaching elections had propagated with more assiduity than success an opinion that the queen and her servants were irrecoverably in the interest of the pretender to prevent the bad consequences of this dangerous impression was a measure of necessity and it employed the whole attention of the leaders of the tories  he is hated by both parties the boldest and the least politic proposed the passing of a septennial bill as the best and most decisive means of securing the continuance of their own power stuartpapers       the lordtreasurer was too timid or perhaps too prudent to follow their advice he perceived that a measure so unpopular would deprive him of the support of the vulgar and place an uncontrolable power in the hands of the highflying tories the cabinetcouncil were his enemies he knew that the most vehement of those who supported his measures in the two houses wished only for the continuance of their present influence in parliament that should they attain their purpose they would be willing to join with his avowed enemies the whigs and to send him to the tower ibid feb       to amuse the jacobites he admitted the agents of the pretender into his conversation and privacy ibid feb          he endeavored to persuade them that all his measures tended to the accomplishment of their wishes and views but he had the misfortune to be as little believed by the excluded family as he was by the legal heirs of the crown his caution his slow measures his mysterious character were by no means calculated to create in others any confidence in his conduct his only hold of his power was the ascendant which he obtained over the queen by terrifying that timid princess with reports of danger and by insinuating artfully that she could be safe only in his own hands he reduced her into a state of dependence on himself and generally subservient to all his designs mss passim   his secret views and intrigues in one important instance her habitual obedience to the minister is said to have yielded to her prejudices to secure himself with the populace the lordtreasurer resolved to take the ground of the whigs the danger of the protestant succession from the queen and her servants had been long a favorite topic with that party they were at great pains to inform the public that the courts of london and hannover were upon the very worst terms though this was a notorious fact they had hitherto found it difficult to persuade the populace on that head to remove every impression of this kind the minister formed a design of inducing the queen to assure her parliament in her speech from the throne that the utmost harmony subsisted between her and the presumptive heirs of her crown he even attempted to reconcile the jacobites to the propriety of this measure he told them that should the house of hannover upon these assurances desert the whigs that party who were ready to sacrifice their professed principles to their passions would declare for the pretender that this circumstance would ruin their importance with the populace and enable the real friends of the excluded prince to secure for him the succession stuartpapers march       the queen averse from the house of hannover though the adherents of the pretender were too zealous and sanguine to be incredulous they gave little faith to the assurances of the earl of oxford ibid  but though they relied in nothing upon his attachment to their cause they affected to place the utmost confidence in his measures the queen however was not so easily won to his project of assuring the nation of her zeal for the protestant succession either from a returning affection for her own family or rendered averse from the interests o the presumptive heirs of the crown by the intrigues o their agents in london she for some time refused to make any mention at all of the house of hannover in her speech hannoverpapers may          the lordtreasurer made the strongest representations against this unexpected resolution he applied to her prudence he alarmed her fears he told her that the safety of her government and perhaps of her person depended upon her quieting the minds of people with regard to the protestant succession that her silence upon the present occasion would confirm the reports industriously spread by the whigs that by expressing zeal for the family of hannover she would defeat the designs of their adherents and that by taking the only ground upon which the whigs fortified themselves against her authority she would reap all the benefit of their situation and ensure to her servants every advantage in the approaching elections ibid   april  th her speech to her parliament swayed by these arguments or yielding to her own fears the queen at length consented she opened the session of parliament on the ninth of april with a speech from the throne she informed the two houses that the negociations of peace were brought to a happy conclusion she mentioned what she had done for the security of the protestant succession she expressed her hopes that the perfect friendship which subsisted between her and the house of hannover would effectually disappoint such persons as made a merit of separating their interests she demanded of the commons the necessary supplies she earnestly recommended the cultivating of the arts of peace as the best means for repairing the losses sustained by the enormous expense of the war she complained of the license of the press and the dangerous growth of the impious practice of duelling she mentioned the necessity of restraining both these evils with new laws as the old were inadequate to that salutary purpose she left she said the force necessary for the protection of the nation to the wisdom of her parliament as for herself she wanted no protection but the loyalty of her people no guarantee but the interest she had in their hearts having recommended unanimity in their councils and requested them to use their endeavors to calm the minds of her people she concluded with a reflection on the partyrage which had so long disturbed the repose of her kingdom journals april  th        the whigs disconcerted this judicious speech disconcerted the whigs in all their projects in the house of commons an address of thanks was voted with but one dissenting voice stuartpapers  it was carried with a great majority in the house of lords    against     disappointed in their public exhibitions the party had recourse to their secret intrigues sunderland orford townshend halifax summers cowper and the lordchiefjustice parker consulted together for two days hannoverpapers       but they could contrive no probable means for preventing the lordtreasurers designs the lords townshend and halisax went twice in the name of the rest to kreyenberg the hannoverian resident they affirmed that the queens speech had given a fatal blow to the influence of the whigs and the protestant succession that the authority of the sovereign had overturned all the designs of their party that the nation gave implicit credit to the queen and construed into partyrage all insinuations against the existence of a perfect friendship between her and the court of hannover that the elector only could undeceive the people that therefore a decisive step was necessary otherwise the interests of his family and the hopes of his friends would be for ever lost ibid april           their intrigues with the hannoverian resident in this distressful situation they implored kreyenberg to lay their humble solicitations at the feet of the elector they entreated his highness for the sake of god hannoverpapers       to send over the electoral prince without the presence of one of the family they solemnly averred that the succession must inevitably be defeated this request they had frequently made to no purpose before the meeting of parliament they now renewed their entreaties with more confidence as their own condition was more helpless and the juncture itself more favorable they desired the prince to take advantage of the queens declaration to feign to believe her sincere and to come under pretense of returning thanks in person they said that without his presence they could move nothing effectually in parliament that they could not even mention the pension expected for the princess sophia that the only question of party they could propose was the removal of the pretender from lorrain but say they if the electoral family shall not interfere decisively the earl of oxford will save us the trouble of that motion he has gained the people by the artifice of the queens speech he will also succeed in the approaching elections and establish the pretender in the kingdom as the eventual successor to the throne hannoverpapers        proceedings of the commons while the whigs were thus disconcerted the ministry carried all their measures with little opposition in parliament though no communication of the treaty had been made to the two houses they had returned general thanks for the peace the commons granted the demanded supplies journals april     they reduced the troops and navy according to the directions of the court they gained the army by allowing halfpay to the officers they secured their influence with their constituents by reducing the land tax to two shillings in the pound in the midst of this attention to the nation they showed their attachment to the ministry the commissioners for examining the accounts of the army made a report that bore hard on former mismanagements some instances of corruption and embezzlement of public money were detected but it soon appeared that the house was more eager to expose the enemies of the prevailing party than to punish the guilty one william churchill a member was slightly censured a vote was passed against the earl of wharton for having sold an office for a thousand pounds but as this instance of corruption happened before the act of general pardon the house took advantage of that circumstance and resolved to proceed no farther in the matter may      treaty of commerce before the house this appearance of unanimity in the house of commons was soon interrupted by an important debate though the terms of the treaty had not hitherto been communicated to parliament the proclamation of the peace on the fifth of may had been attended with the loudest acclamations of the populace the nation in general were highly pleased that a period was put to a war whose excessive weight had rendered them insensible to its renown the treaty which settled the cession of territories between her britannic majesty and the french king was accompanied by a treaty of commerce between great britain and france the ratifications of the two treaties had been exchanged at utrecht on the twentyeighth of april on the ninth of may mr benson chancellor of the exchequer delivered to the commons a message from the queen she informed the house that though it was the undoubted prerogative of the crown to make peace and war she had resolved from the beginning to communicate to her parliament the treaties she had now concluded journals may  th  the house appointed the fourteenth of may for resolving themselves into a grand committee to consider the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of navagation and commerce a conversation rather than a debate passed between the parties on the treaty of peace the whigs found in the treaty of commerce the best ground for opposing the court with any prospect of success  arguments for and against it when the house met on the fourteenth of may a motion was made to bring in a bill to make good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce a violent debate arose between the friends of the minister and the leaders of the whigs the first endeavored to prove that a great advantage would result to the nation from a free commerce with france the latter affirmed that a trade with that kingdom would prove extremely prejudicial to the woollen silk and paper manufactories and above all to the commerce with portugal which brought annually so much bullion into the kingdom the friends of the ministry deduced their arguments from an enumeration of the vast quantities of british commodities exported to france before the two last wars the whigs averred that since the revolution the state of commerce was entirely changed that france had set up and encouraged woollen manufactures of her own that britain had learned in the course of so many years to accommodate herself without the product of france that the french having the work performed for les money could sell their goods at a cheaper rate that should britain even be capable of balancing her own trade with france she could not prevent the latter kingdom from engrossing the commerce of other countries that the increase of the trade to portugal the most valuable branch of british commerce was owing to the high duties which amounted to a kind of prohibition of french wines that should the duties on these wines be reduced to an equality with those on the wines of portugal the trade with that kingdom would be lost as men in general would prefer the wines of france when they could be purchased at the same rate debates printed   bill concerning it rejected the adherents of the ministry advanced arguments equally solid and conclusive but when parties are inflamed against each other passion decides in the place of reason upon a division of the house the bill was ordered to be introduced by a great majority     against   0  the whigs adhering to their purpose of distressing the minister called the prejudices of the nation to their aid they carried their arguments to the press the lordtreasurer opposed them on the same ground but the fate of the bill was not ultimately determined by this public contest many of the tories to the last degree offended at the trimming conduct of the earl of oxford had resolved to join the whigs on the present occasion to accomplish his ruin sir thomas hanmer though he had been instrumental in concluding the treaty of commerce opposed it with vehemence as the best ground for affronting the lordtreasurer he was at the head of a society of forty members of the house of commons who called themselves the octoberclub this junto resolved to throw their whole weight in the scale of the opposing party and to terrify the earl of oxford into decisive measures for the pretender they had frequently requested him in vain to remove the whigs from the lieutenancy of the counties the commissions of the peace and the offices of the revenue he had repeatedly made the most solemn promises upon this subject but though the dissolution of parliament was approaching he had hitherto done nothing in an affair upon which the success of the tories at the new elections so much depended stuartpapers june          when therefore the bill was brought to a debate the most violent of the tories led by hanmer opposed its being engrossed and upon a division of the house carried their point by a majority of nine votes     against       discontents of the scots during the dependence of this bill another matter of still greater importance employed the attention of parliament the house of commons in renewing the duty on malt for another year extended that tax to scotland the members for that part of the kingdom unanimously opposed the measure they complained that the duty in itself too great a burden for their country was contrary to an express article of the union between the kingdoms that it had been stipulated by that treaty that no duty should be laid on malt in northbritain during the continuance of the war that though hostilities had ceased no formal peace was yet concluded with spain that though a pacification between the two crowns was no longer a matter of uncertainty yet it was a maxim in law that odious things were to be literally understood but that matters of favor were to be interpreted with more liberality that as the tax itself was by the express words of the bill to be applied to deficiencies in the war this act laid an impost on the scots from which they were evidently exempted by the treaty of union burnet vol iv  these arguments made a great impression on the house but on a division a majority appeared on the side of the bill the scottish members in both houses of parliament were so much offended that they met at a tavern and having appointed two lords and two commoners to wait in their name upon the queen they requested her permission for bringing in a bill for the dissolution of the union mss passim   character of the duke of argyle though the queen expressed the greatest uneasiness at the address of the scots they resolved to proceed in their intended motion several of the jacobite part of the tories entered with eagerness into a measure which was well calculated to distress the earl of oxford the whigs for the like reason were ready to throw their weight into the same scale but the person who animated the whole opposition on this subject was the duke of argyle this nobleman espousing the principles or passions of his family had uniformly professed his attachment to the protestant succession and his consequent aversion to a minister who was deemed to favor the pretender careless and eager in his disposition he neither concealed his resentment nor disguised his designs with a commanding manner which stamped his very forwardness with an appearance of authority he was feared by many but beloved by none brave in his person but not remarkable for his conduct he might be considered in his military capacity as a bold partizan rather than a judicious commander in his civil character his fire degenerated into a violence that often defeated his views in his public exhibitions in parliament he was rather spirited than eloquent better calculated to terrify his enemies than to support his friends his great defect was a love of money and emolument which he could not effectually conceal with all the efforts of his pride hannover and stuartpapers       his chief talent was an address in managing the prejudices of the vulgar he marked their opinions as they changed and fell dexterously down with the tide  motion for dissolving the union the earl of oxford no stranger to the importance

unwilling to trust a place of such importance in the hands of a man whom interest only could gain to his side disappointment heightened the dukes resentment he resolved to gain by force what he could not obtain by favor he opposed the court with vehemence he treated the minister with insult he therefore entered with great zeal into the counsels of his countrymen for the dissolution of the union between the two kingdoms to carry a point of such great importance was likely to introduce a confusion into the measures of government that would prove fatal to the power of the earl of oxford the resentment of the most violent jacobites kept pace with the warmth and vehemence of the whigs both resolved to ruin the lordtreasurer as each looked upon him in the light of an enemy they flattered

important subject but the force of argument was less apparent on both sides than the irreconcilable spirit of the two parties the violence of argyle against the earl of oxford was ultimately serviceable to that minister at the same time that it contributed to defeat his own designs the duke having in the course of the debate mentioned with the utmost contempt the pretender offended some

desertion of his friends upon the treaty of commerce and the motion for dissolving the union threw the earl of oxford into a kind of political despair he saw that he was hated by the tories at the same time that he was proscribed by the whigs the irreconcilable animosity of the two parties had been hitherto the only support of his power the predominancy of either was to him alike destructive his prudence was now in arms against his principles the most direct way to preserve his authority was to gratify the more violent tories by abetting the views of the pretender but even that obvious path was beset with difficulties and dangers should his measures assume the appearance of jacobitism the jealousy of the people against popery might throw them into the scale of the whigs to retain the favor of the populace was now as necessary as to regain the support of the tories he had therefore recourse to the old expedient of giving private assurances to the jacobites while he marked his public conduct with a zeal for the house of hannover though this artifice was too stale to deceive the tories the whigs showed such an intemperate joy for their success in the affair of the treaty of commerce that the former resolved to support a minister they hated to exclude a party whom they had great reason to fear mss passim   proceedings of parliament impressed with this opinion such tories

message imported that the civil list prior to the year    0 when the late changes in the ministry happened had run greatly in arrear that her majesty therefore requested the house to enable her to raise a sum sufficient to pay her debts upon the funds of the civil list as the message contained a kind of reflection upon the former ministry the consequent motion was opposed with great vehemence by the whigs but they found upon this occasion that their late triumphs were not owing to themselves a bill empowering the queen to raise five hundred and ten thousand pounds for the payment of the

whigs resolved to move for an address that the most pressing instances should be used with the duke of lorrain to remove from his dominions the pretender to the crown of great britain this motion was opposed in the house of lords by none but the lord north the commons voted the address without one dissenting voice this spirit of compliance defeated the views of the whigs they hoped that their

throne she thanked in a particular manner the commons for the supplies by which they had amply provided for the public service she hoped at the next meeting the affair of commerce would be so well understood that the advantageous conditions obtained from france might be rendered effectual to her people by law she expressed how sensible she was of the affection zeal and duty of the commons she recounted their former services she enlarged upon their late favors she acknowledged her gratitude for their having furnished her with supplies for continuing the war and for strengthening her hands

advantageous and honorable peace she requested her parliament to make the people sensible of what they had gained by the late treaties she entreated them to remove the groundless jealousies which had been so industriously raised to prevent all unhappy divisions that might not only weaken but even endanger the advantages which she had obtained for her kingdoms there are some very few i hope she

in the whole speech no mention was made of the pretender none of the protestant succession but they were most offended at the contempt with with which she treated the opposing party and the impression

artifice and clamor of contending knaves the object of the two parties was the same  the parliament was dissolved and each endeavored to serve themselves with the people in the approaching elections  intrigues and dissensions in the cabinet the speech that gave so much offense to the whigs seems to have been fabricated without the advice of the earl of oxford though he was the ostensible minister he guided no longer the cabinet when he was in a manner proscribed by the two contending parties in parliament he was violently attacked in the closet the viscount bolingbroke who had from the beginning traversed his measures had long fixed his eyes upon his power having gained the lady masham by gratifying her passion for the public money he insinuated himself into the favor of the queen

nothing for the pretender his manner and his opinions were alike disgustful to both sides with a show of application to business he never brough affairs to a period he heard representations with an appearance of attention but his answers were slight undecisive and vague the viscount bolingbroke yielding to his own intemperate ambition or the natural violence of his character despised oxford and

   the mortifications which the treasurer experienced proceeded from the machinations of his rival more than from the inveteracy of his enemies the treaty of commerce must be reprobated as it was then

elector of brunswick to send to great britain the electoral prince they had represented in the strongest and most decisive terms that the queen and her servants were irrecoverably attached to the pretender they threw his highness in the affair of the succession into a despondence that degenerated into a kind of despair he became careless and indifferent about a throne which was represented so difficult to ascend to humor however those who called themselves his friends he agreed at length to send his brother duke ernest to great britain the whigs disappointed by this proposal formed an opinion that his highness was jealous of the influence which might be acquired by his son in great britain they requested him therefore to come in person but he absolutely refused to comply with a demand that seemed at once impracticable in itself and inconsistent with his own dignity hannoverpapers        intrigues of the whigs though the backwardness of the elector threw a damp on his party his servants continued with a degree of eagerness a correspondence with the whigs his highness having positively declared that he would not risk an expedition into britain in a hostile manner prior to the queens death his ministers had begun to take precautions in expectation of that event they had sent early in the year several queries to the leaders of the whigs the answers which were to form the line of their conduct were given by the lords summers cowper and halifax they declared that no commission granted either by the princess sophia or the elector could be valid should these be signed and executed during the queens life they declined for themselves to act upon authorities neither established by precedents nor appointed by law the duke of marlborough and general cadogan who signified their inclination to have the eventual command of the troops were not so scrupulous they declared that a writing in french without any adherence to forms would be sufficient that the authority of the duke of marlborough was so great among the soldiers that any piece of parchment was enough to ensure their obedience to his command as for cadogan he wished only for a show of authority to take possession of the tower or to place himself in conjunction with the electoral prince at the head of the british troops that still lay in garrison in some cities in flanders hannover papers passim

to political writers and for spies planted round the pretender though their solicitations on these subjects had been attended with little success they continued to make applications of the same disagreeable kind when the session was drawing to a conclusion and a dissolution was foreseen they demanded one hundred thousand pounds from the elector to corrupt boroughs to influence the elections and to return men of constitutional and whiggish principles to the ensuing parliament ibid  the magnitude of the sum left no room for hesitation in rejecting their request one repulse however was not sufficient either to intimidate or discourage a party so eager in the pursuit of their designs they diminished their demand to fifty thousand pounds the elector plainly told them that he could not spare the money that he had done the greatest service consistent with his own particular situation and the state of europe in general to the well affected in great britain that he had engaged the emperor and empire to continue the war against france that he employed seventeen thousand of his troops against that kingdom that this circumstance had deprived the french king of the power of sending

correspondence except such as solely conveyed intelligence of the state of opinions and the secret intrigues in government the same distrust of the lord treasurer that prevailed at hannover was entertained with much more reason at barleduc but both agreed in the opinion that his own safety would at length induce the earl of oxford to throw himself in the scale of the pretender the adherents of that prince placed however their greatest hopes in the inclinations of queen anne they knew that an interior cabinet was formed in opposition to the trimming conduct of the lord treasurer that bolingbroke who had long hated that nobleman had flattered the prejudices of the queen and her favorite to ruin the minister that the latter had applied to the principal whigs for protection against his colleagues in office ibid  that the whigs had rejected his supplications and that he was thrown into political despair the jacobites therefore hoped to derive from his situation an aid which they could not expect from his principles ibid   whigs encourage the emperor to continue the war the whigs in their eagerness for power and office had extended their intrigues to the councils of foreign powers their expectations and their fears for themselves had induced them to flatter the emperor and empire to the continuance of an unequal war they insinuated through the court of hannover that one of two events very likely soon to arise would turn the balance against the house of bourbon that should the queen already manifestly near her end happen to die the war would be instantly renewed by great britain under the electoral family that in case of the demise of lewis the fourteenth who was now broken with infirmities and age france by falling under the dominion of a minor would be

avarice had assembled before his house disappointed in their expectations gave free vent to their aversion to france and popery they were easily induced to connect the interests of the pretender with the objects of daumonts embassy and thus the whigs contrived to instill a jealousy into the populace to favor their own interests in the general elections  riotous behavior of the scots the ferment raised in england by the general elections extended itself to scotland with equal violence the whigs as well as the tories in that part of the kingdom were averse from the minister the first were

impeach her majestys title to the crown and the succession of the house of hannover that sir constantine phipps lordchancellor of ireland had acted contrary to his duty and the protestant interest by representing the author as an object of the queens mercy that the lordchancellor had in a speech to the lord mayor and aldermen of dublin jan          by declaring his opinion prejudiced a cause

should immediately withdraw and prepare an address to her majesty on the subject of these votes the commons offended at the resolutions of the lords extended further censures to the conduct of phipps they accused him openly of abetting the views of the jacobites from his refusing his approbation as chancellor of a person elected lord mayor of dublin merely because that person was attached to the principles of the late revolution the flame could be only extinguished by a prorogation the duke of shrewsberry apprized of the declining health of the queen was willing of himself to put a period to the contests in ireland and to return to london though the indiscreet jacobitism of the lord chancellor merited censure the conduct of the irish commons was much blamed by the british tories the figure which phipps had made at the trial of doctor sacheverell had gained the affection of the churchparty the whigs were loud on the other side of the question and the truth is that the chancellor

two parties continued though the tories were in general the most successful more whigs found their way into the house of commons in the present than in the preceding elections the new parliament which was to have met on the twelfth of november was further prorogued to the tenth of december this measure was at the time ascribed to the manifest decline of the queens health and the squabbles among her servants the earl of oxford having received a repulse from the whigs in the month of august hannoverpapers       had endeavored to regain the confidence of the tories to gratify their prejudices some

prejudices of the sovereign the duke might have probably deserted the principles of the whigs which like many of the party he had only adopted to favor his own designs but when he found that the queen was obdurate and that the pretender himself treated his proposals with caution and even distrust he fell back with vehemence into his former professions to the house of hannover he corresponded with that family without either ceremony or distinction he accused the ministry of incurable jacobitism and in the general accusation even involved his friend bolingbroke he was joined in these assurances by most of the leaders of the whigparty the duke of argyle yielding to personal resentment affirmed to the envoy of hannover that he knew from his own experience the lordtreasurer was a false and deceitful man that he exerted himself with all his might against the protestant succession that he was reforming the army to facilitate the restoration of the pretender and that even his friends acknowledged he was too far engaged to retreat the earl of ilay extended his accusations much further than his brother the duke of argyle he assured the hannoverian resident that the presbyterians

poor conscientious lords who were in want of subsistence they demanded with the most vehement entreaties two thousand pounds to carry the elections for the common council of london they represented

agree to any of our proposals we must in prudence provide for ourselves and yield to the times hannoverpapers dec        despondence of the electors servants these representations though not sufficient to prevail with the elector to make remittances threw his servants into a kind of political despair if we shall do nothing ourselves they said for the succession we cannot expect to succeed without a miracle but our disappointment of a crown is the least evil we have to fear our troubles will only begin when our hopes shall come to an end having raised so many enemies by our prospect of the british throne we can enjoy neither peace nor safety in the electorate those who either feared or envied our elevation will never be satisfied till we are so low that they may be assured they have

of their fears a proposal made by the baron de bernstorff president of the electors council was received by marlborough and cadogan with eagerness and joy he insinuated that his electoral highness might be induced to borrow to the extent of twenty thousand pounds from his friends in britain this sum was to be laid out on the poor lords and the common council of london during the three years the parliament was to sit the first would be thus enabled to vote according to their principles the latter might ply the government and harass the queen and her ministers with remonstrances in favor of civil liberty and the protestant succession marlborough and cadogan undertook to furnish the money on the obligation of his electoral highness provided the interest of five per cent should be regularly paid ibid dec  0       but his highness would give no obligation either for the principal or interest he however signified to his agents that his friends should advance the money as they

vain to dispel their groundless fears nothing could remove their apprehensions till the queen herself wrote a letter on the first of february to the lord mayor announcing her recovery the public melancholy and panic were changed at once into festivity and joy the armies reported to be assembled in the bolognese and the squadrons said to be preparing in the ports of france disappeared like an

baits to deceive they wrote to hannover that the object of harleys commission was twofold that either the queen appeared to the lordtreasurer to be in such a bad state of health as to render it

in parliament ibid march         but notwithstanding the accession of so many tories to the cause of the house of hannover their agents were extremely diffident of the succession they informed their court that out of ten who were for the electoral family nine would accommodate themselves to the times that whatever their principles might have been in speculation they would hazard nothing in practice that in the affair of the succession they would embrace the cause of the first of the rivals for the throne that should arrive in the kingdom that those who expressed the greatest zeal for the protestant line flattered themselves that the government of the pretender whom they looked upon as a weak prince would not be so great an evil as a perpetual civil war ibid   sentiments of both

but i frankly acknowledge he continued that should ever matters be pushed to any length on that side the greatest part of us tories will submit while some of you whigs will perhaps be fools enough to

two parties flew into their usual flame a motion was made in the house of commons against a pamphlet written with great acrimony and boldness charging the servants of the queen with maladministration and asserting in express terms that the protestant succession was in danger through their machinations this performance though the work of a mr moore mss passim  was ascribed to mr richard steel a name well known in the republic of letters steel who had obtained a seat in the house of commons acknowledged himself the author of this obnoxious publication after various and long debates he was upon a division expelled the house march          in the house of lords the whigs foreseeing the severity against steel extended their animadversions to a publication written in opposition to his pamphlet this answer which reflected severely on the scottish nation had been ascribed by public report to the famous dr swift it was chiefly levelled against the duke of argyle who was hated by the doctors patron the earl of oxford but though the violence of the whigs yielded not to that of the tories they were not equal to them in point of numbers when the matter came to a vote the ministry however chose to remove the whole affair from before the lords into a court of common law  the ministry dismiss several officers during the contest between the parties in parliament secret animosities subsisted in the cabinet the two rivals for the queens favor were however united in their public measures against the whigs on account of their common fears the ministry were no strangers to the designs of that party they knew that the elector had been long solicited to undertake an invasion they resolved therefore to be prepared against an event that threatened their own power as well as the queens authority it was upon this account and not in favor of the pretender that they fell upon the suspicious measure of new modelling the army in the middle of march the duke of argyle the earl of stair and other officers of rank whom the ministry suspected were removed from all their military employments the queen however paid an equivalent in money to the dismissed officers the measure furnished the artful with an object of clamor and terrified the credulous and timid the viscount bolingbroke who was known to have obtained the ascendant over the lordtreasurer was accused of being the author of these dangerous counsels his enemies affirmed that despairing of the queens life and excluded from every hope of the favor of the house of hannover he precipitated every thing to pave the way for the restoration of the pretender publications of the times   the elector refuses to gratify the whigs the leaders of the whigs terrified by this appearance of decision in the ministry fell into their usual despondence they declared their opinion that no hope remained but in the death of the queen or in that of the pretender they blamed the court of hannover for having sacrificed their friends as well as their own hopes of the throne the elector argued in vain against the propriety of yielding to their desperate requests he knew he said that the queen was averse from seeing any of his family in her dominions that not withstanding her prejudices he would have sent the electoral prince to london had he not been persuaded that the measure would bring matters to an open rupture that as it was impracticable to bring the lawful successor into the kingdom they ought to secure the succession by removing his competitor that he had already made repeated instances to the queen on that subject that he was resolved to renew his remonstrances that as to their unceasing demands of money for poor lords commoncouncils bribery of members and private pensions he would hear no more of

willing to support to the utmost their party hannoverpapers march  0 n s        unmanly fears of that party these assurances on the part of the elector neither answered the hopes nor removed the fears of the whigs though such tories as were in the interest of the house of hannover though the lordtreasurer himself though the concurring voice of the whole ministry declared that the protestant succession was in no danger the leaders of the party gave way to their own unmanly terrors they drew inferences from uncertain facts they improved into strong realities idle rumors they even believed that preparations were already made for sending several of their leaders to the tower in this state of doubt and uneasiness they resolved to make one other effort to gain the people by awaking their fears the lords having taken the state of the nation into consideration the earls of wharton nottingham and sunderland with other peers of the same party represented in the strongest terms the danger that threatened the protestant succession they moved that an address should be presented to her majesty on the subject of the removal of the pretender from lorrain and on other points calculated to raise the resentment of the populace against the ministry on this occasion the earl of oxford made a motion which seemed preposterous as the motive was then unknown he moved for leave to bring in a bill for the further security of the protestant succession by making it high treason to bring any foreign troops into the kingdom hannoverpapers passim        their conspiracy to seize the tower etc men who ascribe to policy every measure of a minister will find it difficult to account for the motion made by the lordtreasurer if as he averred in the house he only meant to preclude the adherents of the pretender from invading the kingdom his expedient was altogether nugatory and unnecessary such troops as should attend that prince would have been open enemies if foreigners and rebels if natives the treasurer seems to have reasons for his present conduct which he did not choose to reveal the states general alarmed by the terrors of the whigs and the zealous representations of the agents of hannover began to make preparations for aiding effectually the elector in his views on the british throne some ships of war were made ready for sea in their ports some troops especially the

with action the deliberations of their leaders measures were concerted by a society called the kitcat club to seize the tower to declare for the family of hannover to secure the persons of such as were suspected of favoring the pretender in this number the lordtreasurer himself had the misfortune of being comprehended by his enemies and he awkwardly chose this preposterous motion as a kind of proof of his being no stranger to the designs of the whigs hannoverpapers passim      publications of the times mss passim   reflections in all states that possess any portion of public freedom the appeal of parties is always made to the people though the body of the nation enjoy but a very small share of any government they make up with their weight and numbers what they want in authority as

happens to possess themselves of that strong hold they over a we their antagonists and govern at discretion the noisy populace by whose suffrages they have ascended to power the domestic history of the present reign contains little more than a continued series of such political hostilities in this clamorous contest as well as in real war the combatants acquire an experience from length of time that frequently suspends the fate of the conflict when a decision is most to be apprehended  protestant succession voted out of danger the whigs with a perseverance worthy of a better cause than any design on power and office had long continued their attacks on the tories the weight of government the efforts of the church and the great popularity of the queen herself had hitherto frustrated all their efforts disappointed in their public conduct they had lately recourse to private measures and succeeded in gaining over such tories as were discontented with the ministry the agents of the house of hannover at the suggestion of the leading whigs had prevailed with the earl of anglesea and his followers in the house of lords to desert the tories upon promises of future advantage hannoverpapers       sir william dawes though spontaneously raised by the queen to the sea of york promised upon the like assurances to desert the measures of the court and to carry over to the whigs a majority of the bench of bishops ibid  encouraged by this unexpected defection the party introduced a warm debate in the house of lords on the fifth of april after various speeches the question was proposed whether the protestant succession was in danger on a division the courtparty prevailed by twelve votes    against     the earls of abingdon and jersey the lords ashburnham herbert and carteret who had uniformly supported the ministry joined the whigs on the present occasion the same question being agitated before the commons was carried by a greater majority for the adherents of the court     against  0    cause of the desertion of some tories though the desertion of so many tories from the ministry may be ascribed in some degree to the promises of the hannoverian agents they had motives of another kind the most of those who joined the whigs had been highly irrigated against the earl of oxford they knew that a party had long been forming against him in the cabinet and that a defeat in parliament was only wanting to the completion of his ruin he was abandoned by his brethren in office he was no longer supported by the queen herself the scanty majority in a question on which his power depended was equal to a partial defeat every body expected to see him next day without his staff as treasurer he himself offered to resign hannoverpapers april       but he contrived to insinuate to the queen by one of his friends that her ruin would succeed his fall struck with this application her usual fears began to return though at the solicitation of the lady masham she had consented to dismiss the treasurer she became again reconciled to that minister upon certain conditions hannoverpapers april       the earl of nottingham who hoped to succeed oxford in the treasury was again disappointed ibid  and thus was forced by his resentment to abet a party of whose principles he secretly disapproved  motions of the whigs against the pretender the whigs encouraged by the late accession to their party carried farther their opposition against the crown on the subject of the chevalier de st george only they could raise the fears of the people they moved therefore for an address to her majesty for renewing her instances with the duke of lorrain to expel the pretender from his dominions an addition made to their motion seemed levelled against the suspected feelings of the queens mind it was proposed to request her majesty to issue a proclamation setting a price on her brothers head the lord north and gray seconded by the lord trevor opposed with vehemence this latter measure april         they represented that the motion was as inconsistent with common humanity as it was repugnant to the christian religion that to set a price on any mans head was to encourage assassination by public authority that for their own parts should ever the case come before them as peers and judges they would think themselves bound in justice honor and conscience to condemn such an action as murder the whigs argued upon the ground of expediency but the tory lords who had joined them some days before deserted them on this occasion the bishops either from principle or decency were averse from this sanguinary measure and upon a division the addition to the first motion was rejected journals april     their fears superfluous and vain the address to the queen was presented only by a few whig lords could a judgment be formed of the state of things from the conduct of parliament one might suppose that the nation was then in imminent danger that the pretender was ready to make a descent upon britain with a powerful army or that he was invited by a formidable party at home that his friends only waited for his arrival to dethrone the queen and utterly extirpate all the whigs in the kingdom the contrary of all this was the truth the french who could only support the pretender were unwilling to plunge into those disasters from which they had been lately extricated by a species of miracle lewis the fourteenth never hearty in the cause of the excluded stuarts was now more averse than ever from giving them any effectual support his ambition and his love of glory had vanished with his power he felt the decline of years though still eager to live he foresaw his own approaching death the prospect of french affairs was gloomy beyond that period he was to leave the scepter in the hands of a sickly infant under the tuition of an unprincipled relation who from the very misfortunes of the late war had perhaps extended his views to the crown in this melancholy state at home lewis thought of nothing less than to kindle a war abroad by assisting the pretender  observations on their conduct were then the fears of the whigs an idle dream or aimed they only at the persecution of an unfortunate woman already driven to the verge of the grave by solicitude as well as disease to save the honor of that party the answer to these questions must be made at the expense of their understanding having first endeavored to alarm the populace with the fears of popery and the pretender they began at length to be the dupes of their own arts and to believe seriously what they had so often averred their precipitate schemes had created the only dangers that now threatened the object of the act of settlement had the queen been less timid or the minister more violent or even more regardless of his original principles the first to preserve her authority and the latter to secure his power and perhaps ultimately his life might have entered into measures that would have proved fatal to the succession in the house of hannover the conduct of the whigs was throughout more calculated to irritate than to intimidate had the ministry carried into their councils that contradictory boldness and obstinacy which bad treatment invariably raises in the minds of the spirited and proud  their scheme to embarrass the queen though the whigs in a fit of despondence had threatened to the court of hannover to abandon their principles and to shift for themselves their success in the late questions had animated them to further attempts against the queen and her servants they had proposed to the hannoverian resident in the beginning of the session to demand a writ for the electoral prince to sit in the house of peers as duke of cambridge the resident without any direct orders from his court communicated his design to the lordtreasurer who had uniformly made the most violent yet the least effectual professions of his zeal for the protestant line that minister plainly told him that to bring over any of the family of lunenburgh would be to place her coffin before her majestys eyes and that those who had any respect for her friendship or hopes from her favor should never propose a thing so utterly disagreeable to her mind hannoverpapers    feb    march       the elector himself was as much averse from the measure as the queen he had uniformly refused his consent to the sending over the electoral prince in the preceding year and his refusal was so peremptory that the whigs and even his servants made no scruple of ascribing his conduct to a jealousy of his own son ibid      passim   a writ demanded for the electoral prince though the elector had not probably changed his sentiments he yielded in part to the earnest instances

of hannover she could not persuade herself that their minister acted in the present case by their instructions hannoverpapers april    n s       this was the only answer the resident could obtain to his demand the exultations of the whigs increased the resentment of the queen she declared in the most peremptory manner that she would rather suffer the last extremities than permit any prince of the electoral family to come to britain to reside during her life that she considered the conduct of the resident in the light of a personal affront as a mark of her ultimate displeasure she sent the master of the ceremonies to forbid schutz to appear any more at her court she ordered that officer to declare at the same time to the envoy that she intended to solicit the elector and electress for his instant recall ibid may     the lordtreasurers professions the lordtreasurer terrified at an incident that was likely to create an open rupture between the queen and the presumptive heirs of the

conscience of his oaths but out of a profound respect for their many virtues that he might without vanity say he had the chief hand in settling their succession to the crown that the lady masham was for the protestant line that he was sure the queen was inclined to the same side that nothing therefore could endanger the succession but the sending over any of the electoral family without her majestys consent ibid april     he however altered his language in a few days he declared that he never thought matters would have been pushed so far that he was apprehensive of his own speedy disgrace that he was desired to enter into the views of the pretender and that the queen was more determined than ever to strengthen the interest of her brother and to secure for him the throne ibid may     if anne was before attached to the eventual succession of the pretender the present incident was calculated to hasten her designs she was alarmed on the subject of the writ to a degree that gave an unusual animation and even vehemence to her conduct she wrote to the princess sophia she sent letters to the elector and the electoral prince she expressed to each her surprise at the design of sending the prince to england she almost openly threatened that his coming to britain might endanger if not prevent the succession of his family to the throne in this determined conduct that timid princess seems to have been chiefly supported by her own fears she found that the attachment of her subjects to her person declined with the state of her health that though she had many servants she was totally destitute of friends that those whom she trusted the most were the least likely to adhere to her cause that a minister who derived his claim to her favor from his pretending to support her measures was making terms for himself with her political enemies that her authority and even her very title as sovereign would depend upon the moderation of her successor and that she would be either

misfortunes or forming hopes upon his future prospects entered heartily into his cause perceiving the indifference of france he endeavored to gain the imperial court to the interest of his guest he even directed his envoy at the court of vienna to ask for him in marriage one of the daughters of the emperor joseph charles the sixth was so little offended at this request that the only objection he made was the disparity in their age the archdutchess was but twelve years old but the pretender was in his six and twentieth year the emperor recommended his own sister as a more suitable match he however prudently observed that the times were too critical to come to a determination on this head but that when an occasion should offer he was much disposed to give to the chevalier de st george solid marks of his esteem and regard stuartpapers feb           a proclamation against him offering a reward many zealots in britain maintained in the mean time a correspondence with the pretender and his servants the ministry continued to admit his agents into their conversation to serve or ruin his cause as might best suit with their own interest but amidst insinuations of attachment and perhaps professions of zeal they were betrayed into a measure which might convince him that his hopes from their favor were ill founded an information having been obtained by the vigilance of the earl of wharton against some irish officers who inlisted men for the pretender they were seized by a warrant from the queens bench the people were alarmed the whigs added artfully to their fears the adherents of the ministry were terrified the lordtreasurer now in concert with the whigs had wrought so much upon the natural timidity of the duke of shrewsbury that he joined him in an important measure upon the present occasion mss       the discovery made by wharton having fallen under the deliberation of the cabinetcouncil it was carried by a majority of votes that a proclamation should be issued against the pretender shrewsberry deserted his principles of jacobitism and his political friend bolingbroke upon this point hannoverpapers   th june   th july   a proclamation was accordingly issued on the twentythird of june promising a reward of five thousand pounds for apprehending the pretender whenever he should land or attempt to land in great britain the two houses voted an address of thanks to the queen and the commons in their zeal for the protestant succession extended the reward to one hundred thousand pounds journals june           the queen endeavors to soothe the elector the conduct of the queen upon the present occasion seemed inconsistent with her suspected attachment to the interest of the pretender but her fears from the family of lunenburgh had suspended her affection for her own her object was to soothe the elector to agree to her request of keeping the prince at home she had taken early precautions for this purpose soon after the writ was demanded she appointed lord paget her ambassador to the court of hannover but his lordship having declined that service she conferred that character on her own cousin the earl of clarendon the elector on his part ordered the baron de bothmar to repair to london to supply the place of schutz who upon being forbid the court had left the kingdom bothmar endeavored to defeat the object of clarendons embassy by raising prejudices against that nobleman in the mind of the elector he informed his court that clarendon was a selfish and presumptuous fool hannoverpapers june          that when he was governor of an american province he dressed himself as a woman the better to represent the queens person that this foel to use bothmars words was appointed without the treasurers knowledge that bolingbroke had acquired the superiority and that oxford had made through kreyenberg the resident the most servile advances to bothmar himself a sure sign says he of his approaching fall ib   death of the princess sophia during these transactions the electress sophia died suddenly at hannover in the eightyfourth year of her age may    o s  she retained her faculties to the last but there is reason to believe that had she even survived queen anne she would not mount the throne she was a princess possessed of great prudence good sense lively parts and a considerable degree of knowledge with an affability of disposition that rendered her much beloved though she was the only person mentioned by name in the act of settlement her great age had prevented her from being the principal object of attention the elector without consulting her seems to have instructed his envoys in her name and the parties in britain who strove to pay their court to the family of luenburgh had for several years much neglected the princess her demise as it was not unexpected was regarded as a common occurrence scarce any mention is made of that event in the papers of the hannoveriat agents in britain except where it is announced in form to the queen her death therefore could produce no change on the present state of affairs  state of the ministry but though the elector was now one step nearer the throne his efforts to secure the succession were far from keeping pace with the sanguine hopes of his friends he made no preparations for sending the electoral prince to britain to gratify the whigs to put an end to the teasing entreaties of his servants and perhaps even to terrify queen anne he had given permission for demanding the writ but there is no reason to believe that he altered his first sentiments on that subject or that he ever seriously designed to permit his son to depart from his dominions this conduct would have thrown back the whigs into their former despondence had not their hopes of power been from time to time revived by the dissensions in the cabinet the common safety of the two candidates for the queens favor had hitherto preserved a kind of union in their public counsels the measures of the crown though languidly supported were carried forward with a degree of unanimity the jealousy of the tories except in a few questions on which some of their leaders joined the whigs from motives of private interest or resentment had cemented them together in a manner not to be disjoined by the squabbles between oxford and bolingbroke but as the quarrels of these men were likely soon to accomplish the fall of the one or the other the whigs looked forward to the confusion expected from that event they watched with eagerness the cabals of the two rivals and hoped through the dissensions of their political enemies to resume the reigns that had been struck from their own hands  parliament prorogued the supplies being granted and the public business in some measure finished the queen came in person to the house of lords on the ninth of july in her speech from the throne she made no mention either of the house of hannover or of the protestant succession her fears from the coming of the electoral prince were dissipated but her resentment was not yet abated she told the two houses that her chief concern was to preserve the liberty and the religion of her subjects and to secure the present and future tranquillity of the kingdom that to attain these desirable ends her parliament ought to show the same regard for the just prerogatives of the crown and for the honor of government as she had always expressed for the rights of her people journals july         having finished this speech she ordered the chancellor to prorogue the parliament to the tenth of august men who ascribed to some design all the measures of anne put various constructions on a prorogation which was not so suddenly expected those who argued with most decisiveness on this subject attributed the measure to the manifest decline in the health of the queen they affirmed that a dropsy under which she labored increased from day to day that the ministry had their reasons for wishing that parliament might not be sitting at her death besides that their projected schemes now demanded all their time and their care hannover papers july        open rupture among the ministry in reasoning in this manner mankind must have supposed that the ministry were united by the same principles and the same views nothing however could be more contrary to truth than this supposition the chief servants of the crown were divided between two irreconcilable rivals men obstinately resolved on each others destruction during the sitting of parliament the animosities between oxford and bolingbroke were in some degree restrained by their common fears their mutual friends established from time to time a temporary reconciliation between those rivals for power but when the parliament was prorogued they observed neither moderation nor common decency in their contests the first could bear no equal in the queens favor the latter was resolved to yield no longer to a superior they descended into altercation personal reflection and mutual accusation the lordtreasurer made no scruple to declare that he could produce evidence that bolingbroke was a determined jacobite bolingbroke on his part openly affirmed he had proofs in his hands that oxford was in the interest of the pretender though the allegations of neither seem to have been well founded they had both the misfortune to be believed ibid        immediate cause of their quarrel though the difference in their characters and a perpetual struggle for power had rendered the treasurer and secretary irreconcilable enemies a late incident in parliament was the obvious cause of their present fury a few days july   before the prorogation the lords took under consideration the trade to spain and the west indies as lately settled by the treaty concluded at madrid this examination was suggested by the lordtreasurer now secretly in the interest of the whigs to procure the fall of bolingbroke the queen had reserved for herself the fourth part of the assiento or contract for negroes this share was privately divided into sixteen parts five were designed for the lordtreasurer five for bolingbroke four for lady masham and two for one arthur moore the agent of the junto in this affair hannoverpapers july          the earl of oxford perceiving the dangerous state of the queens health sacrificed an uncertain interest for certain revenge in the course of the examination he made himself a party against his associates in spoil he joined those lords who insisted to hear the spanish merchants against the treaty ibid  he encouraged an address to the queen requesting her majesty to apply to the use of the public her part of the profits of the assiento contract bolingbroke dictated an answer that gave great offense to the lords neither he nor the lady masham could forgive the treasurer for a measure which in hurting their interest had deeply wounded their pride  concert between this incident hastened the fall of the treasurer but it was far from being the sole cause of his disgrace though bolingbroke had failed in his project of bringing marlborough into office in the preceding winter he never lost sight of that object during the whole session he is said to have held a correspondence with the duke whose only objection to the present men and measures was an irreconcilable aversion to the earl of oxford that minister by his suggesting no difficulties in any measure was a servant calculated to please a weak sovereign that was always haunted by political fears he had therefore obtained a dominion over the queen which neither the arts of bolingbroke nor the influence of lady masham could remove the demand of the writ made by the envoy of the house of hannover was one of these few incidents that had raised any appearance of spirit in the mind of anne bolingbroke had the address to persuade her that this measure was privately promoted by the earl of oxford his cabals with the whigs his vehement professions to the electoral family his mysterious conduct which she had now for the first time remarked confirmed the insinuations of bolingbroke she therefore resolved to dismiss a servant whom she could no longer consider in the light of a friend mss passim   bolingbroke and marlborough bolingbroke on the other hand humoured the queen in all her prejudices he suggested to her that to pay any attention for the future to the house of hannover was incompatible with her service hannoverpapers july  0       her resentment had placed her in the scale of the pretender as far as she was permitted by her own timidity and jealousy the principal object of bolingbroke was to perpetuate his influence that of marlborough to regain his former power the first knew that he could not support himself alone after the removal of the lordtreasurer the latter had no objection to his entering into any measures should that minister be removed from the cabinet the views of both were turned to their own interest should the queen live and continue her favor for the pretender they would probably have paved his way to the throne should she happen to die before matters were ripe the duke had established an interest with the family of hannover that might preserve his friend though no decisive proofs of their intrigues can be now produced a probable conjecture may be made they designed perhaps to serve the pretender by the means of sweden the ambassador of that kingdom made no secret of his expecting real assistance through the means of bolingbroke from the british court and he openly expressed his wishes that the pretender were already arrived ibid july           their views the duke of marlborough assured of the projected disgrace of oxford hastened to ostend to embark but he was detained there for a fortnight by contrary winds in this interval of suspense the difficulty which bolingbroke found in forming the show of a ministry was the cause of the delay in the treasurers fall his own object was to continue secretary of state to command all the foreign correspondence he was however to dismiss bromley his colleague in office and to place the seals in the hands of sir william wyndham the treasury was to have been put into commission the earl of anglesea was to have been at the head of the board hannover papers july  0  but either some of these men declined the offices allotted for them by bolingbroke or he himself became undecisive through the weight of his own power he however resolved to remove the earl of oxford and to trust the rest to fortune on the twentyseventh of july when the treasurer came to court he was deprived of his staff he was however permitted to fall gently from his high station being suffered to retain all his other offices ibid        dismission and character the character of the earl of oxford has been described in all its singularities as the incidents arose but the throwing into one view its most striking features may give a more complete portrait of the man the talents bestowed upon him by nature were neither extensive nor obvious and these seem to have been little improved by education though he has been called a patron of learning and of learned men his whole progress in literature was confined to that slight knowledge of the dead languages which men intended for public life generally bring from school he neither understood foreign languages nor wrote with any degree of elegance his native tongue in the disposition of his mind he was reserved distrustful and cold a lover of secrecy to such a degree that he assumed its appearance in mere trifles fond of importance without any dignity of manner so full of professions that he was always deemed insincere in his public measures he was rather tenacious of his purpose than either firm or resolute in his conduct yet much more decisive in the means of annoying his enemies than in those calculated to gratify his friends with a facility of temper that could deny no request but with a defect of mind that could bestow nothing with grace he offended the disappointed and even lost those whom he served the disposal of offices which gives influence to other ministers was a real misfortune to the earl of oxford he often promised the same place to five persons at once and created sour enemies without making the fifth his friend  of the earl of oxford but if the earl of oxford was not remarkable for striking virtues he had the good fortune to be free from glaring vices though undecisive in the great line of business he was not subject to personal fear though thoroughly ambitious he was a stranger to haughtiness and pride though persevering in his opposition to his enemies he was not in his temper revengeful and though he made no scruple to tempt the honesty of others with money he himself cannot be accused with justice of the least tincture of avarice in his public measures he can never deserve the character of a great minister there was a narrowness of sentiment a vulgarity of policy and even a meanness in his conduct that frequently excited the contempt of his best friends in his private intrigues for power in his dextrous management of two parties by whom he was equally hated in his tempering the fury of the jacobites in his amusing the vehemence of the whigs in his advancing the interests of the house of hannover when most distrusted by themselves and their adherents he showed a considerable degree of address and political knowledge the nation owed to a defect in oxfords mind a greater benefit than they could have derived from a minister of more splendid talents had he been possessed of the pride inseparable from great parts his resentment for the ill usage which he experienced from the whigs and the agents of the house of hannover might have induced him to defeat the protestant succession and bring about those very evils of which he was unjustly accused  observations in a country where freedom prevails extensive talents are far from being the nearest path to the possession of power their prior condition must place mankind in the line of preterment otherwise their abilities instead of being employed by the state become through want of use a burden to themselves the most intelligent sovereign at the head of a popular government is extremely circumscribed in the choice of his servants he must rule his people through the medium of persons whom some accident independent of themselves have fixed in a certain rank in the community but as the advantages which savor ambition are enemies to the toil necessary for improving and enlarging the mind men frequently come to the management of the concerns of a great kingdom with abilities scarce sufficient to regulate the affairs of a private family hence and not from a dearth of talents proceed the confined systems the vulgar policy the uniform undecisiveness of public councils a minister instead of moving the whole machine of government suffers himself to be carried forward by its inherent motion and should no accidents happen the praise must be given to fortune these observations may be applied with a degree of justice to the earl of oxford who carried into his public conduct all the narrowness of his private character  consusion in the cabinet though the viscount bolingbroke had the address to remove the lordtreasurer he was not able to seize the reins which he had struck from his hands wild visionary and vehement in all his projects he had not foreseen difficulties or he was found incapable to surmount them when they came during three days of anarchy and confusion in the cabinet the minds of men were agitated with the vicissitudes of hopes and fear the queen herself in a dangerous state of health before had increased the violence of her distemper by the agitation of her spirits having assisted at a council of her principal servants in the night of the twentyninth of july she became perplexed beyond measure at their differences in opinion and want of decision the usual discharge from an imposthumation in her leg was stopped aug   death of the queen the gouty matter translating itself to the brain threw her into a dozing insensibility in which she expired at kensington on sunday the first of august about seven of the clock in the morning in a transient interval of her lethargy she delivered the treasurers staff to the duke of shrewsbury who had been recommended to that high office by such of the privy council as were assembled upon the occasion at kensington  her person and character thus died anne stuart queen of great britain and ireland in the fiftieth year of her age and thirteenth of her reign in the person she was of a middle stature and before she bore children wellmade her hair was dark her complexion sanguine her features strong but not irregular her whole countenance more dignified than agreeable in the accomplishments of the mind as a woman she was not deficient she understood music she loved painting she had even some tasse for works of genius she was always generous sometimes liberal but never profuse like the rest of her family she was goodnatured to a degree of weakness indolent in her disposition timid by nature devoted to the company of her favorites easily led she possessed all the virtues of her father except political courage she was subject to all his weaknesses except enthusiasm in religion she was jealous of her authority and sullenly irreconcilable toward those who treated either herself or her prerogative with disrespect but like him also she was much better qualified to discharge the duties of a private life than to act the part of a sovereign as a friend a mother a wife she deserved every praise her conduct as a daughter could scarcely be excused by a virtue much superior to all these upon the whole though her reign was crowded with great events she cannot with any justice be called a great princess subject to terror beyond the constitutional timidity of her sex she was altogether incapable of decisive councils and nothing but her irresistible popularity could have supported her authority amidst the ferment of those
