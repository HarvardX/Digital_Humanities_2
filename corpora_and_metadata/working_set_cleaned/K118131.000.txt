an account of the life and dealings of god with silas told late preacher of the gospel wherein is set forth the wonderful display of divine providence toward him when at sea his various sufferings abroad together with many instances of the sovereign grace of god in the conversion of several malefactors under sentence of death who were greatly blessed under his ministry  written by himself  they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep  psalm cvii       and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever  dan xii   london printed and sold by gilbert and plummer no    creechurchlane leadenhallstreet and by t scollick bookseller cityroad       preface although it is near seven years since the author of this pamphlet left this vale of tears yet when we peruse its contents it may with some propriety be said that although he be dead he yet speaks his experience with respect to trials and deliverances was in many instances very singular as will appear in the following pages as it must be allowed that great advantages have been derived from reading and relating the dealings of god with his people both in a way of providence and grace i think our deceased friends testimony should not be withheld from the christian reader the practice in different ages of the church has been to recite the experience of the people of god hence we read that david who had experienced many deliverances from his enemies both in a temporal and spiritual manner cries out o come hither all ye that fear the lord and i will tell you what he has done for my soul we read also in the prophet malachi that they who feared the lord spoke oftentimes one to another and a book of remembrance was written the apostle paul also observes that we should exhort and encourage one another so much the more as we see the day approaching thus much is observed by way of apology for the publication of mr tolds life suffice it then only to say the author was one of the rev mr wesleys preachers and that his outward conduct corresponded with his profession he was for a number of years eminent in visiting the unhappy prisoners both in newgate and other gaols where his ministry was made very useful  i was acquainted with mr told some years before his death and believe he was a man of integrity therefore can with greater propriety recommend the following pamphlet to the candid and christian reader  samuel smith july         an account of the life and dealings of god with silas told etc i was born at the limekilns near the hotwells in the city of bristol on the  d day of april      my parents both on the father and mothers side were very creditable people my grandfather told who was an eminent physician at london lived in bunhillrow and was possessed of a very plentiful estate in houses my grandmother also enjoyed a very considerable fortune at torrington in the west of england worth about l 00 per annum but having a great dislike to london and her husbands business fixing him there caused so far a separation between them that they and their posterity experienced very fatal consequences therefrom as he took to him a housekeeper who as i was informed by my mother when she found a fair opportunity gave him what proved his end and secured all his writings and the titledeeds of the estate together with all the readymoney plate jewels etc the family being absent from london and although she could not hold the estate etc yet for a great number of years and even to this day several people have lived rent free for want of proper titledeeds to empower the heir to receive the same to that when i first came to london after faithfully serving my time to capt moses lilly of bristol to the seas they had commenced the building of a few houses in the front of bunhillrow on the left hand side going up out of chiswellstreet but hearing that one of dr tolds grandchildren was come to london they proceeded no farther than covering them in and in that condition they remained for the space of twenty years before they were finished the tenants all of them still living rent free i was frequently advised to make a claim to the estate out for want of money to go to law together with the loss of the writings i utterly declined it so that i had given up all hopes of ever being profited thereby and as to my grandmother tolds estate in the west this never came within my knowledge  i now come to the account of my father who was a physician at bristol and in great esteem throughout that city but being a great schemer it proved his ruin and the impoverishing of all his family particularly in one instance of building a wet dock at the limekilns where i was born he laid out thirtythree hundred pounds and lost every penny by one evans for whom my father undertook the business who failed and went off this laid my father under the necessity of going out doctor of a guineaman in the course of which voyage he died and was buried at kingston in jamaica leaving only six hundred pounds for the maintenance and education of five children i would here observe that during this voyage i was informed he cleared the sum of l 00 which capt celliwood wronged our family of  my mother was born at topsham near exeter and was daughter to capt thomas suckabitch otherwise sucksbury who commanded a ship upwards of forty years something remarkable is related of my mothers pedigree viz in tracing them up to the farthest knowledge it has been represented that in the time of the kings of the west angles his majesty being out on a certain day hunting with his nobles discovered a male child in the wood with no one near it but a large bitch the maid having left the child with the bitch whilst she went a nutting in the woods the king who found the child sucking the bitch carried it home named it suckabitch and brought him up giving him a large estate round the spot where he was found which the succeeding generations have severally enjoyed to this day but altered the name to that of sucksbury  my uncle thomas sucksbury married the daughter of  lloyd esquire on st jamess back with above l 00000 fortune but she being deformed he went to sea again being captain of a very large ship for many years it was supposed the ship foundered in the atlantic as she was never heard of  my brother joseph and sister dulcy with myself were sent to nurse at kingswood near bristol where we were taken the utmost care of by the most tenderhearted woman i ever met with at this place we all continued till i arrived at the age of eight years my friends at bristol then made interest for one of us two boys to be admitted into the hospital of edward colson esquire on st augustins back near the quay of bristol a school i dare venture to say that cannot be surpassed by any throughout great britain for piety and christian discipline having a minister to attend twice a week regularly for the instruction of one hundred boys in their duty toward god and man here i think it may not be improper to give an exact and impartial account of the character and piety of so worthy a benefactor and also of the wisdom and goodness of almighty god in raising up so steady and useful a man to posterity i shall trace this man of god from his birth he was the son of edward colson a journeyman soapboiler whose wages did not exceed ten shillings per week and had ten children then living of whom edward was the eldest who when he had arrived to an age fit to be put out an apprentice his father bound him to a virginia captain about the time that the colonists were transported to north america in order to inhabit those parts this proved his first rise as his behavior and humble readiness to obey his superiors moved many of the merchants who first settled there to make edward the cabinboy many presents insomuch that before his ship departed from america for england he had acquired the sum of fifty pounds and being of an exceeding liberal disposition on his arrival at bristol he hastened with the l 0 and dispensed every farthing thereof to the prisoners at newgate and shortly after sailed again to virginia where he through the kind providence of god gathered among his former friends twice the money of the preceding voyage and disposed of the whole after the same manner here i must discontinue the relation of his proceedings knowing no more of them till he arrived at the age of forty years when as i have been informed he became a very eminent east india merchant prior to the incorporation of the east india company and had forty sail of ships of his own with immense riches flowing in upon him yet notwithstanding he remained steady and uniform in his charitable disposition distributing many thousand pounds to various charities in and about london as also private gifts to many parts of the kingdom and in the year   0  he instituted a very magnificent school on st augustines back bristol which as i have been informed cost him   000 pounds in the building and endowed the same with between    and   00 pounds per annum freehold for ever likewise ten pounds for apprenticing every boy and for twelve years after his death ten pounds to put them into business he likewise maintained religious economy in the school such as prayers three times a day performed by one of the superior boys he also caused to be erected a very grand free stone almshouse with an elegant chapel situated in the front thereof on st michaelshill bristol for    old men with a handsome allowance for every individual and a clergyman to attend them weekly he also founded a large free school in templestreet bristol which was set apart for the education and clothing of  0 boys and likewise provided for ten old men in the city almshouse nor do i recollect that i ever was in any church throughout the city but that a memorandum of his donations to several useful charities is recorded of him i have likewise been informed of his building at his own expense the whole church and town of all saints near the tolsey bristol together with those many public charities now extant in that city it has been frequently reported that his private charities far exceeded those in public i remember to have heard in my youthful days that one of his ships trading to the east indies had been missing for upwards of three years and was included in the number of those that were destroyed at sea but at length she arrived richly laden his principal clerk brought him the report of her arrival and of the riches on board to which he gave answer that as she was totally given up for lost he would by no means claim any right to her therefore ordered the ship and her merchandises to be sold and the produce thereof to be applied toward the relief of the needy which directions were immediately carried into execution  another singular instance of his tender consciousness for charity was at the age of forty when he entertained some thoughts of changing his condition he paid his addresses to a lady but being very timorous lest he should be hindered in his pious and charitable designs he was determined to make a christian trial of her temper and disposition and therefore one morning filled his pockets full of gold and silver in order that if any object presented itself in the course of their tour over london bridge he might satisfy his intentions while they were walking near st agnes church a woman in extreme misery with twins in her lap sat begging and as he and his intended lady were arm in arm he beheld the wretched object put his hand in his pocket and took out a handful of gold and silver casting it into the poor womans lap the lady being greatly alarmed at such profuse generosity colored prodigiously so that when they were gone a little farther toward the bridge foot she turned to him and said sir do you know what you did a few minutes ago madam replied mr colson i never let my right hand know what my left hand does he then took his leave of her and for this reason never married to the day of his death although he lived to the age of     in the year      he died at mortlake up the river thames having left many considerable legacies to charitable uses providentially i was in the school at the time of his death when orders were given for all the children to learn by heart the  0th psalm to sing before the corpse as it entered the city which was at lawfords gate where we joined the hearse and sang before it the space of five hours amidst a most numerous and crowded audience it is impossible to describe in what manner the houses and streets were ined with all ranks of people and although the rain decended in torrents none paid any regard thereto but the whole multitude seemed eagerly determined to see the last of so eminent a man we came at last to all saints church where he was interred under the communion table the day of his birth and also of his death are commemorated to this day throughout the city of bristol his many donations to the poor are by his executors faithfully upheld still here i conclude the perpetuative memory of so good a man which still remains invaluable to me  i now proceed to give an historical account of my own life from my infancy as far as it may be brought to my remembrance which is from three years of age i was then in petticoats and for a considerable length of time my sister dulcybella and self wandered into the woods and field fixing ourselves under the hedges conversing about god and happiness so that at times i have been transported in such a measure with heavenly bliss that whether in the body or out of the body i could not tell this happiness attended me for a few years  one remarkable circumstance i would observe when my sister and selfwere very young we wandered out into kingswood and lost ourselves in the woods and were in the utmost consternation lest we should be devoured by wild beasts but quickly the kind providence of god permitted a large dog to come behind us although no house was within a mile from the wood yet the dog drove us clear out of the wood into our knowledge what was remarkable the dog never barked at us and when in our knowledge we looked around us to behold the dog but he was not to be seen being heedless and unapprehensive of any further danger we wandered again into the woods and were a second time bewildered and in greater perplexity than before when on a sudden looking around us we beheld the same dog making toward us till he came directly up to us and we being much terrified ran from him till we got a second time into our knowledge nor did the dog leave us till we were driven by him where we could not possibly run into any more labyrinths i then turned about to look for the dog but saw no more of him although we were upon an open common this was the lords doing and it was mavelous in our eyes  when i arrived at the age of between seven and eight years i was put into mr colsons hospital in the year      and in the year      was bound an apprentice to the seas to capt moses lilly in the ship prince of wales and sailed from bristol for cork and jamaica in the month of july       here i may date my first sufferings being wonderfully wrought on by the spirit of god and totally ignorant of the maxims of the world having been confined for six years in the hospital free from all intercourse with mankind this rendered the new sea life very disagreeable to me also my unacquaintance with the various mysteries on ship board made me very untoward in the duty i was engaged in the first reception i met with on board when the ship lay in kingroad was to this effect the chief mate called for the cabinboy but he not being on board he sent me to the cook to get him a plate of victuals which i really imagined was meant for myself and accordingly got a plate full carried it down into the cabin and having a keen appetite made a very comfortable dinner when the chief mate had done his business he sent for me in order to bring his victuals i told him that i understood it was for myself and that i had eat it up upon which he knocked me down and began cursing and damning me at a horrible rate this language i was never acquainted with therefore thought i should have broke my heart with grief and having no friend to whom i could apply for redress i was forced to suffer all the repeated acts of barbarity that might follow which continued for eleven years  the first of those afflictions was that of sea sickness which held me till our arrival at jamaica after lying at kingston many months not having any freight for england the ship made a voyage down to the bay of campeachy in the spanish west indies at which place she lay at anchor about    miles from the land where with her bottom beating the ground every swell of the sea she was exceedingly damaged when we had completed our cargo we sailed back for jamaica very short of all species of provision expecting to have a short passage but to our mortification it was a passage of    weeks and after being out three weeks we were put to short allowance both of bread and water one biscuit and twothirds of a pint of water per day this was what i never before experienced and therefore it was the more grievous to be sustained and had it not been for a heavy shower of rain off the island of cuba we must have perished for want here we stopped up all the scuppers and saved about six casks of water by the use of the swabs which we dried the decks with and which we rung into the casks and although the water was very bitter yet providentially our lives were preserved thereby for we were reduced to half a pint of water a day and that full of mud and maggots yet were we three days before we arrived at bluefields the west end of jamaica without a single pint of water on board and had been eleven weeks destitute of biscuit pease or flour so that we had neither food to eat nor water to drink  when we came to an anchor in bluefieldsbay we boisted out the longboat stowed her full of casks and dispatched her for the fresh water when one of our men fell flat upon his bely and drank so immoderately that a few hours after he came on board he expired and the next morning we sewed him up in a hammock and threw him overboard when a large shark descended after him and we supposed swallowed the whole body as we were riding at anchor in kingston harbor the capital of jamaica waiting for a freight to england we at length got  0  hogsheads of sugar on board and on a friday a very great noise was heard in the atmosphere similar to that of splitting wood and the element was very much disturbed our chief mate was of opinion that we should be visited by a hurricane that evening which began about eight oclock the same night and held its vehemence without intermission till six oclock the following evening all language fails me to set forth the violence of this tempest as nothing could stand before it there were in the harbor of kingston    sail of ships many of which were very large but all riding with three anchors ahead and notwithstanding ours was a new ship with three new cables and anchors yet about four oclock in the morning we parted all three cables at once and turning broadside to the wind overset and sunk as far as the ground would permit and in that condition we were driven with our gunnel to the bottom down to the extremity of the harbor which is about    miles though we were the first ship that drove from her anchors yet all our masts stood but this was not the situation of any vessel beside for the whole fleet lost all their masts yards and bowsprit and not one vessel large or small but was driven with astonishing rapidity high and dry on the land the same hurricane also drove a large snow of   0 tons above half a mile into the country which broke and tore the cocoanut trees some of them up by the roots likewise a very heavy brigantine was cast upon the wharfs in the town and a large sloop of about  00 tons lay with her keel across the brigs deck in short that part of the town nearest the waterside was sufficiently barricaded with the wrecks of ships and vessels and as there were no tides of ebb and flood consequently there was no possibility of getting them off nor were there any save one fine stately ship which rode out that tempest so that seventyfive sail of ships of war and merchantmen were inevitably destroyed in the tremendous overthrow one remarkable instance i would take notice of viz the ship nicholson capt smiler of london quite a new and beautiful vessel rode her bows out sunk at her anchors and all on board perished except the captains son and four more who were saved by getting into a small boat called the moses that carried no more than one hogshead of sugar at a turn  all the ships at port royal shared the same fate with those at kingston except the winchelsea man of war and kirkington of bristol capt pills both of which cut away their masts and were upon the brink of foundering even at the close of the hurricane which was on saturday evening about six oclock here i would briefly observe how suddenly the storm ceased it varied from east to west and was for a few hours calm after which it chopped round to its former point and blowing with a vehemence impossible to be expressed lasted near an hour and was succeeded by a second calm two or three days after the reducement of these parts of the island viz kingston and port royal and likewise of the dreadful consequences of the storm upon the fleet of ships the drowned seamen were drove upon the shore for miles down the harbor and were left to be devoured by the crows and other wild fowl  immediately after the hurricane followed a pestilential sickness which swept away thousands of the natives every morning i have observed between  0 and  0 corpses to be carried past my window and being very near death myself i expected every day to approach with the messenger of my dissolution from this illness i contracted an habitual fever and ague which continued eleven months so that i was wasted to a mere shadow nor had i one person under heaven to take care of me except a negro who brought me every day a dose of jesuitsbark to the warehouse where i was laid in a hammock at length my master gave me up and i wandered up and down the town almost parched with the insufferable blaze of the sun till i was resolved to lay me down and die as i had neither money nor friend accordingly i fixed upon a dunghill on the east end of the town of kingston and being in so weak a condition i pondered much upon jobs case and considered mine similar to that of his however i was fully resigned to death nor had i the slightest expectations of relief from any quarter yet the kind providence of god was over me and raised me up a friend in an entire stranger a london captain coming by was struck with the sordid object came up to me and in a very compassionate manner asked me if i was sensible of any friend upon the island of whom i could obtain relief he likewise asked me to whom i belonged i answered to captain moses lilly and had been cast away in the late hurricane this captain appeared to have some knowledge of my master and cursing him for a barbarous llain told me he would compel him to take proper care of me in about a quarter of an hour after this my master arrived whom i had not seen before for six weeks and took me to a public house kept by a mrs huchinson and there ordered me to be taken proper care of this cost my master about  0s per week however he soon quitted the island and directed his course for england leaving me behind at his sick quarters and if it should please god to permit my recovery i was commanded to take my passage for england in the montserrat captain david jones a very fatherly tenderhearted man this was the first alleviation of my misery now the captain sent his son on shore in order to receive me on board when i came alongside captain jones standing on the ships gunnel addressed me after a very humane and compassionate manner with expressions to the following effect come poor child into the cabin and you shall want nothing the ship affords go and my son shall prepare for you in the first place a basin of good egg flip and any thing else that may be conducive to your relief  but i being still very bad with my fever and ague could neither eat nor drink  captain jones then began to explore his surgerybox in order to touch my case with some proper medicines if any were on board but to his disappointment they were all expended notwithstanding this he sent for the boatswain into the cabin and asked him if he knew of any remedy for the intermitting fever he told the captain that he could not only produce a remedy but that if i lived  0 years longer in the world i should not be subject to it thereafter this was in the year      which is now    years out of the  0 and i do not remember to have experienced one fit of it since and although i had been afflicted with the ague eleven months the boatswain cured me in less than five hours here i began immediately to recover my strength and became more lively and active than ever i was in my life upon our sailing for bristol capt jones being of a free affable temper in order to please the ships company steered his course to make the island of bermudas merely out of curiosity as it appears to be very distantly situated from the westindian islands upon our arrival thereat we scudded along shore from one end of the island to the other nor did i perceive either hill or mountain upon the whole island it being a fine level grassy land after we lost sight of this island we made the best of our passage for england but in the prosecution thereof something rather supernatural happened and i suppose may not be credited by many of my readers be that as it may my intentions are not to advance beyond the bounds of truth in relating the following circumstance or in any other throughout this tract  in the space of five weeks after our departure from bermudas the captain ordered the man to keep a sharp look out at the foretopmasthead as by our journal and calculation of the logbook we expected to be no great distance from cape clear the west end of ireland accordingly one morning about seven oclock the sentinel at the masthead threw out the signal for land about two points on the weatherbow but as at that time the ship was running with the wind on the starboardbeam the captain deemed it most advisable to brace all sharp up and lie as near the wind as we possibly could the land soon became conspicuous to the naked eye from the deck and we altered our course as the land edged round but would not attempt to make any nearer approach toward it than a full league i frequently had my eye fixed upon the land as had also the captain and all the ships company while we were at work clearing the decks bending the cables and making ourselves ready in all respects to adapt the ship for anchorage or to be prepared for running into an harbor in case of any strait or emergency i do not remember ever to have seen any place apparently more fertile or better cultivated the fields seeming to be covered with verdure and very beautiful and as the surf of the sea almost convinced us that it was playing on the shore we were beyond all doubt for the space of ten hours that the ship had made a convenient landfall our captain therefore gave the man who first discovered it  0 gallons of rum and  0 pounds of sugar but about six oclock in the evening as we were washing the decks and the sun was shining clear from the westward in less than a minute we lost all sight of the land and nothing but the horizon interspersed with a few pale clouds was perceptible from the deck this filled the ships company with the utmost astonishment and confusion nor did we make the coast of ireland for several days after our captain and ships company concluded that it was old brazille which navigators affirm to have been destroyed by an earthquake between   and  00 years ago at length we arrived at bristol and i was with my master capt moses lilly a few weeks when he consigned me over to a timothy tucker commander of the royal george bound for guinea and the west indies a greater villain i firmly believe never existed although at home he assumed the character and temper of a saint  the first demonstration of his notorious conduct was given to the ships company in the enforcement of a white woman out of her native country and selling her to the black prince of bonny on the african coast the next proof of his villainy was the vile and blasphemous language wherewith he perpetually governed the seamen indeed another exemplification of his horrid conduct was particularly noticed one sunday morning as i went down to the gunroom in order to procure necessary provisions for the ships company the captain happened to find me at the bread cask and declared that i was taking from thence considerably more than would be used therefore he immediately went to the cabin and brought out with him his large horsewhip and exercised it about my body in so unmerciful a manner that not only the clothes on my back were cut to pieces but every sailor on board declared they could see my bones and that very visibly yet this act of barbarism did not give him sufficient satisfaction for he threw me all along the deck and jumped many times upon the pit of my stomach in order to endanger my life and had not the people laid hold of my two legs and thrown me under the windlass after the manner they threw dead cats or dogs he would have ended his despotic cruelty in murder repeated instances of this behavior were committed by capt tucker to the principal part of his seamen in the course of the voyage to bonny one day i accompanied the king arigo on shore for the benefit of my health as the savage had almost put an end to my life and continued there for the space of six weeks and slept with the kings son prince arigo during the same at this place the black king had  00 concubines thirty of whom dwelt in his house and an elderly woman presided over the rest one morning in particular i was suddenly seized with a racking pain in my head i acquainted the queen in moorish with the cause of my indisposition she informed his black majesty therewith who ordered me some doctor as they term it and about half a dozen of his ladies took me into a back yard and stripped me quite naked even to my skin sat me on a jointstool and gave me some yabba or water with a cloth to dry myself i could not conceive what they purposed to do with me as the elder lady invented diverse stratagems to get me into a studious frame of mind and when they perceived me quite fixed looking at my feet and i apprehending they were about to wash them with the hot water suddenly the female monitor or president snatched the cloth from out of the water and threw it directly in my face which startled me to such a degree that it effectually removed the pain in an instant here i penetrated their maxims in performing the cure however in about half an hours time my pain revisited my head with greater violence than before and i informed the queen that ishe was obagona or my head was very bad she then told his majesty that my disorder was returned who straightway collected his grandymen together and they carried me to the summit of a certain hill the acclivity whereof must be impossible for strangers to surmount on the right hand side of which was situated the kings palaverhouse or place erected for their heathenish worship they took with them a dog and about  00 roots called yams when i entered the house i was struck with uncommon amazement at the sight of  0 or  0 black mens heads hanged round this palaverhouse here i was inexpressibly terrified as i had received a very pious and christian education so that their diabolical and gross proceedings created great horror upon my soul at length they commenced the usual sacrifices to their gods during which one of the senior characters who signalized himself by a scimeter at his side drew it took the dog beforementioned laid it on the floor and at one blow cut off its head he then pulled the tongue out of its mouth fastened it between its teeth and instantly came and touched my forehead cheeks chin and every joint with the dogs tongue  the king finding these resources to be ineffectual proceeded further and directed some of his people to sprinkle the dust with a quantity of palm wine and to lead me through a trackless desert down to the ship conceiving the wine as there was no water to be had might create a path to the sea shore this answered and prince arigo the kings son hailed the ship which lay at a small distance from land and desired them to send the boat on shore as piccaninni baccaeau was yarre yarre that is was very sick accordingly it was done and when i came on board tucker with a grim countenance and horrid expressions asked me what ailed me i replied that i had a strong fever on me then said he i will soon cure you so he went and brought his horsewhip and although i was extremely sick he whipped me unmercifully yet however his medicine did not perform the cre but heightened my fever so that i was nearly brought to the gates of death yet god raised me up again upon our arrival at st thomay or st thomas the european woman which tucker brought out from england died in a shocking manner was sewed up in a hammock and thrown overboard with a bag of ballast at her feet in order to sink her but in the course of a week afterward the corpse of the woman was observed to float upon the water i believe god had suffered this uncommon circumstance to happen in order to open the eyes of our wicked captain but he had no dread or remorse in him  i cannot but give one more instance of the barbarity of this captain during the voyage and his gross manner of executing it as a more bloody and inhuman action surely never was perpetrated by an englishman except himself this was upon one of our black slaves who through a violent sickness was worn to a mere skeleton and as he could not eat his allowance the savage tucker invented a scheme to compel the slave to eat and laid to his charge that he was sulky however the poor creature could not nor did he eat upon this the captain called for his black cabin boy robin to bring him his horsewhip he did so and tucker began lashing the poor sick man till i firmly believe from his neck to his ancles there was nothing to be seen but bloody wounds the poor creature made no kind of resistance nor spoke one word this provoked and highly incensed our bloodthirsty devil so that he went still farther and told him in negroish he would tickeravoo him the poor slave answered  adomma which signified so be it by this time the captains dinner was ready under the awning on the quarter deck he left the man in shocking agonies bleeding and groaning on the forecastle came to his dinner like a hog and eat without fear or shame after he had dined he called for john lad and ordered him to get two ammunition pistols well loaded with ball then called for robin the cabinboy to bring them forward which when done he left his table and ordered john lad to follow him which he accordingly did with one pistol in each hand they both went forward on the maindeck the poor object sat with his back against the larboardgunnel of the ship then tucker with a malicious and virulent grin pointing one of the pistols to him told him it would kill him the man replied as before  adomma upon this the captain applied the mouth of the pistol to the middle of his forehead and fired the man instantly clapped his hands to his head one behind and the other before and stared the captain in the face the blood gushing from his forehead like the tapping a cask but he did not fall tucker then turning to john lad with a blasphemous oath said this will not kill him and immediately clapped another to his ear and fired that also nor did he drop even then at last the captain ordered john lad to fire another through his heart which was done he then dropped down dead all the men slaves in consequence of this uncommon murder rose upon the ships company with full purpose to slay us all but we nimbly betaking ourselves to the cannons pointed them through a bulkhead that parted the main and quarter deck which when they perceived the greater part of them ran down between decks and the remainder jumped overboard and were all drowned save one or two which with the assistance of the jolly boat we rescued from the violence of the sea at length we arrived at barbados when captain tuckers notorious conduct was repressed in some measure which was visibly perceived by his sending the slaves large quantities of rum and sugar yet on his leaving that island he renewed his former cruelties but did not exercise them on me with that degree of severity which he had frequently used in the passage to kingston  in the course of eight weeks we arrived at bristol and my original master moses lilly received all my wages but allowed me no pocketmoney and fitted me out very scantily for the next voyage  having no friend or relation in london i was drawn in to perform a second voyage with tucker the bare idea of which almost broke my heart yet he treated me with less rigor than in the voyage before  i have only two circumstances to remark in this voyage the first was when slaved and ready to sail for bonny we dropped down and came to anchor a little without the bar and at about twelve oclock at night an universal shriek was heard among the slaves between decks and being asked what ailed them they with wild confusion of mind said that egbo or the devil was among them the next morning when we came to open the hatches to admit the air into their loathsome dens and for the purpose of discharging their tubs to our great surprise we found a number of them laying dead upon hoisting up about  0 of them we save    and the rest having irrecoverably lost their breath in the suffocation the captain directed us to cast them overboard which was instantly done  0 in number  a second circumstance which happened on board our ship and which i think myself compelable to relate was the captains inhuman cruelty to the ships cook the poor man had nothing but greenwood to make his furnace boil with on which account it was impossible for him to get the food ready in time therefore the captain habituated himself to certain practices such as horsewhiping him and stabbing a knife into his face so that the poor mans life was grievously burdensome to him indeed he oftentimes hinted to us that he would throw himself overboard but we endeavored to dissuade him from it yet one morning about eight oclock poor john bundy plunged himself into the sea without our knowledge so that we diligently searched the ship for him but he could not be found we informed the captain of it who answered with some degree of pleasure that he saw a hat swimming astern which he supposed was the b  d of a b  s hat yet notwithstanding this heartbreaking usage we providentially completed the voyage  after this i was shipped on board the scipio capt roach who was much of a seaman a pleasant tempered gentleman and exceeding free and liberal with all his ships company but he having purchased a fine black girl for his own use she in the end proved the cause of his death one evening as we lay at anchor in new callabar one tom ancrao came on board who talked very good english and the facetious capt roach having made a tub of punch on the quarter deck had the fiddler and the ships company dancing with him but left me with tom ancora to purchase the slaves when this was done tom desired me to give him a dram which i did he then desired me to let the bottle stand i told him i must first obtain the captains leave for so doing i then went to capt roach who gave me leave tom at this indulgence filled a rummer with brandy and clasping the black girl in his arms as their custom is they put both their mouths to the glass and jointly drank thereout but unfortunately for capt roach he came into the cabin and detected them in that attitude while drinking which so provoked him that he ran the end of his cane into toms mouth broke the tumbler and knocked out all his front teeth although he had a fine set the captain then ran to his stateroom for one of his loaded pistols but tom apprehensive of his danger jumped overboard it being dark and the tide of ebb flowing strong toms canoe dropped astern took him up and carried him on shore our captain was resolved to go on shore to close the breach that was made but the ships company all earnestly strove to convince him of the imprudence of going to tom ancoras house yet if he was bent upon going they entreated him not to eat or drink any thing however capt roach was resolutely deaf to all their kind expostulations he dressed himself in a scarlet plush suit put his sword on and went to toms house but he being too subtle for the captain carried it fair and easy and seemed to be very friendly but took care to give the captain a strong dose of poison which in three days time operated so effectually upon him that the fingers on both his hands were drawn into the palms and all his toes were drawn under his feet hence it evidently appeared to all the traders that tom ancora had poisoned capt roach  next morning one dick ebrew and his son came on board and desired to learn what kind of eatables he partook of and whether it was hot or cold while at tom ancoras house saying if he would simply tell them it was not impossible for them to expel the poison and save his life these two men i have often admired for their meek and loving spirit exceedingly far beyond tens of thousands who call themselves christians however all their reasoning with the captain to convince him that he was poisoned proved ineffectual as he insisted upon it he was not and again the others as strenuously insisted upon it that he was at length the benevolent father and his son parted with our captain in a plaintive condition their eyes expressive of the same as they had not the opportunity of preserving his life he being a man greatly esteemed amongst the natives for his courteous behavior  before i proceed any farther i would relate the behavior of our cooper and a black whom we named adam when the ship was sailing over the bar adam had planned the cutting off the ships company which when perceived by the other slaves they joined the mutiny and on a sudden rose and seized the cook and threw him into the furnace of boiling rice they likewise attacked the boatswain took from him his knife and stabbed him in several parts of the body and threw him overboard wells the cooper hearing the disturbance came up out of the hold upon which adam also seized him but the cooper said to him adam you no savee me tossue you mini the english of which is dont you know i often give you water adam then said to him  tossue coopery which is get out of the way the cooper then got over the quarter deck bulkhead to the arms chest took up a loaded pistol and shot adam through the head the other slaves at seeing their champion dead ran all down between decks were closely confined and admirably well secured to prevent a second massacre and as the captain lay dangerously ill and only five men able to work the ship we with the greatest and most elaborate toil reached the west indies in three weeks  upon the ships arrival there the owner of her made the cooper a present of l 0 for his services on board her at the time of those assassinations i would again observe before i return to capt roach while we lay at callabar and just previous to our sailing the captain sent me on shore armed with two men to what is called enforcement of trade accordingly i went on shore with a cutlass by my side and in my hands two loaded pistols when i arrived at the top of the hill i heard an uncommon shrieking of women and as i drew near a division of houses i saw what through curiosity i had long wished to see namely egbo a native in a fine silk grass meshed net so curiously made to fit him that nothing but his hands and feet appeared the net ended with a fringe not unlike ruffles this man is looked upon as both god and devil and all stand in the most profound awe of him from the highest to the lowest  i stood still to see the sequel of his caprice and observed that in his hand he had a green bough wherewith he was whipping the womens posteriors as they went naked and chasing them out of one house into another and as they were exceedingly terrified and considered it a heavy curse when egbo struck them therefore they fled from him as we would flee from hell flames however when he had satisfied himself by lashing the poor women he came out through the middle of the court and through the meshes of his net i was discovered by him presently he advanced toward me with full purpose to let me also feel the weight of his green bough upon which i instantly drew my hanger with a resolution to cut off his head he then ran away and i saw him no more afterward i was visited by some of the chief men in the town saying  bacareau you no fear egbo i replied not i and that if he had offered to strike me i would have cut his head off at which answer they could not help laughing heartily and then retired  i now return to continue the thread of my account of capt roach and the further particulars of my voyage to jamaica my reader may observe that i lest the description of our proceedings upon old callabar at our captain losing the use of his limbs at length he found the poison to work fatally upon him so that he was reduced to an inability of helping himself the whole burden then fell on my hands nor would he suffer any other to approach him i conducted myself in the disagreeable function tolerably well till we anchored under st thomass fort on a portuguese island lying about  00 miles to the westward of the coast of africa where capt roach directed me to sell the surplus of cargo after purchasing the guinea slaves etc i went accordingly on shore with the remaining part of the cargo to the scrivans house the governors principal clerk bartered with me for golddust broken and damaged jewels rings etc which amounted to the sum of l  0 he put it into a very curiouslymade bag the better to enable me to keep it secure i took the aforesaid sum in my righthand and as i was walking deliberately down to the beach swinging it backwards and forwards a little black boy came behind me snatched the bag of gold out of my hand and fled out of sight before i could well look round me here i was left in the utmost consternation at so great a loss but in a few minutes to my unspeakable satisfaction i perceived the scrivan from whom i had received the gold hastening down upon the beach with the bag in is hand who had met the boy flying up the town with it he then gave me the bag and money and said sir be more careful of your property for the future especially when you are in a strange country i was inconceivably thankful and am ready to affirm that this portuguese was actuated with stronger principles of honor especially in this instance to a stranger than thousands of my countrymen would have been to a native of their own country  by this time our captain grew worse and one day with his stool came several large clots of blood from him one of which resembled a fowls kidney and the bulk was nearly equal to that of a pigeons egg when i informed the captain thereof he lifted up his eyes and hands i hope his heart too to heaven repeating these words lord jesus receive my spirit from this time he voided larger clots of blood so that it was computed two or three and thirty pounds of blood had been discharged from him at various times he strictly charged the surgeon to open him when dead for the satisfaction of his wife he soon after made his exit and upon his bodys diffection the surgeon pointed out to us the mystery of the poison and its operation likewise the cause of his voiding such quantities of blood which was in consequence of the veins across his stomach being cut by the poison into  00 pieces he was then sewed up in his hammock with a bag of ballast fastened to his feet and committed to the great deep and i firmly believe he had all his sufferings here  various occurrences happened in the ship during the captains illness but i shall particularly remark only the circumstance of one which i apprehend was rather of an ominous nature every day in the course of his weakness in body he made repeated efforts to reach the cabin windows in order to receive the cooling air and at whatever times he looked in the water a devil fish was regularly swimming at the stern of the ship he did not appear to be a fish of prey but his breadth from fin to fin was about    feet and in length about seven or eight with a wide tail and two ivory horns in front he followed the ship to our best calculation near   00 miles nor was it remembered by any of the ships crew that a fish of that nature had made its appearance in the course of any of their voyages perpetual attempts to destroy or catch this monster was made by the fastening a thick rope round the body of a dead negro and casting him overboard but it was ineffectual the fish swam close under our stern got his horns entangled in the rope underrun it to the end and then tossed his refused prey several yards above the water when the captain died he forsook the ship and we saw him no more  our chiefmate james seabons on the death of capt roach undertook the command of the ship and after a short passage of a few days she arrived at jamaica while we were lying at moorings and tarrying in the harbor for a freight the ship was overrun with rats and by our judgment there were thousands on board this we deemed an ill omen which indeed proved so in a short space of time when the ship sailed from jamaica we had a difficult task to steer through the windward passage but at length we weathered the east end of jamaica and directed a steady course between that and hispaniola and the east end of cuba about three oclock in the afternoon having a fair wind by which the ship was scudding eleven or twelve miles an hour we suddenly discovered a very large sloop close in shore under cape nichela our captain being a young mariner took her to be a new york sloop bound for jamaica we instantly hauled up our courses and lay too but as she swiftly bore down upon us our captain shortly found his mistake as she proved to be a spanish guarda la cofta or what was more redoubtable a spanish pirate the enemys vessel was exceedingly large full of guns and men our captain was then very assiduous and exerted himself to the utmost in the means of saving the ship but the men would neither fight nor fly so that the captain was constrained to surrender the ship cargo and men to the disposal of the enemy  when we were boarded the spanish sailors began to plunder us stripping and taking all away from the captain down to the cabinboy nor did they spare the clothes on our backs but in turn of them clothed us with their filthy ragged frocks and drawers they killed all our poultry and set us to picking them put on the ships large kettle and boiled both fowls and ducks they likewise took away all our compasses save two that had been spoiled with the rain on the coast of africa in short they took away every useful article and left us totally destitute of carpenters coopers and boatswains tools they then informed us that at eight oclock the next morning every one of us without distinction partiality or reserve should be hanged and that without ceremony and had also the barbarity to present to us the place and the scaffold erected for that purpose which was on the platform under cape nichola and we had every reason to fear that they would have carried their designs into execution had not the providence of god interposed by making me the instrument of our deliverance therefrom the happy circumstance was this i frequently kept the ships accounts in the captains absence and was ordered to do so when he was removed on board the spanish pirate i then secured his gold watch and deposited the same amongst the coals in the forepeak and brought our ship to an anchor close under the enemys stern where we remained all night  when the enemys under captain had discontinued his plundering their principal or spanish commander repaired on board the capture and brought our master with him in order to spend the evening together and in the course of their conversation the spanish captain to my extreme grief and disappointment asked captain seaborn if he had such a thing as a watch on board he replied sir i had a gold watch on board and a silver one but i am afraid they are lost in the plunder however the captain wisely asked me if i knew whether it was stolen or whether i had taken care of it myself if i had he said it would be the sure means of saving our lives i told him that i had hid it in the forepeak amongst the coals i was then directed to go and bring it but one of the spanish common seamen knowing for what i was sent thither followed me down the forescuttle and when i had pocketed the watch he took up a billet of wood struck me a blow on my left ear which stunned me and then took the watch from out of my pocket notwithstanding my insensibility i could take particular notice of the fellow that if i survived the blow he might be apprehended in about twenty minutes i came to myself went and informed our captain of what had happened who asked me if i knew the man against i told him he was leaning with his leftarm on the ships gunnel he then informed the spanish captain of it who went with me to the man and demanded the watch the dastardly fellow went on his knees and surrendered it and was afterward with all his plundering companions by the command of their captain dismissed from our ship and sent on board their own they all returned to their own vessel in launches and after their captain had discoursed with ours about the space of  0 minutes he returned on board his own ship likewise  we still remained in a state of anxiety in respect to our destiny but at eight oclock the next morning a decision took place by the spanish captain hailing our ship and desiring us to weigh anchor and direct our immediate course for england the uncommon joy which this reprieve produced in the hearts of every sailor on board our ship was infinitely beyond what i am able to describe in this narrative each of us danced skipped and jumped about from one end of the ship to the other insomuch that several sailors were quite fatigued and an utter stop was made to our necessary duty but when this exstacy was subsided and the ships company more composed we immediately hove ahead weighed anchor with great pleasure made sail with a favorable breeze and in the space of two hours left the land seven leagues astern my reader will remember that the ships company was threatened with execution the morning of the reprieve therefore the irresistible joy we all experienced may be easily accounted for however greater misfortunes and cross providence were yet to come for the third day after our escape from the pirate by the officers observation and the ships reckoning we apprehended that the vessel was no great distance from crooked island therefore a diligent lookout at the masthead was ordered to be kept precisely at ten oclock p m the sentinel called out to the man at the wheel and begged him instantly to put the helm hard at lee as there were  0 sail of ships on the leebow at no great distance we were at that time scudding with the wind quarterly all our steeringsails set at the rate of    or    miles an hour the ship quickly answered her helm but having such a crowd of sail upon her and the mariners not being sufficiently active to haul them down at so short a notice we found that instead of shipping we were surrounded with dreadful breakers on a reef of rocks and so very steep withal that when the ships stern tended round any person could have jumped off the ships tafferel upon them having so exceeding swift a way through the water she drew a little off from the rocks yet by reason of her missing stays she fell off again and the first blow she struck a projected part of a rock went through her bottom and in a few minutes the whole ship was full of water by the deepsea line we found that her stern lay in  0 fathoms and had she not been held fast by this rock every one on board must inevitably have perished  in the midst of those suffering seasons we all experimentally knew the merciful hand of almighty god was over us for if the ship had not struck on the spot where she providentially did it would have been an utter impossibility for any one on board to have reached the land as we afterward found there was no passage through the reef except that part whereon the vessel was wrecked seeing no prospect of ever securing the least part of her hull we used all diligence at every possible opportunity to save part of her cargo we speedily hoisted out our longboat and stowed several bags of bread therein together with an old foresail wherewith we intended to make a tent on shore but the boat being exceedingly rotten with many leaks in her bottom and having no tools on board to stop them before we could reach the landingplace to our mortification the boat sunk to the gunnel and totally spoiled all our bread yet by the assistance of the almighty we all escaped to land with the foresail with which and the help of two long poles we erected a small tent for the purpose of keeping off the insufferable heat and scorching influence of the sun  when the evening approached the captain directed us to run the yawl backwards and forwards from the east to west parts of the island in order to discover the town or inhabitants if any whereby to obtain some refreshment but after having spent eight hours in that hazardous excursion we perceived that the island was totally uninhabited here another fresh scene of distress presented itself as we could get no provision from the ship we were determined to search the island for both food and water we did so but without success nor was the land productive of any animal or vegetable species but an abundance of land crabs and shell fish these evident marks of desolation and barrenness gave birth to various resources in order to support life and accordingly three or four of us were compelled by the captain to venture ourselves naked into the sea and swim on board the ship if possible for the purpose of getting such water as was not spoilt and notwithstanding the wreck lay full two miles from the shore yet we effected our purpose in a short time  having hoisted out three casks of fresh water we left them to be driven on shore by the strength of a constant seabreeze and the waves together which in the space of ten minutes sent them so near the land as to be rolled up the beach by our seamen on shore my readers may be surprised at our swimming two miles upon a stretch but let it be observed that there were many small rocks lying between the shore and the ship so that when we were almost wearied out they served us for resting places though truly we never quitted these rocks but at the immediate hazard of our lives seeing there were a multiplicity of sharks and alligators perpetually sporting throughout the bay i perfectly well remember to have seen three sharks divide a mans body in the harbor of st tomay on the coast of africa the first seized one of his hindquarters and wrenched it off at the first shake a second attacked the other hindquarter and took that away likewise when a third furiously attacked the remainder of the body and greedily devoured the whole thereof  i was subject to many dreadful apprehensions in the performance of my exploits least a circumstance of this kind should befall me likewise but the lord was my sure protector after we had weathered three weeks in this deplorable situation and exposed to the malignancy of the inclement atmosphere the moschettos like swarms of bees discovered our persons and pierced our flesh severely with their poisonous stings inasmuch that we were all necessitated to bury ourselves in the sand even our hands and faces clearing only our mouths and nostrils at certain times for the admittance of air and discharge of breath or we should certainly have been stung to death  our captain then asked who would undertake to proceed with him toward the n w part of the island as he conceived that would be the only means of finda remedy i readily complied with his proposal and jumped into the boat accompanied by four others and the captain and upon our leaving the island we left those troublesome companions the insects here it may be well to observe the goodness of god in sending these insects to drive us out to sea our captain being inclined to run round the island in order to make what discoveries he could we sailed about  0 miles round to the s w where we found a fine bay as the boat having but a light breeze imperceptibly advanced to the land we discerned several flemingo birds and as they were a fowl of the first magnitude we all imagined that they were some persons who inhabited the place but when we arrived at the rocks we found our mistake and were under the necessity of revisiting that truly disagreeable reef of rocks whereon our ship was cast away  upon our approach to the shore several of our people with overjoy desired us to run out to sea as there was a vessel in the offing the captain immediately steered through the gut and we happily met her about half a mile from the wreck of our ship when we came near to the stranger the seamen presented loaded blunderbusses at us and told us to keep off or they would certainly fire upon us we begged to inform them that we were in great distress our ship being lost on the reef of rocks and that the remainder of our people were on shore in a tent their captain then with some warmth declared if we did not keep our boat at a greater distance from their ship he would discharge a sixpounder at us and send both yawl and men to the bottom he likewise asserted that we were pirates that our ship was not lost but riding at an anchor and that we had no authority to lay in those uninhabited parts of the world we expostulated with the captain a considerable time and at length he permitted us to repair on board  when we had so done the captain whose name was cabel bean ran close in shore embarked the remainder of our distressed companions by the assistance of their yawl and after having interrogated them respecting their catastrophe he found that our relation was strictly true  as we had many valuables on board which we supposed had received no damage the vessel which was called the patomack sloop stood off and on till with their boats and our yawl we had saved goods to the amount of l  00 in anchors cables rigging rum pimento cotton etc and as the vessel had nothing on board but ballast it was more adapted to receive the spoilt goods while we were thus employed a large turtle boat from virginia hove in sight the masters name was sims a molatta he likewise lent us the assistance of his boat and crew in recovering the spoils of our cargo after we had saved every thing within the reach of possibility sims the molatta took three or four of us with the two captains round to the n side of the island in order to instruct us in the mystery of fish catching so that we might in some degree alleviate our distresses if we should at any future period fall into the like situation accordingly we sailed up a salt water river where were plenty of mullets and a young chicken turtle and as the water in this region was amazingly shallow not more than two feet we chased those fish backwards and forwards till we chased them out of breath and withal into about six inches water which opportunity we nimbly embraced in falling flat upon our breasts and catching them without any tackle  we secured the chicken turtle after the same manner and hastened to terrafirma with a design to cook all our acquisitions and notwithstanding we could get neither fire or candle yet mr sims produced a tinderbox and striking fire to the tinder applied a small piece thereof to some dry grass gave it a few shakes into the air till it was kindled into a substantial fire we then barbaqued the young turtle and boiled a mullet still we were at a loss to obtain freshwater and asked mr sims if he could procure us any he only scratched and troubled the sand rather above highwater mark and to our astonishment the fresh water sprung up after we had regaled ourselves captain sims conveyed us from that region in his turtleboat to the reef of rocks whereon our ship was cast away by this time the seamen of captain beans potomack had well nigh equipped her and tarried only for the return of their passengers  when we were all on board the liberal captain openly distributed all and every part of the proceeds of said cargo among the sailors belonging to the wreck and then directed his course toward boston in new england about three weeks after our departure from the desolate island early one morning we discovered the gayhead of st matthiass vine yard so called from its appearance in a variety of colors with a reef of rocks not more than half a mile astern of us we came to anchor about eight oclock in the evening with fine pleasant weather but at ten p m a tremendous storm arose which caused the sea to roar dreadfully and run mountains high  precisely at twelve oclock as i had the watch upon deck a very heavy sea broke against our bow which strained the ship exceedingly i hastily ran to the companion hatchway to call another upon the guard but suspecting the violent sea to have had a dangerous tendency on the ship went immediately to the deepsea lead took and hove it over the stern to judge whether she was riding safe at her anchors or not but found the lead was under her bottom i ran to the hatchway called all hands and informed them the vessel was adrift  captain bean of the sloop said in a very solemn manner then the lord have mercy on our souls we are every one lost and immediately the vessel came down with such vehemence upon the rocks that when the waves returned they were high even up to our gunnel above the water the sea driving us upon them with such a power that nothing but the omnipotence of god could have preserved us from the imminent danger the sea still continued with the utmost rapidity and followed us like rolling mountains even to the beach which dashed the sloop so violently upon and against the rocks that we entertained no other ideas of the consequence but that she would be broke in a thousand pieces in this situation i pulled off my frock and drawers which was all the spaniards had left me and all the covering i had in the world the next wave that attacked us washed them overboard and left me completely destitute of clothing of any kind whatever nor was it in the power of any person on board to afford me any kind of relief however when we were upon the deck i proposed to three more on board that could swim tolerably well to plunge ourselves overboard and attempt to gain the shore persuaded that if this plan could be effected a method might be taken to save the lives of those on board who otherwise must have been drowned accordingly four of us cast ourselves overboard and endeavored to swim on shore but in the attempt we were carried backwards out of our depths by a raging surf nor could we get firm footing on the sandy beach till the wave had spent itself at length after having our bodies dangerously hurt and driven about by every succeeding wave we got safe on shore and hailed the others on board the wreck to send a rope on shore in order to haul them one by one to land they did so and we rescued every poor distressed companion of ours from the remorseless deep after this they unanimously consented to travel a little way into the country and almost compelled me to go with them naked as i was but i very reluctantly declined it owing to shame and confusion and while the others were ransacking the island in quest of provision etc i was solitarily bewailing my deplorable and hapless state between two small rocks and almost starved with hunger and cold at seven oclock in the evening it being dusk one of our men came running toward me and compelled me to go to a tavern with him which was at the distance of seven miles i asked him if he had brought me any thing to cover me he replied no but that there was speedy help for it i readily complied with his desires but with much difficulty reached the tavern at midnight the messenger went in and informed the host of my case who brought me out a pair of red breeches which was all he had left after supplying the rest  ebenezer allen governor of the island and who dwelt about six miles from the tavern hearing of our distress made all possible haste to relieve us and when he arrived at the tavern accompanied by his two eldest sons he took captain seaborn his black servant joseph and myself through partiality and escorted us home to his own house between eleven and twelve at night we reached the governors mansion all of us ashamed to be seen would fain have hid ourselves in any dark hole or corner as it was a truly magnificent building with wings on each side thereof but to our astonishment we were received into the great parlour where were sitting by the fireside two fine portly ladies attending the spit which was burdened with a heavy quarter of house lamb  observing a large mahogany table to be spread with a fine damask cloth and every knife fork and plate to be laid in a genteel mode i was apprehensive that it was intended for the entertainment of some persons of note and distinction or at least for a family supper in a short timethe joint was taken up and laid on the table yet nobody sat down to eat and as we were almost hid in one corner of the room the ladies turned round and said poor men why dont you come to supper i replied madam we had no idea that it was prepared for us the ladies then entreated us to eat without any kind of fear of them assuring us that it was prepared for none others and none of us having eaten any thing for near sixandthirty hours before we picked the bones of the whole quarter to which we had plenty of rich good cider to drink after supper we went to bed and enjoyed so prosound a sleep that the next morning it was difficult for the old gentleman to awake us  the following day i became a partaker of several secondhand garments and as i was happily possessed of a little learning it caused me to be more abundantly caressed by the whole family and therefore i fared sumptuously every day this unexpected change of circumstance and diet i undoubtedly experienced in a very uncommon manner but as i was strictly trained up a churchman and could not support the idea of a dissenter although god knows i had well nigh by this time dissented from all that was truly good this proved a bar to my promotion and my strong propensity to sail for england to see my mother prevented my acceptance of the greatest offer i ever received in my life before for when the day came that we were to quit the island and to cross the sound over to a town called sandwich on the main continent the young esquire took me apart from my associates and earnestly entreated me to tarry with them saying that if i would accede to their proposals nothing should be lacking to render my situation equivalent with that of the family  as there were very few white men on the island i was fixed upon if willing to espouse one of the governors daughters i have been informed that the governor was immensely rich having on the island two thousand head of cattle and twenty thousand sheep and every acre of land thereon belonging to himself however i could not be prevailed upon to accept the offer therefore the governor furnished us with  0s each and gave us a pass over to the town of sandwich  upon our arrival there we waited on a mr silas bourn justice of the peace who treated us courteously ordered us to sign our names to a certain document which he purposed to transmit over a large canal to the keeper of a tavern whereby we could have every thing we wished for  after taking our leave of justice bourn we set out for plymouth which we were informed was the first spot whereon the americans landed when they first went over to inhabit those parts of the world it appeared a low mean place with only a small spired meeting house which they built and covered in with shingles before they had raised one dwelling house such was their zeal for the glory of god we passed through this tract of land without a main road to guide us till we came to a wood the woods in this part of the world are no ways similar to those in england with briars and thorns but are variegated with numberless rows of tall pines which naturally grow at a tolerable distance from one another so that they bear a greater resemblance to a gentlemans park and form a beautiful appearance we continued traveling till it began to grow dark and finding no house in our way since we left plymouth we concluded that we must pitch our tent in the woods all night however at about seven oclock we fell in with a small publichouse after we had supped i craved the hospitality of an old englishman in providing a bed for each of us but he very roughly expressed his disapprobation thereof seeing we were entire strangers  as we were just about to commence our nocturnal journey a poor woman ran up to us and insisted upon our returning to her quarters where we should be hospitably accommodated with every thing that was suitable to our situation for that night this being the first of november and the winter in that southern hemisphere being just set in we were whilst by the fire almost burnt on one side but nearly frozen on the other as soon as daylight appeared we arose took our leave of the old woman after returning her many thanks set out upon our journey and at half past eleven a m we all reached the beautiful town of hanover here the buildings and structures from one end thereof to the other were truly magnificent and handsome the inhabitants were really polite wealthy and of a beautiful complexion mien and deportment  at the north west part of the town was a very fine road which extended itself to the sea shore in the center of which road stands a stately church very aptly situated for the purpose of travelers who frequently have recourse thereto and intermit their journey on sabbath days one sunday as my companions and self were crossing the churchyard at the time of divine service a well dressed gentleman came out of the church and said to us gentlemen we do not suffer any person in this country to travel on the lords day we gave him to understand that it was necessity which constrained us to walk that way as we were all shipwrecked on st martins vineyard and were journeying to boston the gentleman was still dissatisfied but quitted our company and went into the church when we had gone a little farther a large white house proved the object of our attention the door being wide open we reasonably imagined it was not in an unguarded state without servants or others but as we all went into the kitchen nobody appeared to be within nor was there an individual either above or below however i advised my companions to tarry in the house until some person or other should arrive they did so and in a short time afterward two ladies richly dressed with a footman following them came in through the kitchen and notwithstanding they turned round and saw us who in so dirty and disagreeable a garb and appearance might have terrified them exceedingly yet neither of them was observed to take any notice of us nor did either of them ask us any questions touching the cause of so great an intrusion  about a quarter of an hour afterward a footman entered the kitchen with the cloth and a large twoquart silver tankard full of rich cider also a loaf and cheese but we not knowing it was prepared for us did not attempt to partake thereof at length the ladies coming into the kitchen and viewing us in our former position desired to know the reason of our malady seeing we were not refreshing ourselves whereupon i urged the others to join with me in the acceptance of so hospitable a proposal after this the ladies commenced a familiar enquiry into our situation i gave them as particular an account of every recent vicissitude that befell us as i was capable of with a genuine relation of our being shipwrecked and the ole reasons of our traveling into that country likewise begged they would excuse our impertinence as they were already informed of the cause  we then were emboldened to ask the ladies if they could furnish us with a lodging that evening they replied it was uncertain whether our wishes could be completed there but that if we proceeded somewhat farther we should doubtless be entertained and genteelly accommodated by their brother a quaker whose house was not more than the distance of seven miles we thanked the ladies and set forward and at about eight oclock arrived at their brothers house fatigued with our journey we hastened into the parlour and delivered our message whereupon a gentleman quickly gave us to understand by his free and liberal conduct that he was the quaker referred to by the aforesaid ladies who total strangers as we were used us with a degree of hospitality impossible to be exceeded indeed i could venture to say that the accommodations we met with at this quakers house seeing they were imparted to us with such affectionate sympathy greatly outweighed those we formerly experienced  after our banquet the gentleman took us up into a fine spacious bedchamber with desirable bedding and very costly chints curtains we enjoyed a sound nights rest arose between seven and eight the next morning and were entertained with a good breakfast returned many thanks for his unrestrained friendship and liberality and departed therefrom fully purposed to direct our course for boston which was not more than seven miles farther here all the land was strewed with plenty their orchards were replete with apple trees and pears they had cider presses in the center of their orchards and great quantities of neat cider and any person might become a partaker thereof for the mere trouble of asking we soon entered boston a commodious beautiful city with    spired meetings the dissenting religion being then established in that part of the world i resided here for the space of sour months and lodged with captain seaborn at deacon townsends deacon of the north meeting by trade a blacksmith  nothing was wanting during our continuance there but on the contrary affluence flowed in upon the inhabitants from all parts of the continent i need not give any description of boston as by this time the town commerce situation etc are almost universally known to every kingdom of europe here i shall only make a few observations touching the nature and disposition of the inhabitants of that city their behavior is altogether amiable as peacemakers and they are naturally blessed with humane inclinations together with such strict order and economy as i never before observed nor do i ever remember to have heard one oath uttered or the name of the lord mentioned save upon a religious occasion during the four months i tarried at that place nor is there one lewd house suffered in the whole town or any sabbathbreaking it was a pleasure to buy and ell among them because i never found an individual throughout their fraternity guilty of extortion would to god i could say this of the inhabitants of great britain  upon the arrival at boston of all our seamen they were strongly recommended by the natives to sue for the salvage of their goods and properties which were fortunately saved out of the ship scipio but captain clark refused to make us any satisfaction as his vessel was wrecked by waiting to take us up upon this circumstance a certain gentleman of that city undertook our cause and commenced an action against captain clark in the admiraltycourt the defendant stood the trial which was maintained by judge byfield an elderly gentleman and after a hearing of about half an hour the judge addressed captain clark told him to look upon us as objects of distress and asked him if he thought we had not suffered sufficiently already he therefore said as they saved the cargo of their own vessel i hereby decree that they shall all without any kind of restraint receive double salvage then to our astonishment captain clark though deemed by the inhabitants a covetous and avaricious character answered the judge with a cheerful accent that it should be so and that he would moreover render to each of us a present of ten pounds currency exclusive of our respective salvage thus ended our lawsuit and we had a sufficiency to fit us out with every necessary article for sea again  i embraced the first opportunity for that purpose and voluntarily shipped myself on board the allen captain dennis for antigua in the west indies i got my discharge there having a strong inclination to return to my native country accordingly i entered into an agreement with captain skatt then lying in the harbor of st johns the principal commercial town of antigua but as we were tarrying there in order to obtain a freigt for england there came on a very terrible hurricane and although it was excessively violent during its continuance and drove us out of the harbor into the offing yet we providentially sustained but very little damage and notwithstanding the ship was entirely unrigged save a jury foremast yet by the assistance of that and the immediate providence of god we reached in the space of eight days the harbor of st johns again when we had taken in part of our homewardbound merchandise the ship was by virtue of a special document from the governor of said island transmitted to the island of montserrat about ten leagues to leeward of antigua there to procure the residue of our cargo and finish the lading thereof  this island chiefly consists of numerous lofty and barren mountains with an unnavigable harbor rendered so by a multiplicity of small sharppointed rocks several whereof at ebbtide are one two or more feet above the water there is ikewise a very mean and inconsiderable town which maintains little or no correspondence with others in the adjacent islands the name of this town is basseterre and it is situated in view of the islands of nevis st christopher and guardaloupe here another difficulty followed us as we were necessitated to travel seven or eight miles over various rocks and through many valleys in order to get firewood called manchanell which is one of the most beautiful trees probably in the known world and bears an apple the odours whereof are not unlike our english golden rennets and of an equal form and size but it is one of the rankest poisons root body branches leaves and fruit i remember when i first went to jamaica at a place called littleworth one of those kind of trees was planted which grew full of fruit and spread its branches and leaves as wide as our great walnuttrees in england i simply knocked down one of the apples and ignorant of the consequence was going to eat it as it was pleasing to the eye when a black man observing my heedless actions ran with uncommon swiftness toward me and in a cautious hurry snatched it from my hand giving me at the same time to understand that if i had eaten it all my teeth would have fallen out of my head and that without any kind of remedy and further he told me that if any person was to stand under that tree in a shower of rain the drops issuing therefrom and falling on any part of the skin would take it clearly off as our men were cutting those trees for firewood at montserrat they had their eyes closed and swelled in so dreadful a manner that we were apprehensive they never could retrieve their natural sight but i think they severally recovered in a very short time  when the ship was completely ready for sailing we weighed our anchor and sailed for bristol where we arrived after a seven weeks passage and after a peaceable retirement for a few weeks i shipped myself with captain james seaborn for a second voyage with him in the ship amoretta for old callabar on the coast of africa and the island of barbados one of the caribbe or westindian islands here i began to be prefered being made gunner of the ship and when we were slaved the ship sailed for barbados but was speedily ordered for south carolina there to dispose of our slaves which we did to our satisfaction in a few days and were soon reladen then without any delay steered our course with a strong though delightful gale to the bristol channel nothing remarkable occurred in the course of this voyage on coming to england i betook myself to barnstaple in devon where dwelt a brother of mine who kept a genteel shop there i continued with him for several days then repaired to bristol again accompanied by my brother and from thence set off for london to visit my mother whom i had not seen for ten years past my family being in low circumstances i was obliged to go again to sea and the first trip was in a coasting sloop to wisbeach with a captain john heath when i returned i shipped myself with captain thomas long in the ship ann and judith for antigua when i had made this voyage also i covenanted with captain rogers for a voyage up the mediterranean his ship was iaden with   0 quarters of corn upon charterparty to three delivering ports viz marseilles genoa and leghorn in the course of this eastern voyage we sustained various hardships which may particularly be attributed to the perverseness of our commander we sailed from the downs in the month of january      after riding out and weathering many vehement storms in that sea the whole fleet sailed down channel with very promising weather but before we had made any progress in our intended voyage the wind suddenly varied and blew with such vehement rage that the greater part of the fleet were scattered and their sails blown and torn to atoms therefore such part thereof as could put back without danger returned to spithead while the others were dispersed abroad throughout the channel and driven over to the coast of france but our captain as before hinted being an obstinate though an experienced seaman and the whole ship entirely his own was determined to assume that unrestrained presumption which other commanders more circumspectly declined the consequence was we were beating to windward for full five weeks incessantly under reesed courses the mountainous sea making continual breaches over the ship nor did the cook or any of the seamen during that time dress any provisions neither had any of us the comfort of a dry thread upon our backs one night in particular the wind being at northwest attacked us so violently that the ship was laid hatches under water and the forescuttle where we came up being unfortunately open every repeated sea poured itself down into the hold like stoods insomuch that the ship was sunk very near two streaks in the water the captain was at the same time cursing swearing and roaring at the ships company like an infernal spirit and had it not been through the dexterous alacrity and nimbleness of a john stonehouse one of our seamen who ran up the weather main sreads and who secretly conveyed himself under water to come at the leemainsheet and let it go which as the mainsail was set naturally pressed the ship down to leeward we must inevitably have foundered and all hands without relief have perished when the mainsheet was let fly the mainsail went all to shivers like a clap of thunder the foresail then were the ship round and brought her starboardside to the wind which blew her upon an even keel she lay for a long time like a log upon the waves and having five feet water in her hold we had immediate recourse to both pumps and in about five hours cleared her and proceeded on our voyage but the obstinacy of the captain occasioned the loss of the cargo of whout not one single bushel being saved out of the whole lading and this considerable loss fell upon the configuors as our first port of delivery was marseilles in the south of france down in the gulf of lions in the streights of gibraltar we went thither and offered to the consignees there the cargo but they refused to accept thereof this obliged us to carry it to genoa where it was likewise refused from thence we steered up to leghorn and this being the last port of delivery the freightors correspondents were constrained to accept of it good or bad agreeable to charter when our cargo was discharged and our ship reladen we departed for england but before i proceed to our passage for england i would take notice of some of those things which are worthy observation in that part of italy where we were stationed  and first i never remember to have seen a more splendid magnificent and fertile country in the course of my life than this was here the warmest of my juvenile conceptions of foreign parts were in some measure realized and as at the early period of my life i had entertained many pleasing ideas of those places where the apostles with such holy zeal propagated the gospel in their travels so i found a natural propensity to satisfy myself with a clear view of every remarkable thing throughout the limits of my restriction while on shore in one part of genoa i observed two very lofty pillars of marble built upon so elevated a plan as to be evidently perceptible from ships at the distance of    miles at sea this is conjectured to be the gallons erected for mordcai the jew by the wicked contrivance of haman and which proved fatal to haman himself two things more i shall notice in genoa the first is the image of a man at the back part of a gentlemans house sculptured out of a solid rock almost at the summit thereof which appears to be precipitated therefrom with his head foremost his arms extended and the hair of his head hanging pendant considerably below his body and his whole frame fixed on his right foot through which a spring was conveyed and ran throughout the body so as to discharge drops of water from the tops of his fingers and hair here another surprising phoenomenon attracted my notice at the top of a passage that led me to the rock i perceived the exact representation of a stout and corpulent man descending from the rock which seemed to threaten me with impending danger therefore i nimbly fled out of its way least in its fall i should be crushed to pieces however the statue remained firm in that surprising attitude  the next curiosity was a grand arched bridge near a mile in length with many spacious arches and streets of houses some of them four stories high running under those arches this bridge as i have been informed was constructed for the better convenience of carriages passing from the city into the country for supplying the remoter natives with the necessaries of life and commerce the distance between every arch is sufficiently extensive to admit of twenty carriages abreast of each other i likewise in the course of my observations on this city perceived that it was founded on a basis of seven hills having a beautiful change covered and skylights fixed around for the better convenience of merchants to transact their negociations  at leghorn i saw nothing interesting or of a grand appearance except the four brazen men who are placed in a conspicuous situation round a pedestal this was erected in honor of the duke of genoa who gloriously defeated four notorious pirates that frequently disturbed the mediterranean viz a father and his three sons they were taken prisoners by the duke in a row galley and their statues erected in brass around the pedestal as a memorial and on another spot was placed the image of the duke standing upright with a truncheon in his hand and casting an air of contempt upon the four captives the space between these not exceeding half a dozen yards in this place there are numerous galleys of war supported by common prostitutes and strumpets tolerated by government who have a considerable part of the city allowed them wherein they commit all manner of abominations i do not ever remember to have fallen in with a city or town in which impurity predominates over the inhabitants in so licentious a manner as in the city of leghorn nor is it possible for either sex to forsake or renounce that horrid course of life even though they should be ever so desirous or convinced of the sin thereof  when the term of my liberty was elapsed i repaired on board our ship and in a few days we sailed for england when we arrived off the isle of wight a tender which lay in the channel to press the homeward bound seamen a proceeding derogatory to god and man took our ships crew and after having been on board the tender rather upwards of a week a division took place among the seamen one part was sent on board the lenox of  0 guns and the other part on board the ipswich of the same force after lying at spithead ten months under the weight of an arbitrary fellow of a lieutenant i was removed on board the phoenix captain trivil caley who was the complete gentleman and christian and one whose conduct was guided by the tear of god he frequently encouraged religious discipline on board nor did he ever neglect to order his chaplain to attend his invalid seamen at five oclock in the morning both at portsmouth and gosport and would constantly visit every patient respectively on his knees at their bedsides with all the devotion becoming a christian never was a commander so caressed by a ships company as captain caley and his men were equally endeared to him so entirely cautious was he before he spoke to any man on board from the highest to the lowest that he even drew the attention of strangers for my part i could never look at him but with uncommon satisfaction and delight in short his mildness sapience and fortitude greatly surpassed those characters i had ever admired before in my life happy truly happy it proved for me that i providentially fell in with so worthy a christian otherwise what with the hell of uncommon curses and blasphemous oaths accompanied by an habitual course of cruel and barbarous behavior on the parts of two lieutenants i must have died under my burden as the idea of a man of war was ever perfectly distasteful to my inclination at that time i was grievously oppressed with the rheumatism however early one morning god undertook my cause and i began thus to reason with myself the rheumatism what is it and it was strongly suggested to me in a manner not unlike a clear voice it is a violent cold i then with great astonishment asked what is most proper as a remedy for the cold i was answered as before spring water the reason of this i could not comprehend and asked again why spring water the answer to me clear as a strong voice was man was created out of the dust of the earth and water springs out of the bowels of the earth therefore it is the more adapted to his nature at this i was satisfied and straightway called for a man whose name was tom lewis who came immediately and asked me what i wanted i requested him to procure from some part of the ship five or six shirts and air them sufficiently at the fireside i told him also to fill a large pitcher full of water and bring it instantly to me and i would drink till i could drink no more as i believed the lord had directed me to a cure by taking a hearty draught of spring water he endeavored to dissuade me from so hasty an action assuring me that its operation would surely kill me in my then present condition notwithstanding added he if you are bent upon taking it i will get it quickly he did so and completed my desires i then drank immediately of the spring water laid myself down on the bed and tom covered me up very warm after i had lain about the space of half an hour with no appearance of the waters operation i put my head under the clothes and breathed hard on the pit of my stomach this produced a perspiration and that in a profuse measure i then desired my attendant to bring me half a dozen welldried and warm slannels in order to rub me from head to foot he did this likewise and continued his rubbing till i had made five shirts in a condition equal to the dipping of them in water when i had put on my sixth dry shirt i gave thomas to understand that i was totally exempt from every the least symptom of the rheumatism and pain instantly jumped out of bed dressed myself without his aid and asked him what was for dinner below he replied saltfish and potatoes and although i had not enjoyed one meal for eight or ten weeks before yet i went down and made as hearty a meal as i ever remember to have eat in my life and then walked the distance of a mile on shore by way of recreation here i considered that nothing was impossible to him who had all power in heaven and in earth two or three days after this i was pronounced able and went on board the lenox the ship i formerly belonged to my several indispositions began in the month of january      and accompanied me with direful pangs and sensations till the latter end of april following  on the christmaseve in the course of my liberty i espoused mary verney a very virtuous young woman in the twentysecond year of her age at that time i was in my twentythird year after remaining on board the ship for two months orders were sent down to sir john norris on board the britannia a firstrate of  00 guns with the union flag at his maintopmasthead the barflour admiral balchan of  0 guns and blue flag at the foretopmasthead and the lancaster of so guns admiral haddock with st georges flag at his foretopmasthead together with twentyfive sail of the line to sail immediately for lisbon in order to protect the king of portugals brazilian fleet from the threats of the spaniards here myself with several others were turned over from the lenox on board the grafton of  0 guns and sailed in company with the fleet for lisbon and arrived in the tagus some time in the month of may      where we lay ten months at anchor in which time the brazil fleet arrived and orders were sent from england for admiral haddocks squadron to return thither previous to our departure from lisbon the king of portugal with his brother the black prince came on board of all three admirals whose ships were dressed in various colors consisting of all nations in the world and making a very brilliant appearance his portuguese majesty allowed every man and boy in the fleet one pint of wine per day with fresh provisions every day till the completion of our voyage  we sailed for england in the beginning of january      and arrived off the rocks of scilly the latter end of the same month where our ship was well nigh lost it being indispensably necessary for us to beat to windward under reefe courses but thank god we were preserved in this storm also and arrived safe in chatham river where we were paid off february        i then came directly to london nor have i ever been to sea since i could wish to make one remark here which i have omitted in the course of my voyages the coast of africa is attended every day especially on the leeward coast with dreadful tornadoes of wind thunder and lightning the flashes of which for some time take away the sight at one time in particular about eight degrees to the southward of the equinoctial line at one a m a violent tornado came down upon us with loud claps of thunder and fierce flashes of lightning in the height of this storm also descended from the disturbed clouds something that bore the resemblance of a squib darting out fire at one end about one foot and a half in length and the thickness of a mans wrist it came down from the heavens with astonishing velocity passed within a yard of my head and penetrated the quarter deck but meeting with an obstruction of the air made its way through the main hatchway took a swift course over the larboardquarter and when it burst exploded with so loud a clap of thunder that we could not expect two planks of the ship would have remained together however the ship weathered this storm also but not without much damage through the mighty force of the tornado  i now entered into a new scene of life and although i had been brought up to the sea and had no friends to supply my necessities at home yet i was resolved through the help of the almighty to have recourse to any employment be it in never so menial a calling rather than abide in the unsuitable state of life i formerly did a life attended with all manner of sufferings and wickedness in the highest degree my case being rather different from other seamen as god never left me without conviction which constantly rendered my mind very unhappy and i ever experienced grievous stings of conscience for the commission of any discoverable sin being now in a married state and desirous to lead a regular and observant life i habituated myself to the church service but finding the churchmen living as did other people and having no christian friend to converse with i knew not what step to take and therefore readily concluded religion was a mere farce at the same time being subject to the weight of many temporal distresses a fresh burden came upon me yet it pleased god to point me out in a few months a school at staplefoot tauney near passingford bridge in the county of essex erected by a lady luther who spared no pains in its building and also bestowed many donations toward the support and maintenance thereof my whole salary amounted to l   per annum ten pounds whereof was the neat salary from the school two pounds from lady luther and the like sum from mr moot a wealthy farmer with as many dayscholars as i could acquire for my own account i soon raised a considerable school and sent to london for my wife and all my goods the lady three days in the week invited me with the curate of the parish to dine with her and every other day if i thought proper to accompany the servants at their dinner in knaveshall as they termed it i now began to be much delighted with my situation and reserved no diligence to bring the children forward in their learning indeed the success i met with caused the school to be recommended throughout the country  here the curate of the parish frequently called upon me and decoyed me to his lodgings about three miles from the school to join him in smoking a pipe drinking a bowl of punch with the like carousals i was also pressed upon to sing him a sea song and was generally detained so very late at night that i could scarcely find my way home but this life did not answer my desires and therefore as the curate and myself were going from lady luthers over the fields to my school i took upon myself to quote some passages of scripture relating to our immoral proceedings my guide or pretended one laughed heartily and said told are you so great a blockhead as to believe the scripture it is nothing but a pack of false theology the whole of it this surprised me much and from that period i separated myself from his company and god in his providence disunited me from those dead and barren christians by the following simple circumstance  the wood i had bespoke for firing not coming in as i expected i acquainted farmer mills on the opposite side of the churchyard who gave me leave to send my boys into his field where they might be able to collect a quantity sufficient for my use until the bespoken firewood came in and seeing it was on the farmers own ground i had no conceptions of any impropriety of conduct on my part yet this through the insinuative complaint of an old woman who ever before expressed the sincerest regard for myself and wife proved the cause of my removal out of the school and country sir edward smith then lord of the manor sent for lady luther and desired to know what kind of a schoolmaster she had brought into the country and whether he ever taught his children their catechism my lady informed me that sir edward greatly surprised her but she answered him that i bore the best characters and had brought the children forward in their education in an extraordinary manner and that i taught the children their catechism every thursday sir edward then asked how i came to leave out the eighth commandment therefore insisted upon my dismission from the school and departure from the town immediately nor would he hear the circumstance face to face so that i was under the necessity of hiring a wagon to carry all my goods back to london and was then at a loss what method to pursue for the maintenance of my family but in a short time a clerks place offered at kingswharf beaufortsbuildings to a dealer in coals and timber i remained there about four months when my mistress leaving off business i was necessarily discharged and was left destitute of employment for some time nor could i obtain any relief or procure the least employ from any quarter thereabouts so was resolved to submit to any the meanest office to procure a subsistence and accordingly engaged myself to a mr medway a bricklayer in watlingstreet to keep his books and at vacant opportunities to attend and wait on the labouers here i continued about six or seven years and afterward served mr john pankeman a bricklayer likewise but in the course of my services with him god began a different providence with me and one day as laboring at my work in oldstreet road a young man who was likewise a bricklayer came and asked me if i could help him to business i answered him rather roughly which he received with great meekness this struck me with surprise i then called him back and desired him to wait on a certain master bricklayer at an appointed place the next morning who i was apt to believe could find him employment he repaired thereto accordingly and the gentleman without asking him any questions admitted him into his service this young man was the instrument in the hand of god of leading me out of darkness into his mavelous light here my readers will permit me to enter upon my religious life and therefore i think it prudent to revert back to my earliest days and as i have already in the beginning set forth the manner and mystery of gods working upon my soul to the time of my admission into edward colsons hospital so i shall occasionally intersperse my changes of station in this life as well as those of a spiritual nature  when i first was admitted into school between two extremes that of parting with my tenderhearted nurse and being driven into a new scene of life i was brought under much distress of mind yet i constantly found the spirit of god working powerfully upon me nor could i ever find peace or rest but when meditating on things divine my thoughts when at prayers in the school three times every day were carried up into heaven with the most solemn ardent desire and when we assembled in the college church which we regularly did every sabbath day the service there was to me a heaven upon earth here i drank deep into the bliss and happiness of the everblessed and adorable jesus and that without interruption till i arrived at the age of ten years by which time i had made some proficiency in learning and was approved of by the minister who came twice a week to instruct us in religious principles so that in a short time i was competent by readily answering him any questions propounded to be entitled a monitor i then began to read pious books especially the pilgrims progress this set me on fire for god and heavenly bliss and wrought in me the utmost horror of taking the lords name in vain or of telling a lie and as there were a few lads in the same order as myself that were piously inclined so we often read the pilgrims progress together on a lords day in particular being at the college church the reverend mr sutton preached a very alarming discourse upon the deep things of eternity to a wanton crowded congregation the fashion was then for the women to go nakedbreasted nor was there scarce a woman to be found in the college but appeared in the most indecent manner yet the discourse in a great measure effected its design neither do i ever remember to have seen any thing of that kind in bristol afterward many of our boys were deeply affected by the sermon so that when we came home to school several of us entered into an agreement to pinch the tongue of him that told a lie or that mentioned the lords name in an irreverent way  when i was about twelve years of age i was more profoundly acquainted with divine things but not with myself as a sinner sitting one day in my order and reading the pilgrims progress i suddenly laid down the book leaned my right elbow on my right knee with my hand supporting my head and meditated in the most solemn thought upon the awfulness of eternity suddenly i was struck with a hand on the top of my head which affected my whole frame the blow was immediately followed by a voice with these words dark dark dark and although it alarmed me prodigiously yet upon the recovery from so sudden a motion i found myself broad awake in a world of sin notwithstanding all my former happiness and bliss i now found a dreadful difference as nothing could give me satisfaction either from person or things not could i ever rest atisfied about my salvation as temptation from the world the flesh and the devil were ever besetting me  one day the boys being permitted to go to visit their friends i obtained permission likewise although i had no relation or friend in the city my mother and two sisters residing in london and my two elder brothers residing in the country however several of the boys accompanied me that afternoon to go to a river called broadstony near the city for the purpose of learning to swim and as i was strongly desirous of learning that art several of the smaller boys with myself went into a pond adjoining to that river which received the overflowing thereof it being low water i ventured rather beyond the others but in attempting to swim struck out of my depth and was for some time struggling for life my companions who sat upon the bank on the other side the river imagined i was taking my sport and pastime by reason of my rising above water and diving under again therefore had no conceptions that i was on the verge of being drowned till they perceived that i gave a dart sunk and they could see me no more at this they were all terribly affrighted and in the utmost consternation not knowing what to do but descrying some haymakers at the farther end of the meadow they ran with all possible haste and informed them that a boy was drowned providentially there was a dutchman among the haymakers who upon hearing the sad news threw down his hayfork ran to the riverside enquired of the others where i was perceived to sink and upon as near an information as could possibly be given he jumped in without pulling off any of his clothes he then searched and groped about for a considerable time but i could not be found as in the dart i had shot a great distance from the spot where the children perceived me to sink i was now given up for lost but as the dutchman was swimming to the bank where a willowbush grew out at the side in order to haul himself out of the pond he felt about with one of his legs just before he came to the bank and as my head was covered in the mud with my heels upright so he providentially struck his foot against mine and joyfully gave the signal that i was found he went down brought me up and landed me on the bank but not the least signs of life were discernible in me the dutchman held me with my heels upwards for some minutes and then concluded my life was irretrievably gone yet it entered into his mind to try another method accordingly he swam across the river and went a little way up the hill where there was a small alehouse he got from thence a quartern of brandy and swam over the river back again into the meadow holding up the brandy in one hand and swimming with the other my jaws were firmly set together nor was there any motion or breath to be perceived yet he put some brandy into his mouth forced my jaws open and blew repeatedly half a quartern of spirits down my throat he also blew some up my nostrils and into my ears and in about three quarters of an hour my lefteye flew open and i gave a loud shriek they then carried me to baptistmills where in about four hours i recovered my senses so as to have a faint knowledge of one or two of the boys these were the immediate accounts of all transactions as they related them to me  i was then conveyed home to the school but with an excruciating pain equal to the being out through in the middle of my body nor did i enjoy an exemption therefrom for several years together neither do i remember a single twelvemonth for a dozen years successively but that this pain produced two three or more fits of sickness every year and many of them brought me near the grave when i went to school mr samuel gardner the principal master of the hospital having been informed of the circumstance punished me severely as a strict charge had been delivered by him that none of us should go near the water one of his scholars having been drowned some time ago and who never recovered  i hope my readers will suspend their judgment in censuring what i am now about to relate although it may appear rather incredible i shall then in the most simple and artless manner treat of what was as real to my sensations as that i ever had an existence the circumstance was this although i was deprived of my natural senses and had no ideas of the things of ts world yet my spirit was permitted by god both to behold and experience that which i believe no one in the body ever did my entrance into this blissful vision as it ared to me was that i rushingly emerged out of thick aess into a most glorious city the luster of which a fr outshone the brilliancy of the noonday n  the brightness thereof transcends the glimmering ray of the moon this empyreal light shone with a esplenent power on the city and illuminated even the darkness through which i seemed to urge my y and enforce my entrance into that beatifie state and notwithstanding we cannot retain a steadfast eye upon the sun when dazzling our eartly cities with its meridian splendors yet i found no impeiment to my sight in looking with a rapturous ardency on this havely me the beams whereof darted from the theast with a rflgence beyond the highest conceptions there was also some resemblance of a bottom or foor like unto glass but neither the city or bottom were of any substance the inhabitants were all in the form of men arrayed in robes of the finest quality from their necks down to their feet yet they also appeared to me of no material substance what particularly courted my attention was that not one of these celestial bodies were under any degree of labor to walk as they all glided swiftly along as if carried by the wind this was my own case clothed in the finest of linen and conveyed with the like celerity no speech or language was needful there as they were all one soul the solemn sacred joy and uninterrupted peace i then possessed all language fails me to point out i had no imaginations of evil or any temptations thereto but was completely happy without mixture  another point of this vision i would just remark before i close the subject that is while those blessed spirits were performing their aerial course one of them about  0 yards off on my right hand turned round and looked steadfastly at my raiment we both suddenly stopped and the extacies which proceeded from his countenance united us together as one oh who can express the sweet pleasant and serene tranquillity then enjoyed but on a sudden i lost all sense of this very desirable state and clearly apprehended my being brought again into a sinful world the coming into which was as through a devouring ocean of blood and fire this was the sequel and conclusion of that awful dispensation of the righteous god to me well knowing how he had disposed of me for many years past that i might be made perfect through sufferings and drink deep into this cup and be baptized with his baptism as to my external sufferings they are principally set forth in the foregoing part of this narrative  i have likewise already hinted at my being particularly convinced of sin by reading the pilgrims progress yet the spirit of god never left me without conviction nor do i remember ever to have fallen into any outward sin but i reflected upon it with guilt and abhorrence and being deeply affected with the consequence of  in a future judgment i was also often terrified with awful dreams when on my first passage to jamaica i was grievously exercised in my mind as not one of the mariners had the least concern for god or the salvation of their own souls but on the contrary appeared to be greedy of eternal death and damnation and as st paul intimates evil communications corrupt good manners so this in process of time though with much fear and trembling not only corrupted my manners but my morals also and being unacquainted with the devices of the devil i stole into a reasoning spirit doubting whether all those persons who seemed happy in themselves could be lost eternally or not although they lived such horrid lives the fatal enemy made a fresh attack upon my mind and forced me still to doubt whether god would suffer any of the human species to be punished eternally for crimes committed in this their transitory span of life although the word of god expressly declares it shall be so those and similar temptations got considerable advantage of me  when we arrived at jamaica the inhabitants in every particular corresponded with those reasonings nor do i remember ever to have met with one man or woman who had the fear of god before their eyes in the town of kingston or port royal or even the form of godliness among them they were much addicted to profane cursing swearing whoredom lying and sabbathbreaking exercising the utmost cruelty on their unhappy negro slaves which never appeared to be a burden upon their untouched consciences and as i have been a spectator to multiplied acts of cruelty exercised by them upon their poor miserable black drudges i shall briefly relate one instance which for its notoriety and unheard of inhumanity it would be unjust on my part to withhold from the attention of all lovers of clemency and christian discipline and from the world in general as i went on shore at ramsayswharf for certain sugars at the east end of kingston a stout black man about thirtysix years of age was brought down to the crane at the end of the wharf by his master and for the commission of some almost nameless error was delivered up to be punished the mode of executing this bloody punishment was as follows the boatswain tied both wrists together with a strong cord then hooked the crane between his wrists and hoisted his body nearly a foot from the floor the boatswain then took a whip composed of cowsskin which when dried hard and twisted lengthways forms a kind of corkscrew the outward edge thereof from end to end being extremely sharp a negro man in obedience to the boatswains commands and at a moments notice began the direful action in presence of his vile master accompanied by two others of the same complexion gazing upon the pitiable object with complaisancy and delight after the executioner with his piercing weapon and with one hundred repeated lashes had reduced his body from neck to ancles into one flagrant wound and human nature was no longer able to support itself under the remorseless stroke the poor man hung down his head and received the remaining cuts like a stock or a stone repeatedly though faintly uttering oh me deady me deady nor did this move the accursed fiend his master till the poor tortured object appeared in his last gasps he then desired the boatswains mate to desist for a few moments and approached the almost expiring slave where taking a more particular survey of his wounds from head to foot and perceiving two or three inch spaces which had not been laid open he instantly ran to the boatswains mate and compelled him to lash him there also and make him all alike when this was executed he was loosed and as he had no strength to stand so he lay as totally dead while he was washed from head to foot in a tub of saltbeef pickle placed on the wharf for that purpose here i was greatly astonished that the excruciating pains and acute smarts produced by the pickle did not put a speedy end to the remainder of his existence the vile heathen his master tarried to behold this operation also and afterward walked off well satisfied the effect this worked upon my mind as i ever did and humbly hope ever shall abhor the appearance of cruelty more especially when i behold such merciless acts thereof as i then did heightened my indignation to such a degree that i must acknowledge had i been possessed of a knife sword or any other cutlery instrument i should certainly have transfixed the body of so infernal a being this deed was not executed in a corner or done privily but upon the open wharf and in a nominal christian protestant country but if the word christian implies which it unquestionably does one who has the mind that was in his heavenly master or that pursues his most holy example then there can be no impropriety or breach of charity in pronouncing such wretches as those children of the devil rather than the children of god by faith in christ jesus the scripture impartially condemns all such with this dreadful sentence depart ye cursed into everlasting fire unless they deeply repent before they are called out of this life all this gross ignorance and horrid barbarity overspread the island of jamaica in the year      and i am spared to the year      yet there are too many reasons to believe that the same or nearly the same spirit of cruelty still predominates over those our unfortunate fellow creatures the greater part of whom are clandestinely taken away from their native countries utterly against the consent of their parents and themselves and enforced by devilish compulsion into slavery and captivity to the latest moment of their lives with their children and childrens children after them unto many generations until god undertakes their wretched cause and sets them at liberty here it may be retorted upon me physician heal thyself as i had been in the slave trade for some years i confess and acknowledge this charge but my case was different being at that time an apprentice and unacquainted with the consequent evils of that horrid trade i conducted myself with the utmost circumspection according to the best of my knowledge in obedience to my masters interest but when i arrived at boston those pious and christian people reasoned the matter with me and notwithstanding my familiarity with the african trade and the immediate prospect of being made a conspicuous character in that impious number of guinea commanders yet through the allwise providence of god i relinquished every point of temporal interest and advantage nor had i any the least inclinations or weakest desires of resuming them any more therefore i am under the highest obligations to the almighty for so happy a deliverance from the snare of the devil seeing that it is one of the most base practices under the sun but had not the lords timely interposition manifested itself in rescuing me therefrom i probably might by promotion to the rank of captain have proved as eminent a savage as the most notorious character among them surely an immediate curse from god attends upon this cruel trade as few voyages are made to those parts in which the crews are not thinned by poison suiside ill usage and every species of destruction this i have remarked during the slavery under which i labored when unhappily linked to that trade and although i was frequently laboring under severe sicknesses myself yet the merciful hand of god was ever over me and followed me with daily convictions for sins yet having an evil precedent always before me and the corruptions of my own evil nature incessantly prompting me to sin i sometimes gave way thereto against the light of conscience knowing but very little of the corrupt fountain from whence those resistless currents of evil perpetually flowed yet this was always a pain to my mind and a complete obstacle against my having immediate recourse to private devotion it likewise proved a barrier against my solemn deprecations for pardon of my past sins and to guard against future temptations but to my greater grief still i found that when the bank was broken the breach was made wider and being at that time between    and    years of age and my carnal passions getting the dominion over me i was oftentimes overcome with sweaing drunkenness and lewdness as also diverse other evils therefore what with my terrified conscience and cross providence in temporals my life became completely miserable so that for about ten years i continued in that unsettled state sinning and repenting nor did the lord suffer me to prosper either in soul or body yet i was never without fear of death hell and judgment this i considered a mercy far beyond my deserts  in the month of july    0 mr charles casper greaves the young bricklayer already spoken of in the foregoing account was made the instrument of my introduction among the then much despised people called methodists a people grievously contemned by reason of the many evil reports raised against them one of which was that the false prophets referred to in scripture were every sunday or at other select opportunities in the center of their congregations another report was the there were certain subterraneous dens and caves into which the men and women frequently resorted there to commit all manner of abominations together with similar reports all which i cordially believed and communicated those sictitious relations to my wife her father and mother so that we all conceived an utter detestation to these methodists but gods thoughts of them were not as our thoughts therefore i was through his providence pointed out to be the happy instrument of conversion both to my own and wifes family which will more fully appear in the sequel hereof but previously returning to young mr greaves i hope to recount the many interesting passages of our intercourse during his employment in goldenlane by a brewer to whom i was also a clerk i here descried something in the countenance and behavior of this young man very different to that i beheld in others as well as myself however to my shame be it spoken i treated him with ridicule and contempt he being a whitfieldlite as it was termed and to the nearest of my remembrance i sometimes cursed and swore at him and told him the whole fraternity of them was a mixture of false prophets hypocrites and plebeians all which he bore with a calm magnanimity and unwearied patience nor did he return me one evil word or look his countenance appeared full of holy grief which greatly condemned me although i concealed it from him and at twelve oclock being dinner time he asked me where i dined i answered him very roughly in the hayloft he then said i will go with you so we both ascended together and as soon as we were seated on the trusses of hay he took a prayer book out of his pocket and read a few verses out of the psalms he then turned round and asked me what i thought of those words and as i was fond of the scriptures i was the more confounded well knowing they condemned me more abundantly than before when he perceived my tongue was silent he began rather too hastily upon me and asked me to go with him that evening to hear the reverend mr wesley at the foundry i begged him for gods sake never to ask me a question of that kind any more for i was determined never to go thither and that if my wife ever came to the knowledge of such proceedings she would never forgive me seeing me so earnest he considered it prudent to say no more but in that instant god began to work powerfully upon my soul then the eye of my mind saw the son of god sitting on his throne to judge the world and a calm peace rested upon me such as tongue cannot express this happy change abode with me every moment of that afternoon and i quickly though imperceptibly found my spirit much united to mr greaves and therefore related my experience to him i then myself proposed going with him to hear the reverend mr wesley to which he acceded with great satisfaction and accordingly we repaired to the foundry but were disappointed  the next morning he took me up to shorts gardens to hear mr wesley but we were disappointed there likewise however we tarried to hear the sermon yet the place was very unpleasant but the preacher exceedingly more so who proved to be mr maxfield a laypreacher with a thickhead of curled hair resembling a mop and a clownish disagreeable voice stammering out his words as i imagined without rhyme or reason when he had concluded i went out in a pet and asked mr greaves for what reasons he brought me there whether it was to hear a good sermon or to be disgusted by the grumbling of a fellow who could not deliver half a dozen words of common sense  this unkind speech however did not appear to affect him the least in the world but on the contrary excited his compassion and increased his pity toward me so that he very mildly enquired of me the place of my residence and gave me to understand that without any fear of disappointment i might depend upon hearing the reverend mr wesley next sunday morning at five oclock i answered him more surly than ever i did before but told him he might call at my apartments if he thought proper and gave him directions accordingly and notwithstanding his place of abode was at kensington and that of mine on churchhill near blackfriars church yet he was at my house precisely at four oclock in the morning i then went with him to the foundry and as we were passing through cheapside he commenced a christian conversation and asked me if i ever had an idea of what was become of all those who walked that street fourscore or an hundred years ago this prepared my mind for hearing the word and as before observed god had wrought graciously upon my soul so i was the better prepared to receive instructions when we entered the foundry as i had heard various unaccountable reports both of the place and people i was much tempted to gaze about me in order to make a few observations thereon and finding it a ruinous place with an old pantile covering a few rough deal boards put together to constitute a temporary pulpit and several other decayed timbers which composed the whole structure i began to think it answered the report given of it as there were many rooms and corners similar to those caverns related to me by my former irreligious acquaintances in one of these recluse parts of the foundry sat three or four old women one of whom appeared in the attitude of an unmovable statue with her apron over her face nor was she uncovered during the whole time of divine service the enemy of souls immediately suggested that she was an hypocrite my friend mr greaves stood close behind me to prevent my going out as i had done at shortsgardens to which i was strongly tempted and had it not been for the multitude of people assembled together so early in the morning as between four and five oclock and the striking consideration of such profound seriousness which evidently appeared in the countenance of almost every person there i must certainly have given way to the temptation and thereby have lost the greatest blessing i ever experienced before i tarried there a full half hour before the service began during which my mind was sorely disturbed with many strange notions as i had been so strongly attached to the church of england exactly at five oclock a general whisper was conveyed through the congregation and here he comes here he comes was repeated with the utmost pleasure i was filled with curiosity to see his person which when i beheld i much despised the enemy of souls who is never unprepared to hinder the salvation of individuals suggested that he was some farmers son who not able to support himself was making a penny in this low and ignoble manner he passed through the congregation into the temporary pulpit and having his robes on i expected he would have begun with the church service but to my astonishment the introduction to his preaching was the singing an hymn with which i was almost enraptured but his extemporary prayer was quite unpleasant as i thought it savoured too much of the dissenters mode of worship which at that time my prejudice could not abide after which he took his text in the  d chapter of the  st epistle general of st john    and    ver i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you etc the enemy struck a deadly blow at me and in that moment suggested that he was a papist as he dwelt so much on forgiveness of sins and although i had read this portion of scripture many times before yet i never understood that we were to know our sins forgiven on earth supposing that it referred only to those to whom the apostle was then writing especially as i had never heard this doctrine preached in the church however my prejudice quickly abated through the excellent wisdom with which mr wesley spoke this clearly elucidated the subject and proved the point i then plainly saw i could never be saved without knowing my sins were forgiven me and in the midst of his sermon the spirit of god sealed the truth of every word upon my heart at the close of the discourse however strange it may appear a small still voice entered my left ear with these words this is the truth and instantly i felt it in my heart and for five and thirty years i have never once doubted of those truths and doctrines received amongst us viz of salvation by that faith productive of good works my worthy friend mr greaves observing my attention to the sermon asked me how i liked mr wesley i replied as long as i live i will never part from him hitherto the lord has kept me and i trust he ever will with this first sermon my soul was on fire assured that it was the truth so that i was filled with zeal for the righteous cause and for some years i ran as it were through fire and water to promote the redeemers kingdom and that not without glorious success here i broke off at a stroke all my old acquaintance in iniquity who mocked and derided me exceedingly and one of my most intimate acquaintances said to me what told are you commenced whitfieldlie as sure as ever you was born if you follow them you are damned but the heavier my persecutions were the more abundantly i rejoiced and conceived such love and union to my ministers and companions in tribulation that naught but death could make a separation  i had now to encounter with my wife and family with whom for many years i had lived peaceably and in quiet but they perceiving different marks of an alteration in my mind and behavior suspected i had been among the methodists my wife though a worthy honest woman yet an entire stranger to this new light happened one day to exclaim very warmly and said what the devil possesses you i hope you have not been among the methodists i will sacrifice my soul rather than you shall go among those miscreants although i never before this heard an ill expression drop from her lips oh how does the carnal mind rage in the unconverted however i gave her for answer if you are resolved to sacrifice your soul i am resolved god willing to join them at which she said no more nor ever opposed my going to the word  after this happened a very unfortunate circumstance one evening as my wife was occasionally at her accustomed chandlers shop which in a circle of years had taken some hundreds of pounds of my wifes family between whom and the proprietor a spirit of unanimity had invariably subsisted from the origin of their mutual acquaintance she discovered a leg of pork roasting by the fire and being big with her fourth child longed to eat of the joint mr c was ever free with our family in what my house afforded therefore my wife naturally imagined a similar degree of freedom on her part would not be considered as an act of rudeness by mr c  at this time however he seemed unfamiliar nor did he invite my wife to partake of his supper as usual mrs told being strictly modest went home and informed her mother of the illiberality of mr c who went immediately to him and related to him my wifes condition upon which he raved cursed swore and with the hottest censure replied what can i not have a joint of meat but she must long for it throwing out of his mouth at the same time the most sarcastic and repeated invectives her mother struck with his behavior quickly informed me thereof i then went to him myself and offered him half a guinea for a platefull of the pork which he sharply refused this broke off for ever afterward our acquaintance but i do not imagine that the disappointment would have effected my wife had it not been principally owing to the weakness of her mother who informed her of the mans cruel behavior which had so heavy an effect upon her that the child became emaciated within her insomuch that she was never delivered but lay eight months under the physicians charge which was attended with a very great expense at this time my salary was but low having no more than ten shillings per week out of this threepence was applied to the paytable every saturday evening nine shillings i lodged in the hands of a friend for the support of my wife and the remaining ninepence was the whole of my subsistence the following week  in the year      having been married seven years my wife died leaving only one child a girl about two years of age god now began to bless me in my temporals and increased my outward circumstances soon after my wife death i was recommended to a mr bembow at newcrane wapping to serve him as a clerk where i was greatly respected through my diligence in business and constant assiduity when employed in a more inferor calling a few months of my services to mr bembow were scarcely expired before i was visited by a mr hogg one of the rev mr wesleys stewards who informed me that the rev mr wesley requested my undertaking to teach the charitychildren at the foundryschool but i being fixed with mr bembow refused it a few days after mr hogg returned and together with a repetition of his former message he said that mr wesley positively insisted upon it making mention that my calling thereunto was equally clear and evident with mr wesleys calling to the ministry i then believed it was my duty to comply with his desires and therefore informed mr bembow of the intended separation both mr bembow and his wife entreated me to continue my services toward them telling me at the same time that no money should part us for that they never had acquired an assistant who executed their commands with such attention and promoted their interest with such assiduity and pains as i constantly did but as i considered it the immediate interposition of god and dared not for conscience sake to reject the undertaking i then thought proper to continue steadfastly inexorable to all their entreaties though it was the occasion of much grief on both sides  the day after our disunion i was established in the foundryschool and in the space of a few weeks collected threescore boys and six girls but the society though many in number yet poor withal could not grant me more than ten shillings per week this however was sufficient for me as they hospitably boarded and clothed my daughter being conscious of my indispensable duty in this important undertaking and having the children under my care from five in the morning till five in the evening both winter and summer sparing no diligence to make them complete in the rudiments of their education i at length with the assistance of an usher and four monitors brought near  0 of them into writing and arithmetic i continued in the school seven years and three months and discharged     boys most of them to capital trades  in the year      and as near as i can well remember in the month of june i attended the children one morning at the five oclock preaching when the rev mr wesley took his text out of the   th chapter of st matthew the   st   d   d and   th verses and i having labored under sore convictions for a considerable time was almost distracted in my mind when he read these words i was sick and in prison and ye visited me not and as i was sensible of my negligence in never visiting the prisoners during the course of my life so therefore i was filled with an horror of mind beyond expression i then began to reason with myself that i had obeyed the other injunctions but not this one therefore i could not be saved as i never had a mere knowledge of either prisons or keepers and to increase my then prevailing wretchedness it was suggested to me that i should be eternally miserable if i did not speedily visit them this threw me well nigh into a state of despondency and hopelessness as i was totally unacquainted with the measures requisite to be pursued for that purpose however the good and gracious god two or three days after sent a messenger to me in the school who informed me of ten malefactors that were under sentence of death and would be glad of any of our friends who could make it convenient to go and pray with them the messenger whose name was sarah peters gave me to understand that they were all much awakened and that one of them john lancaster was converted and full of the love of god in consequence of this reviving information i committed my school without an hours delay to the superintendency of my trusty usher mr mar and went with sarah peters to newgate where we had admittance into the cell wherein they were confined  in the first place i desired lancaster to call them altogether into his cell and then began to inquire into the state of their souls i addressed mr lancaster first as he appeared to be all alive to god he told me he had no doubt but that god for christs sake had forgiven him all his sins and although as he observed he was very young yet he had lived a very wicked life and acknowledged that three others with himself were the persons who robbed the foundry one morning of all the brass candlesticks but he knew that shortly he would be with jesus in paradise he added this morning about five oclock the sun of righteousness arose in my dark cell and i am now so full of god and heaven that i am like a barrel of new wine ready to burst for vent oh for words to express what i now feel he then dropped on his knees and earnestly supplicated the lord jesus to endue the reverends john and charles wesley with such a profusion of his blessed countenance that when his glorious wisdom calls them hence they might come to the grave as ripe shocks of corn to the ground fitted for their masters pleasure i then spoke to the rest six of whom seemed clear of their acceptance in the beloved  while i was speaking to these one roberts a carman who lived in whitecrossstreet entered the cell looking at me with a sullen shyness and with a countenance speaking the very spirit of the old serpent dwelling in him this immediately struck me and i endeavored to speak to him with all the comfortable words and use the most pacific exhortations i was capable of inviting him to come to the lord jesus as a poor helpless lost and undone sinner that jesus was the only sinners friend told him that the king of heaven laid down his life for the chief of sinners and that he certainly died for him i therefore quoted for example david mary magdalen peter and the thief on the cross now while i was thus speaking to him i perceived his countenance to change into a pleasing smile and his uncultivated savage behavior happily transformed into a childlike deportment now god instantly made the lion to lie down with the kid so the turbulent man became meek and continued thus till his last moments  the report having been made and the deadwarrant coming down eight of the ten were ordered for execution the other two were respited nor did either of those two appear to have any the least regard or concern for their deathless souls therefore i trust they were spared for a good purpose that they might have time for repentance and amendment of life  the day arrived whereon the other eight malefactors were to die sarah peters and myself were early at the cell in order to render them all the spiritual service that was within our power the keeper having received directions on the overnight to lock them all up in one cell that they might pour out their souls together in fervent solemn prayer to almighty god they paid very circumspect attention thereto and a happy night it proved to each of them so that when they were led down from their cell they appeared like giants refreshed with wine nor was the fear of death apparent in any of their countenances we then went up to the chapel when my companion and myself conversed with them in the pressyard room upon being called out to have their irons taken off lancaster was the first while they were disburthening his legs thereof the sheriff being present lancaster looked up to heaven with a pleasant smile and said glory be to god for the first moment of my entrance into this place for before i came hither my heart was as hard as my cell wall and my soul was as black as hell but oh i am now washed clearly washed from all my sins and by one oclock shall be with jesus in paradise and with many strong and forcible expressions he exhorted the innumerable spectators to flee from the wrath to come this caused the sheriff to shed tears and ask mr lancaster if he was really in earnest being so greatly affected with his lively and animated spirit as their irons were taken off they were remanded back to the pressyard room but by some accident they were a long time getting off the last mans fetters when they were gotten off lancaster beholding him at a short distance clapped his hands together and joyfully proclaimed here comes another of our little flock a gentleman present said with an apparent sympathizing spirit i think it is too great a flock upon such an occasion lancaster with the greatest fluency of speech and with an aspiring voice said oh no it is not too great a flock for the shepherd jesus there is room enough in heaven for us all when he exhorted the populace to forsake their sins he particularly endeavored to press on them to come to the throne of grace immediately and without fear assuring them that they would find him a gracious and merciful god to forgive them as he had forgiven him at length they were ordered into the cart and i was prevailed upon to go with them when we were in the cart i addressed myself to each of these separately the first person was mr atkins the son of a glazier in the city a youth of    years of age i said to him my dear are you afraid to die he replied no sir really i am not i then asked him wherefore he was not afraid to die he again answered me because i have laid my soul at the feet of jesus therefore i am not afraid to die i then spoke to mr gardner a journeyman carpenter about the age of  0 who made a very comfortable report of what the lord had done for his soul through the free remission of all his past sins and that he found the true peace of god reigning in his heart the last person to whom i spoke was one thompson a very illiterate young man but he agreeable to the others entertained no fear of death assuring me also that he was perfectly happy in his savior and continued so till his last moments this was the first time of my visiting the malefactors at newgate and of my attendance upon them to the place of execution and then it was not without much shame and fear because i clearly perceived the greater part of the populace considered me as one of the sufferers when we came to the fatal tree lancaster lifted up his eyes thereto and said blessed be god then prayed extemporary in a very excellent manner and the others behaved with great discretion john lancaster had no friend who could procure for his body a proper interment so that when they had hung the usual space of time and were cut down the surgeons mob secured the body of lancaster and carried it over to paddington there was a very crowded concourse among whom were numberless gin and gingerbread vendors accompanied by pickpockets and whores of almost every denomination in london in short the whole scene resembled a principal fair rather than an awful execution now when the mob was nearly dispersed and there remained only a few bystanders with an old woman who sold gin a remarkable occurrence took place and operated to the following effect  a company of eight sailors with truncheons in their hands having come to see the execution looked up to the gallows with an angry countenance the bodies having been cut down some minutes previous to their arrival the old woman before named who sold gin observing these tars to grow violent by reason of their disappointment mildly accosted them and said gentlemen i suppose you want the man that the surgeons have got ay replied the sailors where is he the poor affrighted woman gave them to understand that the surgeons crew had carried him over to paddington and she pointed out to them the direct road thereto they hastened away and as they entered the town enquiry was made by them where the surgeons mob was to be discovered and receiving the information they wanted they went and demanded the body of john lancaster when the sailors had obtained the body two of them cast it on their shoulders and carried him round by islington they being tired out with its pressure two others laid themselves under the weight of the body and carried it from thence to shoreditch then two more carried it from shoreditch to coverleysfields at length after they were all rendered completely weary and unable to carry it any farther the sequel of their project and their ultimate contrivance to rid themselves of the body was an unanimous consent to lay it on the step of the first door they came to they did so and then went their way this gave birth to a great riot in the neighborhood which brought an old woman who lived in the house down stairs when she saw the corpse lay at the step of the door she proclaimed with an agitated spirit lord here is my son john lancaster this being spread abroad came to the knowledge of the methodists who made a collection and got him a shroud and a good strong coffin i was soon informed of this event which was peculiarly singular as the seamen had no knowledge of the body nor to whom he belonged when living my second wife went with me to see him previous to the burial but neither of us could perceive the least alteration in his visage or features or any appearance of violence on any part of his body a pleasant smile appeared in his countenance and he lay as in a sweet sleep  from the time of this introduction among the prisoners i preached frequently to the selons and debtors in newgate of the latter i joined about    in a regular society nor would they suffer any individual to live in any outward sin as they never neglected to inform me of every such instance on my following visitation at that time i had so lively a zeal for the cause of religion from my first hearing the gospel that i spared no pains or labor to do all the good that was then in my power through the assistance of god both to the bodies and souls of sinners embracing every opportunity both in respect to hearing and speaking so that in process of time i preached in every prison as well as many workhouses in and about london and frequently traveled to almost every town within    miles around this metropolis nor did i ever doubt but that god as surely called me to that office of administering his holy word to the unhappy malefactors as st paul was called to the ministry  i still continued in the foundryschool and by my second marriage to the widow of captain robert griffith who had five children living my family was much increased in temporal circumstances for the space of a few years and my soul was exceedingly delighted but when i began to confine myself to certain regulations such as rising at four oclock every morning going to the five oclock preaching diligently attending the church service and strictly observing all the other ordinances of god i was then clearly convinced of my unbelief of my lost estate and of the carnal mind which is at enmity with god no tongue can express the bitterness of soul i then labored under both day and night and that for a long time having no rest in my flesh by reason of my sin and although my place of abode joined the foundry yet when i have left the school to go either to breakfast or dinner my agony of mind has been so dreadfully heavy that i have even forgot to eat my bread and have oftentimes wandered into hoxtonfields there to pour out my misery before god frequently after i had dismissed my scholars in the evening i have rather than go to my own apartments taken a solitary walk into the fields till nine ten and eleven oclock roaring for the very disquietude of my soul and notwithstanding i never could accuse myself of inattention to any ordinance fasting and praying and fitting up both early and late yet my unbelief prevailed till i became completely miserable in this situation i continued about three years so that i chose strangling rather than life nor could i with all my hearing and selfdenial overcome this damning sin of unbelief never was i possessed of so irritable a disposition and at the time when people told me i could believe if i would gladly would i have given worlds to believe were they in my power but such power belongs to god alone and glory be to him he displayed that power in my deliverance the manner of my rescue as it appeared to me in a manifest reality i shall simply and sincerely relate taking one morning my melancholy walk after five oclock preaching in the deepest distress of mind and as i was passing ratcliffrow leading to the shepherd and shepherdess a walk i had taken before times out of number i perceived a cow coming toward me i really wished in my heart i was that beast as i considered it ten thousand times happier than myself the next thing that passed me was a dog i heartily wished i could metamorphose my body and mind into that of the dogs afterward i observed a man taking his course a few yards off i then thought that man would afford me the greatest happiness i ever before experienced if he would put an end to so wretched a life in these miserable and distracted moments i had no conception of a deliverance so very near especially as the enemy of my soul had just previously suggested to me that if i lived  00 years longer in the world i should never receive a transformation of spirit by the grace of god all which i believed however i continued walking by a slow gradation till i came to a lonesome part of a field by the shepherd and shepherdess which i imagined was better calculated for retirement than any other spot thereabouts when i had secluded myself therein being alone on a sudden in the twinkling of an eye a hand struck me a weighty blow on the top of my head which in some measure affected my senses but i instantly found myself crying with a loud voice praise god praise god and looking up i beheld the ethereal universe replete with the glory of god and that glory of such substance and palpability i thought i could have laid hold of it with my hand this attended me for the space of a minute but was succeeded by an uncommon thick darkness through which a black dart as if it was shot from the hill near islington pierced its way and with wonderful swiftness entered my heart i did not feel any pain thereby but it was followed with these words this is one of your old delusions although i was staggered at this for a few moments yet i was quickly enabled to look up to heaven and to beseech god in fervent prayer that i might more fully know whether this was the remission of my sins or not as at the first i felt unspeakable peace which far outweighed all my former misery and as i looked up the heavens were unclosed about a mile in length as it appeared to my mortal eyes and tapered away to a point at each end the center of this awful and sacred avenue was about twelve feet wide wherein i saw the lord jesus standing in the form of a man holding both his inestimably precious hands upright and from the palms thereof the blood streaming down floods of tears gushed from my eyes and trickled down my cheeks i said lord it is enough nor have i once doubted since but that i was freely justified at that time  now as i had been greatly harrassed when in my wretched state with the doctrine of election i prayed the lord to explain to me whether the blood of jesus christ was sufficient to save all the world or not and immediately some articulate voice asked me the following question how did you find yourself an hour ago i then recollected that i was in a wretched and lost state the voice again suggested all the world is but as one man and one man as all the world the meaning of these words were as clear to my intellectual sensations as the sun performing its diurnal course therefore one drop of the blood of christ was not only sufficient to save the whole world but ten thousand worlds of sinners if there were so many this i believed as an unquestionable assertion of verity nor since this do i ever remember to have experienced the slightest temptation to the doctrine of predestination whereof i cannot by any means consider myself a defender  seeing that nothing remarkable has occurred in my spiritual or temporal affairs from the year      to      i shall now confine myself to give a farther account of my elaborate researches into the situation of the prisoners at newgate and into the state of their souls but i purpose not to enter into a minute history of each but of such only as were the most remarkable characters among them in the course of my several visitations  i believe it may be upwards of twentyone years since i first attended the prisoners in newgate and there chiefly on the debtors side though sometimes i conversed in public among the felons and the lord is witness to the horrible scene and the dreadful emblem of the infernal pit which was therein pourtrayed consisting of swearing cursing speaking blasphemies and foul conversation and that continually the unfortunate persons confined in that prison found it the nearest resemblance to the picture of hell of any under the canopy of heaven however having a constant pressure upon my mind to stand up for god in the midst of them and to defend his cause against those mighty sinners while heedlessly proceeding in this destructive path i therefore prayed to god for wisdom and fortitude in the attempt of that disagreeable task to flesh and blood i confess i did so many times with fear and trembling yet i can conscientiously announce to the world i ever found the lord overcoming all my apprehensive dreads and confounding the adversary indeed for a few years i could not fully perceive my call to attend the malefactors meeting with so many and various repulses from the keepers and ordinary as also from the prisoners themselves but notwithstanding this opposition i was the more vehemently pressed on in spirit to burst through all so that by the aid of him who has all power in heaven and earth i became in the name of god daringly resolute in that point and would conform myself to no denial the ordinary mr tailor constantly on sunday mornings stationed himself a few doors from newgate for the space of two hours or more to obstruct my entrance in forbidding all the turnkeys respectively to give me admittance yet the god of all compassion to those souls for whom christ died frequently made an entrance for me so that i had an opportunity of preaching every sunday morning on the debtorsside to the number of  0 prisoners who behaved with much seriousness and attention after which i proposed to them the uniting themselves together in the nature of a society and acquainted them also with the manner and restrictive proceedings of mr wesley throughout his several congregations i read and left with them the rules of our society particularly desiring them to consider seriously whether they deemed it proper to confine themselves to such regulations or not upon my succeeding visit i understood that through the circumspection of two or three prisoners who were men of good understanding and of a liberal education that had highly approved of my proposals an unity had taken place among  0 or more for a considerable time afterward they paid regular attention to preaching and to the meeting of the young society behaving themselves suitable to what might be reasonably expected from persons in a situation like theirs if any offense was given to the society in my absence a report of the person or persons by whom such offense had been occasioned was never withheld from my notice this desirable economy continued for a considerable time when a great tumult was made by the ordinary who ever afterward shut me out from those parts of the prison it may here be observed there were many intermediate workings of gods blessed spirit among the felons but more eminently among the condemned malefactors  i hope now to give a short account of gods remarkable working upon the souls of mr holmes and five others four of whom were most rancorous and unforgiving roman catholics the case of mr holmes nearly corresponded with that of john lancaster already treated of in the foregoing relations this man was excellently useful to the others of his fellow sufferers and likewise greatly so to the spectators having no opposition i joyfully embraced the opportunity of visiting these six malefactors and soon gained my point over the two protestants and three of the papists who by force of my arguments rejected further advice from the priest and closed in with salvation by faith alone  here i endeavored to take such methods of conducting myself toward these men as i had usually done with the former happy departed souls and as i had an open door into the cells which ever proved the most beneficial to the then confined prisoners i went from cell to cell being locked in with every individual for a longer or shorter time according to the situation and state of mind of each prisoner and was permitted by the turnkey to retire without any emolument whatever herein the hand of the almighty was quite evident finding mr holmes more lively and active than any of the rest he answered a very useful purpose having a clear sense of forgiveness himself he zealously exerted himself in the means of bringing the rest of his fellow sufferers to a true sense of the necessity of being born again and truly the lord prospered his endeavors so that at every repeated visit i made to them which was very frequent i found the rest of the malefactors either under stronger convictions or just ready to step into the pool for my own part the advice i gave them was principally to make them the more deeply sensible of their lost estate while i was very cautious of daubing them with untempered mortar and hence i always perceived their conversions were more solid real and permanent so that what they had received was truly shown in their conduct a few days before their death i came more particularly home to the point and exhibited to both protestants and papists how absolutely impossible it was for happiness to be obtained either in time or eternity without the clear knowledge of god being reconciled to them through the death and passion of our lord and savior jesus christ together with a sense of their redemption through his blood the forgiveness of their sins none of them appeared to be clear in this point except holmes all the rest still lay at the poolside  here i was struck with the conduct of one of the young roman catholics who notwithstanding all that i could force into his mind would not be reconciled to his prosecutor declaring that he would maintain that obstinate resolution to his last moments i told him if he retained and cherished that dangerous resolution the word of god lay flat against him quoting this passage of scripture if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brothers trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive your trespasses this greatly alarmed his mind so that he became more teachable the night before their execution i desired the inner keeper or turnkey of their respective cells to give them the opportunity of assembling together in one cell to the end they might all pass their last hours in unitedly pouring out their souls in servent and mighty prayer before god this was granted agreeable to my desires i also requested one of the prisoners who had been confined for some years to attend them diligently and read to them he did so and they accordingly began their exercise from out of the prayer book but after spending two hours in that lifeless frame and finding their spirits to be in no wise animated thereby one of the malefactors was moved and said come let us pray extempore and who knows but god will open our mouths they all gladly consented thereto and the lord in his mercy did in compassion to their infirmities not only open their mouths but their hearts too and that in an unusual manner manifesting himself unto them as he does not unto the world so that they wrestled with god in such great fervor of spirit from nine till twelve oclock that each of them was in a profuse bath of sweat then they laid themselves down to rest from twelve till two when every one of them again joined themselves in eager prayer nor did they desist from their happy exercise till the time arrived when they were summoned to chapel i went that morning before daylight and availed myself of the joyful opportunity of getting admittance just before they were let down as they entered the pressyard i saw the happy consequence of their last acts of devotion and solemnity no tongue or pen is able faintly to represent the solemn joy and peace which appeared in each countenance but particularly in the young roman catholics whom i could not prevail upon to forgive his prosecutor to him i chiefly addressed myself saying my dear man how do you find yourself he replied with a pleasant voice and a heavenly countenance find myself why truly sir my soul is so filled with light love and peace that i am the same as if i had nothing beside within me in this rapturous spirit he continued to his latter moments after chapel holmes with the others came down and had their irons struck off he spoke to all about him of the unspeakable love of god to him and assured them that he knew god for christs sake had forgiven him all his sins his words were so very powerful that he drew abundance of tears from the spectators after they were haltered they were put into three carts and sent for execution i went with holmes in the first spending our way to the most advantage upon our arrival at the tree holmes first stood up and lifting his eyes to heaven said lord did not thou die for sinners thou did die for me then turning round to the multitude he prayed extempore so very excellently that it caused hundreds to be in tears round the gallows when prayers were finished by the ordinary all of them agreeable to my request went off the stage of mortality first turning round and putting their faces to each other their hands being tied crying out as in the voice of one man lord jesus receive our spirits  during the spaces of time which intervened between the several executions i frequently preached and exhorted among the felons and debtors in newgate and constantly visited the sick in all parts of the prison which i have sufficient reason to believe was blessed in a great measure to many of their souls as in consequence of those means numbers were prepared to receive the glad tidings of salvation when under sentence of death  some years ago messrs morgan whalley brett and dupree with two more being then under sentence of death were ordered for execution in the late kings reign and notwithstanding they were all conspicuous characters in life yet the highest interest the nation could afford was ineffectual to obtain an exemption from justice especially as their fatal delinquency was the fruit of an intoxicated project  the circumstance was thus they all conjunctly agreed upon a party of pleasure at the election of a certain member for chelmsford essex but after they had glutted themselves with an immoderate regalement they uanimously consented to divert themselves by going out upon the roads and there endeavor to effect a robbery on the first individual that might present himself in their way in the course of these their unrestrained proceedings a certain farmer chanced to pass them who was attacked by these unhappy men and robbed of all his money after this the farmer having met with assistance pursued them all into chelmsford where they were every one secured and were removed by a habeas the next day to london they took their trials were cast received sentence of death and ordered as before mentioned for execution mr brett was the son of an eminent divine in dublin mr whalley a gentleman of a considerable fortune and was possessed of three country seats of his own mr dapree was also the complete gentleman and mr morgan an officer on board one of his majestys ships of war the last of these was frequently visited by lady elizabeth hamilton the duke of hamiltons daughter both before and after sentence i have seldom failed to be present with them at their several interviews in newgate and thereby understood that if this lamentable affair had not taken place the connubials of mr morgan and lady betty were to have been solemnized in a very short time  this lady like the importunate widow set forth in the gospel went daily to his majesty as did also others who had great influence at her request and pleaded with his majesty for the life of mr morgan but at the first his majesty considering it a point of injustice as well as partiality would by no means attend to her plaintive petitions another consideration was that they were all persons of dignity and fortune and could not plead necessity to palliate the enormity of those robberies as many unhappy sufferers could therefore his majesty said his subjects were not to be put in bodily fear and suffer the loss of their property merely through a capricious wanton whim however the morning prior to the execution lady betty hamilton appeared before his majesty and fell upon her knees i suppose in tears too my lady said his majesty there is no end to your importunity i will spare his life upon condition that he be not acquainted therewith till he arrives at the place of execution these documents were with the utmost precision attended to and accordingly mr brett mr whalley and mr dupree were tied up to the gallows the other cart with mr morgan and two other gentlemen followed but the sheriff upon ordering the coach to stop produced the respite sent to mr morgan from his majesty it is hard to express the sudden alarm this made among the numerous multitude and when i turned round and saw one of the prisoners out of the cart with his halter loose falling to the ground he having fainted away at the sudden news i was instantly seized with a great terror as i thought it was a rescue rather than a reprieve but when i beheld mr morgan put into a coach and perceiving that lady betty hamilton was seated therein in order to receive him my fear was at an end and truly i was very well pleased on the occasion  as soon as the coach with mr morgan and the lady had drove off for newgate a venerable gentleman who carried the appearance of a courtier walked up to the first cart and addressing himself to mr dupree in a very christian manner begged him to look steadfastly to god in whose presence he would shortly appear and hoped the mercy his companion received would have no bad effect upon him mr dupree with the most unimaginable calmness and composure of mind said sir i thank god that he is thus reprieved it does not by any means affect me this gave the gentleman much satisfaction now when prayers were ended i addressed each of them in the most awful and striking words i was capable of and which i have great reason to believe were not to little purpose as they all appeared entirely resigned to their fate mr brett the clergymans son displayed the conduct of a gentleman and scholar in a mild spirit he earnestly craved the sincere prayers of the multitude and likewise in his last piece of exhortation he conjured them all to take warning by the untimely end of the three objects of their present attention when they were turned off and the mob nearly dispersed i hastened back to newgate and there seriously conversed with mr morgan who in consequence of the unexpected change was scarcely recovered  in the course of our reciprocal conversation he told me his mind a few minutes previous to and at the arrival of his reprieve was in so happy a state that he could not immediately tell whether life or death was best yet when about six weeks were elapsed it evidently appeared by mr morgans transactions that his majestys gracious act of lenity was clearly worn off his remembrance for one day as i chanced to pay him a visit whereof he was not previously apprised i detected him in playing at cards with and against a mr barrett who was confined upon the supposition of defrauding his creditors this man was apparently totally destitute of the fear or knowledge of god and was also very prejudicial in his behavior to the souls of poor condemned prisoners ever attempting to divert their minds from their attention to that which was truly good likewise setting at naught and exposing to censure and ridicule those who incessantly labored for their eternal benefit but the lord overruled him i then laid before mr morgan the dangerous folly of such proceedings and added if such conduct as that viz playing at cards is oftentimes through point of conscience abolished by men of common sense how much more then ought such empty and souldestroying amusement to be despised by one who had so recently been rescued from death by his majestys great clemency in so conspicuous a manner as he himself had i therefore entreated him to lay the cards aside and never attempt to resume such folly any more by virtue of this remonstrance he became very complaisant and as an obsequious child conforms his behavior to the wishes of his parents just so mr morgan renounced the diversion to which his mind was so strongly inured and in a moments time he marked the line of his conduct with an humble attention to all my sympathising reproofs  the beforementioned mr barrett finding i had taken the attention of mr morgan from off his evil allurements began to abuse me very much and also boasted that it was not in the power of all the world to hurt him that he defied all the judges to bring him in as a culprit upon trial but however shortly after his creditors having a strong suspicion that he had some effects concealed in a chest wherewith he was furnished in newgate obtained a judicial order to search it and found as they had been informed to the amount of l 000 in bank notes cut in halves soon after this his trial came on and he was deemed guilty by the judges he was condemned with mr samuel lee a fine young gentleman for forgery and they were both accordingly ordered for execution mr barrett on the tuesday in smithfield mr lee on the wednesday at tyburn mr barrett refused my company and the service i might have been to him therefore i cannot give my readers any account of him as touching his behavior during his latter moments yet mr lee the morning before his execution was very attentive to instruction and just before he was turned off the stage of life put a letter into my hand which i opened and was deeply affected with the contents thereof it began thus oh eternity eternity eternity who can fathom the depths of eternity the whole body of the letter expressed the devoutest sentiments of his inmost soul his behavior on the passage o and at the place of execution was altogether serious nor did he leave room to doubt of his eternal salvation  i shall next speak of what i heard and knew of mary edmonson who was executed on kenningtoncommon upon the supposition of murdering her aunt at rotherhithe this unfortunate young woman was under close consiement a great length of time the day of her removal arrived she was then conveyed to kingston there to stand trial before judge dennison who some time before tried a mr coleman a brewers clerk for the supposed personal abuse of a young woman and although the opponents of mr coleman labored to persuade this young woman that coleman was the person who treated her in that scandalous manner yet when they were in each others presence she declared he was not the man his enemies still pressed upon this young woman to change her opinion assuring her that he was the offender and as further interrogatories were put to her respecting the circumstances which had been alleged she gave a contradictory answer which seemed to imply that he was the man so the poor guileless prisoner was thereby put into immediate confinement and there secured till his trial came on when he was condemned and executed about three years after this mr colemans innocence was brought to light and that as evident as the noonday sun the carman who drove him to the place of execution having been proved to be the man and that by his own confession he was therefore tried condemned and executed and one mr delagourd who was found perjured in colemans case was sentenced to stand in the pillory opposite st georges church in the borough afterward he with two others who were concerned in the taking away mr colemans life were transported  i return now to mary edmonson who as before observed was tried by judge dennison upon mere circumstances as no positive evidence against her could be produced however i understood that the prisoner suffered very severe and rigorous treatment from the judge because she insisted upon her innocence and integrity the judge still laying the murder to her charge calling her a notorious vile wretch assuring her that she would be d  d if she denied the fact a matters were so evident particularly seeing that her apron and cap were found covered with blood in the copperhole yet as she was condemned on circumstances only and as i attended her to the place of execution i have every reason to believe she was condemned innocent of the charge  now as i was often prevented embracing the opportunities of visiting this woman while in confinement so therefore i entertained no ideas or even the least intentions of seeing her suffer but as i was occasionally passing through the borough i chanced to call on one mr skinner a cheesemonger in that street who earnestly entreated me to attend the unfortunate mary edmonson that being the morning appointed for her execution as he was a man very piously inclined and one who seemed deeply affected about the future state of her soul i therefore complied with his entreaties although i was extremely fatigued by my long journey and as he further observed that the unhapy woman had been brutally dealt with in the course of her imprisonment and also greatly hindered in making her peace with god i immediately considering it a point of my duty set out for kenningtoncommon yet with very slight hopes of coming to the speech of her before she entered into her unchangeable state but the lord has his way in the whirlwind some minutes previous to my arrival at the peacock near the common whereon she was to suffer thomas tollis the executioner espied me in the midst of the mighty concourse and filled with joy and tears hurried through the crowd and said mr told i thank god you are come pray follow me and i will lead you to the room wherein she will shortly be confined and for gods sake speak as closely to her as you can i followed him into the room and after having tarried about the space of half an hour i heard a violent shout of here she comes i then had recourse to the window which looked into the road and there perceived that the turbulent mob were universally combined in giving her a shocking reception with extended mouths throwing out the most vile terrible and blasphemous curses and oaths impossible to be penned or set forth nay too horrible for reflection to dwell on when the prisoner was brought into the room she stood with her back against the wainscot but appeared perfectly resigned to the will of god i then addressed myself to her saying my dear for gods sake for christs sake and for the sake of your own precious soul do not die with a lie in your mouth you are in a few moments to appear in the presence of an holy god who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity o consider what an eternity of misery must be and this will be the certain portion of all who die in their sins therefore if you are guilty openly confess it or if you were in any wise concerned in the murder you are not clear before god if you do not publicly acknowledge your guilt she heard me with much meekness and simplicity but answered that she had already advanced the truth and hoped she might persevere in the same spirit to her last moment mr hammett who was then chief keeper of the newprison borough by order of the sheriff dismissed every person from out of the room and said to me mr told i am sensible of the business upon which you came hither but must beg you will quit the room as no person is permitted to attend her without obtaining the sheriffs consent for that purpose but upon mr hammetts following me out he intimated that the sheriff would grant me permission to attend her in the cart to the place of execution if i deemed it prudent to ask him  the period of her departure for the gallows having arrived i solicited the sheriff to bestow his approbation of my visiting her as soon as possible he then asked me if i was a clergyman i replied no sir are you a dissenting minister i answered no what are you then i informed him that i was one who preached the gospel and could wish to be the means of bringing the prisoner to a confession the sheriff at that bid me lay hold of his horses bridle and told me i should accompany her to the place of execution yet he did not urge me to rush into that dangerous attempt immediately seeing the rioters were so fiercely exasperated against her it was observed to me by the sheriff that a very great satisfaction would be given to the nation in general if i could be instrumental in bringing her to a confession now as we were proceeding on the road the sheriffs horse being close to the cart i looked at her from under the horses bridle and said my dear look to jesus this salutary advice quickened her spirit insomuch that although she did not look about her before yet she then turned herself round to me and joyfully answered sir i bless god i can look to jesus to my comfort this produced a pleasant smile in her countenance which when the sons of violence perceived they d  d her in a shameless manner this was accompanied with a vengeful shout see how bold she is see how the l  h laughs at length we came to the tree where many officers were stationed on horseback besides numbers more on foot furnished with constables slaves when the cart was backed under the gallows a very big and corpulent man as i was in the midst of the hubbub trod on my left foot with such fury and weight that i really thought he had taken it quite off however the sheriff soon cleared the way and formed an arrangement of constables round the cart then directed some of them to put me thereinto in order that i might be of all the service to the malefactor which laid in my power the sheriff himself standing behind the cart the better to avail himself of my discourse with her when she was tied up i began to address her nearly with the same words as i did at the peacock pressing upon her at the same time an acknowledgement of the perpetration in the most solemn manner i was capable of but she declared her innocence in presence of the sheriff i then interrogated her thus did you not commit the fact had you no concern therein was you not interested in the murder she answered i am as clear of the whole affair as i was the day my mother brought me into the world the sheriff on hearing these words shed plenty of tears and said good god it is a second colemans case the circumstance likewise brought tears from many persons who heard her when i was getting out of the cart the executioner put the handkerchief over her eyes but she quickly moved it away and addressing herself to the multitude begged them to pray that god would bring to light when she was departed the cause of the assassination saying that she had no doubt that the prayers of such persons would be heard as she repeated her innocence solemnly declaring that she was as ignorant of the crime for which she was going to suffer as at the day of her birth and added also i do not lay any thing to the charge of my maker he has an undoubted right to take me out of this world as seems him good and although i am clear of this murder yet i have sinned against him in many grievous instances but i bless god he has forgiven me all my sins her kinsman then came up into the cart and would fain have saluted her but she mildly turned her face aside strongly suspecting him to be the assassin having frequenty challenged him therewith at kingston this i believe will shortly appear to the satisfaction of my readers that he was the very man and the sole cause of marys untimely end but first i purpose to finish with mary  after her kinsman was gone out of the cart the executioner a second time was putting the handkerchief over her face which she again turned aside looking at the sheriff and lamenting thus with meekness i think it cruel that none is suffered to pray by me the sheriff then desired me for gods sake to go a second time into the cart and renew my prayers with her which when finished mary began to pray extempore and in a most excellent manner when she had concluded her prayer the executioner performed his part and being turned off her body dropped against my right shoulder nor did she once struggle or move but was as still as if she had hung three hours upon her trial it was represented that she cut all her fingers across on both hands for a deception in order to lay the murder upon some other person but in her defense upon trial she declared that her fingers were not cut by a knife but being alarmed when she entered the house at seeing four men one of whom was in a white frock and also seeing her aunt lay weltering in her own blood she in consequence thereof made somewhat of a startling motion which when the felons perceived they all ran out of doors mary necessarily following them close caught the door with both her hands and called out murder but by their pulling the door very hard her eight fingers were thereby jammed almost off when she was executed i noticed her fingers went immediately and took a door with which i jammed my fingers also and found them to be marked exactly like hers  i now return to the kinsman of mary edmonson who upon the death of his aunt as mary and he were cousins was entitled to l 00 left him by way of legacy and likewise to mary l 00 the kinsman having received his bought himself out of the army as before he had been a foot soldier some time after the execution of his kinswoman he with another man hired a postchaise in the borough to go on a party of pleasure to croydonfair upon their return in the evening mary edmonsons kinsman said to his friend in the chaise as passing kennington gallows there is the place where my kinswoman mary edmonson was hung wrongfully the other struck by the assertion said wrongfully how do you know she was hung wrongfully because replied the kinsman i should have gone in her room his companion after a short conversation and among other questions asked him where was the place of his abode he answered in hedgelane charing cross now when they had put up the chaise the supposed friend of marys kinsman went that moment to justice hammond in the borough who being informed of what had passed granted a warrant to apprehend him he was accordingly apprehended and committed to newgate where at his request i visited him he then desired me to render him all the spiritual assistance i was able but my instructions were lost in the instructions which he received at newgate from his fellow criminals having speedily learnt how to act and also the art of denying the confession he had made to his companion in the chaise notwithstanding he was removed by a habeas from newgate to kingston in surry and when the assizes commenced he was tried before judge dennison who tried his kinswoman mary edmonson but as he so artfully denied the charge the judge frankly acquitted him however he soon went on the highway and committed a robbery and was taken for which he was tried cast and condemned but i have been informed judge dennison to prevent camours got him a reprieve for transportation so that i have never heard of the villain since which is now many years ago  i shall next give an account of mr harris who was reported to be the flying highwayman during his confinement after sentence he was both stupid and hardened inattentive to instruction from the ordinary or myself the morning of his execution when he came out of his cell he behaved as a man deprived of his senses but upon his entering the chapel he became violent so that the rev mr row was terribly affrighted and thereupon ran for his life however i went to him and endeavoring to create a calmness in his temper i solemnly set before him the awful eternity he was just going to enter into yet all the counsel i gave him was as water spilt on the ground nor was the least glimpse of repentance to be seen in his countenance or behavior the others that were sentenced to suffer with him by direction of the sheriffs were ordered into the cart yet the same dullness and stupidity of mind was not removed from mr harris nor did he give the least attention to what was spoke concerning him until we had passed a little beyond hattongarden i then pressed upon him to be silent and still for the space of ten minutes during which to be very cautious of speaking a single word but to be fully observant in keeping the eye of his mind steadfastly fixed upon the everblessed and adorable jesus and to beseech of him the forgiveness of all his sins hanging back his head on the copse of the cart he shut his eyes and was profoundly silent for the said space of ten minutes when upon raising himself up the tears pouring down his cheeks he clapped his hands together and said now i know the lord jesus has forgiven me all my sins and i have nothing to do but to die he then burst into an extempore prayer that the assembled populace might more distinctly hear him on both sides and continued happy to his last moments but solemnly denied the charge of his being the flying highwayman as he never leaped a turnpikegate in his life though it was acknowledged by him that he had committed several highway robberies in his lifetime  the next person of whom i shall give a particular account was one anderson a poor abject laboring man whose character before the following unfortunate affair happened was unimpeachable touching his industry sobriety and honesty this poor man had a wife far gone with child and a daughter about seven years old but was totally destitute of money clothes and a spot where to lay their heads having been by one of their rigid creditors dispossessed of the mean habitation they formerly held and necessitated to lay on the floor in such persons apartments as the goodness of god had actuated with principles of humanity  one morning mr anderson having been a long time without employment said to his wife my dear i have a strong inclination to go down upon the quays it may be the lord will provide for me a loaf of bread or some employment whereby we may sustain ourselves a little longer or else we shall perish with hunger he accordingly went out and that speedily but as the many attempts he had hitherto made were entirely fruitless and finding that all resources had failed a temptation entered into his mind to commence robber in order to raise himself and family from that deepest state of penury and distress he gave way to the temptation and accordingly turned back and went into hoxtonfields where casually meeting two washerwomen who were bringing home their clean linen he without bidding them stop said to one mistress i want money she replied i have only twopence then said he give me that after this exaction of twopence he addressed the other saying you have got money i know you have the woman answered i have but fourpence he exacted that likewise and insensible of what might follow scarce knowing what he did he walked before them into town when they arrived in oldstreet the two women charged him with a constable and both declared that he stopped them in hoxtonfields and formally robbed them of their money he was by reason of this information committed to prison tried and cast at the oldbailey for death with several others who lay a considerable time under sentence before the report was made to his majesty in the interim poor mrs anderson though big with her third child made frequent visits to her husband and through the considerate intervention of some beneficent friends she was enabled to supply him with sufficient food the prison allowance not being more than one pennyworth of bread per day during the many years i attended the prisoners it is scarce within my remembrance to have seen an instance of such meek loving and tender spirits conjugally subsiding as that which appeared so admirably conspicuous in the countenance and deportment of this poor man and his wife indeed they were naturally inclined to few words but the woman frequently seating herself by her husbands side and there throwing her arms around his neck they would shed mutual and sympathetic floods of tears to mitigate the great anguish which at their several interviews regularly overwhelmed their united hearts but it is impossible to do justice to their exquisite sensibility and tender affection when i called all the prisoners into the pessyard room they behaved with the deepest attention nor do i remember to have made them one visit but i ever found their souls to be greatly profited by m exhortations i may further observe this was the case with all the others then under confinement in some measure  mr anderson some time before the death warrant came down was both convinced of sin and also clearly sensible of the remission of his sins the morning of his execution having arrived i attended him a little past six oclock and upon his being let down from his cell found him to be exceedingly happy in his mind telling me he had no doubt of his salvation and that he should shortly be with jesus whom his soul loved and added this is the happiest day i ever saw in my life oh who can express the joy and peace i now feel if i could have all the world i would not wish to live another day notwithstanding the minister churchwardens and overseers with several others of st lukes parish presented various petitions to his majesty on his behalf and though he had received an honorable character from the captain of the man of war whereto he formerly belonged and from which he wa relarly discharged yet when his case was under the consideration of the privy council by a wrong information which they received that he was the anderson who was an audacious highwayman at that time on the roads he was included in the dead warrant  now as i was going in the cart with him to the place of execution well knowing the miserable situation of his wie i enqired of him where she was to be found to which he aswered i can give you no kind of intelligence where seeing she has no place of abode but says on the floor in some poor persons dwellinghouse movin from  the is compelled by necessity therefore i am uncertain where she may be found or heard of i thn sd him where there might be a probability of discovering her residence he told me in lamballey bishopsgatestreet now finding that the lord had strengthened my wishes to assist her i spent therefore three days in grovelling through almost every dirty alley in that neighborhood and after having almost resigned every hope of coming to the knowledge of her then place of abode i at the last received information of her whereby it was ascertained that she dwelt in holywelllane i went there accordingly and found her in a melancholy situation sitting with a poor old woman when looking into the room i saw no other furniture than a piece of an old rug whereon they both laid themselves to sleep the room also was i verily believe more nauseous than the cells of newgate when i had spoken a few words i gave mrs anderson strict directions to call at my house in christophersalley she came but not without much fear imagining i had somewhat to say against her as i was engaged in other employment when she came to my house my wife happened to converse with her and as mrs told always had a very tender heart toward the poor she put two shillings into the poor womans hand bidding her come in and take a dinner in the course of their conversation my wife observed to mrs anderson that i only wanted to do her all the good that was in my power the next night i was appointed to preach at our chapel in oldgravellane where in my discourse i represented to the congregation the unfortunate case of mr anderson who died for six pence being the first crime if criminal which i think not were circumstances considered i also set forth the afflicted and deplorable situation of his wife now although the congregation that evening was but small and those chiefly poor people yet they contributed to her relief six and twenty shillings and by laying her case before others i got as much as clothed her decently as she continued with me i perceived she began to grow near her time i therefore asked her if she could give me an account of the parish she properly belonged to telling her i would get a petition signed by doctor wathen one of the governors of the london lyinginhospital to provide some kind of an asylum for her reception but the poor woman not having any knowledge of her husbands parish i was on that account obliged to commit her as one of the casual poor on the parish of shoreditch doctor wathen informing me she could not be admitted into the london lyinginhospital without a security from the parish to receive the child in case of her death i waited on the principal churchwarden but he being absent i repaired to the dwelling house of the other who ridiculed and abused me in a most scandalous manner indeed although i had already represented to him the lamentable state of mrs anderson assuring him that her life would be lost for want of attention being left entirely destitute of money or clothing the savage replied i suppose it is some woman you have got with child and you want to father it upon the parish for this i paid him a compliment and told him i lived but a few doors from him that my character was well known and that if he choe to inquire thereinto he would in my opinion find himself mistaken he then said in a surly manner then i suppose it is some hanged mans widow or other i quickly took my leave of him assuring him that i should seek no further relief from one whoe unhandsome behavior rendered him incopetent to give any i hastened then immediately to a gentleman of mine own correspondence who maintained a close acquaintance with the upper churchwarden and informed him of the unkind and also ungenteel behavior of the other with the distressed situation o poor mrs anderson now the upper churchwarden who seemed to be of a most excellent polite and benevolent spirit and desired my friend to send her to his apartments the next morning by eight oclock she waited on him accordingly and made herself known he ordered her in and gave her a good breakfast while he signed her petition when he had so done he ordered her to carry it to the under churchwarden to sign it also at whose peril it would be to refuse her seeing the upper churchwarden had previously signed it as soon as her petition was signed she attended at the hospital in aldersgate street and was accordingly admitted where in a few days she was delivered of a fine girl when her month was clapsed my wife received her into our own house with the child and she continued there for many months performing her daily business industriously with all the sobriety and cleanliness imaginable nay with much more than could be expected or desired from a woman in her misery of mind this exertion of her ability was manifested by way of a requital of our former kindnesses some time after her child died and as my wife was able to transact her daily occasions without mrs andersons immediate assistance i did at mrs tolds request procure a housekeepers place for her where she gave great satisfaction and soon became a creditable respected woman i also bound her daughter an apprentice to a weaver and have never seen her since but twice which is some years ago  some time after mr andersons execution i attended mr powell who was cast for forgery he was much of the gentleman as well as a very personable man the only observation i have to make on his behavior is that during his confinement seriousness and devotion were truly conspicuous in him he never feared to instruct his brethren under his unhappy situation so that by his upright walking in the fear of god a solemn awe was laid on the minds of those his fellow sufferers when the day appointed for execution arrived the sheriff indulged him with a coach and bade me get therein that i might dispense my spiritual labor to his invaluable soul i accordingly exerted myself to the utmost in giving him this kind of help and afterward went to the other malefactors who were conveyed in carts and there attended them also imparting similar passages of scriptural assistance to them mr powells mind was staid upon god in so steadfast a manner that after we had sung an hymn and concluded our prayers he closed his eyes and earnestly entreated me to decline my discourse with him in order that he might be the better enabled to meditate on god and an awful eternity at the place of execution they all behaved with that penitence and solemnity naturally expected of men going into an unchangeable state therefore i humbly hope they are all lodged in immanuels breast  in the next place i shall speak of a mr gibson an a y who was sentenced to death for forgery he w an eminnt character in his profession portly and handsome in his person in respect to religious principles he had been very wavering and irresolute ever learning but never coming to the perfect knowledge of the truth sometimes he inclined to the romish church at other times he would conform to the established church of england then he would go to the methodists and sometimes he held with the dissenters of various denominations but i soon became acquainted with his motives for this kind of doctrine hunting viz that it arose from pecuniary views and lucrative desires this i learnt by his own acknowledgement he frequently attended my exhortations with the rest under sentence always expressing much satisfaction thereby i also made him repeated visits to his own room on the masters side where he always readily received me and that with expressions of great pleasure  upon his trial his cause had been referred to the twelve judges after    months confinement he dispatched his wife to one of the judges to know if a determination of his cause was nearly on the carpet the judge answered if mr gibson is in so great a hurry to know this you may acquaint him that his cause has been after mature consideration and weight finally determined and he will not find it altogether satisfactory his wife went back without loss of time and acquainted him with the information given her by the judge yet he still possessed a kind of inattentive carelessness however the ensuing sessions he was summoned to the bar there to plead to his sentence in presence of four judges on the bench permission was granted him to make his own defense and as i was present during the whole time it was a matter of astonishment on my part o hear his learned and rhetorical arguments also the many disputable points of law referred to from various books and acts of parliament indeed i really believe it was the universal opinion of the assembly that he would be immediately cleared as none of the judges were able to confute him at length judge parrot rose from his seat and addressing mr gibson with a lofty air told him and begged he would take notice that his crime had been well considered by the twelve judges and that they had unanimously considered him guilty ag my brethren here present maintain the sa opinions mr gibson on hearing this turned as  as death and was scarcely able to stand he was  committed to his cell and closely confined the  where he soon shook off the rman catholic  and by turns aled t  different fcs who often visited him here i may venture to observe his attention to my exhorations was sers and constant although e was amost incessantly busied with other gentlemen who attended him in his cell drawing up some writing  other to thos whom he or they thought most expient in order to obtain a respite or a pardon from his majesty when the report came down that mr gibson was included in the dead warrant he was shockingly alarmed and began to be more in earnest inquiring of me in an agony of spirit what he must do to be saved i applied thse passages of scripture at first which were the most awakening to his conscience and i believe they were not utterly in vain when i perceived his soul was in extreme anguish and bitterness then and not till then i pointed him to the lamb of god who was ever waiting to be gracious to every returning prodigal i also applied those healing portions of gods most holy word which were most conducive to his present and eternal happiness the awful day came whereon he was appointed to die nor did i perceive any mark or token of a change in his soul on going to the place of execution his mind was greatly agitated as life is precious and eternity awful beyond conception especially when both are so very near yet no one could be more diligent in making serious inquiries of what might be most beneficial to his immortal spirit when we arrived at the fatal spot he turned to me being greatly terrified and said oh mr told i beseech you give me all the assistance you possibly can which through the enlivening guidance of almighty god i was enabled to do and in consequence whereof he appeared to be much more composed and resigned to his fate i hope our lord and savior was propitious to his neverdying soul i endeavored to be equally serviceable to all the rest who were apparently in a better state to leave this world than mr gibson  i shall now speak of a few of the cutters among the weavers three of them i shall mention in particular viz doyle valine and messman the night messman was brought to newgate in order to be settered he discovered me at some distance and approaching me he said mr told i know you very well and added crying i am afraid i shall suffer therefore hoped i would attend him both before and after his trial and give him all the instruction i was capable of i accordingly imparted to him such pieces of instruction as he seemed to stand in the most need of and although he was a man of an undaunted spirit handsome and of a tolerable good understanding yet he was soon brought into subjection to the father of spirits and every visit i afterward paid him he gave fresh evidence of deeper conviction of sin a clearer knowledge of himself his deep fall from god and his lost state his conversion was very singular being quickly changed from darkness to light and from the power of sin and satan unto god which was evidently perceived by all around him before i conclude with mr messman and his calm and peaceable exit i judge it no wise improper but rather necessary to render an exact account of doyle and valine who were executed on bethnalgreen by the decree of government and in the sheriffalty of aldermen townsend and sawbridge  i have but two remarks to make concerning them nor can i represent any thing considerable respecting their attention to things of eternity it is true a few favorable circumstances were manifested in their behavior and at mr doyles request i wrote two or three petitions to his majesty and twice obtained a respite but unfortunately for them an order afterward appeared to send them away for execution here i endeavored to persuade mrs doyle to carry another petition but she replied with ridiculous unconcern there is no occasion for it i am very clear he will not die by what i gathered after this the womans meaning was he would assuredly be rescued by the weavers upon their arrival at bethnalgreen and without doubt these were the secret intentions of the riotous mob as was realized by a watch word which on a sudden was diffused all over the green stones then began to fly from every quarter now as i was with the officiating ordinary in a coach a messenger was dispatched from the sheriff giving my companion in the coach to understand that no time for prayers or devotion would be allotted them neither would there be any occasion for either of us that as soon as the gibbet which was in the cart with them was come to the place appointed they were to be lanched off immediately mr valine greatly terfied begged heartily that one prayer might be offered up to god for them but that not being granted they were turned off in the utmost hurry and confusion  mr messman and others of the cutters were shortly after executed at tyburn but messman apprehensive that the combination of weavers purposed a rescue and he bing very happy in his soul addressed himself when in the cart to the spectators saying with a strong voice gentlemen i humbly entreat you to keep as much silence as is possible we could wish to go to our everlasting home in peace and quietness being happy enough to leave this world without the least desire of living any longer herein nor did we endure any tumult any part of the way or at the place of excution their behavior was all seriousness and devotion for which i have strong hopes that they are at rest from sin and sorrow and become partakers of everlasting glory  i shall next give a brief account of mr bolland a sheriffs officer who had frequently attended the malefactors at tyburn he was condemned for forging an endorsement on the back of a promissory note his character was also in many other instances sadly stained so that the consideration of the latter added to the former offense together with an observation made by one of the judges on the frequency thereof in the mercantile world proved the transaction too weighty to keep him upon sufficient grounds for self vindication otherwise as i had been informed the mere forgery itself would not have been altogether heavy enough to bring him by impartial justice to so awful a situation  when bolland first found that his life was closely pursued he immediately refunded the money yet his prosecutors would by no means deliver up the note he then informed me that his prosecutors exacted of him a second payment of the money and finding his life still in danger he paid that also upon their giving him an indemnification under their hands obliging themselves to cancel the endorsement and as he was persuaded they would act with principles of honor he therefore paid no further attention to their proceedings however they refused at last to efface the indorsement  his trial came on and he was cast and then committed to his cell where he lay a long time but gave very little attention to his spiritual concerns his poor wife took every opportunity to make all the interest she possibly could when the deadwarrant came down and mr bolland included therein he was so engaged in writing petitions etc that he could not neither would he set apart a few moments for the endeavors to secure his soul which gave me great uneasiness i frequently told him how dreadfully dangerous it was to be so anxious concerning his body while his soul was entirely neglected he made many promises but performed very few of them a day or two previous to his execution his wife waited on their majestys at the playhouse where she gave a petition into each of their hands his majesty in consequence of the petition sent for the recorder and told him that he had a great inclination to spare bollands life the recorder replied to his majesty that if he spared his life whose character was truly infamous and baneful he would spare as great a villain as any in the nation it must be observed i speak this only from the information which i received  on the morning of his execution i went early to the cell and labored very much with mr bolland who betrayed a violent agitation of mind when we had entered the chapel he exhibited the most serious attention and was well pleased to hear instruction as he had very little knowledge of the way to eternal life so he was the more intent upon and earnest in searching after those passages of scripture which might furnish him with any hopes of being saved the ordinary myself and other spiritual friends used our utmost endeavors to assist him in that road to eternal life when he was in the cart going to the place of execution he scarcely ceased a single minute in asking me what he must do to be saved and at the crisis of his dissolution he repeated the same i can only leave him to a merciful redeemer hoping he is safely lodged in the arms of his love  the next of whom i would speak was a young gentleman mr slocomb who was executed for defrauding his father of l 00 in the stock of the southseahouse much of the gentleman and scholar was evident in the behavior of this youth upon his fathers coming up to london to receive his interestmoney he was informed that his son brought his draft for l 00 which money he received and the sum debited to his fathers account mr slocomb senior declared he never gave his son any such draft and therefore insisted upon the receipt of his whole interest the gentlemen at the office perceiving the young mans life in danger acquainted his father of the circumstances telling him also if he would not abide the loss they must be under the necessity of apprehending his son who would most assuredly suffer death the father would by no means suffer the loss accordingly the youth was apprehended he was afterward brought upon his trial where he was condemned and received sentence of death the lump of adamant his father then retired to his own country nor would he after that see or hear from his son neither did he once write to him or give him any kind of advice or remit him any degree of relief notwithstanding he lay a long time under sentence before he was ordered for execution something remarkably amiable i perceived in his conduct viz in the first place an entire resignation to the will of god which kept down every murmuring thought and entirely prevented his making any complaint against the severity of his father who deviated so cruelly from paternal duty  and secondly in his behavior during his confinement this also was admirable he being filled with perfect seriousness and devotion occasioned i may venture to say by the close attention he duly gave to my instruction and repeated exhortations in short he never neglected to attend on the means of grace at every opportunity mr powell a fine young gentleman who was sentenced at the same time for forgery became a companion of mr slocombs they constantly conversed together about the awful things of eternity and were both truly instructive to other malefactors they were both much lamented by all who knew them even the most distant of their acquaintance as their whole demeanor was grounded on the basis of godliness they on the awful hour mutually exhibited so excellent a measure of that happy spirit that i am firmly persuaded in my mind those who closely examined their conduct when on the brink of eternity could entertain no doubt of their eternal acceptance with god  the next account which i shall give is that of mary pyner who was sentenced to death for setting fire to her masters house at the same time three or four men were cast for death with whom mary endeavored to contract a very wanton intercourse but they appeared to be on their important guard every moment of their confinement behaving with much penitence and contrition of spirit therefore the enemy of their souls could not inject his fatal poison into the minds of those by the means of marys ungovernable folly i strove to make this young woman the greatest and first object of my visit but experienced various repulses from herself as well as others i was grieved to behold this heedlessness in her conduct especially as the deadwarrant had just arrived wherein she was included however at length i took her aside into the pressyardroom and said to her mary how is it that you in particular above all the other malefactors are so regardless about your precious and immortal soul do not you very well know that gods allseeing eye penetrates your rude behavior toward the men are you not afraid of going to hell seeing you are in a short time to appear before the great jehovah against whom you are now sinning with an high hand are you determined to destroy your own soul your everlasting happiness and your all what are you in love with eternal perdition and gods wrath that you so madly pursue it and do you long to be involved in the bottomless pit and the lake that burns with fire and brimstone which will never be quenched oh remember if you die in your present condition you will die eternally under the wrath of an offended savior and all these miseries attended with greater plagues will be your portion for ever mary lent a particular and calm attention to what i said concerning her and replied mr told i have had some knowledge of you having many times heard you preach at weststreet chapel at this i was greatly astonished and asked her what could be her reasons when she had heard the gospel preached to be guilty of so heinous a crime as setting fire to her masters house and afterward to rob him of his property she answered the devil was too powerful for her in the temptation now i perceived that a change in her countenance and behavior commenced from that moment nor did i hear one unbecoming expression or observe an indiscreet action to her last moment and as her time was short in this transitory world i was the more intent on her future happiness  the night prior to her execution i importunately besought her to spend every moment in wrestling mightily with god for pardon through his dearly beloved son that for his sake all her sins might be blotted out as a cloud and her manifold transgressions as a thick cloud to which she answered god being my helper i am determined not to close my eyes the whole night similar advice i gave to all the rest of the malefactors one of whom espoused the like resolution i then desired the inner keepers to lock them all up in one cell that they might pour out their joint supplications to the awful and tremendous judge of quick and dead in whose presence they must all unavoidably appear in a few fleeting moments this was readily granted so they accordingly devoted that night to an inexpressible advantage by praying singing hymns and rejoicing the lord god himself being evidently in the midst of them when i returned to them the next morning and after having received this soulreviving information i begged the keepers to unlock the cells and lead them down into the pressyard the first that came out was mary pyner i was struck with joy and delight when i beheld the happy change in her countenance as she came out of the cell door which led into the pressyard she appeared to be filled with the peace and love of god when clapping her hands together with pleasant energy she gave a triumphant shout with these words this night god for christs sake has forgiven me all my sins i know that i have passed from death unto life and by twelve oclock i shall be with my redeemer in the world of glory when the service and sacrament was concluded they all came down from chapel and were ordered into the pressyardroom where i continued praying for and exhorting them all nearly the space of forty minutes when directions were given to bring them out and place them in two carts mary pyner accompanied by two other malefactors and myself went in the first cart while we were on our passage to the place of execution i frequently exhorted them to keep the eye of their mind steadfastly looking up to jesus using many repetitions of some passages of scripture which i considered best adapted to their awful situation here i am strongly persuaded my labor was not in vain particularly so in the soul of mary who abided in the happy spirit of faith singing praising and giving glory to god without intermission from the moment i addressed them till they arrived at the tree mary then accosted one of her companions in suffering who cried vehemently and in great anguish of soul saying lord jesus forgive me my sins god be merciful to me a sinner and she said to him do you believe jesus christ died for you he replied truly i do then said mary there is no room left for a doubt of your salvation this produced a glorious revival of his spirit which continued with him till his last breath  when the cart was put under the gallows mary was the first that bore the rope as soon as this was done she turned round to an innumerable assembly of people on both sides saying good people i doubt not that many of you are greatly affected at beholding so young a creature as i am brought to this unhappy and shameful end but oh i am as happy as i can bear to be having full assurance that i shall live with him who died for me and there commence an everlasting banquet of greater happiness at his right hand in the region of endless pa adise she then began to strengthen her fellow sufferers beseeching them not to doubt of the readiness of god to save them i rejoiced in hope that they all received that great salvation purchased by the blood of the everlasting covenant when duty was closed they were all turned off crying for mercy of the lord jesus christ amen  i shall now give a plain simple relation of the unfortunate mrs brownrigg in order to furnish my readers with a view of her disquietudes and her shocking situation during her imprisonment the rt hon the lord mayor having been pleased to favor me with an order to mr akerman the keeper of newgate for granting me permission to attend her while confined therein for the cruel and wilful murder of her apprentice girl mary clifford september  th       i went there accordingly on the evening subsequent to the above direction and was conducted to the room where mrs brownrigg was sitting on her bedside accompanied by a poor woman i addressed her in the most awful and striking manner i was capable of and withal told her that i came by order of the lord mayor and in the name of the lord jesus christ therefore observed if she would accept of my services as a spiritual visitor i should consider it as my duty to speak my mind on this occasion as fully and closely as possible especially as i had heard very dreadful accounts of her conduct she replied mr told i am very glad to see you and shall not esteem you my friend if you do not deal with plainness toward me and speak as home and close as you can happy was i to hear her speak thus and said to her mrs brownrigg you are in an awful situation before man but more especially before the almighty god your most secret sins are within his immediate view so that you can hide nothing from his allseeing eye your character also in the eye of the world is rendered loathed and horrible as you are charged with crimes of the deepest dye to many of which i can scarcely allow any degree of credibility however matters appear too evident in regard to the fact for which you are convicted i likewise told her i very much feared she had but little mercy upon her late fellow creature that she had cruelly used the deceased repeatedly and for some length of time her answer was i acknowledge this accusation so far as to have given the girl repeated corrections but no farther my intentions being directly opposite to any kind of violence i then observed to her that i did not believe she was stimulated by so fierce a spirit of anger as to be driven to the immediate perpetration of murder but i added also what were your ideas of the dreadful consequences which must issue from such shocking acts of cruelty too shocking to nature she replied sir if i had any consideration of the danger thereof i could not have done the deed the devil reigned with a fatal mastery over me i then told her the word of god expressly declares whosoever sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed therefore i had no doubt that her life would go for the life of the poor child she replied i have no doubt of it neither here i began to address her with a more pointed conversation and said to her if you are thus conscious of your guilt there is no time to lose immediately then lay your dreadful case before god under a deep sense of the sin you have committed and not for that only but for all and every of your actual sins from the earliest period of your life to the present moment or you can have no just hopes of mercy at the hand of god through the merits of a crucified redeemer as we are confidently assured he came into the world to save us from our sins not in them therefore i continued to insist upon it unless she humbled herself under the mighty hand of god by a heartfelt repentance and an open acknowledgement of those flagrant crimes she had been guilty of no favor could be afforded to her unhappy soul by the hand of god in the day of judgment nor would she consequently have peace of mind while on earth this said mrs brownrigg i firmly believe i then further added that i did not come to extort any confession from her and begged she would confess nothing to me but i observed to her you will in a few days be brought upon your trial when you will not only be in the presence of the judge and jury but also in the more immediate presence of the allseeing god and witnesses will be called for to give evidence against you then more especially will be the time when it behooves you to speak the truth and i charge you therefore at the peril of your soul not to advance any thing against the dictates of your own conscience in covering your crimes the guilt of which you know before god you are not exempt from but i pray you adhere firmly to the truth should death be the consequence she replied i intend it i again advised her to reject as much as possibly she could the suggestions of the enemy in covering her crimes but to be frankly ingenuous in the acknowledgement thereof before proper magistrates i then closed my first visit with prayer after having given her agreeable to her solicitations all the spiritual assistance within the limits of my capacity when finished i parted with her and the next day being sunday i visited her again about twelve oclock asking her how she found herself as i perceived her spirits to be greatly depressed she replied mr told since you was with me yesterday i have deeply weighed your kind instructions which has occasioned great uneasiness and distress in my mind and notwithstanding i was somewhat easy and composed at certain periods before i am alas quite otherwise now for i am horribly afraid my grievous sins have been set in array before me and i am dreadfully intimidated and fearful lest god should never show me his mercy i told her i was happier with this report and much more satisfied with her present state than at my former visit as i then perceived some hopes of her unhappy state as her condition was because her conscience was now convinced of her crime i applied at this time many threatening as well as healing passages of scripture to her conscience which she very willingly and with much thankfulness received i concluded this visit also with prayer and then parted upon my third visit which was on monday i found her in a very bad and dangerous spirit here i exerted my every faculty in order to settle her mind and strengthen her confidence in god but to my sorrowful disappointment i observed the enemy had so buffetted her soul that she strongly endeavored to conceal her guilt telling me with bitterness of spirit she never intended murder and that she was assured the rigid partial jury who sat upon the body of the deceased would through their envonomed prejudice treat her with a degree of rigor and severity much heavier than her deserts this she spoke with much warmth  i then told her this perverseness of spirit also her present temper and disposition of mind would prove exceedingly hurtful to her precious neverdying soul and that it betrayed in her an absolute blindness and hardness of heart so that no signs of repentance appeared or the least concern for such repeated acts of violence i likewise gave her to understand that i considered it a grand point of my duty to defend the characters of those gentlemen who were on the coroners inquest adding can you mrs brownrigg entertain a thought that those gentlemen who are under an oath and in no wise interested in giving false evidence against you would endeavor to take away your life without substantial reasons and good grounds in their evidence i insisted upon her laying aside all such vain pretenses which were the mere artifices of the devil to destroy her soul telling her withal if she would stand open to conviction and behave in her short moments as became one who was thus confined to a few hours only for the working out her salvation with fear and trembling probably god would show her favor at the last and the blood of jesus christ which speaks better things than the blood of abel would wash away the stain of that blood she had so cruelly and unrestrainedly shed i likewise pointed out to her the loving spirit of a dying savior who when he was expiring on the accursed tree for mans redemption prayed with his last breath saying father forgive them for they know not what they do his prayer was heard and answered when peter was preaching to a great number of them they were cut to the heart and cried out in an agony of spirit men and brethren what must we do to be saved peter answered them repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all those that are afar off even to as many as the lord our god shall call therefore i observed if the mercy of god extended itself to the very murderers of his only begotten son there can be no doubt that it will reach your poor guilty conscience also if you like them are pricked at the heart and cry earnestly to god for mercy through the son of his love you likewise shall obtain the remission of your sins and your name shall be written in the lambs book of life then you shall sing the new song to god and the lamb who has redeemed us with his blood and saves the vilest and chief of sinners these with many similar exhortations having been given her she began to recover her former composedness of spirit never more attempting to justify herself or even to extenuate her guilt i terminated this visit with fervency of prayer also and had not an opportunity of seeing her again until the day prior to the awful day of her exit  on the   th of september being the lords day i came to newgate about twelve oclock and met her as she was coming down stairs from the chapel the keepers informed me of the strict orders they had received to lock her up immediately in her cell and desired me to be particularly vigilant in my remarks on her behavior mrs brownrigg then went into her cell and i followed her thereinto and at her request the turnkey and woman who attended her were both dismissed the cell doors were then locked and bolted upon us when she began to express the extreme anguish of her soul saying mr told god for ever bless you sit down by me when we were seated she began to wring her hands in vehement agitation of spirit praying most earnestly that god for christs sake would have mercy upon her poor guilty soul expressing herself with floods of tears to this effect o lord jesus wash away the guilt of the blood which i have shed in thy most precious blood o lord i am the vilest and chief of sinners be gracious be merciful to me o heavenly jesus for none such a sinner as myself ever existed o save save and deliver from eternal burnings my poor guilty wretched and helldeserving soul oh lord what must i do to be saved gracious god what must i do now heavenly jesus cleanse thou my stains or i am undone for ever thus she continued for some minutes and then turned to me and said mr told what must i do my soul is in bitterness and heavy distress she added also i wrestled all the last night with god in prayer except the space of an hour during which i soundly slept and had very many comfortable visits from the lord during my interval of sleep i dreamed a dream in which i beheld a man coming toward me with a glass of wine in his hand who bade me drink it i took particular notice of the wine that it was red so that when i awoke i was much refreshed but all my comforts are gone again therefore i am now more distressed than ever  i replied mrs brownrigg i am afraid you do not sufficiently permit the spirit of god to convince you of the enormity of the crime for which you are condemned are you condemned in your own conscience do you judge yourself that you may not be judged of god condemn yourself that you may not be condemned in the day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts will be open to god angels and men do you call to remembrance the sins of your whole life and are you fully convinced that you deserve to be punished eternally for your impiety and transgression she replied i do then said i if it be so you are not far from the kingdom of god wringing her hands in an agony of spirit she said oh that i may know this oh that i may be assured of this great god enable me to depend on this she continued to use several repetitions hereof i then asked her whether she was never tempted to destroy herself she answered mr told i am glad you have asked me this question and i will answer it without reserve beginning the relation she said when i was first taken at wandsworth the constable compelled my landlady to search my pockets to know whether i had a knife or any other instrument whereby i might have committed the shocking act of suicide i was searched accordingly and although i had a knife secreted yet it was not found this threw me into a violent temptation so that i cut a little hole about the bigness of a silver groat in the peek of these my stays showing me the place herein continued she i put the knife it being a clasped one i conveyed it round my hip through the covering of my stays she then presented to me the very place where it lay undiscovered during her confinement in the poultry compter after that she added now as i have advanced thus far i should be to blame were i to be so very disingenuous as to conceal the rest therefore i shall acknowledge to you mr told that many times i used to consider where and on what part of my body it would be the most expedient to stab myself that by so doing i might effect the business at once yet the lord in his infinite mercy led me safe through this temptation  i then asked her if she had ever seriously considered the consequence of so rash an attempt and what would have become of her soul if she had died in an act of selfmurder seeing it would be utterly impossible for her to be saved not having time for repentance she answered i never was inclined to think on or consider any thing of that nature for the consideration of that shame ignominy and reproach that are always consequent on tyburn executions suppressed every other serious and calm idea whereon my contemplations should have rationally dwelt i told her i had a few questions more to ask her and begged she would return me the plain simple truth so that her veracity might be unsullied and spotless she replied mr told i can open my heart to you like as to myself ask what you judge proper and i will by openness and simplicity endeavor to afford you satisfaction i then informed her it was currently reported and well nigh in every ones mouth that in the course of her practice in midwifry she had been guilty of destroying several children in the birth and feeding her swine with them i added is this true or not she replied i was asked the same question some time ago by an eminent physician but truly mr told i never had any misfortune during the time of my practice except with three and i now desire you to take down in writing the names of those three gentlewomen i then laid and they will give you a satisfactory account viz whether the fault lay at my door or not as they were all three brought into the world putrified i have had said she as good success in general as most women in my calling and was equally esteemed by my employers neither were they ever so wonderfully astonished as at the time this unfortunate affair came to light the names of the three gentlewomen who had the dead children were mrs gore at camberwell mrs flude at the workhouse in grubstreet and mrs  at the bellinn holborn  the second question i asked her arose from an information i had received touching her secret transactions with seventeen apprentice girls whom she had at several times acquired from various parishes in and about london as it was said that when she was requested to give an account of them she could produce but three i demanded is this true or not to which she answered i never in my life had more than three apprentices viz the deceased the evidence and one that is gone back to the foundlinghospital  thirdly i asked her if she could say in the presence of almighty god that she never practiced any of those cruelties before her answer to this was i never did i asked her again what could induce her to commit so dreadful an act of barbarity now she said i can give you very substantial reasons for so doing pray said i what may they be she replied about ten years ago when i had six small children about me i walked closely in the ways of god never being able to accuse myself of negligence or inattention rising at five oclock in the morning and being at bow churchyard in cheaple at six oclock prayers then mr told i was very happy in my god who manifested himself to me so that i walked steadfastly in the light of his blessed countenance for a considerable time but oh unhappily for me i grew slack in my duty forsook my god and he forsook me so that i fell into the spirit of pride and anger then by degrees into the crime for which i am to die i can give you mr told no other reason but i beg you will help my distressed soul all that you can i replied i humbly hope god will be your helper protector and defender as i still hoped that she had not committed the unpardonable sin against the holy ghost i trusted there was yet room for mercy therefore i pressed upon her to understand that christ himself declared that every other sin of what nature or kind soever shall be forgiven unto men upon tree repentance and deep humiliation under a sense of guilt before god here i strongly exhorted her to come to the throne of grace and to trust fully in the blood of the everlasting covenant and that god for christs sake would upon no consideration reject or cast out those who came to him through the son of his love but would blot out all their iniquities as a cloud and their transgressions as a thick cloud and that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself i also told her that the lord jesus even while he hung upon the accursed tree bore all and every one of our sins on his own body saying it is finished having made a full sufficient sacrifice oblation and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world and for here is and mine in particular i also begged her to observe that we were not damned so much for particular or weighty crimes committed but for not believing in our inmost souls the great truths of the gospel which speaks in this manner god sent his son into the world not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved  again i informed her that when the lord jesus sent forth his twelve disciples he gave them this command go ye into all the world preach the gospel to every creature by the gospel you are to understand said i the glad tidings of salvation through a crucified redeemer whosoever therefore believes and is baptized shall be saved but he that believes not shall be damned my dear woman added i venture your all in time and eternity on this great savior of the world and then though your sins should be as scarlet god will make them white as snow and although they be as crimson they shall be as wool you see then that gods thoughts toward us are not as our thoughts toward him and one another see then that you lay fast hold on this hope of eternal life set before you and though you will assuredly tomorrow before this time pay the debt of your natural life for the life you have destroyed yet be of good comfort the son of god has given body for body and soul for soul that we may be made partakers of eternal life and be for ever where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary spirits are at rest thus i continued to press the doctrines of salvation by faith with weight upon her conscience and found my labor was not in vain in the lord she then began to be much comforted telling me before we parted she found she could now trust body and soul in the hands of her dear unerring savior her countenance was much altered and that languid gloom which rested upon her at our first entrance into the cell i easily perceived to terminate in pleasant serenity composure of mind and resignation of spirit was expressed strongly in all her looks i then went to prayer and parted with her for this time commending her into the hands of a merciful redeemer  monday the   th instant being the day of her execution i repaired to newgate about a quarter past six oclock in the morning where i found mrs brownrigg with the rev mr moor the ordinary in the pressyardroom we went immediately up to chapel endeavoring to comfort her in the best manner we could and found her spirit fully prepared to receive instruction her mind greatly composed and her heart filled with prayer when we came to chapel we tarried some time before prayers began in the course of which interim the turnkey had introduced mr brownrigg and their son they addressed each other in a very striking manner then the ordinary prayed extempore with them after which we sang an hymn he then exhorted and prayed again when he had done he desired me to pray i did so and we sang another hymn very applicable to the dying malefactors case now when we were ready to communicate the others were admitted up to chapel among whom were three clergymen who joined us in the sacred supper of our lord and truly a blessed time it was especially with the malefactor her husband and son at the close of which solemnity it was considered prudent to dismiss every person from the chapel in order to give them the fairer opportunity of taking their last farewell of one another so we all retired accordingly but i had not reached the bottom of the steps before the keeper beckoned to me saying mrs brownrigg desired to speak a few words with me i speedily returned to her upon which she said mr told we want you to employ a little more of your time with us pray give my husband and son a word of advice i did so agreeable to her desires and imparted i may venture to say no small share of instruction for which they all returned me many thanks i then addressed myself to mrs brownrigg as she was in the spirit of prayer while i was speaking to her the son fell down on both his knees and bursting into a flood of tears with his head against his mothers side said i beseech you my dear mother lay both your hands upon my head and bless me she replied i hope god will bless my dear son almost frantic he added my dear mother put both your hands upon my head and bless me yourself his mother then put both her hands upon his head saying my blessing be upon thee my dear child the husband then fell down on both his knees on the other side saying the lord bless you god be with you my dear wife being scarce able to speak for weeping he assured her that all the care that was possible should be taken of her offspring that they might be trained up to serve god they then parted when the keeper and myself led her down stairs as she was through extreme debility unable to walk alone and carried her into the pressyardroom the sheriff not having arrived we caught another opportunity of being useful to her applying our short time to the most advantage a clergyman belonging to st pauls was likewise of excellent service giving her without any narrowness of heart good and wholesome advice the lord reward him sevenfold in his own bosom the time came when mrs brownrigg was ordered into the cart when the rev mr james and myself stationed ourselves by each side of her mr james on the right hand and myself on the left when we had fixed ourselves i perceived the whole powers of darkness were ready to give her a reception beckoning to the multitude i desired them to pray for her at which they were rather silent until the cart began to move then they triumphed over her with three huzzas this was followed by a combination of hellish curses when we had passed through the gate carts were placed on each side of the street filled principally with women here i may say with the greatest truth nothing could have equalled them but the damned spirits let loose from the infernal pit and to be brief this was the spirit of the wicked multitude entirely to the place of execution and notwithstanding her crime was horrible yet god in his infinite wisdom and mercy supported her mind seeing her time was short so that she never made one complaint of such treatment neither did she drop one murmuring expression from her lips in any part of her passage i repeatedly asked her if the dreadful tumult did not draw the attention of her mind from off the lord jesus she replied not in the least i bless god then some of the common cries from the thoughtless concourse accompanied with dreadful imprecations were pull her hat off pull off her hat that we may see the b  s face however i withstood this cutting clamor all the way till we came to the place of execution and that for two reasons first i was conscious it would too much expose her to the censure of the inexorable mob and which was abundantly worse it would discompose her mind and hinder her meditating with god the second consideration was that as the incensed mob thought it not enough to rejoice over her by common rage and defamatory abuse but were altogether cruel to cast stones dirt etc therefore if i through endeavoring to pacify them by virtue of a friendly address should on the contrary excite their madness and exasperation they would not only disturb her mind but endanger her life before the law had executed its office i must observe here i never in the course of my life beheld so much the absolute necessity which all ministers of the gospel of every denomination amongst us lay under in plucking those brands out of the jaws of eternal death and destruction or a dreadful account will be one day given by such preachers when we came to the place of execution the outcries of the mob were not so violent yet notwithstanding when she was tied up to the fatal tree and exposed to god angels and men an awful spectacle little or no compassion was drawn from the hearts of the populace for the behavior of thousands was such as i am persuaded no part of the habitable world would be guilty of except the inhabitants of great britain immediately after the executioner had tied her up i discovered an horrible dread in her countenance fearing that some violent temptation had assaulted her i begged to know the cause of her being so distressed she said mr told i have many times passed by this place and always experienced when near this spot of ground a dreadful horror seized me for fear that one day or other i should come to be hanged this said she enters afresh upon my mind and greatly terrifies me i said your mind all the way was very composed and repeatedly you told me you could put your full trust and confidence in your blessed redeemer and that you had no doubt but that you should be happy with him dont you find it so still she replied i still retain my confidence but this powerfully occurs to my mind of what i frequently imagined whenever i past this piece of ground and therefore i am terrified exceedingly i then told her it was by no means a point of her business or duty to pay any attention to that but her whole entire duty and attention was to look steadfastly to the lord jesus and that would be sufficient to subdue every other opposition and enable her to resign her spirit into the hands of almighty god some time before she was turned off the rev mr moor came into the cart spoke to her and prayed with her we sang two hymns and continued to exhort her for threequarters of an hour she was very devout crying vehemently for mercy just as the cart was ready to draw off the ministers all having gone out i turned to her and advised her in her last moment to keep her mind steadfastly fixed upon christ she said i hope i shall the cart then drew off and i humbly trust god has received her departed spirit amen  thus christian reader concludes the narrative of the life of mr silas told written by himself some time before his departure from this vale of tears after having passed through a troublesome and laborious life with great fortitude and patience being continually anxious for the good of his fellow creatures particularly the condemned malefactors in the several prisons in and about the metropolis striving ardently by all the means in his power to promote their everlasting welfare submitting meekly for christs sake to the ill treatment which he too often experienced not only from prisoners and keepers etc but even to reproach and censure from those who ought rather to have encouraged and applauded him after having done all the good in his power he cheerfully resigned his soul into the hands of his heavenly father in december      in the   th year of his age and has no doubt received this blessed welcome well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of thy lord  finis
