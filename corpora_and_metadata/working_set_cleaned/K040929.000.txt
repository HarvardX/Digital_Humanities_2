mr maitlands account of inoculating the small pox vindicated from dr wagstaffes misrepresentations of that practice with some remarks on mr masseys sermon  the second edition  to which is added his first account of inoculating the small pox  london printed and sold by j peele at locks head in paternosterrow       to the honored sir hans sloan bart president of the college of physicians etc permit me honored sir to inscribe these few sheets to you they are written in vindication of the practice of inoculating the small pox  your known candor and experience encourage me to submit them to your censure with regard not only to the safety of the method but likewise to the truth of the facts here contested i am under great and many obligations  honored sir your most obedient humble servant charles maitland  mr maitlands account of inoculating the small pox vindicated etc i am very sensible of the respect that is due to the profession and character of the author of the letter against inoculating the small pox but am no less sensible of the obligation i lie under to vindicate my own reputation which a violent fit of sickness has hitherto hindered me from doing and i can do it with the more freedom because i am conscious to my self that i began this practice in england with the same view to the public good with which i hope the learned author condemns it i must take the liberty to say that allowing the doctors abilities to be as great as possible in his own profession he seems not quite so well qualified to write upon this subject because of the narrowness of his experience as far as appears by his letter and his partial credulity or incredulity in matters of fact which he takes from others and lastly because of strong prejudices which impose upon his most excellent understanding and draw him into reasonings which either are inconsequential or conclude strongly for the practice of inoculation which they are brought to overturn all these i believe will appear very plain to any impartial reader in the following animadversions in which i will endeavor to be as short as the subject will allow  the letter pretends to be an admonition to physicians not to meddle in this practice of inoculation till they are better ascertained by experience of the success of it at the same time it is a most warm dissuasive not only to physicians but to all sorts of people not to practice it at all and consequently to deprive them of all possibility of coming by experience would it not found somewhat absurd if any one should say to a young physician pray sir dont practice till you have experience but it is still more so in this case because in a practice that is entirely to be laid aside you can neither have the benefit of your own nor other peoples experience  as to physicians meddling with this practice of inoculation i can only say it may favor too much of novelty to be bigotly zealous for it and too much of a facultyinterest to be so violent against it physicians cannot ingraft people against their own or their parents consent and a physician would be out of his duty who should persuade them to it contrary to their inclinations on the other hand if a person from the experience of the fatality of the small pox in general or in his own family in particular should resolve to ingraft his child any physician who should dissuade him from it might in a great measure be chargeable with the fatal consequences of the neglect of a method which the parent had proposed as the only moans to save his childs life and he would be still as much to blame if when the parent had resolved to ingraft his child he should refuse to attend him it is very common with parents not only to leave their children in houses infected with the small pox but to bring them into the room where their brethren or sisters lie ill of them and a parent who does so conveys the infection to his child as deliberately and according to the doctor certainly more than he who orders him to be inoculated would it not then be equally impertinent in the physician to deny his attendance in either case  i must put the doctor in mind that there are very few of the most useful discoveries in physic that have not been strenuously opposed by many of the faculty upon their first appearance there is extant a decree of the college of physicians at paris against the use of antimonial vomits it were easy to assign many instances of the like nature  as the doctor is surpised that an experiment practiced only by a few ignorant women amongst an illiterate and unthinking people should on a sudden and upon a slender experience so far obtain in one of the politest nations in the world as to be received into the royal palace i hope he has not forgot that the practice of curing intermitting fevers by the bark was introduced of a sudden by a barbarous indian if not into the royal family into the family of a viceroy and thence transmitted to us  page   the blood of the english if we speak of it as national is the product of the richest diet etc ergo to bring em to a spare diet before they have the small pox must be extremely dangerous and hurtful this must be the doctors conclusion mine i own would be the direct contradictory if the inflammatory state of the blood arising from the richness of the diet makes the small pox in england very mortal that practice which either takes the advantage of a contrary state of the blood or by a spare diet introduces it must be beneficial  page   the finest the most volatile and indeed insensible particles of the animal juices are the most penetrating and consequently the most contagious and for the same reason the most noxious does it follow therefore to convey the infection by the grosser and sensible parts must be extremely unfit and dangerous i confess i should have inferred the contrary  the symptoms are more or less and the distemper appears in a greater or a less degree according to the state of the blood at the time of infection therefore the practice of inoculation is highly to be encouraged because it either finds or puts the blood into a good state before the infection seems to be a more natural conclusion than the contrary one  page  0 if we could be assured that the distemper would not be equally uncertain by inoculation according to the nature of the injected matter or the disposition of the fluids in the person who receives it so that it would constantly prove of the mildest kind inoculation would no doubt be a very rational and useful practice the doctor surely will not affirm that a person inoculated is equally uncertain of the circumstances mentioned with one who catches the small pox by the common way of infection first he may be assured if the inoculation takes place of the time when he shall have the small pox secondly that he has not the infection by the insensible particles which the doctor owns to be the most contagious or which is near the same thing convey the contagion the strongest thirdly he may be as sure as his operator is careful that he is infected by a favorable kind and fourthly he may be much more sure of the disposition of his fluids than a person who catches them by chance after a surfeit or a debauch and after all this he may be assured if he has not absolute certainty which i believe one has hardly in bloodletting that he has a much greater probability to escape which is sufficient ground for human prudence to act upon if the doctor will deny those things i think it is folly to reason upon this subject any longer and if as the doctor says inoculation may be a more uncertain method to give the contagion than that which nature has pursued it may be notwithstanding that much more safe  page    the very choice that is made of a thick purulent matter to intermix immediately with the blood seems a little repugnant to our reason since we know that the particles have such a different contexture and such different powers to attract it may proceed from my ignorance or dullness but i confess i do not easily apprehend the meaning of this sentence whether by the particles he means the particles of purulent matter or the particles of blood or whether the particles of purulent matter have different attractive powers from those of the blood is not obvious from the construction of the sentence i choose rather to understand him in the last sense because he has afterward very sagaciously discovered that the blended particles of blood with blood may in all reason be thought more likely to unite and less liable to raise commotions but it happens unluckily in the case of inoculation the design is to raise a commotion and the purulent matter for the reason mentioned by him is fittest for that purpose and his observation that purging medicines injected into the blood will purge does not prove that the pus of the small pox mixed with the blood may not raise the small pox what he says in this paragraph as likewise in the following concerning the experiment of the mangey dog proves that pus is a more proper vehicle to convey infection than blood i cannot find any more in it  page    it never came into the heads of the practitioners abovementioned to raise distempers by art in a human body then i will be bold to say it never came into their heads to practice physic which considered in a true light is founded upon that single principle of curing natural by raising artificial diseases what is bleeding but an artificial haemorrhagy purging but raising an artificial diarrhaea does the vomiting produced by a surfeit and that procured by a medicine differ so much as that the one must be called a disease and the other not are not blisters issues and setons artificial  imposthumations i hope he has not forgot the of his great master hippocrates the wounds and amputations of surgeons differ only from accidental ones by the manner and intention morbus est ille corporis status qui functiones animales laedit and it may be likewise observed that physicians produce those diseases in their patients often by way of prevention as well as cure and in this they do nothing but imitate nature which often attempts the cure of one disease by another  page    his next argument is taken from the fatal consequences of this very matter it self returning into the blood in the very height of the small pox where there seldom is a full and sufficient discharge by the skin etc one would imagine that the natural inference from this would be to the advantage of inoculation for if there are terrible symptoms which arise from want of a sufficient discharge of the purulent matter in the small pox inoculation which provides for such a discharge by artificial outlets must needs be useful and seems more proper than the blisters which the physicians apply on that occasion as to the fatal consequences arising for want of a sufficient discharge upon the skin i am afraid the case is quite different from what the doctor represents for the more matter is discharged upon the skin the more is often returned into the blood witness the confluent kind of small pox where the discharge upon the skin as well as the symptoms arising from the return of the matter into the blood are both the greatest and i believe it will be found the less the discharge upon the skin the less will be the danger from these symptoms the doctor says that one may always observe in this artificial method even where the distemper is the fairest and most kindly that the pustules scarce ever plump up to that degree or contain so laudable a matter as they do in the natural sort here is an odd jumble of the words always scarce ever suppose for scarce ever one put seldom then the sentence runs thus one may always observe the pustules seldom plump up etc what happens but seldom happens sometimes and to observe always that not to happen which happens sometimes is odd or oddly expressed i would be glad to know how many cases the doctor has observed to frame this so general a proposition upon of the contrary of which hundreds of persons about this town who know the disease perfectly have been eyewitnesses  page    the doctor foresees some inconvenience that must happen from those viscid particles intermixing with the blood without undergoing the common alterations of aliment but they have that in common with the volatile and most insensible particles but then they are viscid and therefore according to the doctors reasoning dont convey the infection so strong but they occasion great disorders not so great as the insensible and volatile particles at last they break through the glands of the skin if only the small quantity of purulent matter that mixes with the blood break through the pores of the skin the eruption indeed would be very small but to cause an eruption is the very intention of the operation the small pox cannot be produced without it and if the doctor still insists that it is only like the small pox all i can say is if he had been pleased to attend multitudes of cases of inoculated persons here and elsewhere in england since this practice began he must have been convinced that the eruptions produced by inoculation are the genuine small pox if his arguments so far prevail as to hinder any future inoculation he must for ever continue in his mistake if the patient recovers then it was only something like the small pox if any one dies then to be sure it was the small pox caught by inoculation and of the worst sort in this paragraph it is no small pox by and by it is a small pox so bad that it is capable of spreading the small pox through a whole city and an artificial way of depopulating a whole country this way of arguing is a very plain proof of the strong prejudices the doctor lies under and that as he has taken up his opinion early he is resolved to defend it obstinately  page  0 the inoculators are charged with acting like empirics because they are not ascertained of the different doses for children and adults there does not seem to be any great matter in this nicety by experience as it stands hitherto a small quantity will communicate the small pox and a greater has been found not to do hurt in any one instance if the inoculation is performed by incision the different apertures will answer that intention however there is a great difference between recommending caution and forbidding the practice it is still more strange to forbid the practice till that is determined which can only be found out by practice according to this principle it had been impossible ever to have found out any thing in medicine for he that gave the first dose of a vomiting or purging medicine or of any other could never be sure of the proper dose nay farther according to this doctrine it is impossible to give any body their first dose of any medicine for who can tell what is the proper dose for any particular person there being often singularities in every ones constitution in all these matters mankind generally govern themselves by common sense and strong probabilities there being no absolute certainty in any human affairs  page    the doctor returns to his former point that it is not the genuine small pox and consequently no security against that disease the matters of fact i will answer by themselves all i shall say at present is that if the symptoms of the ingrafted small pox are more mild than those of the natural sort i hope the doctor will not bring that as an objection against the practice i believe the patient in this case has just as great certainty for not having the small pox again as any other person who has had them which is no absolute one those who are infected by any method i believe are much in the same condition as to their security from the disease for the future for which i will give the doctor this one plain proof which is sufficient to establish a moral certainty this practice of inoculation has been continued for many years in several countries if the inoculated had been subject to catch the small pox a second time something of this kind must have happened and a very few instances of this must have put an end to the whole practice for can any one imagine that people in their senses would have continued a troublesome experiment which was not effectual for the purpose for which it was designed i will take the freedom to say that this single reflection is a stronger proof of this point than all the doctors doubts and suggestions who knows nothing to the contrary as i shall show by and by may it not at least be advisable to allow a truce in the dispute till an uncontested case of that kind happens  page    but innoculation does not always take place and produce the disease is therefore the practice to be left off there are some persons who by a speciality of their constitutions seem hardly susceptible of the distemper and others who have had the disease but it has been mistaken or forgot they go farther in turkey and affirm that the very running sores are a security against the small pox there may be indeed a strong presumption that persons who have had so severe a trial as inoculation may not be susceptible of the distemper besides there are several incidents in performing the operation which may not be carefully attended to if the patient has not the small pox there is little hurt done there are some whom a very strong dose of physic will not purge what then must we never afterward give a purge  if the doctors aphorism laid down page    that an experiment to make it useful always must be nearly uniform there must be no such thing as the practice of physic unless by the word nearly he allows a very great latitude  i cannot allow it as a solid argument against inoculation that the french and italians have not begun it no more than that the house of bourbon has never been inoculated were the doctors letter published in italian too as it is in very elegant french both nations to be sure will be sufficiently frightened from ever attempting this practice and to make the antidote still more universal let us have it in sclavonic and high dutch welsh and irish also  what the doctor says page    of the attention that is to be given to the natural weaknesses of the constitutions of the persons inoculated is a very proper caution and perhaps miscarriages if any such there be may be owing to the neglect of it but as i hinted before if the least ill success even in the most innocent branches of the practice of physic arising from want of care or skill should be a perpetual bar to the repitition of them people must leave off to purge vomit bleed or even to cut corns of which operation several die in a year within the bills of mortality  page    but it is possible and even probable the matter of the small pox may communicate the diseases of the people from which it is taken this is hard the doctor will scarcely allow that the matter of the small pox will communicate the small pox but it is probable that it will communicate any other disease que vive thomas diaphoinus il na jamais ete vaincu en dispute how are we sure that the aliment or drugs both for external and internal uses dont communicate the diseases nay the very natural qualities of those animals from which they are taken i think indeed the election of wholesome subjects to inoculate from is a proper caution but the doctor demands absolute certainty which cannot be found in any human affair and less still in any medical or chyrurgical practice mankind in all those matters govern themselves by the strongest probabilities and that these are on the side of inoculation i shall plainly demonstrate  page    the doctors argument from the jarring opinions of the innoculators if all he says were true is just as strong against the practice of physic in general for if no body was to take any medicine till doctors cease to differ i believe the faculty would starve may we not with more truth affirm that the antiinoculators a word more sonorous and longer by two syllables than that of inoculators are as inconsistent and changeable in their opinions one while they asserted that it was impossible to give the small pox by this method when experience had convinced them some of em at least of the untenableness of this doctrine then they allowed if it proved mortal that it was the small pox if they escaped to be sure they would have them again if it was a favorable sort then there was some inveterate distemper transplanted with it if any boils or imposthumations appeared at the going off of the disease those were the effect of the inoculation not the consequence of the small pox in general or of the constitution of the patient these are certainly not the reasonings of ingenious and inquisitive philosophers but the cavils of interested disputants and it would be ridiculous for any man to be determined by the jarring opinions either of the one side or the other  there is nothing material in the way of argumentation till we come to page    there this practice is condemned as it tends to propagate and continue an infection in any place here again it is the small pox else why should it spread the small pox i answer if it be true that the generality of mankind have the small pox if they are rare in some years they must be rise in others because a new stock of subjects susceptible of the distemper is produced and the operation of this distemper upon the mass of mankind in any particular place is nearly uniform when this general run of the small pox happens i take it to be indifferent to the mass of the inhabitants of any place in general except in this one particular that when the disease is produced by a bad constitution of air as it is most epidemical so it is then most mortal now if this distemper should happen to be propagated by an artificial method in a favorable season would not this be rather an advantage to mankind than otherwise for example the doctor alleges that hardly one of a hundred has died of the natural sort this year would it not then have been highly profitable to mankind that a general run of the small pox had happened in so favorable a season and this would still operate more strongly for the benefit of mankind if not only the season but the method of propagation had ten to one of odds of producing a mild sort so that this argument of the doctors has the misfortune with a great many of the rest to prove the contradictory of his conclusion but without taking the advantage of the doctors hardy assertion that hardly one of a hundred have died this year of the small pox i will examine it a little by numbers i have not all the bills of mortality by me but by a small specimen the account stands thus  died of all diseases died of the small pox   0     00   0   0                 00  0       0            0                 0                 0        0                                                  0         by which it appears that the single branch of mortality occasioned by the small pox is some years   and in a circle of twelve years about     of the whole mortality in general for       is near     of        during this term of years london wanted an addition of near   000 people yearly to keep it equally full if all mankind had the small pox then   000 people one year with another had it of which     died if one half of mankind had the small pox then   out of   who had the distemper died of it which by the way shows the doctor to be out in his calculation for if only  000 die this year as perhaps may appear by the bills  00000 must have been sick of the distemper to make his assertion true that one only of a hundred died if he means it only of children it is a strong argument for inoculation because it allows that to be a favorable age  by the bills of mortality of breslaw it appears that the mass of mankind lose above    per cent before they are a year old that is of a  00 that are born more than    die that first year i may say with great probability that not    of those have the small pox at all but die of other diseases and that in the account as it stands before us   of   of infants may be reckoned neither subjects of the distemper nor of this practice but as it were nonentities therefore out of the   000 people the yearly recruits of london abovementioned substracting  000 there remains   000 of which yearly there died above   00 of the small pox that is   so that the small pox may be reckoned to cut off   of mankind above the age of one year i wish the world is not malicious enough to say that physicians like the clergy are now struggling for their tenths but to proceed if as i said all mankind above a year old have the distemper i out of  0 dies of it if one half then   out of   which have the distemper the natural way dies of it if of mankind have the small pox once in their life then of them   out of    die if    then   out of    which have the distemper die of it according to d nettletons calculation out of      who had the natural small pox in some neighboring towns in yorkshire there died   0 which is about    out of a hundred as to the prudential part of inoculation it is all one whether a greater or lesser number have the small pox for the chance of not dying by the small pox the natural way is made up of the chance of escaping the distemper and that of escaping in the distemper if of mankind have the distemper it is of or   if   of mankind have the distemper then it is x  or   or   etc still all mankind must be considered with the seeds of a distemper within them which has the chance of   to   to cut them off then surely they dont merit such hard names of homicides and spreaders of infection who do but attempt to lessen the dread and danger of this terrible pestilence  by the accounts of the inoculation in england and the plantations though it is an early practice and has not been managed with due care and circumspection out of about  00 on whom it has been performed the enemies of the practice have not produced the names of above   persons that have died allowing their deaths chargeable on this practice which i believe is not in fact true a practice which brings the mortality of the small pox from one in ten to one in a hundred if it obtained universally would save to the city of london at least   00 people yearly and the same odds would be a sufficient prudential motive to any private person to proceed upon abstracting from the more occult and abstruse causes which seem to favor this operation it is a self evident proposition that a person who receives the infection by inoculation has a much fairer chance for his life than he who takes it the natural way unless it can be affirmed that the having the election of all the circomstances of the disease is of no manner of advantage for example it must be of some benefit to know that one is to have the distemper nine or ten days before it comes rather than to be surprised or perhaps mistaken in it to have it at an age when it is not so mortal to take it when the body is in a temperate and cool state rather than in a contrary one when the constitution of the air is favorable rather than malignant after a cool diet and other due preparations rather than after a surfeit or a drunken bout for if the principal strokes toward the cure are in the regimen in the beginning of a distemper it must be still more so in a regimen before it begins if the doctor will deny these truths i have done but if the having all the circumstances abovementioned in ones power be of some advantage then the practice of inoculation cannot be hurtful but beneficial to mankind in general then why must an experiment already practiced with success in another country that bids fair to save the lives of multitudes be entirely laid aside and crushed in the bud cannot the learned physicians who so zealously oppose it have a little patience and time will clear up many things in it which perhaps may be now doubtful therefore since this practice cannot be hurtful but beneficial to mankind in general it ought not to be discouraged  as to the inconsistencies and mistakes the doctor is pleased to charge me withal i shall always be so ingenuous as to own such as my inadvertency or want of experience have subjected me to what i wrote was according to the best information or experience i had at that time general propositions in practical matters are not to be understood in the strictness of a logical universality the symptoms from which i exempted the inoculated small pox are to be understood in a comparative sense with regard to those of the natural sort the word usual will justify this meaning in which any reader not quite captious will interpret them if with all these restrictions i cannot be favorably understood i beg pardon and as i said before i shall be always willing to recant any mistake but as on the one hand i study to keep myself free from prejudices so as to be susceptible of any future conviction which may arise from experience so i would not submit a point already established to the silly cavils of those who have none  i am sure i am not mistaken in the account of the inoculation at newgate but the doctor is i referr the reader to my printed journal whereby it appears that the operation was fairly and equally performed on all and i can with great truth declare that i had no intention to make any difference in the incisions nor was there indeed any made the doctor not having seen evans the man who had had the small pox before till next day when they were partly healed this might occasion his mistake nor was the matter taken from a violent fluxkind but from a full distinct coherent kind and at the proper time mrs tompions boil as he calls it on her arm was not the same from the first day of the eruption nor the only one she had but was a fair regular pustule of the small pox of which also she had others if he had been pleased to examine alcock who had the goaldistemper had also  0 pustules at least of the genuine small pox with a gentle fever before the eruption as to all of them having had but few eruptions i hope that is no objection against the practice and as to the time and manner of their pustules going off they were much the same as in the gentler sort of small pox only that alcock opening his with a pin made them fall off sooner the doctor might have taken notice that eliz harrison who had them as gently at least as any of them has been employed since in nursing above  0 people in the small pox and never has caught them which any impartial person will judge to be a better proof of the genuinness of the distemper than all his observations can evince to the contrary  as to mr hns case it is true but the inference is only that there was one person on whom the inoculation did not take place i hope the doctor has not forgot that he owned to me that mr colts children had the true small pox though their case differed in nothing from those in newgate but in the degrees of the distemper  as to the experiment in st thomass hospital after two vastly large incisions and an immoderate quantity of the matter applayd three days and nights confinement of the patient to his bed without opening his bandage a warm regimen in a hot season i visited him to know the truth of the noise that was made on the sixth day after the operation and saw no eruptions nor had he any nor were his incisions digested i took the freedom to ask doctor wadsworth then present whether the sores pointing at them were like those he saw at newgate and he fairly owned he could not say they were i again saw this patient a week after but still no eruption if any eruptions happened between these times they could not be the small pox and i believe none who saw and attended both experiments can truly say they were like those in newgate  i own that it seemed probable that the six persons in mr batts family might have caught the small pox of the girl that was inoculated but it is well known that the small pox were rife not only at hertford but in several villages round it many months before any person was inoculated there witness mr dobbs house in christs hospital buildings where he himself died of the worst sort with purples and his children had it some other families there and particularly mrs mosss where the abovenamed elizabeth harrison inoculated in newgate attended several persons under it to prove whether she would catch the distemper by infection both latin boardingschools mr stouts and mr loyds families mr john dimsdales coachman and his wise and mr santoons maidservant who was brought to the same house and died of the confluent kind of the small pox i took matter from the said coachman to inoculate mr batts daughter in the country farm house the first ingrafted in that country after this i took matter also from mr stouts maidservant to inoculate mrs heaths two sons which were all i inoculated in that town besides all these there were a great many more whose names i cannot at present call to mind both in town and country about it who had the small pox and several died of it the summer before i began this practice these are matters of fact which the doctors author cannot disprove to charge then the spreading the infection and the consequences of it  that town upon two single boys who were inoculated in a court in a manner separated from all the rest of the town which was fuller of the small pox before than after the inoculation is not agreeable to that ingenuity which the doctor seems to demand of his adversaries  the case of mr de graves daughter which fills up three or four pages in the letter and upon which the doctor lays the foundation of his hypothesis the reader may please to take from her fathers own words in his letter annexed from which it appears that the girl had the small pox but once of the favorable kind and in all probability by inoculation so far the case is singular that it did not take place till eleven weeks after the operation and until the blood was put into a ferment by violent motion here the doctor triumphs in his dilemma either she had or she had not the small pox by inoculation if the first then it is plain inoculation is no preventive of the disease if the second the experiment is good for nothing i think in this way of argumentation to make it conclusive there ought to be a perfect enumeration but here is a third case and the real one not enumerated which is that the girl had the small pox and that but once by inoculation though not at the same time when the doctor lays the scene of his dilemma but to consider the second branch allowing that this small pox was the natural sort and not produced by inoculation of which i think the contrary is plain sure it is a strange inserence to say that because inoculation has not taken effect in one subject it is therefore good for nothing the doctors excellent judgment will instruct him to reason with more temper and solidity in other matters of his profession and not make use of his aphorism that one instance is as good as a thousand in matters of experience what the doctor says of his fears of a great class of hypothetical diseases is all vanished and the girl is very well i refer the doctor upon this head of the preventive power of inoculation to the letter which he lays so much stress upon from boston where his ally in this dispute owns that not one of the inoculated being about three hundred during the space of five or six months in a general run of the small pox has had the small pox the natural way as far as we know but of this more afterward  as for his second story of captain hussart it requires only a bare reading to make it ridiculous for no unprejudiced person of common sense can believe that one after having been inoculated twice without any effect would try it a third time but after a third time to try it a fourth fifth and sixth time passes all degrees of credibility but it seems this captain was not very certain whether it was five or six times one inoculation had quite slipped out of his memory he wanted one quality which the proverb demands in some sort of people since the doctor can give credit to this story of captain  and at the same time question the  what is said by eminent physicians who  from their own and other peoples observations on the spot where inoculation is practiced daily i appeal to my readers if i may not with justice tax him of being partially credulous or incredulous as facts make for or against his purpose and with all due respect to the senate of boston i question whether a bill or an hypothesis founded upon such a fact is more extraordinary but allowing it to be true what is the inference that a person who could not catch the small pox by inoculation had them the natural way if that were granted will it prove that one who has the small pox by inoculation may afterward have them the natural way if upon the same authority the doctor can believe the story of the muscovite dragoon or the inoculated soldiers in the french army i wish him much joy i promise him i will not like the gentry who went in quest of st albans trough ride twenty miles to be able to disprove it i should be glad to know which way the doctor supports so bold an assertion that page    by the account dr nettleton gives as also by the best observation upon those who have been inoculated in this city scarcely a fourth part of them have had a true and genuine small pox i have read over carefully dr nettletons account contained in his letters printed in the transactions of the royal society no   0 and for my life i cannot find any thing to justify this assertion on the contrary he says we have not yet found that ever any had the distemper twice neither is there any reason to suppose it possible there being no difference that can be observed betwixt the natural and artificial sort if we may be allowed to call them so but only that in the latter the pustules are commonly fewer in number and all the rest of the symptoms are in the same proportion more favorable i hope there is at least as much credit due to an ingenious practitioner who writes from a very extended experience as to one who writes for the most part by hearsay  as to those who have been inoculated in london to oppose my own and other persons testimony from ocular inspection against his who talks by report may seem perhaps too great presumption i therefore challenge the doctor to name the cases and authorities whereby he supports such a wild assertion  as to mr sprs case i will not preoccupy my reader with any reflection but refer him to the matter of fact here subjoined as it is testified by the surgeon and apothecaries that attended him  as to the case of lord btss servant i refer to the account subjoined  he is just as much misinformed of the case of lord fss son who had a favorable sort of small pox and was in no danger of his life as the physician who attended him will readily own  as to the unfortunate accidents which have happened to some of the first rank by this ingrafting method if i guess right who he means one of them is perfectly well without any unfortunate accident and the imposthumation which had no dependence nor communication with the incision is perfectly cured without any exfoliation of the bone or any hectic fever but it is hard to charge the common accidents of the small pox in general upon this method in particular  it is no less a misinformation that the children of a nobleman understood in his letter were ingrafted from a bad sort of small pox as to what he says of the poorer sort of people of scotland running about with the small pox upon them without either shoes or stockings the doctor seems here to intend a reflection but i choose to avoid all reflections either national or domestic i believe the people of england as well as those of scotland for the most part neither wear shoes nor stockings in the small pox as to their custom or ability of running about they are much in the same condition as they are here some have them favorably some otherwise and every one has conveniences and helps according to their circumstances  as for the three letters from boston in new england printed by way of appendix to the doctors it might suffice to say that they are only a severe and perhaps a just invective against the clergy and others for meddling in this branch of the physicians practice upon which encroachment some of the faculty invoke the vengeance of the civil magistrate and threaten the offenders as poisoners and spreaders of infection with prisons and gibbets and if the laws in being are somewhat deficient modestly call as some others have done upon the legislature for new ones this general consideration is sufficient to invalidate the credit of any thing that is said by a person so strongly interested but so great is the force of truth that it has extorted enough from this partial complainant to justify the practice which he so bitterly inveighs against for first he owns that the whole practice of inoculation was managed by unskillful persons and that many who died or suffered much under inoculation if they had had better management might have had better fate that the practitioners neglected as trivial both the advantages of a suitable season and a well prepared body that they inoculated all ages and constitutions from the beginning that they inoculated women with child and hysterical people and after all they practiced it at first with indifferent good success that it had been practiced since the middle of june to the date of his letter dec  0 upon above two hundred subjects with various succcess he tells you in his second letter that they had at that time the experience of two or three hundred inoculated and after all this in all his three letters he gives you only two letters of the name of one inoculated person who died mrs dl he says at random that others died of it whom time may bring to light were the bodies of those inoculated persons hid under dunghills had they not christian burial it is wondrous strange that in a place where the practitioners in physic and the magistrates both were against inoculation he could not come at the knowledge of a mortal case but one the inoculated mrs dl who is trumpd up upon all occasions he says many of the inoculated suffer much page   what then a person that has the small pox even in the gentlest sort must suffer and at last page  0 he ingenuously acknowledges that the small pox acquired by inoculation is frequently more favorable than in the common way and not altogether so mortal  secondly that not one of the inoculated during the space of five or six months has had the small pox in the natural way so far as we know that is of about three hundred people inoculated some of which no doubt had only those eruptions which they will not allow to be the genuine small pox in a time when the whole town and country was an hospital of people sick of the distemper and few persons exempt from its rage for the space of five or six months not so much as one had the small pox for ought they knew i say if such a case had happened it is not probable it could have been concealed and that this acknowledgment from one who is so zealous an enemy to the practice is a stronger proof of the efficacy of it for the purpose intended than all the ifs and maybes of this or any other letterwriter  it had been fair in this gentleman to have given in the numbers that died of the natural sort of small pox during that season or to have stated the case fairly between two or three hundred sick of the natural sort and as many of the inoculated kind both under the care and direction of unskillful and unexperienced people and then perhaps as in the inoculated kind he could instance by name only one that died in the other sort he would have been puzzled to find the names of those who escaped  but to this he will say that the inoculated small pox propagated the mortality of the natural sort there is a full answer given to this objection of spreading infection before i think it is hard to exclude men from the means of securing themselves from a great pestilence upon a mere suggestion the influence of the natural small pox upon mankind in any place in a circle of years may be affirmed to be uniform with strong probability and if the air of any place in a contagious season is such as renders the distemper very mortal it is a strong motive for people to take the advantage of a good season and secure themselves in time from a plague which is so likely to destroy them and if prudence only were to be consulted it would perhaps be much more the duty of the legislature to order than to forbid this practice and no doubt according to the acknowledgment of the enemies of this practice they would by this method diminish the mortality and increase the number of their people and the magistrate is forced often upon more arbitrary proceedings in any pestilence but as that would seem too great an encroachment upon the natural rights of mankind i should not approve of it but on the other hand it would be a most tyrannical encroachment upon the same rights to debar mankind from the lawful means of securing themselves from the fear and danger of so terrible a plague  as for the particular faetor that according to the letter attends the sores of the inoculated it is much of a piece with the story of the kentish long  tayls it shows him to be an utter stranger to the whole practice and makes one doubt whether he ever saw a case of inoculation quite through and the pointing at the inoculated in the streets is as great an instance of barbarity as the other is of ignorance  there is a letter in town from the revd mr mather at boston of a later date which has several remarkable passages in it the distemper meaning the small pox has lately visited and ransacked the city of boston and in little more than half a year of about five thousand persons that have undergone it near nine hundred have died  but how many lives might have been saved if our unhappy physicians had not poisoned and bewitched our people with a blind rage that has appeared very like a satanick possession against the method of relief and safety in the way of the small pox inoculated i prevailed with one physician and for it i have had bloody attempts made upon my life by some of our energumens to introduce the practice and the experiment has been made upon almost three hundred subjects in our neighborhood young and old from one year to seventy weak and strong male and female white and black in midsummer in autumn and winter and it succeeds to admiration  i cannot learn that any one has died of it though the experiment has been made under various and mavelous disadvantages five or six have died upon it or after it but from other accidents  he mentions afterward that cats had it and takes notice of the same thing in doctor leighs history of lancashire and subjoins  that it was generally complained that pigeonhouses of the city continued unfruitful and the pigeons did not lay or hatch as they used to do all the while that the small pox was in its epidemical progress and it is very strongly affirmed that our dunghill fowl felt much of the like upon them  at last concludes with the great benefit they have found by blisters early applied and continued in the natural small pox and is sorry it was so late before they fell into this way but it has constantly prosperd i know not says he that it has once miscarried since we came into it i refer the reader to his letter annexed  it appears by this letter that somewhat more than one out of five and less than one out of six died of the distemper and likewise by the effects mentioned upon animals that the general contagion was owing to a bad disposition of the air and not chargeable upon inoculation  and lastly notwithstanding the unfavourable constitution of the air the inoculated did well  i doubt not but the impartial reader is now satisfied that this practice of inoculation may be still beneficial to mankind notwithstanding any thing that the doctor has adducd to the contrary either by way of argument or fact and that by the same zealous partiality it had been easy to have crushed any the most useful practice in medicine in the beginning it is pretty remarkable that in a neighboring nation where agues are the best branch of the physicians practice the use of the bark has been and is still in a great measure suppressed by methods not much unlike what are used against inoculation and indeed every one of the doctors arguments would have concluded more strongly against the use of the cortex than against this practice i will suppose any stickler against the bark to have reasoned thus in the doctors strain a drug that has been only used among slaves an illiterate unthinking people who have the advantage of a warm climate and a spare diet is not fit to be immediately dispensed to the english whose blood speaking of it as national is the product of the richest diet is it not plain by the diseases that it often leaves behind it that it spoils the constitution witness the jaundice tumors of the legs and other cachexies that are often subsequent upon it besides none but empirics can give a medicine of which they are not sure of the dose is it not plain that it will not answer the design of preventing the disease for the future for notwithstanding the use of this drug the patient suffers many a relapse besides there are not only one or two but innumerable instances of people who have died after the use of it and others who have had a diseased constitution all the rest of their lives the dispensers of this medicine disagree widely among themselves both as to the manner of its operation and the dose some give it in tincture some in substance some in greater some in lesser quantities etc in fine there are three letters from a friend in new england which inform me that many who have taken the bark have suffered very much and mrs dl who had taken great quantities of it actually died etc though i have not my self made use of this medicine nor seen much of the effects of it i am well assured that not a fourth part of the diseases it pretends to cure are genuine agues before i had seen the practice of this medicine i affirmed that is was impossible it would cure an ague but i am willing to retract that opinion being convinced by an experiment that it does so sometimes it were easy to carry this parallel reasoning through the whole letter not only with equal but more strength in most places  the doctor in appearing with so great zeal against this practice is not the representative of the whole faculty for there are many of them who from their disinterestedness and innate love to mankind are willing that an experiment should go on which in proportion to the extensiveness of the practice must necessarily diminish the mortality of the small pox in general this is a candid as well as decent way of proceeding at the same time i only blame the author of the letter and those who take part with him for their too early and strong prejudices being unwilling to censure their intentions which i hope are for the good of mankind as well as my own  but there is still a stronger dr masseys sermon page   objection against this practice that it is unlawful and first introduced by the devil who ingrafted job of the confluent sort of small pox  from useful discoveries there can always be drawn important consequences first hence learn we that the small pox is an ancient disease for if it was conveyed to job by some such way as inoculation the matter must have been taken from some body infected with the distemper secondly that sydenham was not the first that began the cool regimen for job fat down upon the ashes in the open air his friends saw him afar off thirdly that his friends were tardy above three weeks before they came to see him for in the genuine confluent kind of small pox it will be that time before they can bear scraping with a potsherd fourthly beloved this confluent sort of small pox were more gentle to be sure than the common natural ones for he seems neither to have had delirium sore throat nor shortness of breath he talked distinctly and good sense  now here a question arises whether an honest man can do that which the devil has done i answer in the affirmative there are three things mentioned of the devils assembling himself as in this place with the sons of god believing and quoting of scripture all these things a good man may not only do but is bound to do  i readily agree with this reverend divine that if inoculating the small pox be an unlawful action it cannot be justified by the good which may ensue from it but that it is unlawful must be proved either by some natural or positive law that this reverend gentleman has brought no such proof either from natural or revealed religion will appear plain upon a very short review of his discourse  page    he says he will attempt to prove that diseases are utterly unlawful to be inflicted by any who profess themselves christians he terms it very right for it is an attempt to prove and no more by restraining the prohibition to christians one would think there was some positive command in the gospel against it but he has brought none which by the most forced construction can prove inoculation to be prohibited by the christian dispensation i know of no immorality that is forbid to a christian the practice of which is allowed to an infidel indeed morality is more clearly taught and more strongly enforced by rewards and punishments amongst us but it does not change its nature amongst the rest of mankind he does not wonder that the practice of inoculation should obtain where the doctrine of fatality is believed but the misfortune is that the matter of fact is quite otherwise for if he had carefully perused dr wagstaffes discourse which he so much commends that would have informed him that no body pretends to give us an instance of an inoculated turk and why because their belief of a fatality makes them neglect very much the ordinary helps of medicine for preserving their lives  page    the instances which he gives of almighty gods having given a miraculous power to mankind to inflict diseases for their punishment does not prove that he has not given them an ordinary one for their benefit  and his saying pag   that no man was ever yet condemned to an immediate sickness for want of sufficient authority is without any proof diseases are external and in the magistrate very often inflicts both that criminals are lawfully punished with the mutilation of their body i suppose he will allow to be common is not that inflicting a disease with a witness and are there not many executions performed by poison which is inflicting an internal mortal disease and here his own argument turns upon him for if diseases are sent for the punishment of our sins then it would seem to follow that the magistrate who has a power from god to punish our crimes has likewise a power to inflict diseases for sins that are manifest to him and all the world the greater power of inflicting death certainly includes the lesser in the choice of the means if for example there should be a law made to punish the inoculators with the inoculation of some disease i fancy this reverend divine would not think it sinful or unreasonable  page    he spends a long paragraph to prove what no body ever denied that a man cannot lawfully do all that is in his power to do and another as evident that the means as well as the intention must be lawful but these are only general propositions the subsumption that inflicting diseases for a good purpose is unlawful is only supposed not proved  page    he doubts whether the life of man be a good or not if the life of man is no good then indeed to act for the preservation of it is not to act for any good end and consequently not only this practice but all others in medicine and many other charitable actions must be given up the rest of the argument of this paragraph is grounded upon the insufficiency of this method for the purpose intended the doctor might have remembered from his exposition of his text job had the small pox by inoculation from the devil even of a favorable sort that he recovered of them and never had them again but in this he must forgive me if i put him in mind that he is out of his sphere and that notwithstanding his professions to the contrary he lays aside the divine and takes upon him the physician the question here is whether giving a disease with a good intention be in it self an unlawful action  page  0 another argument is that a law which forbids the evil forbids also every thing that has a tendency to it therefore all causeless and voluntary mutilations are forbid and yet notwithstanding this law against mutilation more express than any against inoculation surgeons cut off peoples limbs here the intention hallows the action which is in itself expressly forbid and which is more i believe no surgeon will affirm that in all cases where limbs are cut off there is a direct impossibility to save the patients life otherwise or that the operation is always successful a surgeon who cuts a person for the stone even if his patient dies of the operation does not think he has committed a mortal sin in inflicting a mortal disease and yet the patient perhaps might have lived many years and not died of the distemper at last the difference of the two cases the one being for cure the other for prevention does not change the state of the question which in general terms is this whether mankind have a lawful power of inflicting diseases for good purposes a person who has not had the small pox may be very justly considered as having the seeds of a mortal distemper within him and the dread of it is surely a suffering that will justify the lawfulness of using means which have the greatest probability of saving him from a danger which for ought he knows may be nearer and greater than that of a stone in the bladder anxiety and bodily pain dont differ so much as to make an action lawful in one case sinful in the other  page    but it seems it is a tempting of providence and there is no great difference between the devils proposal to our savior to cast himself down headlong and that of inoculation it is wonderful into what absurdities zeal for an opinion will drive a man even to assert that there is no difference between a mans running into a danger absolutely unnecessary and from which nothing but a direct miracle can save him and a venturing on a small hazard to avoid a much greater the case put it as disadvantagiously as possible more resembles that of a person who leaps out of a window for fear of fire and surely that can never be reckoned a mistrust of providence even if he did it before he was much in danger for no body can say that god almighty may not save a man from fire in the ordinary course of his providence and if a person who being prompted by his too early fears had taken this course and lost his life by the fall no body will arraign him of selfmurder he might have done an imprudent but not a sinful action the parents who suffer their children to converse with their infected relations which differs in no moral point from the case of inoculation would think it very hard to be treated as homicides or murderers of their children when the very action proceeds from the contrary principle extreme tenderness  page    in the former page it was a presumptuous trust in this it is an entire mistrust of providence he is sure to have the inoculators some way or other  page    they cannot pray for a blessing upon their endeavors because prayer supposes the use of lawful means  i believe the contrary is true for as a person who is inoculated puts himself more immediately into the hands of god if he has any sense of religion cannot avoid praying for a blessing upon the means which to be sure he thinks lawful and has not yet been proved to be otherwise  page    his argument to prove that inoculation tends to promote vice and immortality is the most extraordinary of all this it does by taking off the dread of the small pox and consequently the restraints of sobriety that mankind lie under upon that account this reverend gentleman has very justly found fault with one maxim to do evil that good may come of it but he has established one just as dangerous in the room of it not to do good least evil come of it for if the diminishing the fear of dying of diseases caught by irregularity is an evil then an able physician is a common nuisance we have reason to be thankful that there are a sufficient number left who cannot be charged with being encouragers of vice and immorality upon this score this principle in its full extent would destroy all works of charity and mercy for the hope of forgiveness is an encouragment to do injuries and the hope of being relieved in want is a discouragement to industry  i am touched with the devout reflections upon providence that are all along spread through his sermon to which i subscribe with all my heart but i cannot so much commend the distorting those great and solemn truths of our holy religion to mantain little party interests and fashionable opinions the text that is quoted page    that the very hairs of our head are numbered i take to be a stronger argument against periwigs and shaving than all that the sermon contains against inoculation our hairs of our beards were given us for an ornament by providence and it is known that many have caught great colds with mortal diseases ensuing upon them by shaving is not a man answerable for all the bad effects that follow upon an unwarrantable action that contradicts the very intention of providence  the peroration page    is equal to any piece of the whole performance let the atheist and the scoffer the heathen and the unbeliever disclaim a dependence upon providence let them inoculate and be inoculated etc i think this clinches the whole matter and this reverend gentleman has furnished us with a new sensible and religious test an atheist or infidel can be found out as a witch by the marks upon his body and that as it has been intimated already that the devil was the first inoculator i think it is not impossible that the next zealous preacher upon this subject may prove the cicatrices of inoculation to be the mark of the beast thus it appears that the doctors position of the unlawfulness of inflicting diseases for good purposes is groundless and contrary to the common usages of mankind  i have been obliged to be the more particular in answering this sermon because the charge in it against the inoculators is hea than that in the letter in as much as immorality is a greater fault than bad practice in physic  from all that i have said i will draw this one conclusion that there does not appear as yet any objection of weight enough to stop the progress of the practice of inoculation but if upon future trials it should be found that the inconveniences do overballance the advantages of it i shall then be as ready to condemn as i am now to justify it  certificate of the honorable mr william spencers death april         upon examining the body of the honorable william spencer son of the right honorable the late earl of sunderland we found the small pox of a mixed sort distinct in some parts and confluent in others almost dried and sealed throughout the body all the inward parts were in their natural state and free from any mark of the small pox in the right ventricle of the heart there were two polipuss whereof of one was branched out into the arteria pulmonalis in the head we found the surface of the brain full of water and the substance of it flabby the ventricles of it being as full of water as they could hold the plexus choroides being white by soaking in that water the basis of the brain was also full of water in the longitudinal sinus there was a long and pretty large polypus and likewise one in the lateral sinus the cerebellum was in its natural state  apr         signed thus claudius amyand isaac garnier apothecar thomas garnier apothecar john reilliez john dolignon  n b the child seemed to be in a fair way on saturday the    st till two aclock in the afternoon when he was seized with a convulsion fit of which he died in a quarter of an hour  this is also signed thus claudius amyand isaac garnier apothecar thomas garnier apothecar     the case of mr degraves daughter in a letter to mr maitland sir i find my daughters case has made some noise in town and has been misrepresented it was thus she was inoculated the   d of febr       and as i saw her daily during the three weeks that she was confined after the inoculation so i can affirm no small pox ever appeared uponher during that time but only heats and flushings attended sometimes with heaviness and pain in her head and a little more quickness of pulse than usual and oftentimes without any disorder at all none of those heats and flushings ever came to perfection or to any thing like the small pox which gave my daughter some uneasiness and the rather that the other persons who had been inoculated at the same time and in the same house with her had a very fair distinct small pox and yet had less sickness than she nor did the incisions in her arms discharge so much and so long as theirs did and therefore were completely healed in less than three weeks time when the sores of the other person were yet large and running thus all expectation of her having the small pox by the inoculation being over she was purged once or twice and then discharged from her confinement the   th of march following nay it was believed she never would have that distemper for having been very much exposed to the infection when the was but two years of age and yet more when the was about eight without contracting it this last trial being unsuccessful seemed to give a tolerable ground for this opinion however my daughter continued discomposed and out of order when the came home the heats and flushings abovementioned still subsisting on her though in a lesser degree her stomach loathing fleshmeats and her rest disturbed with dreams and horrors she had likewise two small boils one under her arm and another on her side but none of these accidents were troublesome enough to hinder her attendance on her accustomed business within and without the house however these continuing for about two months after she came home the was purged once or twice in order to remove them but still they subsisted upon her not to any degree till the small pox broke out upon her which happened in this manner three days before she had heated herself extraordinarily the first by going to the camp and back again on foot in a very warm day the second by walking heartily to the charter house to see her brother and returning home and the third day in going and sitting at the playhouse in lincolnsinnfields as she sat at this last place the small pox broke out upon her at least i never perceived it upon her till her return at which my daughter was surpised she having had no illness whatever that could hinder her pleasure at the play and her walking home or any such precursory warnings of that distemper which i hear have been divulged abroad as soon as the small pox had appeared she recovered her stomach for those fleshmeats she had loathed before and came to that natural composed sleep of which she had been deprived since the inoculation and she having gone through the most favorable periods of that distemper she got well in eight days from that i perceived the first eruption so that i must conclude from the symptoms which my daughter was by times afflicted with during eleven weeks after she had been inoculated that it appears evident to me the small pox she had then was the effect of the inoculation although it has showed itself much later than is usual after that operation as to the itch that appeared upon her about the same time with the small pox i can only account for it thus she had been infected by her brother about three months before she was inoculated and i thonght her cured of it by the same means that were efficacious for the cure of her brother it is certain that when she was there was no appearance subsisting of that distemper nor any show of it till that time the small pox appeared upon her however she is perfectly cured of the itch by the same means that were used at first and i thank god my daughter is at present as well if not better in every respect than ever she was in her life  i am sir your most humble servant isaac degrave august         a letter from dr nettleton at halifax in yorkshire to dr jurin rssecr sir in answer to what you require from me as to what has been farther done i have only to add that since i writ to dr whitaker i have made the insition upon about fifteen persons who have all had the distemper very favorably and got through it with a great deal of ease as nothing uncommon or extraordinary did happen in any of these cases it will not be necessary to trouble you with a particular account of any of them they were most of them at some distance the small pox being in a great measure gone from this town and neighborhood  i am very sensible of the favor done me by the royal society who were pleased to take notice of my letter to dr whitaker which you had nothing to move you to besides a generous disposition to encourage the smallest attempts toward any thing that may tend to public advantage i must own that all the information i had concerning this affair which i have happened to be engaged in was entirely from the philosophical transactions it is now about six years since the royal society did communicate to the world some letters from two very considerable physicians residing in turkey whose good sense or integrity we had no reason to call in question these gentlemen did solemnly assure us that the method of inoculation had been for many years practiced in those parts of the world with almost constant success i had as well as all others who have been engaged in the practice with sufficient sorrow and concern been called to many in the small pox whose cases were so deplorable as to admit of no relief and therefore i could not but be very thoughtful about this method which promised to carry persons through that cruel distemper with so much ease and safety i was so far from knowing that it was a crime that i always thought it the duty of our profession to do what we could to preserve the lives of those who commit themselves to our care and i know no reason why we ought not with all humble thankfulness to almighty god to make use of any means which his good providence shall bring to light conducing to that end this matter though of so great importance lying dormant so long after it was known is i presume a sufficient proof that none have been very forward to try experiments but when we had the account in the public papers that it had by their royalhighnesss command been done with success at london i could not be satisfied without trying it here i was soon convinced that it would be of very great use and the more experience i have had of it since the more i am confirmed in the same opinion i believe all others who have seen any thing of this practice are in the same sentiment and there is no doubt but in a few years the world will acknowledge the service which the royal society have done to mankind in first revealing to this part of europe a thing so beneficial as it will certainly prove for though some few unfortunate accidents may sometimes happen yet these will be very rare in comparison of the many sad and disastrous events which this distemper has been and ever will be very fruitful of while it is left to rage in its full force and violence  sir i doubt not but when you love collected a sufficient number of observations for it you will be able to demonstrate that the hazard in this method is very inconsiderable in proportion to that in the ordinary way by accidental contagion so small that it ought not to deter any body from making use of it in order to satisfy my self what proportion the number of those that die of the small pox might bear to the whole number that is seized with the distemper in the natural way i have made some enquiry hereabouts and i shall take the freedom to transmit the accounts to you because i believe you may depend upon their being taken with sufficient care and impartiality in halifax since the beginning of last winter     have had the small pox and out of that number    have died in rochdale a small neighboring market town     have had the distemper and    have died in leeds     have had the small pox and     have died it is to be noted that in this town the small pox have been more favorable this season than usual and in leeds they have been more than usually mortal but upon a medium in these three towns there have died nearly    out of every hundred which is above a fifth part of all that have been infected in the natural way i have in these accounts confined my self to the limits of the towns the numbers that have had the small pox in the country round about is vastly greater but the proportion of those that die is much the same i have made the enquiry in several country villages hereabouts in some i found the proportion to be greater in others less but in the main it is nearly the same  i am etc thomas nettleton halifax june          mr mathers letter from boston in new england march  0th       sir so considerable a part of mankind fearfully perishing by the small pox and many more of us grievously suffering by that miserable distemper you will allow me to entertain you with a few more communications and writ i think it is a fourth letter upon it  the distemper has lately visited and ransacked the city of boston and in little more than half a year of more then five thousand persons that have undergone it near nine hundred have died but how many lives might have been saved if our unhappy physicians had not poisoned and bewitched our people with a blind rage that has appeared very like a satanick possession against the method of relief and safety in the way of the small pox inoculated  i prevailed with one physician and for it i have had bloody attempts made upon my life by some of our energumens to introduce the practice and the experiment has been made upon almost three hundred objects in our neighbourhoud young and old from one year to seventy weak and strong male and female white and black in midsummer in autumn in winter and it succeeds to admiration  i cannot learn that any one has died of it though the experiment has been made under various and mavelous disadvantages five or six have died upon it or after it but from other diseases or accidents chiefly from having taken the infection in the common way by inspiration before it could be given them in this way of transplantation however at present i need say no more of this having already given you some report of our proceedings in it  to them who are under the inoculation of the small pox we commonly give a vomit in the time of their decumbiture a day or two before the expected eruption one of our patients not vomiting so freely as he would have done thrust a finger or two into his throat which fetched up what was to be discharged from his uneasy stomach he had but a few of the small pox and the pustules were sufficiently of the distinct sort as it uses to be where they have the small pox inoculated but the fingers that had been thus employed proved as full as they could hold of the confluet sort which he now thought his whole body would have been if we had not in this way prevented it  doctor leigh in his natural history of lancashire counts it an occurrence worth relating that there were some catts known to catch the small pox and pass regularly through the state of it and then to die we have had among us the very same occurrence  it was generally observed and complained that the pigeon houses of the city continued  and the pigeons did not hatch or lay as they used to do all the while that the small pox was in its epidemical progress and it is very strongly affirmed that our dunghill fowl felt much of the like effect upon them  we have so many among us who have been visited with the plague in other countries many years ago and who have never been arrested with the small pox after it though they have been exposed as much as any other people to it that it now begins to obtain a belief with us that they who have had the plague will never have the small pox after it  i will add but one thing more for succor under the small pox where life is in danger after all the methods and medicines that our sydenham and others rely upon i can assure you we have yet found nothing so sure as this procure for the patient as early as may be by epispastiks a plentiful discharge at the handwrits or ancles or both i say as early as my be and keep them running till the danger is over when the venom of the small pox makes an evident or violent invasion on the nobler parts this discharge does wonderfully i am sorry it was so late before we fell into this way but it has constantly prosperd i know not that it has once miscarried since we came into it  march  0         my lord bsts servants case by one that constantly attended him my lord bsts six children were inoculated the    th april five of them had got through the small pox before the  0 th when his servant was inoculated he came from cirencester to my lords house in london about the time that his children had the small pox on them with an intent to be inoculated but matter could not be found so soon as desired and the fellow in the mean time lived among the servants that attended on my lords children whether he had contracted any infection by that commerce is not determined or whether the disorder he had on him three or four days before he was inoculated may be ascribed to that as some have thought or to a change of diet and air or only to a cold caught it is most certain he complained then of pain in his head and bones and was feverish doctor mead was consulted and ordered him to be blooded vomited and other medicines for his relief and that the inoculation should be postpond till after his recovery for this end he was removed out of my lords house to a nurse who takes people in for the small pox he got well of his complaints the    th april and twas thought proper to inoculate him the  0 th ditto he kept well till the  th may and then had no other disorder on him than what is usual before the eruption of the small pox after inoculation on the   th the eruptions were plain of the distinct large kind and he was relieved on that account but at night his complaints returned on him and were rather more severe than they had been he having then a kind of dilirium frequent vomitings and stools these continuing the   th doctor arbothnot was called to his assistance doctor mead saw him also the next day they prescribed several things which had the desired success but at this time his body was covered with small pox and most of it of the confluent sort he continued in a tolerable good way till the    th of may when his fever was sharper on him with a dilirium and difficulty of breathing he was then blooded and blisterd but without any effect he died the    th and was opened the    th then upon inspecting the outside of his body the face and limbs were found as full of small pox as they could hold as were also two places in his breast and shoulders they all appearing of the confluent sort nothing material was observed in the dissection of his body saving that the lungs were inflamed and mortified and that in the cavities of the thorax there was a pretty large quantity of
