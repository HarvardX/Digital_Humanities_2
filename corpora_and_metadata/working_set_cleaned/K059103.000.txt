the mercer or fatal extravagance being a true narrative of the life of mr wm dennis  mercer in cheapside london  the occurrences herein related are well worthy the observation of the reader and proper to be regarded by every mechanic in great britain  written by mrs charke author of the life of henry dumont esquire and miss charlotte evelyn etc etc  london bailey printer no   0 leadenhall street  the mercer or fatal extravagance of all the follies and vices incidental to mankind none can be deemed more contemptively erroneous than that of living beyond our fortunes and running into expensive dignities superior to the sphere of life in which providence has placed us the world has been and daily continue to be convinced of the truth of this assertion yet so prevalant is this folly i may call it even a crime that either through weakness of judgment or ill placed ambition very near three parts of the world are guilty of it to their own prejudice and those whom they are concerned with  the following sheets contain a genuine account of an unhappy instance of this kind and it is fatal consequences which give me leave to hope may happily prevent any future ills of this nature and though histories are so commonly made the entertainment of the public that truth and falsehood are equally regarded and past by by the reader only as fabulous but this narrative has a claim to reflection as it unfortunately happened in the reign of king charles the first and was the ruin of two worthy families whose branches are still in being one of whom gave me a sufficient account as give them by tradition and are now notwithstanding the length of time since the dreadful event unhappy sufferers through the indiscretion of their ancestors  in the forementioned reign there was a gentleman whose name was weston a worthy person of a large estate near the city of canterbury who had been father of many children but it pleased heaven to deprive him of all except one daughter his last born on whom he bestowed all that a fond fater could to make her a perfectly accomplished young lady as she was heiress to a very considerable estate mr weston was resolved to qualify her in such a manner as to double the value of her fortune by instilling into her mind such principles as would not only secure her own happiness but that of the person who should be destined her partner for life  her beauty merit and fortune from fifteen years of age assembled a numerous train of admirers but as her heart was not affected by any of them till she was above seventeen her father would not insist on a union with any till she had met with the man she thought she could be truly happy with rather preferring his daughters peace of mind than her interest as he could make a worthy husband entirely easy in point of circumstances whom gratitude as well as love would he conceived compel him to use his child well not only by the possession of a blooming amiable creature but receiving an advantage of fortune the want of which has too often made way for a fool while a man of sense has been deprived of an opportunity of tenderly making amends for  deficiency  among the number of mr westons acquaint he was visited by one mr dennis  of his a great goldsmith in lombard street this gentlemans intimacy  to take with him to canterbury his nly son accompanied with his daughte  agreeable young lady and a school  of miss westons as he had a very great friendship for her father he heartily wished an alliance between the two families and as the two ladies had contracted a very great esteem for each other he thought his daughter might kindly become her brothers advocate but that was entirely needless for the moment miss weston and young dennis met they received a reciprocal tenderness though each was ignorant of the effect of their interviews at that time and secretly languishd for each other till miss weston in her private conferrences with miss dennis innocently artlesly discovered the passion she had for her brother who had not failed before that time to make an open declaration to his sister of the fond regard he conceived at first sight for her agreeable friend this did not long remain a secret in the family for miss dennis immediately informed her pappa who communicated the affair to mr weston and in short with all due regard to the modest fears of the enamored young lady the old gentleman contrived very speedily to crown the happy lovers wishes by a public solemnization of their nuptials at canterbury cathedral  in a short time after mr dennis set up his son in a silk mercers shop giving him a fortune of four thousand pounds in ready cash besides two thousand more in stock  though this was a genteel fortune twas unequal to the young ladys whose father gave her on the day of marriage ten thousand pounds in bank notes and at his death left her ten thousand more  in a few weeks after the young couple were married they opened a very grand shop in the city and mr dennis placed with his son as his foreman one mr arnold an elderly discreet man who had served in that capacity with young denniss master who having acquired a competent fortune left off trade and retired into the country  mr arnold was a worthy man who having a very large family and meeting with misfortunes in trade was in his early days so so unhappily reduced as to be obliged to throw up his business that without scandal or reproach he might do justice to his creditors though he himself suffered greatly from many to whom he had largely entrusted his goods for very considerable sums  but as he was a man of almost unprecedented principles of honor he rather chose to lead a life of servitude than meanly buffet with ill fortune to support at best a broken reputation  young dennis received his instructions in trade from mr arnold who tutored him in so gentle a manner it occasioned a great regard and tenderness on both sides and gave the good man such a power over dennis that he strictly adhered to what he advised or proposed and thought himself under a certain obligation to pay him the respect due to father and was as fearful of offending the friendship of the one as of disobeying the commands of the other  but alas time which brings forth all strange and unaccountable things wrought a fatal change in the disposition of this thoughtless young man who instead of following the worthy examples of his industrious friend soon after his kind father had settled him in such a manner as enabled him in a few years to acquire an immense fortune he grew tired of business and too fond of every pleasurable expense that could possibly conspire to effect his ruin and destroy his fame the first step toward his destruction was to set up an equipage and furnish both his town and country house suitable to the dignity of a man of quality as the family increased as it did every year by the birth of a child additional servants were provided and every needful expense was swelled into a superfluity  among the rest of the follies he run into the encouragement of a set of hangers on who made him their daily bread was not the least  and the only virtue that remained untainted in him was a tender fondness for his wife and children which indeed each had an undoubted claim to the former for her uncommon merit in regard to her husband and the world in general the other from their inoffended innocence  mr arnold perceiving his masters growing ruin took upon him to use the priveledge of friendship to warn of the dreadful consequences of persisting in a continuation of this course of life but he had the mortification to find him cold and unwilling to hear or regard the tender admonitions he frequently made use of  at last mr dennis who was ready dressed for a journey to his country house one morning rang the bell at which summons a youth who was a turnover apprentice to him instantly appeared and received an order from his master for mr arnold to send him up a bill or cash for fifty pounds instead of the money mr arnold sent his respects and that he would wait upon him himself in a few momets which accordingly he did carrying with him his book of accounts instead of answering the demand made by the apprentice when mr arnold entered the room mr dennis perceived the marks of real sorrow in his countenance which shocked him but he still endeavored to hide it from the other and demanded the money upon which mr arnold looked at him very steadfastly fetched a deep figh desired him to look over those accounts and judge how much reason he had to suppose that twas possible for him to expect such a draught to be answered and after showing him the accounts which he knew he would himself inspect he sat down by him and with an almost broken heart insisting on his knowing the shameful misery he had reduced himself too and thus addressed him  it is now sir the seventh year of your marriage six of which you have cruelly spent in the perpretation of your ruin your wifes fortune and your own with your stock in trade inclusive is lavishly wasted in extravagances far beyond your right to run into had you been possessed of double the sum and give me leave to add that the figure you have made in life has given such offense to people of superior fortunes it has lost you three parts of your customers and farther let me inform you sir those persons who can afford to lay out large sums in your shop will naturally think it a high piece of presumption in you to put yourself upon a footing with them who are kind enough to lay out that with you for a support which you basely and luxuriously waste in needless and unwarrantable pleasures and unnecessary grandeur it is true sir the character of a gentleman can never be degraded by being a worthy tradesman but then the tradesman has no right to run into those excesses which even a man of quality must blush at if he exceeds the limitation of his fortune pardon me sir for this painful friendly liberty but the concern i feel for yourself and family enforces me to tell you in the plainest terms you are absolutely undone  mr dennis was too sensible of the means he had used to prove the truth of his friends assertion and conservently remained silent for some time at last conscious of his error he broke through his confusion entreating mr arnold to conceal the dreadful situation of his affairs from mrs dennis who was entirely innocent and ignorant of them the fortune said he which she brought me obliged me in honor to regard it as a more than sufficient competence to support her without exposing her to the care and fatigue of my business and though i have through a mistaken pride and ridiculous ambition to set myself above myself undone my family she poor soul never was the least incentive to the ruin in which i have inconsiderately involved myself what shall i do the coach now waits at the door to carry her with my sster to woodford where we propose to remain till after christmas but the concern i justly labor under renders me incapable of pursuing my intent or making any reasonable excuse to her for not going with her  mr arnold overjoyed to find he had wrought such an effect on his mind promised to use his utmost endeavor to soften the rigor of his fortune and find an excuse to mrs dennis that should appear so plausible she should go to her country house without her spouse or the least suspicion of the cause that detained him  he had scarce told his master his design than mrs dennis entered the room and with her usual sweetness of temper fondly smiling on her husband tenderly accused him of delay informing him the coach had waited a considerable time and the little pratlers waited with impatience for papa to mount and set forward to woodford  mr arnold who was ever a sincere and valuable friend to prevent his friends confusion directly told her he was fearful his master must follow her for he had received a letter to inform him mr edgeworth who was a merchant and betrothed to miss dennis was arrived from the indies at gravesend and lay there dangerously ill and entreated mr dennis to come forthwith to settle some affairs between them in regard to himself and his sister but entreated a concealment of the danger he was in to miss dennis whom he loved more than life till either death or a recovery should make it necessary for her to know it  mrs dennis easily credited the report and testified a sincere concern for the news faithfully promising to keep the secret from her sister and earnestly injoining her husband to follow her with the utmost expedition  he led her to the coach and took leave when she was gone mr arnold assured him twas highly proper for him to abscond plainly proving to him his person was in danger if he remained at home a day longer adding that he had from time to time put off his creditors partly with distributing money and partly by fair promises but that the demands were so great the cash was exhausted and their patience tired out therefore sir said he let me advise you as your horses are now ready leave the servants at home who were ready to attend you and take mr william with you meaning the apprentice you know he is an honest youth and loves you too well to betray any trust you repose in him and though i have endeavored to conceal your unhappy mismanagement from him as much as possible yet his constant assiduity in his business has laid open to him as much as painfully convinces him that all is not right though he modestly conceals by even the most distant hints even to me that he knows any thing of the matter but his grateful heart hourly obliges him to remember your kindly preventing him from being turned over to mr oswald who would have made his life hateful to him as to his other apprentices and thinks he can never sufficiently repay the obligation you conferred on him by your kind acceptance of him to serve the remaining part of his time with you  now sir added mr arnold wherever you please to go or whatever you think proper to transact you may safely trust him with and i am certain he will with the utmost fidelity communicate it to me who will make it my immediate busienss to summon all your creditors and if possible gain time enough by prudent conduct to retrieve all yet  mr dennis thankfully received mr arnolds friendly advice and set out with his young apprentice undetermined what course to steer but in the end he happened to stop at a lone genteel inn upon blackheath where after they had refreshed themselves as it was near town forexpeditions sake mr dennis concluded to make that house his repository till he heard what progress mr arnold had made in his affairs in london accordingly william was dispatched home to inform mr arnold where his master resided and continued for three days before he heard from his faithful friend who made the best use of his time to bring the creditors to a composition but in vain the extravagant course of life mr dennis had led and bearing himself with a losty pride by scarcely bargaining but referring it to servants had so exasperated them they were resolved to put the law in force against him to the utmost extremity and accordingly one morning the shop had not been open above half an hour before there entered an execution against body and goods  all that mr arnold could do in this extremity was to send poor afflicted william with the following letter  sir i need not apologize for my silence these three days past as i have been carefully employed with the strictest diligence to accommodate your affair which was the only motive for my keeping you in suspense as i could not part from poor william whose business it was to keep at home while i was encountering a set of inexorable wretches who notwithstanding their good opinion of me was deaf to all i proposed but alas how shall i express the grief of heart i sustain in being obliged to excite the same distress in you by informing you your effects were this day fiezd on and your person equally liable had not you taken my advice by your present concealment which is the only consolation i can possibly receive in this dreadful exigence i am under such confusion and concern i can only injoin you to send back the melancholy messenger with utmost haste to  sir your truly afflicted and obedient servant samuel arnold ps my mistress sent the groom to know the reason of your absence but i framed such an excuse in it she cannot in the least suspect the occasion and i am informed your father is going down to morrow on particular business to you but what it is i am yet to learn     mr dennis for some few moments remained unable to express his grief but by his looks and the poor faithful boy who brought the unwelcome news was equally incapable of uttering his concern till a flood of tears the dictates of his honest heart issued from his eyes and tenderly convinced mr dennis of the anguish of soul the generous youth endured for the wrecked fortune of his unhappy master  mr dennis could not collect himself sufficiently to write and only sent the lad back again to mr arnold with his thanks for his care and concern assuring him that his only hope was death for his relief with this odd disjointed message the youth returned to london  mr arnold was concerned but not much surpised as he considered the dreadful agitation or mind this ungreatful man must naturally feel from the result of his ungovernable folly  in this intervel of time mr dennis had sent word to his daughter that he should pay her a visit and bring with him a person whom he said would be no unwelcome guest to the family in general but not mentioning who it was they could not conceive who it should be however at the time appointed mr dennis arrived at woodford accompanied by his worthy friend mr edgeworth who naturally on his arrival paid his first compliments to his intended father in law who informed him his beloved harriet was gone to his brothers country house to pass the christmas there and that if his impatient desire to see his betrothed spouse could hold out till the day following he would with pleasure attend him thither mr edgeworth was obliged in complaisance to mr dennis to wait a few hours which the fond imagination of separated lovers lengthen into ages however away they went next morning and to the inexpressible surprise of mrs dennis and her sister  from various motives who should they behold but mr edgeworth mrs dennis did not know whether she should congratulate him on his recovery of his health as well as his return to england ae she saw nothing in his countenance that bore the least appearance of the violent and dangerous indisposition described by mr arnold what to think she know not but the poor lady began to grow excessively uneasy when upon asking her father in law when she saw mr dennis who replied not for several days past but concluded to have found him with her and farther enquiring how long mr edgeworth had been landed and being informed but the day before she began to be extremely uneasy as mr arnolds letters to her had been still a confirmation of his being with the very gentleman who was then present and so far from stopping at gravesend they never quitted the ship till they got to deptford where she then lay mrs dennis retired to write during which time mr edgeworth renewed his addresses to miss harriet and the sunday following was fixed for the wedding the generous lover made a voyage extraordinary to make himself a more acceptable match for the young lady and happily succeeded in his design by bringing home in his last adventure as much as completed with what he had got before a thirty thousand pounder mrs dennis dispatched a servant to london with all imaginable haste and though full of distracted thoughts on her husbands account behaved with infinite good breeding and as much seeming cheerfulness as her anxious thoughts could possibly admit  the unhappy mr dennis remained in a most disconsolate condition at blackheath and reflecting on the sorrow he knew his poor wife must endure when she should become acquainted with his miserable circumstances and the pain of separation from her drove him almost distracted in the violence of his agony he had been two or three times overheard by his landlord to exclaim against himself and urge the heniousness of his crime in the strongest terms and vowing vengeance on himself for being the cruel author of those ills he was too sensible his dear wife and little innocents too soon would feel the dreadful effects of  the landlord to whom he thought himself a stranger broke in upon his grief and greatly apologizing for his intrusion begged his permission to endeavor to assuage the extremity of his uneasiness by unfolding the real cause of his assuring him to the extent of his power he would be of service to him at the same time giving him to understand he was no stranger to his person this alarmed mr dennis as he wished to be concealed and telling the landlord as he had the advantage of him begged to know when and where he became acquainted with him upon which the other withdrew and in about ten minutes sent in the following letter directed to mr dennis  sir as i am assured though you are lately become an unfortunate man i am convinced you are a man of honor and as i am truly concerned for an injury i did you two years ago by stopping you upon enfield chase i have enclosed two bank notes of a hundred pounds each which is the exact sum i enforced from you my success on the road has enabled to quit it yet methinks i should be sorry mr dennis should be distressed when his natural courage and a small share of resolution may repair his fortune as it has done that of his obliged and real friend  ps after this confession of my crime and kind commiseration of your distress i need not sir enjoin you to secrecy or fear the consequences that might possibly arise from being in the power of one who is not possessed of an equal share of honor with yourself     on perusal of the letter mr dennis was struck into astonishment and could not resolve within himself what answer he should make to his landlords advice in order to repair his fortune for notwithstanding he had run through various indiscretions he could not easily be subborned to part with his honesty and purchase wealth at the expense of fame or the hazard of an ignominious death he was too sensible of the sorrows he had drawn upon himself and family without heaping more wretchedness upon them by an everduring infamy therefore resolved not to listen to such a flagrant piece of advice so called for the landlord and thanked him for his concern assuring him the secret should be for ever buried in his bosom but desired him never more to urge the subject and that he would not be thought guilty of compounding with felony insisted on returning the notes which the landlord begged he would not but the other insisted upon it upon which the landlord as streniously insisted that he would make his house his own and as freely command all that was in it mr dennis thankfully informed him that he was obliged to him for his offer but that he was under no necessity at that time to accept on it while they were conversing poor william arrived with the second shocking account that the creditors had sent their emissaries to woodford and that they had even taken the watch from mrs denniss side so the sad catastrophe was no longer a secret to the whole family  old mr dennis was so violently exasperated he refused the least assistance toward his sons redemption yet pitied his unhappy daughter in law and behaved very tender toward her and her children as a fond father possibly could entreating her to go home with him and strongly urged her though twas his own child to endeavor to forget him but her fondness was too powerful to listen to his advice which in the mood the old gentleman was in he ordered his coach and went away highly displeased at his daughters refusal of his offer mr edgeworth who had a sincere regard for young dennis which was greatly strengthened by the inviolate fondness he had for his sister kindly and generously resolved to repair his fortune by bringing his creditors to a composition or if that failed he resolved to pay his debts and give him a term of years to make him an acknowledgment  miss harriet took this as the highest proof of his regard to her though she was sorty he should hazard any part of his fortune to serve her relation and that she wanted no such severe proofs of his passion for her for such she termed it as it was doubtful whether it would ever be in her brothers power to make him a suitable return but these fears did not prevent his generous design which he put into immediate execution the moment he got to town and with mr arnolds assistance every creditor was paid to the full extent the amount of which came to upwards of fourteen thousand pounds  mr dennis upon receiving the news of woodstock being surrounded with his creditors he grew desperate and madly and resolved to take the advice of his landlord who directly furnished him with arms and a horse that had been trained up to that business and having dispatched william to mr arnold he set out and was not heard of for two or three days in which time mrs dennis mr edgeworth mr arnold and miss harriet went down to bring him but to their great mortification he was gone before their arrival which distracted his poor wife who had plumed herself up with the hopes of being restored to her much loved husband the landlord told them it was possible he might return in a day or two befori which he did not expect him but where he was gone he was entirely ignorant  mr edgeworth prevailed on mrs dennis  go to town again faithfully promissing her to go every day in search till he found him which he did and in about four days time mr dennis returned to his landlords again and having met with great success in his new fatal expedition he set out toward london and met a gentleman on the road within two miles of his lodging and without any hesitation clapped on his mask and bid him deliver which the gentleman refusing he immediately shot him through the head and robbed him of a considerable booty among which was a letter case all which he rode hastily off with leaving the deceased weltering in his blood upon the road the body was soon found and carried into the first house to be owned and the horse who stood by his dead master was also conveyed thither  as soon as mr dennis got to the inn where he had lodged from the time he went from his own house he directly sat down to count  booty which in cash was upwards of twenty guineas but on perusing the letter case and finding in it receipts for his own debts paid by his worthy friend and intended brother in law his distraction consequently arose by an inexpressible height there was no more room left for deliberate reflection in so desperate a case and madness raging he directly snapd a pistol at his head which missed fire and the landlord coming that instant into the room he was prevented making a second attempt but within an hour was taken by some of the people who were sent out in search of the murderer and the house which he was in being greatly suspected to be a receptacle for highwaymen that was the first they routed nor had they much trouble in quest of their man for he directly owned the robery and murder quietly surrendering himself to the rigor of the law the penalties of which he thought too little for his crime  as he had attempted his life proper care was taken to prevent his destroying himself and as soon as he was committed to newgate a sufficient guard was set over him on that account  miss harriet was directly seized with a violent fever for the loss of an honorable lover barbarously deprived of life by the hand of her unhappy brother whose shameful end anticipitated the decrees of heaven in regard to both and in a few days gave a fatal period to that young lady who expired in the height of madness  mrs denais had not so happy a relief for she lingered in anguish and despair till the morning her hapless spouse was to be executed during whose confinement she constantly attended him contrary to the commands of his and her own father who took the children down into the country that they might not be pointed at as the unhappy ofsprings of their unfortunate father what added to the immoderate grief of this inconsolable creature was the knowledge of her husband being coddemned to be hung in chains on account of the murder  the night before his execution she persisted in staying in the pressyard on the outside of the cell where her destined husband lay as soon as he was brought forth in the morning in order to receive his fate with speechless grief she fell into his arms with the tenderest marks of deep and silent sorrow in this conflict of despair and love expired  this shocking scene drew tears from each spectator and sent the dying husband quite delirious to his shameful end mr arnold who at his request attended his last moments soon after died with grief and poor mr william the apprentice who had many obligations to mr dennis grew into a settled melancholy which he never overcame the parents of this unhappy couple lived but few years after this dreadful catastrophe one retire from business and the other languishd out a miserable life at his country seat where he denied himself the benefit of light from the fatal hour of his daughters death  this story is too true to be distrusted or disregarded by the reader or those who may hear it told and as every person who breaths may be liable to the same dreadful misfortune it is not to be deemed an offense to relate the sad consequences arising from illplacd pride and unreasonable ambition the strongest motive that could possibly induce me to publish this melancholy was an observation i have made for many years of the presumptiae vanity daily increasing and prompting many persons in trade to live up to the state of those whose birth and fortune might justify the running into such expenses as must naturally terminate in the ruin of trading families and be the unhappy cause of multiplying the numerous indigent who but for this failing in parents might live comfortably to themselves and be generally beneficial to the world  finis
