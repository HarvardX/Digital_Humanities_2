the chapter of accidents a comedy in five acts  price one shilling and sixpence  the chapter of accidents a comedy in five acts as it is performed at the theater royal in the haymarket  written by miss lee  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxx  to mrs p  oh thou who badst me fearless try the oar and launch uncertain on lifes flattering sea urging with trembling hand my bark from shore while wondering at thy own temerity nameless as are thy merits still remain  yet let thy heart appropriate all its dues and oh whatever the event do thou retain the tender titles of my friend and muse should fortunes favorites circling close her throne and fames loud trump be mute to me alone the pity of the world i can return and still at unsuccessful fiction spurn while heavens supreme indulgence gives to me its charms combined and realizd in thee preface the aversion a woman ought to feel at the necessity of engaging even in a literary contest has induced me to endure a variety of imputations yet to publish a piece and leave all unanswered might at once give a sanction to the past and encourage future slanders  let this plead my excuse for introducing myself to those who have so generously received a comedy i would wish more worthy their patronage  charged early in life with the care of a family i accompanied my father eight years ago into the rules of a prison where the perjury of an enemy and the injustice of a judge for a time confined him to amuse some of my melancholy leisure i there from a fondness for marmontels beautiful tale of lauretta first conceived the design of introducing into the drama a female heart capable of frailty yet shuddering at vice and perhaps sufficiently punished in her own feelings a lover whose error was likewise in his heart not head and even for him i contrived a chastisement in the agony of losing her nor did i imagine in adopting a religious tenet i could ever be accused of offending morality subsequent characters and incidents arose in the manner they now appear except that the governor had then no place in it it is now seven years since the piece was brought thus forward soon after which a friend lent me a translation of monsieur diderots pere de famille  this fine performance gave me infinite pleasure under all the disadvantages of a translation and the chancesimilitude which now and then occurred between that and mine rather flattered than grieved me since conscious of my own originality and imagining even my worst enemy if he charged me with a plagiarism would at least allow while the subject was new to our stage my only crime was in denying it  i returned the translated play and mine lay dormant several years sentiment was now exploded and i therefore sought to diversify it with humor the character of the austere commander in monsieur diderots play had particularly pleased me and not being mistress of the french language i sought in vain for a translation on purpose to interweave him into mine not able to meet with any i created the character of governor harcourt whose chief likeness to the french uncle is in name and heightened the piece with every event relative to him but an unbounded partiality i must ever retain for music made me finish it as a three act opera  in the interim my father had been engaged as a capital actor by mr harris life opened gradually upon me and dissipated the illusions of imagination i learnt that merit merely is a very insufficient recommendation to managers in general and as i had neither a prostituted pen or person to offer mr harris i gave up without a trial all thoughts of the drama and sought an humble home in bath resolving to bury in my own heart its little talent and be a poor any thing rather than a poor author some valuable friends i had long possessed there insisted i should be wanting to myself in consigning this piece voluntarily to oblivion and offered me a recommendation to mr harris with a promise of concealing my name unless it was accepted i could desire nothing more and under these circumstances it was put into that gentlemans hands above a twelvemonth ago the praises he gave it induced my friend to own my name and from that moment let his conscience tell him why it sunk in mr harriss favor he said he had frequently refused a play of mr macklins taken from le pere de famille and could not accept another on the same subject insisted that the serious part of mine was all diderots advised me to cut it entirely out and convert the humorous part into an afterpiece which be would bring out in the course of the season  reasons very remote from the stage could alone induce me to listen a moment to his proposal and those brought me a hundred miles to converse with him on the subject when he produced me the copy sent him so worn out and dirty that i had reason to conclude he had lent it to every one he knew at least  i was enough mistress of myself to listen with complaisance to the most supercilious and unmeaning criticisms and agreed to mutilate it according to his ideas the actors were now named i had every reason to imagine it a settled thing and returning to bath sent the reduced copy at the appointed time viz early in september a month elapsed without my even knowing he had received it when with the continued illmanners of addressing me by a third person for he never wrote a single line in answer to several letters i was shown a paragraph from mr harris by the friend already mentioned importing that i had sent him four acts instead of two and must still take away half adding that he advised me by all means to retain my own disregarding diderots  i did retain my own for as the manuscript was luckily returned for another alteration i thought it time to consider what was due to myself and that the character of mildness and complacency would be rather dearly bought if i gave up all merit for it i therefore wrote him a civil letter and finally withdrew it  i shall not expatiate on this treatment i was perhaps in some degree blameable for believing that man would set any value on my time or my money who knew not the value of his own nay i may be in reality obliged to him in one sense since his acceptance of my comedy would inevitably have consigned to oblivion those parts of it honored with the most lavish applause  what pleasure do i feel in retracting the general aspersion cast upon managers when i speak of mr colman  obliged to get the piece represented if possible lest the subject should be borrowed an evil too common of late i enclosed it with an anonymous letter to that gentleman briefly relating these particulars and it was left at his house early in the year by an unknown person at the expiration of a fortnight the manuscript or his answer was demanded and the latter by this means rendered both impartial and decisive mr colman thought the general name of author entitled to the compliment of his own handwriting and by a flattering opinion and immediate acceptance of my piece encouraged me to avow myself by his advice i cut out the songs and lengthened it into five acts nor did his kindness end there he gave me the benefit of his judgment and experience both in heightening and abbreviating the business with every attention in casting and getting it up generously uniting to the name of manager that of friend mr colman has brought into notice a woman who will ever with pride and pleasure acknowledge the obligation  prologue written by george colman esquire spoken by mr palmer long has the passive stage however absurd been ruled by names and governed by a word some poor cant term like magic spells can awe and bind our realms like a dramatic law when fielding humours favorite child appeared low was the word  a word each author feared till chased at length by pleasantrys bright ray nature and mirth resumed their legal sway and goldsmiths genius baskd in open day no beggar however poor a cur can lack poor bards of critic curs can keep a pack one yelper silenced twenty barkers rise and with new bowls their snarlings still disguise low banished the word sentiment succeeds and at that shrine the modern playwright bleeds hard fate but let each woudbe critic know that sentiments from genuine feelings flow critics in vain declaim and write and rail nature eternal nature will prevail give me the bard who makes me laugh and cry diverts and moves and all i scarce know why untaught by commentators french or dutch passion still answers to the electric touch reason like falstaff claims when all is done the honors of the field already won tonight our authors is a mixed intent  passion and humor  low and sentiment smiling in tears  a seriocomic play  sunshine and shower  a kind of aprilday a lord whose pride is in his honor placed a governor with avarice not disgraced an humble priest a lady and a lover so full of virtue some of it runs over no temporary touches no allusions to camps reviews and all our late confusions no personal reflections no sharp satire but a mere chapter  from the book of nature wrote by a woman too the muses now few liberties to naughty men allow but like old maids on earth

you would have come to the stillroom to ask will you choose any chocolate   vane why dont you see i am dead  absolutely dead and if you was to touch me i should shake to mere dust like an egyptian mummy because it was not provoking enough to lounge away a whole summer in the country here am i driven up to town as if the devil was at my heels in the shape of our hopeful heir who has neither suffered my lord nor me to rest one moment through his confounded impatience to see his uncle   war umph  he will have enough of the old gentleman presently he is the very moral of my poor dear lady his sister who never was at peace herself nor suffered any one else to be so such a house as we have had ever since he came  why he is more full of importance and airs than a bailiff in possession and hectors over miss mortimer till she almost keeps her chamber to avoid him   vane hates miss mortimer  why here ll be the devil to pay about her i suppose   war hate her ay that he does he looked as if he could have killed her the moment she came down to see him and got into his chamber presently after where he sends for me  who is this young woman mrs what is your name says he why sir says i she is the orphan of a colonel mortimer whose intimacy with my lord says i  pho pho says he all that i know woman what does she do in this house says he his face wrinkling all over like cream when it is skimming why sir says i her father unluckily died just before the duke his brother and so could not leave her one shilling of all that fine fortune so my lord intends to marry her to mr woodville says i  he does cries he heaven be praised i am come in time to mar that dainty project however you may go woman and tell miss i dont want any thing more tonight  so up goes i to miss mortimer and tells her all this lord how glad she was to find he intended to break the match though she cannot guess what he means   vane upon my soul i think it is full as hard to guess what she means what the devil will not my lords title fortune and only son be a great catch for a girl without a friend or a shilling   war ay but i could tell you a little story would explain all  you must know sitting down a loud knocking   vane starts up zounds here is my lord   exeunt confusedly scene an antichamber lord glenmore and the governor meet the latter hobbling l glen you are welcome to england brother i am sorry your native air pays you so ill a compliment after sixteen years absence   gov faith my lord and so am i too i promise you i put up with these things tolerably well in the indies i did not go there to be happy but after all my labors to find i have just got the money when it is out of my power to enjoy it is a cursed stroke  like a fine ship of war i am only come home to be dismasted and converted into an hospital however i am glad you hold it better i dont think you looked as well when we parted my sister poor susan she is gone too  well we can never live a day the longer for thinking on it where is frank is he still the image of his mother   l glen just as you left him but that the innocence of the boy is dignified by the knowledge of the man   gov he will hardly remember his old uncle  i did love the rogue that is the truth on it and never looked at my moneybags but i thought of him however you have provided him a wife   l glen i have you saw her on your arrival i suppose for i left her in town to attend a sick aunt poor mortimer  he died one month before the duke his brother and missed a fine title and estate you know how i loved the honest fellow and cannot wonder i took home his orphand daughter as a match for woodville   gov brother brother you are too generous it is your foible and artful people know how to convert it to their own advantage   l glen it is if a foible the noblest incident to humanity sophia has birth merit accomplishments and wants nothing but money to qualify her for any rank   gov can she have a worse want on earth birth merit accomplishments are the very things that render money more essential if she had been brought up in a decent plain way indeed  but she has the airs of a peeress already and if any philosopher doubts of the perpetual motion i would advise him to watch the knocker of your house then you have out of your precise decorums removed your son to make way for this flirt of fashion and what is the consequence of rendering him thus early his own master   l glen if you run on thus only to divert yourself with all my heart but if you would throw a real imputation on miss mortimers conduct she is entitled to my serious defense i never saw any good arise from secluding young people and authorize woodville and sophia to live with that innocent elegance which renders every rank easy and prevents pleasure from seducing the heart or ignorance the senses   gov my lord i am amazed at you was there ever yet a woman who didnt mean to pass for a goddess do they not gain upon us continually till nothing of our prerogative remains but the name we are wise fellows truly if we do not keep down this humor of theirs as long as possible by breeding them in retirement every tinsel fop will find address enough to convince wife she is an angel and the husband must be lucky as well as sensible who reconciles her to treatment so inferior to her deserts woodville will agree with me i dare say for the character suits with his intended and faith he will make but a modish husband or he could not endure to see her flying about like the queenbee with the whole hive at her heels   l glen you are too captious brother   gov and you too placid brother if like me you had been toiling a third of your days to compass a favorite design and found it disappointed at the moment you thought it complete what would even your serene lordship say and do  here have i promised myself a son in yours  an heir in yours  instead of which    l glen his marriage with miss mortimer will not make him unworthy either title   gov never mention her name to me i beg my lord  i hate all modemongers of either sex the wife i would have given him has beauty without knowing it innocence without knowing it because she knows nothing else and to surprise you further forty thousand pounds without knowing it  nay to bring all your surprises together is my daughter without knowing it   l glen your daughter why have you married since my sisters death your daughter by her you lost before you went abroad   gov yes but i shall find her again i believe  i know you will call this one of my odd whims as usual but we all have some witness this dainty project of yours and so i will tell you the truth in spite of that project  from the very birth of this girl i saw her mother would spoil her and had she lived proposed kidnapping miss in her infancy   l glen kidnap your own daughter  why brother i need only prove this to obtain a commission of lunacy and shut you up for life   gov why though my wife was your lordships sister i will venture to tell you she was plaguey fantastical and contrived to torment me as much with her virtues as others by their vices  such a fuss about her delicacy her sensibility and her refinement that i could neither look nor speak without offending one or the other and execrated the inventor of the jargon every hour in the four and twenty a jargon i resolved my girl should never learn and heaven no sooner took her mother heaven be praised for all things than i dispatched her draggletailed french governess made a bonfire of every book on education whipped miss into a postchaise under a pretense of placing her in a nunnery instead of which i journeyd into wales and left her under the care of a poor curates wife whose name was up as the best housewife in the whole country then returned with a solemn history of her death in the smallpox   l glen well this is indeed astonishing an admirable tutoress truly for my niece   gov yes but there is a better jest than that    l glen indeed  is that possible   gov how do you think i contrived to make them obey my instructions  i saw they suspected i was some rich humorist and was afraid they would after all make a little bit of a gentlewoman of her for which reason except the first year in advance they never had a single shilling of my money   l glen this is almost incredible and so you left your only child to the charity of strangers   gov no no not so bad as that neither  you remember my honest servant hardy after the poor fellows leg was shot off in my tent i promised him a maintenance so entrusting him with the secret ordered him to live in the neighborhood have an eye on the girl and claim her if illused  fine accounts i had from him faith the old parson and his wife having no children and not finding any one own her gave out she was theirs and doated on her in short she is the little wonder of the country tall as the palm tree with cheeks that might shame the drawing room and eyes will dim the diamonds i have brought over to adorn them  this confounded gout has kept me in continual alarm or else she should have spoke for herself   l glen why then does not hardy bring her up to you   gov why for two very sufficient reasons  in the first place that identical parson paid him the last compliment that is buried him a twelvemonth ago and in the second they would hardly entrust her to any man but him who delivered her to them  here was a girl my lord to support your title of which i dare swear you are as fond as ever she would have brought you a race of true britons instead of which from the painted dolls and unjointed macaronies of these days we shall produce our own enemies and have a race of frenchmen born in england   l glen i thank your intention brother but am far from wishing the chief accomplishments of woodvilles lady should be the making cream cheeses goats whey and alder wine   gov let me tell your lordship women were never better than when those were their chief accomplishments  but i may be ridiculous my own way without being singular  harcourt shall have my girl and my money too  cream cheeses quotha no no making cream faces is an accomplishment which the belles of these days oftener excel in   l glen i would not advise you to publish this opinion governor   gov but where is this son of yours sure he has not totally forgot his old uncle   l glen he will be here immediately   gov nay i must even take an old mans fate and follow his mistress without complaint   l glen you have no reason for the reproach this is not his hour for visiting miss mortimer   gov miss mortimer  ha ha ha why do you think i took her for his mistress  what i warrant i can tell you news of your own family though i have hardly been three days in it  woodville keeps a girl and in great splendour  nay they tell me that the unconscionable young rogue encroaches so far on the privileges of threescore as to intend marrying the slut   l glen you jest surely   gov there is no jest like a true one  ha ha ha how foolish you look  this is your innocent elegance this is the blessed effect of letting him live out of your own house    l glen prythee reserve your raillery sir for some less interesting occasion  to have my views thus in a moment overturned  where does she live   gov ha ha ha  oh the difference of those little syllables me and thee now you can guess what made me so peevish i suppose  as to where miss lives i have not heard but somewhere near his lodgings  a devilish fine girl she is by the bye  ah i told you twenty years ago you would spoil this boy  entirely spoil him   l glen zounds governor you have a temper socrates himself could not have supported  is this a time for old sayings of twenty years ago  finish dressing  by that time your nephew will be here and i shall have reflected on this matter   gov with all my heart  it is but a boyish frolic and so good morning to you  here where is my triumvirate pompey anthony caesar exit   l glen a boyish frolic truly  many a foolish fellows life has been marked by such a boyish frolic  but her residence is the first object of my enquiry  vane enter vane is not my son come   vane this moment my lord and walks till the governor is ready   l glen vane  i have deserved you should be attached to me and i hope you are   vane my lord what the devil is he at  aside   l glen this strange old governor has alarmed me a good deal  you are more likely to know whether with reason than i can be  have you heard any thing important of my son lately   vane never my lord   l glen not that he keeps a mistress  what does the fool smile at   vane i did not think that any thing important my lord   l glen i do sir  and am told a more important thing that he even thinks of marrying her  now though i cannot credit this i would choose to know what kind of creature she is  could not you assume a clownish disguise and scraping an acquaintance with her people learn something of her character and designs   vane doubtless to oblige your lordship i could do such a thing  but if mr woodvilles sharp eyes and love will render them still sharper should discover me i might chance to get a good drubbing in the character of a spy   l glen oh it is very improbable he should suspect you  at the worst name your employer and your bones are safe  the office perhaps is not very agreeable but i impose few such on you execute it well and you shall remember it with pleasure  i will detain woodville till you are ready and as i doubt not that his next visit will be to this creature by following him you will find out where she lives prepare then as quick as possible and send me word when you are ready for till then i will not suffer him to depart exit   vane a pretty errand this his formal lordship has honored me with  um  if i betray him shall i not get more by it  ay but our heir is such a sentimental spark that when his turn was served he might betray me were he one of your hareum scareum goodnatured goodfornothing fellows it would go against my conscience to do him an ill turn  i believe i stand well in my lords will if counselor puzzle may be trusted and when he can get nothing by a lie perhaps he may tell truth so like all thriving men i will be honest because it best serves my interest exit   scene a confined garden woodville walking about wood how tedious is this uncle  how tedious every body  was it not enough to spend two detestable months from my love merely to preserve the secret but i must be tantalized with seeing without arriving at her yet how when i do see her shall i appease that affecting pride of a noble heart conscious too late of its own inestimable value  why was i not uniformly just  i had then spared myself the bitterest of regrets   enter captain harcourt har woodville how do  dont you in happy retirement pity me my ealing and acton marches and countermarches as foot has it  but methinks thy face is thinner and longer than a forsaken nymphs who is going through the whole ceremony of a nine months repentance  what thoust fallen in love  rustically too  nay prithee dont look so very lamentable   wood ridiculous  keep this parkconversation for military puppies  how can we have an eye or ear for pleasure when our fate hangs over us undecided   har i guess what you mean but why make mountains of molehills is the rosyfisted damsel so obstinately virtuous   wood imagine a fair favorite of phoebus in all respects since while her face caught his beams her heart felt his genius  imagine all the graces hid under a straw hat and russet gown imagine    har you have imagined enough of conscience and now for a few plain facts if you please   wood to such a lovely country maid i lost my heart last summer and soon began to think romances the only true histories all the toilsome glories recorded by livy phantoms of pleasure compared with the mild enjoyments described by sir philip sydney and happiness not merely possible in a cottage but only possible there   har well all the philosophers ancient and modern would never be able to convince me a coach was not a mighty pretty vehicle and the lasses as goodnatured in town as country but pray let us know why you laid aside the pastoral project of eating fat bacon and exercising a crook all day that thou might conclude the evening with the superlative indulgence of a peatfire and a bed stuffed with straw   wood why faith by persuading the dear girl to share mine   har oh now you talk the language of the world and does that occasion thee such a melancholy face   wood how ignorant are you both of me and her  every moment since i prevailed has only served to convince me i can sooner live without every thing else than her and this fatal leisure caused by my absence with my father she has employed in adding every grace of art to those of nature till thoroughly shocked at her situation her letters are as full of grief as love and i dread to hear every hour i have lost her   har i dread much more to hear you have lost yourself  ah my dear woodville the most dangerous charm of love is every man conceits no other ever found out his method of loving but take my word for it your dolly may be brought back to a milkmaid  leave her to herself awhile and she will drop the celestials i dare swear   wood she is too noble and nothing but the duty i owe to so indulgent a father prevents me from offering her all the reparation in my power   har a fine scheme truly why woodville art frantic  to predestinate yourself among the horned cattle of doctors commons and take a wife for the very reason which makes so many spend thousands to get rid of one    wood to withdraw an amiable creature from her duty without being able to make her happy is to me a very serious reflection  nay i sinned i may say from virtue and had i been a less grateful son might have called myself a faultless lover   har well well man you are young enough to trust to time and he does wonders  dont go now and ruin yourself with your uncle  i have found him out already and advertise you none of your formal obsequious bows and respectful assents will do with him having been cheated in former times of half his fortune by a parasite he mistrusts every one and always mistakes politeness for servility maintain your own opinion if you would win his for he generally grows undetermined the moment he knows those around him are otherwise and above all shake off this mental lethargy   wood i will endeavor to take your advice  should she fly i were undone for ever  but you are no judge of my cecilias sincerity how should you know those qualities which rise with every following hour  can you think so meanly of me as that i could be duped by a vulgar wretch a selfish wanton oh no  she possesses every virtue but the one i have robbed her of exit   harcourt alone har poor frank thy sponsors surely by intutuition characterized thee when they gave thee that name  did i love your welfare less i could soon ease your heart by acquainting you of my marriage with miss mortimer but now the immediate consequence would be this ridiculous match  how if i apprize either my lord or the governor both obstinate in different ways i might betray only to ruin him  a thought occurs  my person is unknown to her  choosing an hour when he is absent i will pay

value of the heart whose peace you have destroyed  my sensibility first ruined my virtue and then my repose  but though for you i consented to abandon an humble happy home to embitter the age of my venerable father and bear the contempt of the world i can never support my own  my heart revolts against my situation and hourly bids me renounce a splendour which only renders guilt more despicable rises i meant to explain this hereafter but the agitation of my mind obliged me to lighten it immediately   wood is your affection already extinct for sure it must when you can resolve to torture me thus   cec were my love extinct i might sink into a mean content  oh no  it is to that alone i owe my resolution   wood can you then plunge me into despair  so young so lovely too  oh where could you

price   wood give me but a little time my love  i am equally perplexed between my father and my uncle each of whom offers me a wife i can never love suffer them to defeat each others schemes  let me if possible be happy without a crime for i must think it one to grieve a parent hitherto so indulgent  i will not put any thing in competition with your peace and long for the hour when the errors of the lover will be absorbed in the merits of the husband   cec no woodville that was when innocent as far above my hopes as it is now beyond my wishes  i love you too sincerely to reap any advantage

of my power obey my benefactor  why why did you marry one who could give you nothing but her heart   har i shall not answer till you can name me an equivalent  trust to my management my dear sophia  i still flatter myself one storm will settle the tenor of our lives  if not while acquitted to heaven the world and ourselves we may struggle with spirit against fortune and sometimes owe our dearest
