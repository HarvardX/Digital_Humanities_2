hypochondriasis  a practical treatise on the nature and cure of that disorder commonly called the hyp and hypo  by sir john hill  the second edition  london printed for t trueman in the strand  mdcclxxv  price one shilling  hypochondriasis sect i the nature of the disorder to call the hypochondriasis a fanciful complaint is ignorant and cruel it is a real and a sad disease an obstruction of the spleen by thickened and distempered blood extending itself often to the liver and other parts and unhappily is in england very frequent physic has scarce known a disorder more fertile in ill or more difficult of cure  the blood is a mixture of many fluids which in a state of health are so combined that the whole passes freely through its appointed vessels but if by the loss of the thinner parts the rest becomes too gross to be thus carried through it will stop where the circulation has least power and having thus stopped it will accumulate heaping by degrees obstruction on obstruction  health cheerfulness and the quiet exercise of the mind depend upon a perfect circulation is it a wonder then when this becomes impeded the body loses of its health and the temper of its sprightliness to be otherwise would be the wonder and he inhumanly insults the afflicted who calls this change a voluntary frowardness the slightest state of this obstruction brings with it sickness anguish and oppression and innumerable ills follow its advancing steps unless prevented by a timely care till life itself grows burdensome  the disease was common in ancient greece and her physicians understood it better than those perhaps of later times in any other country who though happy in many advantages which these fathers of the science could not have yet want the great assistance of frequent watching the disease in all its stages  those venerable writers have delivered its nature and its cure in the first every observation at this time shows they were right and what they have said as to the latter will be found equally just and true all this so far as present experience has confirmed it and no farther will be here laid before the afflicted in a few plain words  sect ii persons subject to it fatigue of mind and great exertion of its powers often give birth to this disease and always tend to increase it the finer spirits are wasted by the labor of the brain the philosopher rises from his study more exhausted than the peasant leaves his drudgery and this without the benefit he has from exercise greatness of mind and steady virtue determined resolution and manly firmness when put in action and intent upon their object all lead to this disease perhaps whatever tends to the ennobling of the soul has at least an equal share in bringing on this weakness of the body  hence we may learn easily who are the persons most subject to it the grave and studious those of a sedate temper and enlarged understanding the learned and wise the virtuous and the valiant those whom it would be the interest of the world to wish were free from this and every other illness and who perhaps except for this alloy would have too large a share of human happiness  though these are most it is not these alone who are liable to the disorder there are countries where it is endemial in other places many have the seeds of it in their constitution and in some it takes its rise from accidents in these last the complaint is the easiest of cure and in the first most difficult  beside the greeks here named the jews of old were heavily afflicted with this evil and in their descendants to the present day it is often constitutional the spaniards have it almost to a man and so have the american indians perhaps the character of these several nations may be connected with it the steady honor and firm valor of the spaniard very like that of the ancient doric nation who followed the sober flute and not the sprightly trumpet to the field and met the enemy not with shouts and fury but with a determined virtue is perhaps allied to this constitution it is the character of the hypochondriac to be sedate and temperate but unmoveably resolved the jew has shown this mistakenly indeed but astonishingly and the poor indian untaught as he is faces all peril with composure and sings his deathsong with unaltered countenance  among particular persons the inquiring and contemplative are those who suffer most by this disease and of all degrees of men i think the clergy i do not mean the hunting shooting drinking clergy who follow the tables of the great but the retired and conscientious such as attend in midnight filence to their duty and seek in their own cool breasts or wheresoever else they may be found new admonitions for an age plunged in new vices to this disease we owe the irreparable loss of dr young and the present danger of many other men the best and most approved amongst us  may what is here to be proposed prevent a loss truly irreparable  the geometrician or the learned enquirer of whatever denomination whose course of study fixes his regard for ever on one object his mind intensely and continually employed upon one point ought to be timely warned also that he is in danger or if he find himself already afflicted he should be reminded that the same course of life which brought on the disorder will without care increase it to the most dreaded violence  the middle period of life is that wherein there is most danger of an attack from this disease and the latter end of autumn when the summer heats have a little time been over or early spring when we first feel the sun are the seasons when in our climate its first assaults are most to be expected the same periods of the year always increase the disorder also in those who have been before afflicted with it and it is a truth which must however unwillingly be confessed that from its first attack the patient grows continually though slowly worse unless a watchful regimen prevent it  the constitutions most liable to this obstruction are the lean and dark complexioned the grave and sedentary let such be aware of the first symptoms and obviate as they may then with ease that which it will be much more difficult to remove  it is happy that a disease wherein the patient must do a great deal for himself falls for the most part upon those who have the powers of reason strongest let them only be conscious of this that the distemper naturally disposes them to inactivity and that the best reason will have no force unless accompanied with resolution  though the physician can do something in the cure of this disease much more depends upon the patient and here his constancy of mind will be employed most happily none can be better qualified to judge on a fair hearing what course it is the most fit that he should take and having made that choice he must with patience wait its good effects diseases that come on slowly will take up time in curing an attention to the first appearances of this disorder will be always happiest because when least established it is most easily overthrown but when that happy period has been neglected the sick must wait the effects of such a course as will dilute and melt the obstructing fluid gradually for till that be done it is not only vain but sometimes dangerous to attempt an expulsion of it from the body  the blood readily separates into grosser and thinner parts we see this even in bleeding and from the toughness of the red cake from that operation may guess how difficult it will be to dissolve such a substance though of less firmness in the vessels of the body that the blood can thus become thickened within the body every pleurisy shows us too evidently in that disease it is brought on suddenly and with inflammation in the other slowly and without and in this last case even before it forms the obstruction can bring on many mischiefs various causes may produce the same effect but that in all cases operates most durably which begins most slowly the watery part of the blood is its milder part in the remaining gross matter of it are acrid salts and burning oils and these when destitute of that happy dilution which nature gives them in a healthy body are capable of doing the greatest mischief to the tender vessels in which they are kept stagnant  sect iii the symptoms of the disorder the first and lightest of the signs that show this illness are a lowness of spirits and inaptitude to motion a disrelish of amusements a love of solitude and a habit of thinking even on trifling subjects with too much steadiness a very little help may combat these but if that indolence which is indeed a part of the disorder will continue to neglect them worse must be expected soon to follow  wild thoughts a sense of fullness weight and oppression in the body a want of appetite or what is worse an appetite without digestion for these are the varying conditions of different states of the disease with these will come on a fullness and a difficulty of breathing after meals a straitness of the breast pains and flatulencies in the bowels and an unaptness to discharge their contents  the pulse then becomes low weak and unequal and there are frequent palpitations of the heart a little darkcolored urine is voided at some times and a flood of colorless and insipid water at others relieving for a moment but not affecting the distemper there is in some cases also a continual teazing cough attended with a choking stoppage in the throat at times then heartburn sickness hardness of the belly with a costive habit or continual tormenting and vain irritation  the lips will now turn pale and the eyes lose their brightness and by degrees the whites will grow as it were greenish the gums by this time want their due firmness with their proper color and an unpleasing foulness grows upon the teeth the inside of the mouth is pale and furred and the throat dry and parched the color of the skin is pale though there are some periods when the face looks florid and as the obstruction gathers ground and more affects the liver the whole body becomes yellow tawny greenish and at length of that deep and dusky hue to which men of strong imagination have given the name of blackness  these symptoms do not all appear in any one period of the disease or all in any one case but at one time or other the whole of them as well as others which now follow the flesh becomes cold to the touch though the patient does not himself perceive it the limbs grow numbed and torpid the breathing dull and slow and the voice hollow and usually the appetite in this period is reduced almost to nothing night sweats come on black swellings appear on the veins the flesh wastes and the breast becomes flat and hollow the mouth is full of a thin spittle the head is always dizzy and confused and sometimes there is an unconquerable numbness in the organs of speech  i have known the temporary silence that follows upon this last symptom become a jest to the common herd and the unhappy patient instead of compassion and assistance has received the reproof of sullenness from those who should have known and acted better  about twenty years ago i met on a visit at catthorpe in leicestershire a young gentleman of distinguished learning and abilities who as i was told at certain times was speechless the vulgar thought it a pretense and a jocose lady where he was at tea with company putting him as she said to a trial poured out a dish very strong and without sugar he drank it and returned the cup with a bow of great reserve and his eye bent on the ground she then filled the cup with sugar and pouring weak tea on it sent that also to him he drank it looked at her steadily and blushed for her the lady declared the man was dumb indeed and the rest thought him perverse and obstinate but a constant and steady perseverance in an easy course of medicines cured him  all these are miseries which the disease while it retains its natural form can bring upon the patient and thus he will in time be worn out and led miserably though slowly to the grave let him not indulge his inactivity so far as to give way to this because death is represented as far off for the disease may suddenly and frightfully change its nature and swifter evils follow  sect iv the danger such are the effects of this mischievous obstruction considered in its simple state but this though often in itself unsurmountable by art at least by any method in common use will be sometimes broken through at once by nature or by accidents and bring on fatal evils these are strictly speaking different diseases and are no otherway concerned here than as the consequences of that whereof we are treating  the thick and glutinous blood which has now so long stagnated in the spleen will have at length altered its nature and acquired a very great degree of acrimony while it remains dormant this does no other mischiefs than those named already but when violent exercise a fit of outrageous anger or any thing else that suddenly shocks and disturbs the frame puts it in motion it melts at once into a kind of liquid putrefaction being now become thin it mixes readily with the mass of blood again and brings on putrid fevers destroys the substance of the spleen itself or being thrown on some other of the viscera corrodes them and this way leads in a swift and miserable death if it fall upon the liver that tender pulpy substance is soon destroyed jaundices beyond the help of art first follow then dropsies and all their train of misery if it fix upon the lungs consumptions if on the brain convulsions epilepsy palsy and apoplexy if on the surface leprosy  the true intention of cure in the hypochondriasis therefore is to melt this coagulation softly not to break it violently and when thus dissolved to give it a very gentle passage through the bowels there is no safe way for it to take but that and even that when hurried may bring on fatal dysenteries  let no one wonder at the sudden devastation which sometimes rises from this long stagnant matter when liquified too hastily we know how long how many years the impacted matter will continue quiet in a schirrous tumor of the breast but being once put in motion whether from accident or in the course of nature who can describe or what can stop its havoc  instances of the same nature from this obstructing matter of the spleen are but too frequent a nobleman the other day died paralytic and dissection showed a spleen consumed by an abscess formed by the dissolved matter of such an obstruction and it is scarce longer since that a learned gentleman who had been several years lost to his friends by the extremes of a hypochondriacal disorder seemed gradually without assistance to recover but the lungs suffered while the spleen was freed and he died very soon of what is called a galloping consumption  thus we see when the obstruction is great and has been of long continuance if it be thus hastily moved the consequence is a sudden and a miserable death whether like the matter of a cancer it remains in its place or like that of a confluent small pox be thrown upon some other vital part  yet let not the patient be too much alarmed this is laid down to caution not to terrify it is fit that he should know his danger and attend to it for the prevention is easy and the cure even of the most advanced stages when undertaken by gradual and gentle means is not at all impracticable to assist his physician let him look into himself and recollect the source of his complaint this he may judge of from the following notices  sect v the causes of the hypochondriasis the obstruction which forms this disease may take its origin from different accidents a fever ill cured has often caused it or the piles which had been used to discharge largely ceasing a marshy soil poisoned with stagnant water has given it to some persons and although indolence and inactivity are oftenest at the root yet it has sometimes arisen from too great exercise  real grief has often brought it on and even love for sometimes that is real study and fixed attention of the mind have been accused before and add to these the stooping posture of the body which most men use though none should use it in writing and in reading this has contributed too much to it but of all other things night studies are the most destructive the steady stillness and dusky habit of all nature in those hours enforce encourage and support that settled gloom which rises from fixed thought and sinks the body to the grave even while it carries up the mind to heaven he who would have his lamp at midnight hour be seen in some high lonely tower miltons penseroso    will waste the flame of this unheeded life and while he labors to unsphere the spirit of plato miltons penseroso will let loose his own  sect v the cure of the hypochondriasis let him who would escape the mischiefs of an obstructed spleen avoid the things here named and let him who suffers from the malady endeavor to remember to which of them it has been owing for half the hope of relief depends upon that knowledge  nature has sometimes made a cure herself and we should watch her ways for art never is so right as when it imitates her and sometimes the patients own resolution has set him free this is always in his power and at all times will do wonders  the bleeding of the piles from natures single efforts has at once cured a miserable man where their cessation was the cause of the disorder a leprosy has appeared upon the skin and all the symptoms of the fermer sickness vanished this last among the jews happened often both diseases we know were common to them and i have here seen something very like it waterdock has thrown out scorbutic eruptions and all the former symptoms of an hypochondriacal disorder have disappeared returning indeed when these were unadvisedly struck in but keeping off entirely when they were more wisely treated a natural purging unsuppressed has sometimes also done the same good office but this last is hazardous  it is easy to be directed from such instances only let us take the whole along with us bleeding would have answered natures purpose if she could not have opened of herself the haemorrhoidal vessels but he who should give medicines with that view might destroy his patient by too great disturbance if a natural looseness may perform the cure so may an artificial when the original source of the disorder points that way but these are helps that take place only in particular cases  the general and universal method of cure must be by some mild and gently resolving medicine under the influence of which the obstructing matter may be voided that or some other way with safety the best season to undertake this is the spring or autumn but even here there should be caution  in the first place no strong evacuating remedy must be given for that by carrying off the thinner parts of the juices will tend to thicken the remainder and that way certainly increase the distemper no acrid medicine must be directed for that may act too hastily dissolve the impacted matter at once and let it loose to the destruction of the sufferer no antimonial no mercurial no martial preparation must be taken in short no chemistry nature is the shop that heaven has set before us and we must seek our medicine there the venerable ancients who knew not this new art will lead us in the search and faithful relators as they are of truth will tell us whence we may deduce our hope and what we are to fear  but prior to the course of any medicine and as an essential to any good hope from it the patient must prescribe himself a proper course of life and a wellchosen diet let us assist him in his choice and speak of this first as it comes first in order  sect vi rules of life for hypochondriac persons air and exercise as they are the best preservers of health are also greatest assistants in the cure of all longcontinued diseases and they will have their full effect in this but there requires some caution in the choice and management of them it is common to think the air of high grounds best but experience near home shows otherwise the hypochondriac patient is always worse at highgate even than in london  the air he breathes should be temperate not exposed to the utmost violences of heat or cold and to the swift changes from one to the other which are most felt on those high grounds the side of a hill is the best place for him and though wet grounds are hurtful yet let there be the shade of trees to tempt him often to a walk and soften by their exhalations the over dryness of the air  the exercise he takes should be frequent but not violent motion preserves the firmness of the parts and elasticity of the vessels and it prevents that aggregation of thick humors which he is most to fear a sedentary life always produces weakness and that mischief follows weak eyes are gummy weak lungs are clogged with phlegm and weak bowels waste themselves in vapid diarrhoeas  let him invite himself abroad and let his friends invite him by every innocent inducement for me i should advise above all other things the study of nature let him begin with plants he will here find a continual pleasure and continual change fertile of a thousand useful things even of the utility we are seeking here this will induce him to walk and every hedge and hillock every footpath side and thicket will afford him some new object he will be tempted to be continually in the air and continually to change the nature and quality of the air by visiting in succession the high lands and the low the lawn the heath and forest he will never want inducement to be abroad and the unceasing variety in the subjects of his observation will prevent his walking hastily he will pursue his studies in the air and that contemplative turn of mind which in his closet threatened his destruction will thus become the great means of his recovery  if the mind tire upon this from the repeated use another of natures kingdoms opens itself at once upon him the plant he is weary of observing feeds some insect he may examine nor is there a stone that lies before his foot but may afford instruction and amusement  even what the vulgar call the most abject things will show a wonderful utility and lead the mind in pious contemplation higher than the stars the poorest moss that is trampled under foot has its important uses is it at the bottom of a wood we find it why there it shelters the fallen seeds hides them from birds and covers them from frost and thus becomes the fosterfather of another forest creeps it along the surface of a rock even there its good is infinite its small roots run into the stone and the rains make their way after them the moss having lived its time dies it rots and with the mouldered fragments of the stone forms earth wherein after a few successions useful plants may grow and feed more useful cattle biberg   is there a weed more humble in its aspect more trampled on or more despised than knotgrass no art can get the better of its growth no labor can destroy it twere pity if they could for the thing lives where nothing would of use to us and its large and most wonderfully abundant seeds feed in hard winters half the birds of heaven  what the weak moss performs upon the rock the loathed toadstool brings about in timber is an oak dead where mans eye will not find it this fungus roots itself upon the bark and rots the wood beneath it hither the beetle creeps for shelter and for sustenance him the woodpecker follows as his prey and while he tears the tree in search of him he scatters it about the ground which it manures  nor is it the beetle alone that thus insinuates itself into the substance of the vegetable tribe the tender aphide reaumur  whom a touch destroys burrows between the two skins of a leaf for shelter from his winged enemies tracing with more than dedalaean art his various meanders and veining the green surface with these white lines more beautifully than the best egyptian marble  twere endless to proceed nor is it needful one object will not fail to lead on to another and every where the goodness of his god will shine before him even in what are thought the vilest things his greatness in the least of them  let him pursue these thoughts and seek abroad the objects and the instigations to them but let him in these and all other excursions avoid equally the dews of early morning and of evening  the more than usual exercise of this prescription will dispose him to more than customary sleep let him indulge it freely so far from hurting it will help his cure  let him avoid all excesses drink need scarce be named for we are writing to men of better and of nobler minds than can be tempted to that humiliating vice those who in this disorder have too great an appetite must not indulge it much eaten was never well digested but of all excesses the most fatal in this case is that of venery it is the excess we speak of  sect vii the proper diet in the first place acids must be avoided carefully and all things that are in a state of fermentation for they will breed acidity provisions hardened by salting never should be tasted much less those cured by smoking and by salting bacon is indigestible in an hypochondriac stomach and hams impregnated as is now the custom with acid fumes from the wood fires over which they are hung have that additional mischief  milk ought to be a great article in the diet and even in this there should be choice the milk of grassfed cows has its true quality and no other there are a multitude of ways in which this may be made a part both of our foods and drinks and they should all be used  the great and general caution is that the diet be at all times of a kind loosening and gently stimulating light but not acrid veal lamb fowls lobsters crabs crawfish fresh water fish and mutton broth with plenty of boiled vegetables are always right and give enough variety  raw vegetables are all bad sour wines old cheese and bottled beer are things never to be once tasted indeed much wine is wrong be it of what kind soever it is the first of cordials and as such only i would have it taken in this disease when it is wanted plainly as a medicine rather than a part of diet maltliquor carefully chosen is certainly the best drink this must be neither new nor tending to sourness perfectly clear and of a moderate strength it is the native liquor of our country and the most healthful  too much tea weakens and even sugar is in this disorder hurtful but honey may supply its place in most things and this is not only harmless but medicinal a very powerful dissolvent of impacted humors and a great deobstruent  what wine is drank should be of some of the sweet kinds old hock has been found upon enquiry to yield more than ten times the acid of the sweet wines and in red port at least in what we are content to call so there is an astringent quality that is most mischievous in these cases it is said there is often alum in it how pregnant with evil that must be to persons whose bowels require to be kept open is most evident summer fruits perfectly ripe are not only harmless but medicinal but if eaten unripe they will be prejudicial a light supper which will leave an appetite for a milk breakfast is always right and this will not let the stomach be ravenous for dinner as it is apt to be in those who make that their only meal  one caution more must be given and it may seem a strange one it is that the patient attend regularly to his hours of eating we have to do with men for the most part whose soul is the great object of their regard but let them not forget they have a body  the late dr stukely has told me that one day by appointment visiting sir isaac newton the servant told him he was in his study no one was permitted to disturb him there but as it was near his dinnertime the visitor sat down to wait for him after a time dinner was brought in a boiled chicken under a cover an hour passed and sir isaac did not appear the doctor then eat the fowl and covering up the empty dish bad them dress their master another before that was ready the great man came down he apologizd for his delay and added give me but leave to take my short dinner and i shall be at your service i am fatigued and faint saying this he lifted up the cover and without any emotion turned about to stukely with a smile see says he what we studious people are i forgot i had dined  sect viii of medicine it is the ill fate of this disease more than of all others to be misunderstood at first and thence neglected till the physician shakes his head at a few first questions none steals so fatally upon the sufferer its advances are by very slow degrees but every day it grows more difficult of cure  that an obstruction in the spleen is the true malady the cases related by the ancients present observation and the unerring testimonies of diffections leave no room to doubt being understood the path is open where to seek a remedy and our best guides in this as in the former instance will be those venerable greeks who saw a thousand of these cases where we meet with one and with less than half our theory cured twice as many patients  one established doctrine holds place in all these writers that whatever by a hasty fermentation dissolves the impacted matter of the obstruction and sends it in that state into the blood does incredible mischief but that whatever medicine softens it by slow degrees and as it melts delivers it to the bowels without disturbance will cure with equal certainty and safety  for this good purpose they knew and tried a multitude of herbs but in the end they fixed on one and on their repeated trials of this they banished all the rest this stood alone for the cure of the disease and from its virtue received the name of spleenwort   o wise and happy greeks authors of knowledge and perpetuators of it with them the very name they gave a plant declared its virtues but with us a writer calls an herb from some friend that the good gardener who receives the honor may call another by his name who gave it we now add the term smooth to the name of this herb to distinguish it from another called by the same general term though not much resembling it  the virtues of this smooth spleenwort have stood the test of ages and the plant has every where retained its name and credit one of our good old herbarists who had seen a wonderful case of a swollen spleen so big and hard as to be felt with terror brought back to a state of nature by it and all the miserable symptoms vanish with the swelling thought spleenwort not enough expressive of its excellence but stamped on it the name of miltwaste  in the greek islands now the use of it is known to every one and even the lazy monks who take it are no longer splenetic in the west of england the rocks are stripped of it with diligence and every old woman tells you how charming that leaf is for bookish men in russia they use a plant of this kind in their malt liquor it came into fashion there for the cure of this disease which from its constant use is scarce known any longer and they now suppose it is added to their liquor for a flavor  the ancients held it in a kind of veneraration and used what has been called a superstition in the gathering it it was to be taken up with a sharp knife without violence and laid upon clean linen no time but the still darkness of the night was proper and even the moon was not to shine upon it silente luna  i know they have been ridiculed for this for nothing is so vain as learned ignorance but let me be permitted once to vindicate them  the plant has leaves which can close at their sides and their under part is covered thick with a yellow powder consisting of the seeds and seedvessels in these they knew the virtue most resided this was the golden dust pulvis aureus they held so valuable and this they knew they could not be too cautious to preserve they were not ignorant of the sleep of plants a matter lately spoken of by some as if a new discovery and being sensible that light a dry air an expanded leaf and a tempestuous season were the means of losing this fine dust and knowing also that darkness alone brought on that closing of the leaf which thence has been called sleep and which helped to defend and to secure it they therefore took such time and used such means as could best preserve the plant entire and even save what might be scattered from it  and now where is their superstition  from this plant thus collected they prepared a medicine which in a course of forty days scarce ever failed to make a perfect cure  we have the plant wild with us and till the fashion of rough chemical preparations took off our attention from these gentler remedies it was in frequent use and great repute i trust it will be so again and many thank me for restoring it to notice  spleenwort gives out its virtues freely in a tincture and a small dose of this mixing readily with the blood and juices gradually dissolves the obstruction and by a little at a time delivers its contents to be thrown off without pain from the bowels let this be done while the viscera are yet sound and the cure is perfect more than the forty days of the greek method is scarce ever required much oftener two thirds of that time suffice and every day from the first dose of it the patient feels the happy change that is growing in his constitution his food no more turns putrid on his stomach but yields its healthful nourishment the swelling after meals therefore vanishes and with that goes the lowness and anxiety the difficult breath and the distracting cholick he can bear the approach of rainy weather without pain he finds himself more apt for motion and  take that exercise which is to be  in his cure life seems no longer burthensome his bowels get into the natural condition of health and perform their office once at least a day better if a little more the dull and dead color of his skin goes off his lips grow red again and every sign of health returns  let him who takes the medicine say whether any thing here be exaggerated let him if he pleases to give himself the trouble talk over with me or write to me this gradual decrease of his complaints as he proceeds in his cure my uncertain state of health does not permit me to practice physic in the usual way but i am very desirous to do what good i can and shall never refuse my advice such as it may be to any person rich or poor in whatever manner he may apply for it i shall refer him to no apothecary whose bills require he should be drenched with potions but tell him in this as in all other cases where to find some simple herb which he may if he please prepare himself or if he had rather spare that trouble may have it so prepared from those whom i instruct to do it   regard  using it is more effectual than simply taking it in powder the only advantage of a tincture is that a proper dose may be given and the stomach not loaded with too large a quantity it is an easier and pleasanter method and nothing more this tincture may be had of mr trueman bookseller at no     in the strand  if any person choose to take this herb in the other way i should still wish him once at least to apply to me that he may be assured what he is about to take is the right plant abuses in medicines are at this time very great and in no instance worse than what relates to herbs the best of our physicians have complained upon this head with warmth but without redress they know the virtues and the value of many of our native plants but dread to prescribe them lest some wrong thing should be administered in their place perhaps inefficacious perhaps mischievous nay it may be fatal the few simple things i direct are always before me and it will at all times be a pleasure to me in this and any other instance to see whether what any person is about to take be right i have great obligations to the public and this is the best return that i know how to make
