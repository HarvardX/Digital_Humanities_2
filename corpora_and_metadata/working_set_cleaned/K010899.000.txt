an historical and geographical description of formosa an island subject to the emperor of japan giving an account of the religion customs manners etc of the inhabitants together with a relation of what happened to the author in his travels particularly his conferences with the jesuits and others in several parts of europe also the history and reasons of his conversion to christianity with his objections against it in defense of paganism and their answers to which is prefixed a preface in vindication of himself from the reflections of a jesuit lately come from china with an account of what passed between them by george psalmanaazaar a native of the said island now in london illustrated with several cuts  london printed for dan brown at the black swan without temple bar g strahan and w davis in cornhill fran coggan in the innertemplelane and bernard lintott at the middle temple gate in fleet street   0   to the right honorable and right reverend father in god henry by divine providence ld bishop of london and one of her majestys most honorable privy council i know not my lord whether what i now most humbly dedicate to your lordship may merit your perusal especially at this time when your lordship is busied about affairs of the greatest moment but since your noble soul be it concerned about things never so weighty and intricate must be allowed some minutes to unbend i submissively beg you would please to bestow some of them upon this treatise well knowing if your lordship smile upon it the world cannot dislike it  the europeans have such obscure and various notions of japan and especially of our island formosa that they can believe nothing for truth that has been said of it but the prevailing reason for this my undertaking was because the jesuits i found had imposed so many stories and such gross fallacies upon the public that they might the better excuse themselves from those base actions which deservedly brought upon them that fierce persecution in japan i thought therefore it would not be unacceptable if i published a short description of the island formosa and told the reasons why this wicked society and at last all that professed christianity were with them expelled that country  my lord  i look upon my self as much obliged to your lordship as ever man was to his patron having experienced your goodness ever since i came into england i have therefore earnestly desired by any honest and humble way to express my gratitude but though your transcendent generosity and the meanness of my fortune and capacity render it impossible for me to pay your lordship all that respect and acknowledgment which are due for your lordships many and great favors yet since my present leisure and enjoyments are owing to your munificence i most willingly lay hold on this occasion and consecrate the first fruits of such blessings to the hand that bestowed them upon me not in the least doubting but your lordship according to your wonted charity and goodness will vouchsafe to receive this little book as a thankful testimony how vastly i am indebted to you and as such it is with all humility and veneration offered by  my lord your lordships most grateful and obsequious servant george psalmanaazaar  the preface when i first arrived in england every one was curious to discourse me about my own country and forasmuch as my account of it was entirely new they thought it my duty to publish it and i readily complied with their advice both for my own ease and their satisfaction but when i had met with so many romantic stories of all those remote eastern countries especially of my own which had been imposed upon you as undoubted truths and universally believed then i was much discouraged from proceeding in my description of it yet since truth ought to dispel these clouds of fabulous reports and i could not escape uncensurd even by my self should i by my silence suffer you to remain in ignorance or rather deceived by misrepresentations i thought my self indispensably obliged to give you a more faithful history of the isle of formosa than as yet you have met with but before i enter upon this subject it is convenient i should premise some few things since then as i before observed there are such various accounts and all different from what i shall give you this is no reason for me to expect greater credit but i leave it to the unbiased judge to prefer which he pleases for it is not so much my concern to be reputed sincere as it is really to be so but here i must entreat you diligently to observe what follows because the reputation of my book depends much upon it in the first place there are several things in their story which you are obliged to suspect because they contradict one another in those matters which every relater assures you he has been an eyewitness of since then their tale is so inconsistent there is very little in it that you ought to depend upon but that i may expose some of their falsehoods i will strengthen what i assert by the authority of some english merchants trading to china whose relations are much the same with mine but vastly different from theirs as for example candidius and others in their account of formosa tell us there is neither monarchical nor democratical government in the island that there is no law nor punishment against theft adultery or murder and such black crimes but every man judges and revengeth in his own case for instance if a man rob me of a hundred pound i may steal from him as much by way of reprizal if a man murders me any of my family or friends may by the murder of him revenge mine and so of adultery etc they tell us farther that there is no economy or order amongst the natives that they are even strangers to the distinction of master and servant that neither mines of gold or silver are to be found there and that they have no spices in answer to which let me tell you that those merchants i before mentioned inform us that there is a governor to whom they paid large customs for every thing they exported if then there be a governor certainly there must be laws let candidius and others say what they please that they have gold silver and spices also is likewise proved by those traders who have exported vast sums of the one and large quantities of the other  reason it self is sufficient to confute what they say of anarchy in our island for how is it possible for any kingdom to stand if no law or degrees of dignity are observed or how can a community be preserved if there are no penal statutes to correct offenders in my opinion if every one was left to revenge himself such a place must be a continued scene of murder and rapine especially since the formosans as candidius and others would have you believe do not look upon these facts as monstrous crimes but only as little tricks and piccadillos  there are some likewise that tell you that the island of formosa belongs to the chann of china but if so why do the chinese pay so great tribute to our governor for the truth of this i dare appeal even to the dutch themselves who are competent judges in the case ever since the emperor of japan has given them leave to renew their trade in formosa after they had many years been banished from thence as you may see in the book chap    of the success of the dutch in japan    i could here also add much more which for brevitysake i omit for it is convincing enough to say that he who so grossly errs in one particular may reasonably be thought an unfaithful relater of every thing else but whether these ridiculous storytellers abovementioned vend their legends out of a design or for want of a true knowledge of matter of fact is not my business now to enquire    the second thing i would have you take notice of is that i pretend not to give you a perfect and complete history of my island because i was a mere youth when i left it but nineteen years of age and therefore incapable of giving an exact account of it besides i have now been six years from home so many things of moment may perhaps slip my memory which would have adorned the description of my country but whatsoever i can recollect i have freely published and i assure you i have not positively asserted any thing which is not as positively true but if i have said what i did not know as a certain truth as such i have admonished you of it i have discharged my conscience receive it as you please for since i have done my duty i shall no more be concerned about it    in my book i have told you the reasons that moved my countrymen to make so great a slaughter of the christians for the jesuits then made such weak excuses for themselves that many not without reason believed they had other designs than what they pretended i thought it therefore proper to give you from the records and tradition of my country the best account of these matters i could in vain the jesuits assign the envy of our pagan priests and the emulation of the dutch as the causes of this persecution such things could never induce us to treat so cruelly all that professed christianity certainly there was a snake in the grass which they would not but i have discovered i am confident by my revealing this and much more i shall draw all the spite and malice of the jesuits upon me of which i have already met with a notorious instance in father fountenay who is lately returned from china having been eighteen years a missionary there this man is now in london and some body had told him i was publishing a book in which i speak much against the roman church and especially against the jesuits this has so enraged him that he endeavors by all means imaginable to destroy my credit as i am daily informed by many gentlemen to whom i only replied let him alone i am little concerned at what such a suspicious person says against me the truth is and will be i hope evident notwithstanding his attempts to stifle it so i shall apply the words of the poet to him parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus  i have had three conferences with him without coming to any conclusion the first was before the royal society on wednesday the second of this instant february when there was a public meeting of the illustrious members of that celebrated body that he might the more easily defend himself he had notice of my coming after we had saluted each other we began our discourse the first question that was proposed to him was to whom does the island of formosa belong he presently replied it was tributary to the emperor of china some of the gentlemen asked him how he knew it to be so he quickly answered that a certain english ship called the harwich was by stormy weather forced upon the shore of formosa that five jesuits were passengers in it one of them was drowned the other four escaped to the island from whence they sent letters to this father fontenay who then was in a certain city in china father fontenay writes to the chann or emperor the chann sends a letter to the formosans demanding them and the ship and so the formosans were compelled to restore both them and the ship i answered that this story was nothing to the purpose for since we are not at wars with the chinese if any of their ships should be driven on our coast and the chann should reclaim them although we live not in his dominions we are in justice obliged to restore them and thus i then answered his story but it appears since by the testimony of several merchants that the aforementioned ship was cast upon the coast of china and not of formosa had i known as much then i would before the illustrious society have detected the falsehood of the jesuit but mistrusting he might be mistaken in the name of the the place and take another island for formosa i desired him to tell me by what name the chinese called formosa he answered that he knew no other name for it but formosa or tyowan but it is very plain not only from what i who should know best assert but also from a certain gentleman who has been in tyowan that it is an island somewhat remote and distinct from ours and is now a colony belonging to the beforementioned dutch this indeed he confessed he was ignorant of i told him farther that the chinese call our island by the name of pakando which agrees with gadavia as we call it both which signify the island formosa pak pak says he there is not such a word in the whole chinese language that ended with a consonant as pak does which is very false for the name of almost all their great cities end with a consonant as nanking kanton peking etc   when at my desire he discoursed in the chinese language near half his words terminated with consonants this was so plain a contradiction that all the auditory observed it at the same meeting also he denied there was any variety of languages or dialects through the whole empire of china but that all the natives spoke with one and the same tongue which when it was demonstrated to be false by many then present he made no manner of reply only unreasonably and obstinately persisted in affirming what he before had said at length that if possible i might make the matter yet more plain i told him either what all the jesuits and others had written of the chinese language was not true or what he said must be false for they assure us the chinese in every province speak various dialects vide the lords prayer in a hundred languages and they have different languages according to their degrees or quality as for instance the noblemen speak the mandarin language the bonzees or priests use another for the divine service which is unintelligible to the lay people and the plebeans a third so that i told him either they or he pardon the expression must lie grossly but he endeavored by impertinent shifts to excuse himself he denied also that the chinese had any tone in their speech by which they distinguish the signification of a word this i likewise affirmed to be false for i have in formosa heard many chinese talking together but they seemed to me rather to sing than discourse besides this contradicts what the jesuits themselves tell us at length after so many interruptions we ended our conference let the reader judge who had the better  i have since had two assignations to meet him once at my lady powiss another time at sioncollege but he failed to answer the appointments  eight days after being wednesday the ninth of february i was to dine with dr sloane secretary to the royal society where were present the right honorable my lord pembroke his excellency spanhemins the king of prussias envoy another nobleman and this father fontenay when he was asked by his excellency to whom the island formosa belonged he replied here is a young man pointing to me who is a native of that country he can better inform you than i who have only been in china i then answered him that it did belong to the emperor of japan we had nothing else remarkable in this conference neither had he the assurance at this time to say any thing more to me he wondered indeed to see me eat raw flesh because says he the chinese dress their meat after the same manner as the europeans though at the same time he confessed the tartars differed from them in their cookery for they only warmed their flesh before they eat it  a third time i met him in the templecoffeehouse in devereuxcourt in the strand near temple bar where several noblemen were present and there he asked me the manner time and reasons of my leaving my country and i rightly informed him neither had he the face to raise any objections unless that he never knew father de rhode who brought me out of my country  i am well informed he takes a great deal of freedom in aspersing me but i shall return him no other answer than that of the mendicant friar to some false accusations against him mentitur impudentissime but sure it is much more becoming a man of probity to speak openly and face to face than thus clandestinely to backbite and calumniate i have just touched upon this subject that you may see how much this narrative will incense the jesuits against me but i trust that providence which so often has delivered me out of their hands will frustrate all their designs and contrivances that i may say with the psalmist he shall reward evil unto mine enemies destroy thou them in thy truth psalm    v    i fear this trifling performance will not be very acceptable to you because it is not so elegant and polite as you perhaps might wish i was sensible of my own weakness and incapacity for it and therefore depend upon your goodness to pardon my errors and supply my defects elegant expressions and pomp of words are not to be expected from a raw and unpolished japanese but since i wrote this treatise in latin that it might be afterward turned into english and obliged the translator to make no additions or alterations it is mine and not his fault if you meet with any imperfections in it  it was translated out of latin by mr oswald except from page    to     which part i wrote in english and was prepared for the press by another hand  i thought it might not be amiss to begin with an account of my travels and conversion which will i hope afford you some things that are entertaining  it is not my delight but my grief that i am obliged to publish my arguments against those religions which i could not conform to because some perhaps will interpret what i have said to reflect upon them but that was far from my intentions who only designed to give you my reasons why i could not subscribe to them which if they please not others yet they do abundantly satisfy me especially since i as yet was tinctured with the prejudices of the idolatry i was educated in far be it from me to condemn any man but as i said before i only acquaint you that these things were offensive to me which perhaps are not so to others  now to the omnipotent and allwise god i return my most humble thanks who by the assistance of his holy spirit has brought me to the knowledge of that religion in which only salvation is to be found and to that christian communion which is most conformable to the institutions of our savior to whom be all honor and praise now and for ever amen  the reader is desired to mend the following errata page   l   after      add as himself tells us in his epistles p   l   after de rode

native of the isle formosa through several parts of europe with the reasons of his conversion to the christian religion when xaverius the great apostle of the indies first arrived with the jesuits his companions at cangoxima in japan in the year      they were civilly entertained by the inhabitants of that place and after this the jesuits and other missionaries being encouraged by the kind reception they met with flocked in great numbers to japan and there boldly professed and propagated the christian faith with good success for many years but since the emperor of japan about the year      for certain reasons hereafter mentioned has forbidden any christian to come into his dominions under pain of death and has appointed searchers in every city to examine all foreigners whether they be christians or no by this test of trampling upon the crucifix the jesuits and other missionaries of the romishchurch are so far from venturing to appear there barefaced or making public profession of the christian religion and endeavoring to make proselites to it that they industriously mask themselves under several disguises lest they should be known to be christians or foreigners and to this end they first travel to goa where there are academies in which all the oriental languages are taught and after they have perfectly learned the japanese language and can speak it as easily and readily as any native then they cloth themselves in a japan habit and so they venture to travel into some island within the dominions of the empire of japan when they are come there they pretend to be natives of some other island in the same empire which is easily believed to be true by the inhabitants who have no suspicion of them because they speak their language exactly and wear their cloths after the mode of the country and thus having secured their admission into a city with safety their next business is to prevent any umbrage of suspicion which may arise from their idle way of living and to this purpose they seem as much concerned for some trade or employment as if they really wanted means of subsistence thus some set up for merchants artificers or toysellers others for schoolmasters or pedagogues to teach the natives children some language they want to learn and so every one acts his part and cloaks himself with some disguise lest he should be discovered to be a forreigner and consequently be obliged to trample upon the crucifix by this means they continue securely and free from danger in any city of japan for the space of four years which is the time allotted by their superiors for their stay in those parts after which time they are obliged to return to their own country and give place to other missionaries who are then sent to succeed them  among the rest there was a certain jesuit of avignon whose true name was father de rode descended of an honorable family who after he had learned the japanese language at the university of goa came into the island of formosa about the year      which was then and had been for some years subject to the empire of japan and being better qualified to be a tutor to young men than for any other employment he gave out that he was a native of japan descended of a rich father and that all his estate was divided among four wives and    sons he had left behind him besides daughters that he being the youngest the portion which fell to his share was so small that he was forced at twenty years of age to leave his fathers house and travel abroad to get a livelihood by teaching the latin tongue which he had been taught and that for this end he was come to formosa after he had been in several other parts of japan by chance this story happened to come to my fathers ears who sent for him and after he had seen and discoursed him he took him for a learned and welldisposed person and therefore resolved to take him into his house to teach me the latin tongue my father acquainted me with the design and told me that i should give over the learning of the greek tongue which i was then studying because i might learn it at any time in our own academies and that i must make use of the present opportunity of learning the latin tongue by this man because he did not know when he should meet with the like opportunity i readily submitted to my fathers commands as in duty bound and father de rode seemed to be as glad of the opportunity as we were my father offered to allow him yearly    copans for instructing me in the latin tongue besides diet and cloths which he accepted of and so a bargain was struck between them now a copan is one pound weight in gold which in english money according to our way of value is about six crowns  after this he came and lived at my fathers house in xternetsa the capital city of formosa for the space of four years and behaved himself so well in all respects toward my father and my self that we were both very well satisfied with him he accompanied me to all places whither i went except when i entered into our temples for then he always left me at the gate because as he pretended he being a japanner was of a different religion from that which was established in the isle of formosa and therefore he said he would return home and worship his god after his own way in the mean time he took care to instruct me in all the articles of our religion as exactly as if he had believed it himself and never spoke so much to me as one word of christianity and indeed he employed his whole time and pains in teaching me the latin tongue and instructing me in the principles of our faith and of moral honesty in fine he appeared to me in all his discourse and actions to be a person of so great probity honesty and candor that i loved him almost as well as my father but at length after four years were expired when i had acquired a competent knowledge in the latin tongue he received letters whereby he was obliged to return into his own country and therefore he begged the favor of me that i would acquaint my father with his design of going away and pray him on his behalf that he would dismiss him and pay him the salary that was due to him according to the agreement made between them i loved him so well that i was mightily troubled to hear of his departure and therefore being ignorant of the secret mystery of his mission i did all that i could to divert him from leaving the place but he declard that he was fully resolved to be gone and travel over the world and see all other other countries and especially those that were christian which he extolled above all others commending them highly upon several accounts which i afterward found to be false in answer to this i told him smiling what are you mad to go among the christians where you will be killed for your religion as we kill them here upon the account of theirs but he very seriously affirmed the contrary and assured me that the christians were very good men and that they were so far from any cruelty that they were always kind and generous to strangers and entertained them very civilly and nobly besides he told me that he did not believe those men who were formerly in japan to be true christians as they pretended themselves to be for said he i have discoursed with many japanners who have been in christian countries and they mightily commended both the country and the inhabitants for the country said they was the most pleasant place in the world and the christian natives gave them a very honorable reception they showed them all the curiosities of art and nature that were in those parts and when they came away the christians so loaded them with gifts and presents that they returned home to their own country with great riches upon which accounts the same japanners continue still to praise the christians and their countries my tutor added farther that in these countries there is great plenty of those things which are here very scarce and precious and besides there are many curious and valuable things in the christian countries which were never seen nor known in japan or formosa lastly he told me that he would not stay any long time in christendom but only for the space of two or three years at most that he intended to spend three years in his travels for as soon as he departed hence he would go to china and from thence to the east indies and after he had continued some time in these parts he resolved to sail for africa and from thence into europe and there continued he i shall see spain france germany italy holland etc the worst of which is more beautiful and pleasant than this island of formosa and at length after i have traveled over all the parts of the known world which are most celebrated either for the curiosities of nature or the improvements of arts and sciences i shall return home to my own native country full freighted with the riches and experience i have gained and then i shall have nothing else to do but to spend the remaining part of my life in mirth and good company for all persons of ingenuity will be glad to see me and delight to hear me discourse of the strange rarities i have observed in other countries of their different and surprising manners and customs of their laws and politics in time of peace and war of the wonderful improvments of arts beyond what is known in our native country of their methods of trade and commerce and lastly of the several notable accidents which happened to me in my travels and by these so pleasant and useful relations i shall purchase to myself great honor and esteem these things he represented to me with such enticing circumstances that i could not but think with my self he had a mind to persuade me to go along with him and i being then a young man about    years of age was the more easily prevailed upon for by the allurements he mentioned he did so strike my fancy and excite my curiosity of seeing the christian countries he so much commended that i could not forbear to tell him that if there was no danger but we might safely return again after five or six years into our native country i had a great mind to be his companion and travel with him through all these countries but he dissembling his design upon me seemed to be very averse to my proposal and told me in a feigned passion god forbid that ever i should entice you away from your fathers house if he should know that i had any such design what could i expect but that he would presently put me to death and therefore i pray you continued he talk no more to me of any such things but after he had inflamed my desire of seeing of the foresaid countries by the charming prospect he gave of them this seeming refusal did rather irritate than extinguish my curiosity and therefore i was still the more importunate that i might accompany him in his travels and to remove his jealousies and fears i promised him very seriously that i would never speak one word of our design to any soul alive but carry it on with the greatest secrecy that his own heart could wish but notwithstanding my promises he still seemed to continue backwards and unwilling to consent to my desire upon account of the danger that attended him which provoked me to repeat with greater earnestness my solemn asseverations and vows of secrecy and fidelity until at last after a long conference and reiterated supplications and assurances he condescended to tell me plainly that he had always a great opinion of my candor and sincerity and he believed i had some respect for him as indeed i had a great love and honor for him that now he was resolved to show the great confidence he had in me by putting his life in my hands which he looked upon as the strongest obligation to fidelity and therefore continued he since you are so urgent to be my fellowtraveller i am willing to take you along with me but then you must be sure to be very cautious and manage all things so secretly that nothing may happen which will give the least suspicion of our design after the main matter was thus agreed between us he used great freedom with me in concerting the manner of our escape and securing some part of a fund for subsisting us in our travels to this purpose he told me one day in our private conversation your father is a rich man and has great plenty of gold both in money and goods and since we are to undertake so long and expensive a voyage it will be very convenient that we should take a good quantity of this gold along with us which will help to defray our expenses but then to prevent all danger of discovery nothing of this nature must be attempted till such time as we intend to make our escape and then about midnight we shall seize upon all the gold and money we can safely come at and pack up our bagage and march off to the next port were we may have a ship  having thus fixed our matters when the time appointed came i made ready to be gone and carried off with me besides other necessaries for our journey    pound weight in gold partly in money and partly in vtensils viz one piece of coined gold called rockmo weighing   pounds   copans whereof each being a piece of coined gold weighs   pound and    pound weight of gold in utensils as pots plates etc besides what i took in silver and steel money to the value of  00 crowns or thereabout with this stock of gold and money my tutor and i set forth having left all my fathers family fast asleep and we arrived about midnight at a port of the sea called by the formosans khadzey which is distant from my fathers house in xternetsa about nine english miles and there i met with one of my fathers baleons or galleys and commanded the steersman to carry me to luconia pretending i had earnest business to dispatch there for my father luconia is the chief of the philippine isles distant from khadzey about  00 leagues where we stayed about eight days during which time i kept the steers man and all the mariners there lest they should return back and acquaint my father where i was and after eight days we found a ship going to goa in which we embarked and arrived at goa distant from luconia about a  000 leagues there we continued about six weeks during which time we were very civily and nobly treated in the monastery of the jesuits which my tutor told me was a house built by the christians for entertaining foreigners and indeed by the kind reception we met with there he did in some measure convince me of the truth of what he had formerly told me in formosa about the probity and generosity of the christians after six weeks were expired we went a board on ship that was going from goa to spain and arrived at gibralter in the space of nine or ten months where i was forced to stay for the space of five weeks being very much indisposed by the change of climates air and diet at length after my recovery we sailed from gibralter toward toulon which is a seaporttown in france where i saw a great many several sorts of monks in different habits which seemed strange to me whereupon i asked my tutor who these men were who told me they were men come from different parts of the world for trade and commerce and that every one of them wore the habit of his own country and as we passed through thoulon marseils and aix in provence i observed a great many crosses on the road which moved me to tell my tutor surely there must be a great many thieves in this country where there are so many gallows but he answered that these gallows were only intended to fright thieves and robbers by the terror of such a violent death and we arrived at last at avignon before i knew my tutor to be a christian but after we went into the monastery of the jesuits there when i perceived the porter call him by his name show him great respect and talk to him in their langage i began to doubt of my tutor whether he were not a christian and when i saw all the fathers of the convent come to him salute him and congratulate his safe return and after that all his kindred and lastly all the noble men and gentlemen of the city came to visit him and express their great joy for his safe arrival i could no longer keep silence but asked him whether he had not been here before how it came to pass that so many people in this city received him very gladly and prayed him to tell the me truth how the matter stood whereupon he confessed to me ingeniously that he was a native of that country and that h dd profess the christian religion and tn he assured me that i should find all things true both as to the country and the inhabitants which he had told me in the isle of formosa i have indeed added he brought you from your fathers house but you know you were very willing and desirous to come along with me and now i will make you a very fair offer if you be willing to learn we will instruct you in all the principles of our religion and if you can be persuaded to embrace it we will take care to provide so well for you that you shall live as well here as you did at home but if you have a mind to return into your own country we will assist you and furnish you with necessaries for your journey this last part of his proposal was only a copy of his countenance which he never intended to make good as appeared by the sequel for he knew there was no advantage to be reaped by my return into my own country which he might expect if i continued there by making a convert of me to their religion however this discourse made me very thoughtful and anxious and when i reflected seriously upon my condition and the great danger to which i was reduced i was so astonished that i knew not what to say or do yet i concluded with my self it would be my safest and best way to give my tutor and the rest of the fathers good words and carry my self fairly toward them lest they should treat me after the same way as we do the christians in our country of which i was sometimes very apprehensive at length to show my self tractable and gain their good opinion i made them this frank offer that if they could show me greater evidence for the truth of their religion than i could show for the truth of mine i was ready to renounce my own religion and embrace theirs father de rode presently accepted of this proposal hoping i would yield to his arguments upon the first onset but to procure himself the greater glory he gave out that i was the son of a king how truly god knows and that i had accompanied him into europe out of a desire i had to embrace the christian religion  there were only three ways by which they could hope to make a convert of me by arguments and demonstrative proofs by flattering insinuations and fair promises or by threats and violence by arguments they could not convince me for i was able to show greater absurdities in their religion than they could prove in mine and particularly in their doctrine of transubstantiation against which i argued several ways as first from the testimony of our senses viz of seeing feeling tasting all which do assure us that it is bread which we receive in the sacrament and not flesh if therefore we believe our senses we cannot believe that the substance of the bread is changed into the natural flesh of christ which is corporally present in this sacrament and then i proved that we must believe the testimony of our senses because upon them depends the certainty of the relations we have concerning the miracles wrought by jesus christ for the confirmation of his doctrine for if those who were eyewitnesses could not be certain by their senses that such miracles were wrought as are related in the life of christ than we have no certainty of the truth of these relations which depends upon the testimony of those eyewitnesses who affirm that they saw such miracles wrought by christ and consequently all the evidence for the truth of christianity from the miracles pretended to be wrought in confirmation of it is subverted and destroyed thus the belief of transubstantiation is inconsistent with the belief of these miracles for if we believe them we must allow the testimony of sense to be a sufficient proof of them but if we believe transubstantiation we must renounce our senses and deny them to be a certain proof of any thing we see or feel  secondly i argued that their doctrine of transubstanatition must be false because the same body cannot at the same time be in two distant places but according to their doctrine the same body of christ was corporally present in a  000 distant places at the same time viz in all those places where this sacrament is celebrated over the face of the whole earth however distant and remote from one another their distinction which they applied to this argument that the same body could not be in more places than one circumscriptive but only definitive appeared to me frivolous and impertinent for still it appeared to me impossible that the same body should be corporally present though it were only definitive as they called it in several distant places at the same time for then the same body might be killed and dead in one place while it was alive in another  thirdly i argued that when christ said at the institution of this sacrament do this in remembrance of me he supposed that he would be absent from them when they should celebrate this sacrament for it is neither necessary nor usual to remember a friend present but only one that is absent and therefore these words of christ do this in remembrance of me do plainly imply that he is not bodily present in this sacrament i argued that their doctrine of transubstantiation could not be true because it supposed that the accidents of bread as they call them remained without the substance and the substance of christs flesh was corporally present without the accidents that are peculiar to flesh both which appeared to me impossible for i cannot conceive how the whiteness of bread can subsist when there is nothing that is white and how there can be the substance of flesh which can neither be seen felt nor tasted  these were some of the arguments i urged against their doctrine of transubstantiation to which i could never receive a satisfactory answer and though they alleged several arguments to turn me from heathenism yet because i thought there were greater absurdities in their religion than they could show in mine i still adhered to my own religion and therefore finding that by arguments they could not prevail they attempted to bribe my affections and so win me over to their party by many fair promises and wheedling insinuations but i knew so well their insincerity and cheating tricks by their counterfeiting themselves to be heathens in formosa and by breaking their promise of allowing me liberty of conscience that i could put no confidence in any promises they made me and besides i very well knew that i could have more riches and honor if i should return into my own native country than i could expect from them in fine the earnest desire and probable hope i had of returning to my father being joined with the fear of continuing in this remote country far distant from my relations among strangers and hypocrites made me flight all the offers they made me which induced them at last to use threats and violence and these i endured with great meekness and endeavored to mittigate their anger with soft words while in the mean time i was contriving and preparing by the most probable means i could think of to make my escape out of their hands  i continued at avignon for the space of    months six in the monastery of the jesuits and nine in other places see the appendix while i continued in the monastery i found they were continually teasing and persecuting me with enticements and arguments to embrace their religion and therefore to get rid of them i pretended a great desire to hear their public prelections for which end i went sometimes to their schools of philosophy and sometimes of theology but being still liable to their troublesome solicitations at last i left the monastery and took a private lodging in the city where i lived at my own proper charges and because they had a great part of my money in their hands which they thought i would not leave behind me they gave me leave to satisfy my curiosity and ramble over the countries round about which i did traveling from city to city for the space of six months after i returned to avignon again i continued there only for the space of three months from the time i first took a private lodging in that city and they welcomed me and seemed at first to receive me very kindly but when they found that i put off from day to day to declare my self a convert then they begun to attack me more closely and told me plainly we have waited a long time to receive you into the bosom of the catholic church and used many arguments to convince you of the truth of our religion but since you still continue obstinate we must desire you to take notice that we can no longer bear with your delays for hitherto we have entreated the fathers inquisitors that they would not give you any trouble which they have forbore to do upon our request but now since you have rejected all the fair means that we have used for so long a time for your conversion they are resolved not to wait any longer and to show they were in good earnest about eight days after there came letters from the grand inquisitor expressly requiring that i should be put into the inquisition unless i would embrace the christian religion whether these letters were real or supposititious i know not but this is certain that the inquisitors showed me such letters and withal told me that if i did not change my religion within ten days they were obliged to imprison me the jesuits were present when these things were done who having consulted with the inquisitors they both agreed to allow me fifteen days wherein to make a public profession of their religion the reason of granting me this further time was this because the day on which they spoke to me was the first of august and the   th of that month being according to them the day of the assumption of the blessed virgin they had a great mind that i should publicly declare my conversion and be baptized on that solemn festival all these proposals i was forced to submit unto and durst not refuse them in my present circumstances whereupon they conceiving good hopes of me began anew to explain to me the mysteries of their religion which they did by similitudes thus for example they illustrated to me the mystery of the trinity by the similitude of a piece of cloth which is thrice folded which notwithstanding the three folds is one and the same cloth they would never allow me to read the bible but they furnished me with abundance of books about the miracles pretended to be wrought by some of their saints in confirmation of their peculiar opinions for the first four or five days of the fifteen which were allotted me i heard with great appearance of submission all the demonstrations they pretended to give for their doctrines and when they answered my arguments with philosophical distinctions and used a multitude of hard words which were to me unintelligible i granted all that they said and confessed they had almost made me a convert for when i said that i could not understand those answers or philosophical arguments this father de rode began to say to me my dear since you cannot understand what this reverend father says i will explain it to you in your own japanois language and so instead of explaining it to me he said my dear son you see that the fathers inquisitors have a great mind to put you into the inquisition because you will not confess your self a convert therefore it would be better for you to say that you understand what they say than to be any longer obstinate their arguments are very well grounded and reasonable but you cannot conceive the strength of them therefore let me desire you to say publicly that you are now persuaded of the goodness of their arguments and that you dont require any more so i was obliged to speak in latin and say now i understand very well let us come to another article  but still i trusted under god to my heels hoping by some means or other to get out of their hands and to run away in such a road that they should not be able to find me out again after ten days of the fifteen were expired i had sold all that i had and then i attempted to get out of the city but i found that the sentinel who watched at the gate to which i came was expressly forbidden to suffer me to go out such care was taken by the inquisitors to prevent my escape however i did not despair but being returned to my lodging i put off my japan clothes which i had hitherto wore and clad my self after the mode of the country and then i attempted to pass out by another gate but i was so much taken notice of by all the people that were in the city that the soldier who stood sentinel at that gate knew me under the disguise of my clothes and stopped me this second disappointment frighted me not a little but having recollected my spirits i considered that money rules the world and prevails over the generallity of men and therefore i offered the soldier a pistol if he would suffer me to go out which he accepted of and so let me go hoping it could never be discovered that he was the man that did it thus god delivered me out of the hands of the jesuits and inquisitors from whom i could expect no mercy if i had not in hypocrisy professed their religion which i could never heartily believe  having thus made my escape out of avignon i traveled along the river rhone with all the speed i could as far as lions from lions i went to salines from salines to brisac and at last from brisac i traveled by the side of the rhone as far as andernach where the soldiers of the elector of colen seized me by force according to the orders they had received from the elector to press all passengers that came that way to fill up the new regiments he was raising there were then three companies in andernach three in lintz and six in bonn whether all the other companies resorted being the place appointed for their rendezvous and when they were all come together my captain thinking to gratify the colonels curiosity acquainted him with what i had told him that i was a native of the isle formosa belonging to emperor of japan and by religion a pagan that i had traveled from this far distant country to satisfy my curiosity of seeing europe having heard strange things about it but the colonel who was a savoyard and called le chevalier st maurice being a bigot of the romish church thought it a damnable thing to retain a pagan in the service of the elector who being informed about me commanded me to be carried to some jesuits that they might endeavor to convert me whereupon i was obliged to go with the colonel and some other officers to the jesuits with whom i was to dispute about religion though i knew very well by my former experience that they are not able by strength of argument to convince any man and much less a jew a turk or a heathen and now being well acquainted with their opinions before hand and the several evasions and distinctions they made use of to defend them i was the better prepared to enter the lists with the jesuits against whom i endeavored to demonstrate that there were greater absurdities in their religion than they could show in mine which i did with so much readiness and briskness and such a fair appearance of reason that the colonel cried out like one astonished it was not i that spoke but some devil that spoke within me at last one of the jesuits took me aside to a private place and told me that i was in a most miserable condition if i should continue in the pagan religion but if i would declare my self a convert to the romish faith he was able to obtain great things for me from the prince elector but i told him he should first convince me of the truth of his religion before he made me any such promises which he not being able to do i slighted his offer and continued still in my own religion whereupon the colonel was so exasperated against me that he threatened to throw me into prison and feed me with bread and water until such time as i should declare my self a convert but my captain who was much the honester man of the two having seized me by force would not suffer any hurt to be done me and therefore prayed the colonel to permit me to go off and to grant me a pass for traveling whethersoever i would which was presently done after i got out of bonn i continued my journey till i came to colen and there the sentinel who kept the gate seized me again and carried me before the captain of the main guard to whom i showed my dismission out of bonn upon the account of my religion but he told me if others be fools i am not though you are a pagan you may serve in the army as well as the best christian and so i was obliged to list my self a soldier in that regiment the colonel whose name was buchwald and the major who was my captain and whose name was warmsdorff were both lutherans the lieutenant colonel whose name was vanduil was a roman catholic and many of the officers in the regiment were calvinists and all of them belonged to the prince of mechlenburg but the regiment was hired by the dutch for some years  the colonel and my captain sent for some lutheran ministers whereof one was at colen another at a village about an hour distant and two more who served in the brandenburg regiments all these four came and disputed with me about religion for a whole day but their consubstantiation offended me as much as the roman transubstantiation  for it is liable to many of the same absurdities with the romish doctrine about the eucharist first because it denies the certainty of our senses in the proper objects and consequently destroys their great evidence of the christian religion from the miracles wrought in confirmation of it which depends upon the testimony of their senses who were eyewitnesses of them secondly the lutheran doctrine as well as the romish supposes that the body of christ which is now glorious and immortal in heaven is corporally present in the eucharist and at the same time in all those places where this sacrament is celebrated which appeared to me impossible  but besides these absurdities which are common to them both the lutheran doctrine is encumbred with several that are peculiar to it for first they say that these words this is my body are to be understood literally and that the substance of the bread is really present so that according to their interpretation the meaning of the words is this substance of the bread is really the flesh of christ which is a contradiction in terminis for it is plainly impossible that the same substance should at the same time be both bread and flesh secondly they affirm that the bread in the eucharist is the sacrament and sign of christs body and at the same time that it is the real body whereas it is impossible that the same thing should be both the sign and the thing signified or that any thing should be a sign of it self thirdly they maintain that the body of christ is alive in the eucharist for they deny the popish sacrifice of the mass wherein the body is slain and offered up which being united to the divinity is certainly the object of adoration and yet they deny that it is to be worshipped  these and several other arguments i urged against the lutherans whereby they perceived that they were not likely to convince me of the truth of their doctrine about the eucharist whereupon the minister who lived at the village near colen took me home with him and kept me there for fifteen days and thither the captain came also and both of them joined together in making me many large promises to entice me to declare for their religion but i continued inflexible and could not be prevailed upon by any such motives after this the lieutenant colonel who was a roman catholic carried me to the capuchins and from them to the jesuits but all the means they could use with me proved ineffectual at last the officers that were calvinists carried me to a minister of their church who dealt so effectually with me that he almost convinced me of the truth of the christian religion because he removed those stumbling blocks which were laid in the way by the papists and lutherans but when he proposed to me the doctrine of absolute predestination and endeavored to prove it from scripture i was so shocked by the apparent absurdity of it that i begun to doubt of all those things he had convinced me of before whereupon i told him if absolute predestination was necessary to be believed then it was a sign of my reprobation that i could not be persuaded to believe it besides i added further that supposing absolute predestination i should never be condemned for my infidelity but because i was reprobated by an absolute and eternal decree of god and lastly i insisted upon this argument that i could not be persuaded to believe in christ unless i were certain that christ died for me but supposing absolute predestination i could never be certain of this because christ died only for those who were to be saved by an absolute decree and it was impossible for me to know whether i was one of that number or no these and suchlike arguments i proposed to him but he to excuse himself for not answering them pretended that i was obstinate and would not be convinced by reason and thus after all the attempts that had been made to convert me to christianity i continued still firm in my old religion in the mean time our regiment marched from colen to boisleduc in holland where some calvinist ministers came to see me rather out of curiosity than any design of converting me whom i opposed with the argument against predestination which i last mentioned but could never meet with any satisfactory answer to it from the bosch we marched to sluse in flanders where we stayed for the space of three months and a half during which time the most generous and candid brigadier lauder who was then governor of sluse invited to his house a minister of the french church called d amalvy this french minister who had a good opinion of himself for a very learned man challenged me to dispute with him about religion and time and place were agreed upon when the day came there appeared a great multitude of learned men who came to hear us and in the presence of them all d amalvy made me this offer that if i could show greater evidence for my religion than he could show for his he was ready to renounce his own religion and embrace mine and in return for this frank offer i promised him to do the same thing if he could give me clearer demonstrations for the truth of his religion than i could for mine having thus settled the preliminaries i was first to give an account of the god we adored and our manner of worshipping him which i did as well as i could extempore but when i told him that we are commanded by our god to offer up infants in sacrifice to him he stopped me and asked does not this savor of cruelty in your god that he will have men sacrificed to him to which i answered that it was indeed most cruel to require such human sacrifices but from hence i took occasion to retort the argument upon him by showing that his god was yet more cruel according to his opinion of him for if it be cruel to deprive men of this temporal life though by this means they are admitted to eternal life certainly it is infinitely more cruel to create men on purpose to make them eternally miserable and to condemn them to this misery before they are born without any respect to the good or evil they shall do and so to sacrifice them to the devil to this retortion he could not answer and so i proceeded further to inform him that our god did appear to us in the shape of an elephant an ox etc and that under these shapes we worshipped him against this apparition of god under such figures he objected that it was impossible that god who was omnipotent infinite immense incomprehensible and eternal could be included in the body of such a beast to which i answered that if it is impossible for god to be included in the body of such a beast he was bound to maintain the like absurdity by the principles of his own religion for said i you believe that the holy ghost who is god infinite immense etc did appear under the shape of a dove which is much less than either an elephant or an ox to this he made no reply and though there were many present who would have answered this and other arguments yet he commanded them all to be silent and would suffer no body to speak but himself in fine he exhorted me very much to the practice of christian humility and meekness as if he intended to reserve to himself alone the privilege of pride and arrogance which i could plainly discern by his words and actions to be very predominant in his temper thus this conference ended without producing any good effect upon me and if by gods providence i had not met with a better guide to direct me in the course i should steer to arrive at a safe harbor in this dangerous sea of controversies i must have split upon the rocks and shelves of the absurd opinions i met with among some sort of christians and adheard more obstinately than ever to the idoltry in which i was educated for i could never bring my mind to believe such a scheme of the christian religion as was proposed but not demonstrated by him such a system of religion could never find entertainment with me which places cerberus in the very threshold i mean which imposes as a necessary article of faith the horrible decree of absolute reprobation for this doctrine gives a very odious and frightful idea of a most good and gracious god by representing him as cruel and tyranical to his poor creatures as one that designs and delights in their eternal ruin it perfectly overturns all religion by destroying the use of all laws and their rewards and punishments to those that are f etterd with the adamantine chains of this fatal decree who according to the calvinists are the greatest part of mankind but while i was in this uncertain and dangerous condition it pleased god who is infinitely wise and good and will not suffer that religion which he has planted and maintained by his own almighty power to be checked in its progress by the ignorance or mistake of his ministers i say it pleased this good god to provide for me such a judicious and honest guide as was very successful in all things relating to my conversion who proposed to me the christian religion in its purity without those monstrous doctrines of transubstantiation consubstantiation and absolute predestination a religion that was not embarassd with any of those absurdities which are maintained by the many various sects in christendom whereof he gave me a scheme in a mathematical method by way of difinitions axioms postulata and propositions which he divided into   parts whereof the first contains the grounds of the christian religion in general the second contains the particular grounds of the church of england as it is a society distinct from all schismatical assemblies and first the grounds of the christian religion he proposed in the following order whereby i was through gods mercy delivered from the errors and superstitions of my pagan religion  the grounds of the authors conversion definitions defin   by god i understand a being infinite uncreated eternal etc containing in himself all perfections that either astually exist or are possible   a thing is said to be created for the glory of god which manifests one or more of his attributes according to its natural state and power   by miracles i understand certain effects that are clear and evident which exceed all the powers of natural causes and are designed for the confirmation of a good religion   by revelation i understand the extraordinary manifestation of the divine will which men by their natural faculties could not attain to   by religion i understand that worship or way of worshipping which god requires of us and we owe unto him   by creatures of the same kind i understand either such as are vegetative sensitive or rational etc   that is said to exist by absolute necessity without which nothing else can exist axioms   all creatures are not endowed with equal perfections   two or more propositions contradicting two or more propositions cannot be both true   if there be two or more things consisting of two or more propositions which are repugnant to one another these things cannot be both true   there are different religions in the world   all different religions whatsoever consist of a certain number of propositions which are either all false or all true or partly false partly true   unless we had a thinking faculty the glory of god would not appear to us   the stronger the faculty is in any man the more clearly are the properties of a thing conceived by him viz of that thing which is the object of the faculty   nothing can be made by nothing postulata   that the glory of god the public good and the advantage of every private man be the great ends which are designed by all true religion   that men must either believe something or nothing   that nothing be believed without sufficient evidence   that those things which have the same or equal degrees of evidence should obtain wtih us the same or an equal degree of assent propositions   there is a god   all things were created for his glory   the more we know of an object the more naturally speaking should the contemplation of that object excite in us the love or hatred of it   all the different religions in the world proceed either from the love or hatred of the object of our adoration or the different degrees of these affections   no worship is to be given to god which is not grateful to him   all the religions in the world taken collectively are not acceptable to god   there is one religion considered distinctly by it self which alone is grateful to god   men in their natural state cannot discover this one religion   there are certain means whereby the true religion may be discerned from those that are false  0 revelation is absolutely necessary    it is most agreeable to the wisdom of god that the creatures of the same kind should express the glory of god in one and the same harmonious manner nay this is a thing inseparable from the nature of these creatures    god may reveal himself more or less to mankind according to his own good pleasure    the more universal the evidence is for any revelation the more perfect and universal the religion it self is    that religion was never designed by god to be embraced by all mankind which had not the degrees of evidence proportionable to that universality    that revelation is of all others most perfect whose evidence is most universal    that revelation and consequently religion is justly to be esteemed most universal whose evidence is so clear that none can call it in question if he believes any thing and which contains such arguments exciting men to the practice of it as are suited to the meanest capacity upon these sure foundations laid down by my faithful guide which he more particularly explained and proved to me by word of mouth the divine grace assisting me i did heartily embrace the christian religion  and i will be bold to affirm that if any one shall carefully examine all the religions in the world by the rules aforementioned it will plainly appear that neither the jewish nor pagan nor mohammedan religion but only the christian has a just title to be the universal religion of mankind  but then finding there were several societies of christians i was for some time doubtful to which communion i should join my self for the ministers of the dutch church endeavored to persuade me to their communion alleging that a church governed by bishops was not agreeable to scripture and the primitive church and on the contrary mr innes affirmed and endeavored to prove that episcopal government was the most ancient and the primitive form of government that was used in the christian church but while i was thus doubtful at length certain principles were agreed upon between them both which being proposed in a mathematical method and clearly demonstrated removed all doubts out of my mind and fixed me to be a most faithful member of the church of england  these principles were proposed to me in the following order  definitions   by a certain order of men i understand some select persons in a society enjoying a power or privilege which is not communicable to every particular member of that society   by ordination i understand a power received of another or others for administering the holy sacraments and other sacred ordinances according to our blessed saviors institution   by a church i understand a society of men believing and professing the christian doctrine and having a power of administering the holy sacraments and other sacred ordinances according to our blessed savours institutions postulata   a society may be said to have a power when one or more of the society are vested with it though every particular member cannot pretend to it   what absolute necessity obliges a society to do in time of confusion ought not to be made a standard for the same or another society when they come to enjoy their power or privileges without any disturbance nay in this case necessity makes not the thing lawful but pardonable only and loses its name when any escape occasioned by it can be redressed   in matters of fact a supposition of the contrary being possible is not sufficient to enervate the truth of what is passed i e none can say such a thing has not been so because perhaps it could have been otherwise axioms   nothing is to be believed in the christian religion but what is built upon certain evidence   nothing is to be practiced by christians i mean in that capacity which is not believed   one man or number of men cannot give that to another man or another number of men which they themselves have not and is not in their power propositions   there has been a church of christians upon earth since the days of our blessed savior and his apostles   the church has no power but what she has derived from our blessed savior and his apostles   the apostles were clothed with a power which was not communicable to all christians in general   all christians in general in the days of the apostles or the primitive church had not a power of administering the holy sacraments and preaching the gospel   those who had not this power themselves could not be in a capacity of communicating it to others   this power then has been continually lodged in a certain order of men to whom our blessed savior or his apostles did communicate it   this power has been transmitted down to us by this order of men inviolably and uninterruptedly from the first ages of the christian church   those are not a church who separate themselves from that or those societies of christians in whom the power of administering the holy sacraments and other sacred ordinances is only lodged   no person ought to join himself in communion with that society which has no power of administering the holy sacraments and other sacred ordinances  0 no man ought to assume to himself that power unless he receives it from those who are in a capacity of giving it    every one that receives it this way ought to be fully assured and have sufficient evidence that those from whom he receives it have a real power of granting it and a bare probability can never vindicate him from usurping that power    no man can be assured of this unless at the same time he has sufficient evidence that those who give it him be in the number of that order of men to whom the apostles did communicate this power to be transmitted down inviolably and uninterruptedly from the first ages of the christian church    there is no other way for people to be assured of this but by going backward from their own times to those of the apostles or the primitive church    those who cannot produce this evidence cannot be that order of men to whom the apostles did communicate this power to be inviolably and uninteruptedly preserved and transmitted down to us from the first ages of the christian church    the church of england is able to produce this evidence and consequently is in the number of that order of men to whom the apostles did communicate this power to be transmitted down to us inviolably and uninterruptedly from the first ages of the christian church these were the propositions concerning church communion that were given to me by my learned and judicious guide mr jnnes which i shall not now pretend to demonstrate but shall only add that by their native force and evidence all my doubts and scruples about the various societies of christians were dissolved and vanished away and i did heartily join my self to the church of england as a true apostolical church and free from all sorts of error either as to its government or doctrine i know very well that no truths are so clear but they may be liable to some objections from men of contrary principles but this i told to the ministers of sluice reverend sirs if ye can give me as clear a scheme of the principles upon which your communion is founded as this which is given me by mr jnnes i shall readily compare them together and determine my self according to the best of my judgment but until you do this you must pardon me that i do not join my self to your communion and since these good men never attempted to give me any such scheme i did frankly and publicly profess my self a member of the church of england  leaving therefore any further dispute about church communion i shall pursue the grounds and principles given me by my guide for demonstrating the truth and certainty of the christian religion and in doing this i shall observe this order in the following discourse viz    i shall prove the existence of a god by whom all things are created and distinctly explain the attributes of god   i shall consider the final causes for which god made the heaven and the earth and all things that are in them and from thence conclude that they were made by a most intelligent and wise being   i shall assert the necessity of a particular revelation from god to discover the manner in which he will be worshipped by mankind which worship is properly called by the name of religion   i shall produce such characteristicks and evidences whereby every one from the light of nature may distinguish between a true and false religion   i shall demonstrate the christian religion to be the only true religion revealed by god to mankind and that all the other religions in the world are false and lastly i shall answer the principal objections which i made while a heathen against the truth and certainty of the christian religion  sect i of the existence of god it is certain that the being of god is the foundation of all religion for all enquiries about the right way of worshipping him would be superfluous and impertinent unless we be first certain that there is a god the far greatest part of mankind as well pagans as others are agreed in the existence of a god yet because some do call it in question i shall endeavor to prove it by a few arguments that i may secure this fundamental doctrine of all revealed religion from all the attacks of unreasonable men  but before i proceed to these arguments it may be necessary to observe the various opinions of learned men concerning the means of attaining the knowledge of god some think that the notion of god is imprinted on the hearts of all men by nature others deny that there is any such idea of a god in the minds of men by nature some think that the knowledge of god is conveyed to us by revelation or derived by tradition from the first man who was immediately created by god but without entering upon a nice examination of these several opinions i hope this will be granted on all hands that by the right use of our rational faculties with the help of those principles that are known by the light of nature we may may arrive at the certain knowledge of god whose existence therefore i shall endeavor to demonstrate by the following arguments  argument i every thing that is must either be from it self or from another if it be from it self then it is uncreated independent and eternal and consequently god if from another seeing all second causes are produced by some other which give them being as we derive our original from our fathers and they from their fathers and so upwards then either these second causes must produce one another in infinitum without any beginning or the effect must sometimes produce a prior cause and so they must produce one another in a circle or we must acknowledge some first cause by which all other things are produced which is god  now there cannot be an infinite succession of causes producing one another from all eternity for every cause that produces a new thing out of nothing must have some beginning of its operation which must be perfected in a limited time and therefore there can be no such production of any thing from all eternity but every thing must be produced in a certain determinate time which is plainly inconsistent with the nature of eternity  and neither can there be any such circular production of causes whereby the last effect is the efficient of the first cause for then the same thing would be the cause of its cause it would be prior and posterior to its cause and to it self which is plainly impossible and therefore we must conclude that there is a first cause which is uncreated and the creator of all things else  arg ii i am sure that there is something now in the world for i am conscious to my self that i think i perceive i doubt which actions cannot proceed from nothing and therefore i am certain that there is a thinking being and from hence these two things will undeniably follow   st that there was something from all eternity for either there was always something and so there was an eternal being or there was a time when there was nothing and then nothing could ever have been for there is no principle more certain than this that nothing can produce nothing but every thing that has a being must be produced by something and therefore if there was a time when there was nothing nothing could ever have been produced   dly since it is certain that there is now in the world a thinking being which knows and understands from hence it will no less evidently follow that there was a knowing understanding being from all eternity for it is no less impossible for a being devoid of knowledge to produce a knowing being than for nothing to produce something and if there was a time when there was no such knowing being it could never have begun to be because there was no cause to produce it and therefore such a knowing being must be from eternity after the same manner we may deduce all the perfections of god for we find there is power wisdom and goodness in the world all which must be derived from the same eternal source for if there had been a time when these things were not they could never have begun to be there being then no cause to produce them and therefore this eternal being must be also most knowing powerful wise and good and be the first cause and original of all these perfections we find in the world for nothing can ever give to another any perfection that it has not in it self and therefore the first eternal cause of all things must contain in it all the perfections that can ever after exist  having thus established the existence of a god i shall next proceed to prove that he is the ruler of the world who directs and governs all things by his wise providence which will appear by considering   that all things in nature do act for certain ends which they attain by using proper means fitted to those ends that are designed but to design and pursue an end and make choice of fit means for compassing that end are such actions as require reason wisdom and foresight which no inanimate creature is capable of and therefore all inanimate creatures must be directed and guided by some wise superintendent in pursuing their several ends by proper means which themselves know nothing of   we see that all things in nature are subordinate to one another and made subservient to several excellent uses and purposes which must be the contrivance of a wise governor that rules over all  thus the plants and herbs serve for food to animals and both plants and animals are useful for many purposes to man as for food and physic and several other necessary ends in humane life man himself is wonderfully made all the parts of his body being wisely adapted to perform their several functions and mutually subservient to one another and to the good of the whole as might be largely proved by particular instances if it were necessary we cannot open our eyes but we meet with many arguments of a wise overruling providence for the air serves us to breath in and is so necessary to our life that it cannot subsist many minutes without it the earth supplies us with corn for food and wood for firing it supports or houses and furnishes the materials for buildings of them the sea serves to transport our ships and commodities to the most distant parts of the earth and to bring home into our harbors the products of all other countries the sun does not shine for himself but appears to be made on purpose to give light to them that live upon the earth and it is placed at such a convenient distance and moves in such a constant uniform course as is necessary to refresh all things on earth with its heat and to ripen all the fruits of the ground by which and many thousand other instances wherein the creatures are admirably fitted for useful and excellent purposes it plainly appears that the works of nature cannot possibly be the effects of blind chance and necessity but must be the contrivance of an allwise creator and governor   to these arguments we might add for a farther confirmation of this truth   st the universal consent of all nations which generally agree that there is one supreme god who made and governs the world   dly the natural power of conscience which reproves and torments a man for the heinous crimes he has committed though the person be above the fear of human punishment or the crime be committed so secretly as to escape all natural means of discovery in which cases conscience by its sentence does as it were bind a man over to the judgment of a superior invisible judge but i shall conclude all with this reflection that from what has been said it appears that though mankind had not any innate notion of a god yet they are endowed with such a rational faculty by which they can deduce the existence of a god from such principles as are universally known and acknowledged by the light of nature and this they can do without the help of revelation which must always presuppose the being of a god who makes that revelation  sect ii of the attributes of god in general although we conceive the divine essence in it self to be one and the same which consists in all possible perfection yet the attributes of god may be distinguished and called by peculiar names with respect to the different objects upon which they are exercised and the different operations that are exerted upon them not that there is any real diversity in god himself but only in our conceptions of him for such is the weakness of our understanding that we cannot in one thought comprehend all the divine perfections but are forced to represent them to our minds severally as exerting themselves upon different objects and so there is no difference in the attributes themselves but only in our manner of conceiving with respect to their different operations  but before we proceed to a particular enumeration of the divine attributes we must premise that these attributes are not to be confounded with the peculiar effects proceeding from them but these two are to be distinctly considered and explained thus justice is to be distinguished from punishment and goodness from beneficence as causes are commonly distinguished from their proper effects  this being premised we may divide the divine attributes into two sorts for there god is considered simply as a being and so spirituality and eternity are attributed to him or as a living being and so understanding and will are ascribed to him the attributes of god that are in the will may be considered two ways either after the manner of affections such as we feel in our selves and so love hatred anger desire joy and sorrow etc are attributed to god or after the manner of moral virtues as justice goodness longsuffering severity etc to which we may add as that which results from all his other attributes his glory and happiness  sect iii of the divine attributes in particular of the attributes which belong to to god as he is simply a being we shall reckon in the first place unity for god is properly and numerically one as being undivided in himself and divided from all other things and because the divine nature cannot be multiplied into different gods as the human nature is into several men therefore there is one only true god and there is no other god besides him  the second attribute which belongs to god as he is simply a being is spirituality for god is a spirit i e a most pure and immaterial being devoid of all bulk whose most essential act is cogitation and he is not only incorporeal but the most pure and simple of all spirits  the third attribute of this sort belonging to god is eternity which is nothing else but a duration that has neither beginning nor end but when we say that god is eternal both a part ante and a part post we include under this notion his immutability and affirm that god is free from all variation and change  the fourth attribute of god is his immensity whereby he fills all places and therefore when we say that god is immense we affirm that no place can contain him and that he is everywhere present in all imaginable spaces and so much may suffice for the explication of the first sort of attributes  the second sort of attributes are such as belong to him as he is a living being and in speaking to them we are first to consider his life as being the foundation of all this kind of attributes and their operations without which he could neither exist nor act as an intelligent being nor be capable of happiness which is contrary to the idea we have already framed of god  the second attribute of this sort is understanding which may be distinguished into knowledge and wisdom the object of the divine knowledge is every thing that is knowable all things that are have been or shall be all things that are possible and impossible when therefore we say that god is omniscient we affirm that god does   know himself and all his own infinite perfections   that he knows all things that are in himself or from himself or without himself within himself as his decrees from himself as his external actions of creation preservation etc without himself as the sins of men etc  the wisdom of god is that perfection in god whereby he foreknows and directs the means which he thinks fit for attaining a certain end which is either subordinate as the redemption of mankind which he accomplished by the incarnation of his only son or ultimate which is the demonstration of his own glory to which all other things are made subservient  the third attribute is the divine will which may be either considered as the faculty or the act of willing such and such things to be done for wise just and good ends such are all the decrees of god whereby he resolves within himself to accomplish certain ends by such means as conduce most to his own glory and these decrees are either absolute as those of the creation and sending his own son into the world or conditional as the decrees of saving mankind upon the conditions of faith and repentance  in the divine will we may consider two kinds of attributes whereof the first is conceived after the manner of the affections we feel in our selves the second is conceived after the manner of the moral virtues which in us do govern the affections  love in god is an affection whereby he delights in that which is good and in communicating himself unto it whence arises goodness this love includes in it self grace mercy etc  hatred is that affection which is opposite to love whereby god abhors every thing that is evil  anger has great affinity with hatred and in us it is an affection whereby we keep off any thing that is evil from our selves but in god it signifies his purpose of punishing evildoers  the justice of god does perfectly agree with his holiness and is that perfection whereby he always wills and does that which is good holy just and right and this is called universal justice but his particular justice is that which distributes to every one what is due or that whereby he rewards the good and punishes the evil and so it respects man as subject to the law of nature  this justice is tempered with mildness and longsuffering which are those perfections in god that restrain his anger against sinners without a great cause  the omnipotence of god is that perfection whereby he can do all things that do not imply a contradiction and is such a power as nothing can resist the glory of god is the excellency of the divine nature whereby he infinitely exceeds all the creatures the happiness of god is the result of all the divine perfections in which he cannot but take great complacency and so they make him infinitely happy by the contemplation of them  from what has been said we may infer that since god is a most simple being and his attributes are not really distinguished from one another his actions do not proceed from one attribute alone but from an harmonious concurrence of all his attributes together  sect iv of gods end in creating the world having thus established the existence of a god and proved him to be the creator and governor of all things so far as was necessary in a matter so clear and evident in it self i proceed now to consider the end which god might propose to himself in creating the world which must be such as is suitable to his own infinite perfections and seeing the glory of god is the result of his most excellent nature we cannot imagine that he did propose to himself any other end in all his works besides his own glory and this seems to me as clear as the sun at noonday but if all the creatures were made for the glory of god then it is certain that every one of them is bound to glorify god in that station wherein it was created and so we say that the heavens declare the glory of god because by them we come to the knowledge of god but man being the most perfect of all the visible creatures and endowed with the most excellent faculties ought so much the more to show forth the glory of god above all the other creatures by how much he is more capable and adapted by nature to that end and indeed the inanimate creatures can only silently commend their maker but it is the duty of man to make their praises vocal and to declare the infinite power wisdom and goodness of god which plainly appear in the works of the creation and this is the great end for which his faculties were given him by god for therefore has he eyes to see and an understanding to perceive and apprehend the wonderful works therefore has he a tongue given him to publish the praise that is due to his most excellent and bountiful creator whether therefore we consider the end for which man was created or the many and great benefits he has received from god as the creating him of such an excellent nature his preservation etc he cannot but be sensible that he is strictly obliged to worship and serve him in some way or other for all men will own that we ought not only to remember our benefactors but to return them hearty thanks suitable to the greatness of the benefits we have received  sect v of the necessity of a divine revelation and   since the divine favors are so great and so valuable it is certain that no man can render him any worship and service that is equivalent to them   since god is a most perfect and simple being he will be worshipped in a perfect and simple manner but it is impossible that mankind should now in its present state of corruption unanimously agree in the true way of worshipping god if it were left to their invention for besides that the reason of men is infinitely various according to their different tempers capacities prejudices of education etc human nature is so much corrupted and does daily so far degenerate more and more as we find by sad experience that they can neither discern the right manner of worshipping god nor perform him pure and acceptable service  besides supposing that mankind could agree in a certain form of divine service and preserve it sound and entire yet still this doubt would always remain in their minds whether such a worship were acceptable to god or no for whether we offer to him gifts or sacrifices they all belong to him as lord of the whole creation nay if we should sacrifice to him our soul and body we give him nothing but what we have received of his free bounty and therefore we can never be certain that we are acceptable to him by any thing we can do or offering we can make and this is what socrates said of old a little before his death i have labored all my lifetime and done what i could to render my self acceptable to god and yet i still doubt whether i have pleased him as regis relates in his discourse of philosophy from whence we may conclude that mankind by nature is so much mistaken in their notions of god and has so far erred from the right way of worshipping him being wholly addicted to sensible things and pleasures that a revelation from god was absolutely necessary to teach him the true knowledge of god and of his will particularly as to the manner of performing him acceptable service and therefore our infinitelygood and merciful god taking pity of the natural blindness of mankind was pleased of his infinite goodness to reveal his will to them and the particular manner wherein he will be worshipped and this revelation being once made all men to whom it is sufficiently proposed are bound as they hope for salvation and would avoid eternal torment to keep the commands of god and observe that form of divine worship which he himself has prescribed which observation of divine worship is that which is commonly called religion  but before we proceed to treat of religion it may be necessary to observe that because men are stiffnecked and slow to believe divine truth therefore lest any should call in question the revelation that comes from god and take him for an impostor who delivered it twas necessary that it should be confirmed by certain evidence the better to persuade men to believe that it came from god and so we find that the christian religion was confirmed by miracles and supernatural signs at the time of its first publication and because cunning and ingenious men may do many things by their extraordinary art and skill which may seem to us miraculous when they really are not we shall hereafter show how any man may discern between a true miracle and that which is falsely pretended to be one this being premised i shall now subjoyn  sect vi of religion in general since god is a most perfect being it is certain that he cannot contradict himself and establish two contrary religions having different and inconsistent objects of worship and therefore when we see so many different religions in the world every one of which is contrary to another and condemns another we must conclude that only one of these religions is true and of divine authority and that the rest are human inventions frauds and forgeries it concerns us therefore to enquire after the means whereby we may distinguish the true religion from those that are false  these means may be considered two ways either with respect to the evidence or to the object we have already observed that the great evidence of the true religion is the miracles that are wrought for the confirmation of it but that we may be able to discern true miracles from those that are counterfeit i shall lay down the three chief conditions which are requisite in a true miracle the first is that he who works a miracle should know beforehand that he is to work it and have a mind to do it the second is that it be certainly known that the miracle or sign was wrought and that the effect of it be obvious to our senses the third that the thing done be such as transcends all the power of natural causes which may be done two ways the first is when it so far transcends all the powers of nature that it appears plainly impossible to be wrought by them as the raising of the dead to life again the second is when the thing done is such as does not exceed the force of natural causes but the manner of doing it is plainly supernatural as the curing of diseases by a wordspeaking without applying any remedy  as to the object of true religion it ought to respect the glory of god the public good and the private good of every particular man and these are the means which i think sufficient for discerning a true religion from that which is false for   as to miracles it is certain that god will not exert his almighty power to confirm a lie and justify an impostor   as to the object of religion it is likewise certain that every false religion which is invented by a deceiver is attended with some absurdity in its doctrine or precepts and contains in it something either contrary to the divine nature or the good and welfare of mankind if therefore we can discover such a religion as has the abovementioned evidence and object we may safely conclude that it is revealed by god but if it be defective in either of these two we must believe that it is false and ought to be rejected by all  sect vii of the christian religion in general and particularly of the miracles wrought in confirmation of it it would be an endless as well as useless work to run over all the several religions that are in the world for choosing one from among them which is established upon good principles and sure foundations and therefore i shall single out the christian religion as that which seems to me at the first proposal to be more excellent than the rest and endeavor to prove that it is founded upon the clearest and strongest evidence that any rational man can desire in matters of that nature and this i hope will give full satisfaction to the reader of the following discourse if he be a christian and i desire him to judge for himself in this case by comparing his own religion with all the other religions professed in the world and he will undoubtedly find it to excel all the rest for the reasonableness and certainty of its doctrines and the holiness and goodness of its laws but if the reader be a jew a turk or heathen i hope he will take the pains to compare his own religion impartially with the christian and i doubt not he will quickly perceive on which side the advantage lies as to the evidence of principles and goodness of precepts for   the miracles of christ were infinitely more numerous and greater than those of moses and mahomet never pretended to work any miracles for confirmation of his religion but used the sword only for its propagation and as to the pagans the strange feats which they pretend to are either ridiculous and incredible or the tricks and forgeries of their priests which cannot endure a fair trial as will appear more fully hereafter at present i shall apply my self to the consideration of christs miracles and show that they have all the characteristicks of true miracles and that they were undoubtedly wrought by him for the confirmation of his religion when it was first delivered in judaea  and   the miracles of christ have all the three conditions aforementioned which are requisite in true miracles for   christ knew beforehand that he was to do his miracles and freely chose to work them in some places and not in others as appears from the history of his life recorded by the evangelists   he did not work his miracles in secret places or in a corner but publicly and openly in the face of the sun before great multitudes of people of all sorts not only friends but enemies and the wonderful effects of them were apparent to the senses of all that were present and therefore that such miracles were wrought by him is owned not only by christians but even by the jews in their talmud by mahomet in his alcoran and by many pagan authors whose names and testimonies shall be hereafter mentioned and lastly the miracles of christ were such as transcended all the powers of natural causes as to raise the dead to life again to give sight to the blind hearing to the deaf health to the sick without the use of any medicines or natural means that are proper to cure those people all which effects therefore must needs proceed from a supernatural power and can be ascribed to god only  though what has been said may be thought sufficient yet to convince all men more fully of the supernatural force and energy that was conspicuous in christs miracles i shall add the following considerations   that they were in a manner infinite for number so that they cannot be particularly reckoned up for he went through all the cities and villages of judaea curing all diseases and healed all that were possessed of the devil and the writers of his life declare that he wrought many other miracles besides those which are mentioned in their history   that they extended universally to all sorts of creatures over which he showed an absolute dominion by the miraculous effects he produced as over devils by driving them out of men that were possessed with them over the winds and seas by allaying the storm and tempest at his command over the fishes and loaves by multiplying a few of them to such a prodigious quantity as was sufficient to feed five thousand over the swine by suffering the devils to enter into them and drive them headlong into the sea over the fig tree by blasting it with his word over the water by changing it into wine over all sorts of diseases by healing of them and lastly over death it self by raising the dead to life again   the miracles of christ produced such effects as were not transient but permanent for the dead being raised to life continued to live the blind having received their sight continued to see the lepers being cleansd continued clean and all these things were done in the presence of many beholders who saw and observed the wonderful change that was wrought   all the miracles of christ but two were miracles of great mercy and goodness as well as power as the healing of diseases the raising the dead to life again etc i say except two which were his sending the devils into the herd of swine and the cursing of the fig tree and these served to show his absolute dominion over plants and animals   all the miracles of christ even those that require the greatest power and energy were wrought by a wordspeaking after lazarus had lain three days in the grave he did but say to him come forth and immediately he arose with all his gravecloaths upon him he did but take the rulers daughter by the hand and say unto her maid arise and presently her spirit came again and she arose straightway he had such a divine commanding power over all natural causes that he cured the most desperate diseases even at a distance by speaking a few words thus he cured the noblemans son when he was at the point of death by saying thy son lives and the centurions servant by saying as thou have believed so be it done unto thee nay the diseased woman that followed him in a crowd was cured by touching the hem of his garment because she believed when he perceived that virtue was gone out of him all these miracles he wrought without using means and when he applied some means they were such as were naturally unfit to produce the effect intended as when he cured the man born blind by spitting on the ground and making clay of his spittle and anointing his eyes with it sending him to the pool of siloam and the performing this cure by such unfit means was no less an argument of his divine power in working the miracle than if he had used no means at all   christ had not only this power in himself of working miracles but he disposed of that power to his apostles who wrought many signs and wonders in his name so st peter cured the lame man by commanding him in the name of jesus to rise up and walk a miracle that was notoriously known to all that dwelt at jerusalem and which the rulers of the jews could not deny though they were their malicious enemies nay the dead were raised by them tabitha by st peter and eutychus by st paul and handkerchiefs and napkins obtained the virtue of doing mighty cures by being sent from the apostles hands and st peters shadow healed all that were afflicted with evil spirits throughout all jerusalem and all the cities round about it as we read in the acts of the apostles this was a wonderful demonstration of the divine power in christ that he could communicate the gift of miracles to his disciples as it was of his divine prescience that he foretold a thing so strange which required an almighty power to accomplish by assuring those that believed in him that they should outdo the many miracles he himself had wrought both which were his peculiar prerogatives whereby he excelled the first founders of all the other pretended religions in the world who never pretended to the power of bestowing the gift of miracles upon their disciples or to foretell the working of them   the apostles after they received their commission from christ to preach the gospel to all nations wrought miracles not only in jerusalem and the land of judaea but in samaria phenice cyprus antioch ephesus and many other cities and countries through which the apostles traveled for planting the christian faith in all which places god confirmed the word of his grace by doing signs and wonders by the apostles hands as we read in the acts of the apostles and st paul assures us that from jerusalem round about unto illyricum the gospel had been preached by him with mighty signs and wonders nay so universally spread was the fame of the apostles doctrine and miracles that their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world for not only the jews but gentiles the romans corinthians and some of all the most famous countries then known were converted to the christian faith by the preaching and miracles of the apostles who could all testify that they saw such mighty works done by them as convinced them that their doctrine was from god so that this evidence was not only publicly but universally known   this gift of miracles was not confined to the days of the apostles but was continued in the christian church for the first three centuries as appears from the writings of irenaeus origin tertullian and other primitive christians who relate innumerable instances of this miraculous power in the second and third ages of the church and appeal for the truth of their relations to the heathens who lived in those times and of its continuance in the fourth century eusebius cyril and austin are sufficient witnesses all which are cited in several late writers to whom i refer the reader and some of the miracles wrought in these ages are not only testified by christians but also by heathens for marcus aurelius himself testified publicly in his letters to the senate the miracle that was wrought at his battle with the marcomanni when the christian soldiers obtained by their prayers a refreshing shower to the roman army distressed for want of water while at the same time the forces of the barbarians were overwhelmed with hail and thunder it appears to be a thing so commonly known that it is mentioned by the poet claudian in   cons hon   chaldaea mago seu carmina ritu armavere deos seu quod reor omne tonantis obsequium marci mores potuere mereri and the prodigy by which theodosius crushed the rebellion of eugenius and arbegastes is also mentioned by the same poet in these words o nimium dilecte deo cui fundit ab antris aeolus armatas hyemes and militat ether et conjurati veniunt in classica venti claud de   cons hon  porphyrie confesses that wonderful cures were done at the tombs of christian martyrs hier adv vigilant c   and that the heathen gods could give no help to men after that jesus began to be worshipped eusebius lib   praep evang and apollo declared from the oracle that certain just men viz the christians hindered him to foretell the truth eusebius de vit constant and the oracle at delphos confessed that he could give no responses because babylas the martyrs bones were buried near him as is related by chrysoft orat   in babylam in fine it was a thing so commonly known and taken notice of in the first ages of christianity that the heathen oracles were struck dumb that plutarch wrote a book concerning the reason why the oracles had ceased and hence it appears that this power of working miracles was continued in the christian church for the first four centuries which adds great strength and force to the evidence as being attested by such a vast cloud of witnesses as lived in that large compass of time  to conclude i must desire the reader to take notice that the force of this argument consists chiefly in these three things   that if such works were really performed as is pretended they were true and proper miracles such as could only be done by the almighty power of god   that we have sufficient assurance that these miracles were wrought by christ and his apostles and the other disciples to whom they are ascribed by those that relate them   that these mighty works were done in confirmation of the christian religion    that the wonderful works pretended to be done by christ and his apostles were true and real miracles such as could only be wrought by an almighty power will appear by considering   that they could not be performed by the most improved arts and skill of men or by any juggling tricks and frauds to cure all diseases and raise the dead to life again by a wordspeaking are too great and mighty works for human power and skill in the highest improvement they cannot cure diseases without the application of some proper medicines they cannot command a dead carcass to rise out of the grave and restore the life and soul to it again after it has been dead three days these things appear so plainly impossible to the natural powers of mankind that as it were ridiculous for any man to assert the contrary so it were needless to confute them but neither can they be done by the tricks of jugglers and conjurers who cheat and gull the people with the counterfeit appearance of wonderful feats which they perform by unheeded causes and secret ways of acting for there could be no trick used in most of those miracles which were wrought as in raising lazarus from the dead after he had lain three days in the grave before many spectators who knew that he was dead and that the same lazarus was now raised again and it is altogether incredible that a cheat of this nature should be carried on through so many instances for so long a time and that none of the great numbers that were concerned in the contrivance nor of the spectators many of whom were jews and heathens should discover the cheat especially considering that the contrivers could serve no worldly end by imposing upon the world but on the contrary they met with bonds and death for this pretended trick and many of the spectators being learned and ingenious men of a contrary religion were sufficiently able and strongly inclined to have discovered the cheat if there had been any which yet was never done and therefore we may certainly conclude that the pretended miracles were not wrought by juggling tricks    seeing these wonderful works could not be done by the power or artifice of men they must be wrought either by the power of created spirits or the almighty power of god but that they were not wrought by the power of any created spirits will appear by considering that they must either be done by good angels or evil spirits as to good angels besides that many of the works aforementioned appear to be above the power of any creature as we shall show presently i shall only observe that if they had been done by good angels this would be a demonstration of the truth of christs revelation no less than if they were wrought by a power inherent in himself for the good angels are the ministers of the heavenly kingdom and are supposed always to do the will of god and design the welfare of mankind and it is utterly inconsistent with all the notions we have of them that they should contribute such a mighty assistance to delude the world with a false doctrine and to persuade so many thousands of its preachers and professors to endure the greatest miseries and most painful deaths in the world without any hopes of a future reward in another life for their present sufferings such a wicked imposture is agreeable only to the falsehood and malice of evil spirits and this indeed is the last refuge and stronghold of infidels who denying the truth of christs revelation ascribe his wonderful works to the power of wicked spirits with whom they say he was confederate so did the jews in his own time for when the pharisees heard of his healing one blind and dumb who was possessed with a devil they said this fellow does not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of devils mat      ie he does it by a confederacy with evil spirits against which pretense christ himself argues very strongly in the following verses every kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation  and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand the meaning of which argument is this that he who opposes devils and unclean spirits and drives them by force from the quiet possession they have enjoyed of mens bodies cannot be supposed to act by collusion and confederacy with them but must be an enemy to them and their designs for the devil cannot be thought to join with another to disgrace himself to defeat his own designs and ruin his kingdom but this appeared plainly to be the design of christ who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for he being a malicious spirit who delights in the misery and ruin of mankind exercised a dominion over the bodies he possessed inflicting upon them several diseases and depriving them of the use of their senses that he might keep them in subjection to him and maintain his kingdom in the world but   christ by dispossessing the devils o mens bodies and healing the diseases they had inflicted destroyed their dominion and ruined their designs of mischief against mankind which cannot be supposed to be done by the devils concurrence but must be the work of one that is an enemy to him   our savior argues that it must not only be the force of an enemy but a force superior to the power of the devil v   of the said twelfth chapter of matthew how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house ie the devil having a quiet possession of mens bodies will hold it until he is forced to quit it and he cannot be forced to leave it but by a power superior to his own which can conquer and overcome him   i may add that the miracles of christ were for the most part miracles of mercy and goodness to mankind whereby he fed the hungry cured the sick and raised the dead to life and so they were directly contrary to the temper and designs of the devil who seeks by all means the misery and destruction of mankind as appears plainly in those idolatrous countries where he requires the sacrificing of many thousand children every year to satiate his cruelty and therefore he cannot be supposed to contribute to the good and merciful design of christs miracles which was so contrary to his malicious and cruel temper   the miracles of christ were wrought to confirm his doctrine which tended directly to the overthrow of the devils kingdom for the son of god was manifested to destroy the works of the devil which he did effectually by turning men from all their idolatrous practices to worship the only true and living god and from all those unclean lusts which reigned without control among the gentiles to a life of the greatest purity and holiness for the great design of the devil was to withdraw mens hearts from the true god and their dependence upon him to put their trust in idols and to draw to himself and suchlike wicked spirits all that worship and adoration which is the peculiar glory of god whereby he gained an absolute dominion over the souls of men making them do that homage to himself which was only due to their natural lord and maker as he did over their bodies by alluring them to those vile lusts which estrange their minds from god and make them sit receptacles for unclean spirits and in these two things the kingdom of the devil did chiefly consist but by the preaching of the doctrine of christ this kingdom of darkness was subverted his altars were deserted his temples demolished and all men were taught everywhere to worship the true god in spirit and in truth and to abhor those obscene rites which some of the gentiles made a part of their religion seeing therefore that by the doctrine of christ men were turned from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god those wonderful works could not be wrought by the power of evil spirits which confirmed such a doctrine as was directly contrary to the design and did effectually overthrow the kingdom of darkness and this i think may be sufficient to show that the miracles of christ were not wrought by the power of evil spirits as the pharisees alleged against him but because the same pretense has been made use of not only by jews but heathens against all the miracles which were pretended to be done by christ or his apostles or the primitive christians in the first four centuries which are ascribed to magical or egyptian arts to enchantments or the strange power of words i say because the same pretense has been made use of against all other miracles pretended to be done by any christians for these magical arts whatever they be must signify a secret correspondence with and concurrence of evil spirits or else they signify nothing distinct from the power and skill of men i shall therefore add two or three considerations relating to all the miracles in general which are pretended to be wrought for confirmation of the truth of the christian doctrine and   the miracles of christ and his apostles were so many so great done so publicly and universally through so many several countries and the power of working them was continued so long in the christian church that it is altogether incredible they should be done by magical arts or the power of evil spirits for who can believe that such a vast number of mighty works for the space of four centuries as are pretended to be done in confirmation of the christian religion should be done by the power of evil spirits when the like was never pretended to be done to confirm any other religion that ever appeared in the world what account can be given why evil spirits should be so mightily concerned to propagate the christian religion above all the other religions in the world was it not at least as much and apparently more for the interest of their kingdom of darkness to promote the idolatrous practices the filthy and obscene the barbarous and cruel rites of pagan religions than to promote the worship of one only supreme god and the purity and gentleness which is prescribed by the christian institution it is true indeed there are some miracles pretended to be wrought by pagan priests in confirmation of their religion the truth of which pretense i shall not now enquire into but they never pretended so far as i could ever learn that they wrought so many and so great miracles so publicly in so many several countries as christ and his apostles are said to have done or that they could communicate the power of working miracles to their disciples and transmit it for several ages to their successors as is pretended to be done for confirmation of the christian religion and it appears to me altogether unaccountable why the christian should so far exceed all other religions in this point of evidence if these pretended miracles were wrought by the power of evil spirits if christ learned his magical art in egypt and taught it to his disciples whereby they were enabled to work miracles as many both jews and heathens have alleged how comes it to pass that others who have been there could never attain to the same art or teach it to others or why do not the egyptians themselves who are the great masters of that magical art show their skill in it by doing so many and so great miracles as they taught christ to do but since neither they have ever done nor any other from them could ever learn the art of doing such mighty works so far as has hitherto appeared to the world we may safely conclude that this pretense is a groundless and incredible surmise besides if christ instructed his apostles in these magical arts they must believe and know him to be an impostor and who then can imagine that ever any men in their sound senses should be willing to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for the sake of a vile forgery as the apostles did when they might have saved them by detecting the imposture    there are several miracles attributed to christ and his apostles which seem to be above the power of evil spirits but supposing it were possible for them to do all these miracles yet being subject to the government of god the great creator and governor of all things visible and invisible they could not do them without his leave and permission which we cannot believe that he would grant because it appears to be inconsistent with his infinite goodness to permit evil spirits to work so many and great miracles on purpose to delude the world with a lie and thereby expose mankind to an invincible temptation to believe it it is true indeed other religions have pretended to miracles wrought in confirmation of them but besides that they were neither so many nor so great as are pretended by christians there was always some means left for discovering the imposture either by the multitude of gods which they worshipped contrary to the unity of the godhead which may be known as has been proved by natural reason or by the filthy and obscene the barbarous and cruel practices they enjoined which are plainly contrary to the natural notions we have of god and of virtue and vice and it was just with god to give them up to strong delusions that they should believe a lie because that when they knew god or might have known him by the works of creation they did not glorify him as god but worshipped the creature more than the creator and allowed themselves in such unclean and cruel rites as are contrary to the natural notions of the divine purity and goodness and we are certain that such a religion cannot be from god though it be confirmed by signs and wonders but when the christian religion commands the worship of one god only and enjoins no practice but what is pure just and gentle as will appear in the next chapter if god should be pleased to permit such a religion to be confirmed by evil spirits doing more and greater miracles than ever were wrought for proof of any other religion in the world every one must think himself obliged to believe it to be from god because there is no way left to discover such a religion having such strong evidence to be an imposture and therefore since it is inconsistent with the goodness of god to offer such a violent temptation to mankind to believe a lie we must conclude that he would never suffer evil spirits to work so many and great miracles in confirmation of it  but besides the miracles which christ himself wrought here on earth there were several illustrious testimonies given to him from heaven which i shall but briefly mention as a farther confirmation of his being assisted by a divine power in the miracles which he wrought of this nature was the star which conducted the wise men from the east to bethlehem where he was born the frequent apparitions of angels to minister unto him at his conception and birth at his temptation in the wilderness in his agony at his resurrection and ascension into heaven such were the voices that were heard from heaven testifying that he was the beloved son of god at his baptism when john the baptist saw the heavens opened and the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him at his transfiguration when a bright cloud overshadowd him and two of his disciples peter and john and again in his agony when christ said father glorify thy name and a voice was heard from heaven i have both glorified it and will glorify it again of the same nature were the miracles and prodigies that accompanied his death on the cross both in heaven and earth when there was darkness over all the earth from the sixth hour to the ninth when the veil of the temple was rent in twain and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many which signs so astonished the centurion and the roman soldiers that watched him that they were forced to confess truly this was the son of god certainly this was a righteous man and indeed all these miracles were so many divine attestations of his mission from god and that he was the peculiar favorite of heaven whom god was pleased so far to honor for as it is certain that no human power and skill could perform or counterfeit such signs from heaven so neither is it conceivable that evil spirits either could or would give so many glorious testimonies to him but to conclude the miracles wrought by christ and his apostles and those that were done by a superior invisible power in attestation of him were so many and so great and extended to so many creatures both in heaven and earth that none but he who had an universal and absolute dominion over all the works of nature could perform them and therefore they were above the power of evil spirits and could only be done by the almighty power of god the great creator and governor of all things  ii having thus demonstrated that the miracles which we believe jesus did had all the conditions of true miracles and were such that no power but that of almighty god could effect our next business is to prove that christ did really work such miracles and this from the following considerations will plainly appear    the miracles of our savior were not like transubstantiation and others of the roman church which are the objects of faith only but they were plain objects of our senses every body present could see them they were not done in a corner or in a particular secret place but publicly before the face of the sun so that it can never be said that these demonstrations of omnipotency were subtle deceits and impostures    we have a constant tradition of christs miracles from the apostles through all ages of christianity even until now the history of them has been always the same and never was or can be contradicted    these miracles are not only acknowledged by the christians but by their greatest enemies for even the jews amongst other things which they relate of christ in their talmud make mention of his miracles also the turks in their alchoran have recorded some of christs miracles his resurrection is commonly believed amongst them they look upon him as a great prophet and as such profess a profound veneration for him lastly several of the jewish mohammedan and heathen writers frequently mention christs miracles this the whole christian world knows better than i my self i shall not therefore now trouble you with particular quotations out of these authors    but supposing that we had not all these testimonies of christs enemies to prove his miracles yet that of the apostles and evangelists would be abundantly sufficient as we shall more clearly show hereafter for they had not the least prospect of any temporal advantage by publishing these things on the contrary they exasperated the powers of the world by it and with their blood sealed the doctrines they had taught this surely is a valid proof that the miracles related in the life of christ were really done by him  iii that our savior wrought these miracles in confirmation of his religion appears from what he said to the disciples of john when they came and asked him whether he was the  or he that is to come he answered go and tell john what you have seen etc and from what he had said to the jews if you will not believe me at least believe the works i do in the name of my father there are many other places in holy scripture which show that the principal end of christs miracles was to confirm his doctrine  sect viii of the object of christian religion the evidences for the christian religion being thus produced and examined we come next to the object of it we have already asserted that the true religion must have for its object   above all things the honor and glory of god   the universal happiness of mankind   the good of every man in particular for the clearer understanding of this we shall divide the christian religion   into the credenda or what a christian ought to believe   the agenda or the precepts he should practice and if we find both these parts of christian religion have the aforesaid object we may safely conclude it is the true religion my design as i have intimated elsewhere is not to run over and repeat the principles of all religions but only to demonstrate the excellency of the christian by its object well knowing that all other religions fall infinitely short of it    as to its credenda it is true there are but few nations which do not believe one supreme being but how grossly are they mistaken in their notions of him some rob him of his chiefest attributes some represent him subject to almost all the passions of human nature and this leads them into such weak and pernicious principles and practices that men of common sence of contrary opinions are ashamed to hear of but the christian religion teaches not only gods existence but his attributes also in the highest perfection that our understanding is capable to bear whereas other religions adore a plurality of gods this teaches to worship one god in unity some make him material this an incomprehensible spirit some again deny his providence or so assert his sublimity that he neglects sublunary things as matters much beneath his government but the christian religion teaches us that his providence is omnipresent and assures us of his great love and tender care over all his creatures in short his goodness mercy longsuffering justice his infinite power wisdom holiness etc are plainly preached and demonstrated by jesus the author of christian religion what a miserable state then are those in who deny the providence of god they are men without faith without hope are they groaning under afflictions they dare not call upon him for deliverance are they in their last agonies where can be their trust and confidence but we are taught that this god is the creator preserver and governor of all things we know he observes all our actions and this makes us mindful of our duty we are sure that he gives us the fruits of the earth success honor life health children and all other blessings and this obliges us to be thankful to that infinite goodness which bestowed them upon us we believe he orders all events as diseases death of friends crosses and afflictions this shows us the great mercy of god who scourges and punishes us that we may repent and return to our obedience other religions indeed oblige men to confess the frailty of their nature to acknowledge the crimes they daily commit and the evils to which they are inclined yet it gives them no other remedies for the appeasing the justice of an angry god but the sacrifices of beasts and of men but blessed be god it is not so with us we know we are sinners but we are confident that the god of infinite mercy will upon repentance forgive us all our trespasses for the sake of jesus christ his beloved son who died for our sins rose again for our justification and ascended into heaven to be our advocate mediator and intercessor with the father this is the greatest consolation man can wish for whilst others are concerned to appease their god by an infinite multitude of sacrifices and these attended with so great a number of ceremonies christians enjoy a perfect ttranquility and freedom relying entirely upon gods infinite mercy praying extolling and magnifying it without end yet this is not all that god has done for us he has not only sent his son to be an expiation for our sins but also to be our prophet and teacher to instruct us in the will of his father by preaching publicly in the synagogues of the jews and especially to those whom he had chosen to be witnesses of his life and doctrine and after the time of his mission was expired and he ascended into heaven he sent the holy ghost the comforter to assist them in planting the religion he left with them bestowed the gift of miracles upon them to confirm it and for the better propagation of it he established a communion and congregation of saints into which all men may be introduced who repent and have faith lastly he has left two covenants viz the sacraments in his church by which he conveys his graces and blessings to us these and more are the wonderful works of the infinite goodness and mercy of god which when we reflect upon we cannot but say with the psalmist what is man o lord that thou art mindful of him etc this i think sufficient to show how much the credenda of the christian religion are for the honor and glory of god the universal happiness of mankind and the good of every man in particular    the agenda or precepts which a christian ought to practice are no less for the honor and glory of god etc that they far excel the rules of all other religions there can be no dispute the jews indeed have the decalogue or ten commandments as well as we but how strictly do they interpret them and how far has christ extended them the jews think if they are not idolaters or blasphemers if they observe the sabbath by not doing any manner of work if they honor father and mother if they do not murder steal commit adultery bear false witness or are not covetous if they observe the ceremonies and festivals which the law prescribes and abstain from the several meats it forbids then they think they have done their duty and that god is obliged to give them the promised reward but the precepts of the christian religion extend yet farther as we shall presently show  god forbid the pagan religion should any ways be compared to the christian which is so far from glorifying god that the honor which is only due to the creator it gives to the creature and teaches men to worship idols the sun moon and stars nay for fear the very devils and to sacrifice their very children to them it obliges its devotees to the utmost cruelty to their own bodies under the notion of holiness merit it allows even prescribes the impurity of polygamy and other uncleanness in a word instead of bringing men to that degree of holiness without which no man shall see the lord it makes them reprobates and throws them into the last degree of imperfection condemning all graces and virtues whereby we overruled our passions as foolish and idle notions etc but least contrary to my purpose i should make too great a digression in comparing the christian religion to all others i shall return and employ the rest of this section in showing that the christian religion is not only above all others but also that it brings a man to regeneration and that perfect holiness which is the end of his creation  if we consider the precepts of christianity as the rules of human life we shall find them the most accurately adapted to our nature as ever were made known to the world no ways contradictory to our reason but tend to make mortal man perfect even as god is perfect the greatest libertines who do not live up to them yet approve of them by these precepts we are taught first our duty to our maker to believe in him to fear him to love him above all things to trust and depend entirely upon him to do his will with all submission to worship him with pure hearts not with sacrifices for he eats not the flesh of bulls or drinks the blood of goats they instruct us how to call upon him and with fervent zeal and understanding and unwearied constancy to offer up our petitions to him to praise and glorify his holy name for all the benefits we and all mankind have received from him since the creation of the world these duties are founded upon the highest and most solid reason and all that believe there is a god must perform them for whom shall we fear but him that is almighty whom shall we love but infinite goodness and loving kindness it self whom shall we confide in but him who is able and willing to help us to whom shall we submit and upon whom shall we depend but upon him who is infinitely wise whose will shall we do but his who is just and right shall we worship him with sacrifices of beasts who is an eternal spirit briefly since on earth we petition our superiors if we will obtain any favors from them and we pay our grateful acknowledgments for them when received infinitely more are we obliged upon all occasions to pray to that god upon whom our being and wellbeing depends and to offer up our praise and thanksgivings to him who has bestowed so many benefits upon us thus our duty to god has not only his glory for its object but our own good and welfare also  our duty to our neighbor gives us the most incomparable rules for government society and friendship for it aims at the good of all men in general and of every man in particular it requires from us obedience to our governors and superiors even when they unjustly use us and persecute us it teaches us the greatest mercy love and humanity one to another obliging us to forgive our bitterest enemies and to pray for our slanderers and tormenters it will not permit us to render evil for evil but on the contrary commands us to do good to those who treat us injuriously there is no friendship so sacred no justice so impartial no charity so great no meekness so exemplary as that which our blessed savior has recommended to us wicked thoughts much more wicked deeds are abhorred by his true and genuine followers who live in perfect peace and tranquillity one with another  our duty to our selves has the same object as the two former it commands us the lowest and most profound humility the greatest meekness and patience under our sufferings and reproaches to be content in whatsoever state of life it shall please god to call us to have an unshaken faith unspotted chastity and to presevere to the last moment of our lives to be temperate in meats and drinks and all recreations to follow our callings with diligence it gives us a singular modesty simplicity gravity and sincerity of heart it teaches us to deny our selves to despise worldly things and hunger and thirst after righteousness to husband well the talent god has given us to follow the things that are pure honest of good report and praiseworthy it commands nothing that is unaccountable nothing that is base and unbecoming reasonable creatures all our actions are moderated by it we ought to be as innocent as doves but as wise as serpents we ought to be modest and humble but not afraid to appear in the defense of truth we ought to do justice but not to be unmerciful we ought to bear injuries but not to be senseless of them we must be kind to all men but without any pride or affectation and thus are all christian virtues moderated if what has been said be well considered and digested it will be evident that the christian religion does bring us to the highest degree of perfection that its possible human nature can attain to and that it tends infinitely beyond all others to the glory and honor of god the universal happiness of mankind and the good of every man in particular and consequently is the true religion  sect ix of promises and rewards of woes and punishments having proved that the christian religion has the true object of the right religion and that the credenda of it were as perfect as could be and the agenda as human nature is capable of bearing we come now to consider what promises are made to them who live accordingly and what woes and judgments are denounced against the children of disobedience our corruption is so great and our vicious inclinations so strong that without a certain belief of future rewards and punishments it would be very difficult for us to walk in the most pleasant paths of religion for how can we conceive a man should extinguish his violent passion for a darling pleasure had he not sure hopes by thus mortifying himself to the world of a more substantial good and of avoiding an everlasting misery  whether we consider these rewards in respect to god or regard to our own souls they are far more glorious and adapt than what any other religion affords what others have feigned to encourage men to do good is indeed not a little enticing but yet it is directly contrary to the nature of god and our souls for instance their notions of metempsychosis or the transmigration of the soul into another body more noble or ignoble delightful charming places riches plurality of women etc which can never agree with the eternal almighty god neither with our reasonable souls they are spirits which can never be satisfied with temporal things they came from god and naturally desire to return to him no pleasure can sufficiently content them but the infinite happiness of enjoying their creator   our bodies have their part in these promises as well as our souls for is it not just that the body which has accompanied the soul through many trials and afflictions for the sake of god should share in its rewards also is it not reasonable that the body which has been deprived of so many lusts and pleasures should with the soul be partaker of eternal happiness the resurrection of the body must therefore be a great consolation to us our savior proved it to the jews out of the books of the law and the prophets he laid the foundation of this truth and we are sure our faith is not vain since he is risen from the dead to say that the scattered particles of our dissolved bodies cannot be collected again is an objection so weak that it deserves not an answer for certainly the almighty creator of man out of nothing cannot only restore him to his former state after his dissolution but endue him also with a perfect understanding and a perpetual vigor etc we see then these rewards are not such sensual banquets as the jews vulgarly believe nor such a fools paradise a plurality of women as the turks expect nor the wanderings of the soul from one body to another as the heathens dream but it is an infinite spiritual happiness we are promised the greatest our heart can wish or that a created being is capable of we shall enjoy the beatific vision god will dwell in us we shall praise him with joyful hallelujahs for ever and ever we shall be free from hunger and thirst from all doubtfulness of thought sorrow pain and death in short we shall be perfectly happy for we shall live in the lord and he in us when we seriously consider this we shall be ready to part with everything even our lives for eternal salvation such perfection of bliss will make all the righteous with st paul most earnestly desirous to leave this world of sin and miseries and to be dissolved to be with christ the apostle experimentally knew what this happiness was when he thus explained it to the corinthians eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which god has prepared for them that love him we shall now briefly consider the woes and punishments  as god has promised such great and glorious rewards to them that love him and are obedient to his commands so he has pronounced most terrible woes and judgments against them that act the contrary is it not reasonable to think that god who is merciful to the righteous should be just to the wicked and the impenitent and if the rewards of the good are inexpressible must not the punishments of those who die in their sins be the utmost misery i should be too tedious if i repeated here all the expressions used in holy scripture to make us sensible of the miserable state of the damned i shall therefore make some reflections on what has been said and so conclude this section    the belief of these woes and torments deterreth us from committing sin and quickens us to repentance and a holy life for no man can hope for eternal life but by doing the will of god everlasting flames must be his portion who dies without repentance    it breeds a dread and fear in us of the great and jealous god a god that will not be mocked it teaches us to tremble at his word to consider his infinite justice and the fierceness of his wrath    we are hereby taught to put a true value upon the work of our redemption for if we believe not an eternity of torments we can never sufficiently esteem the ransom christ paid for us whereas he who reflects upon the glories he had lost and the infinite misery he had deserved cannot but be most thankful for so plenteous a redemption  the belief that god has laid up glorious rewards for those that love him is useful    to wean our affections and desires from the pleasures of this life to create in us a contempt of this world and to teach us to prefer heaven before all things    it encourages us to take up the cross of christ and willingly and cheerfully to suffer all afflictions for his namesake assuring us in the words of the apostle st paul that the sufferings of this present time are not to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed  sect x several other proofs for the christian religion my guide having thus proved the truth of the christian religion by its evidences and its object he gave me some other arguments to confirm me which are not of a little value i shall contract them as much as i can    as the jews own that there was a messiah promised so they cannot deny but that they crucified a man whose name was jesus in whom we find all that is foretold of the messiah in the old testament fulfilled as that he should be born of a virgin in the city of bethlehem of the tribe of judah and of the posterity of david that he should begin to preach in galilee do many miracles be the savior not only of the jews but the gentiles also that he should establish the worship of one true god and destroy that of idols and false gods that he should be betrayed and sold for thirty pieces of silver the time manner and circumstances of his sufferings and death the very parting his garment the scoffs of the multitude his behavior last words the exempting his bones from being broken his honorable burial his resurrection etc all that was predicted and prefigurd of old was accomplished in him so that undoubtedly this jesus is the christ and his religion came from god    my guide noted to me the extraordinary manner how these prophecies were fulfilled of which take two or three examples is it not wonderful that he who had so many enemies should be betrayed by one of his own disciples that he should be condemned to death whom the judge declared innocent that he who had oftentimes escaped being stoned should at last be crucified and yet had he been guilty of what he was accused by the law of the country he ought to have been stoned that he who was crucified which was a roman and not a jewish punishment should be so honorably buried that none of his bones should be broken though it was the custom to break the bones of the crucified and it was then practiced upon the two thieves etc these things are so surprising that we cannot sufficiently admire and adore the infinite wisdom of god who in his son jesus has fulfilled whatsoever was foretold of the messiah    the fulfilling of christs prophecies against the jews their temple and city for in the time foretold by our savior the romans under their emperor titus did conquer the city demolished the temple etc and ever since that time the jews have been dispersed over the whole earth and never since have had any power or government    the wonderful progress of the apostles and their successors in propagating the christian religion this argument will be no advantage to the mahometans for their opinions were propagated by other methods and here   let us consider the author and preachers of the christian religion   the religion it self   the manner of its propagation    the author of the christian religion was jesus the son of a poor virgin and the reputed son of a carpenter his birth in a stable in bethlehem his education in galilaea his sufferings and ignominious death on the cross amongst malefactors these are greater hindrances than helps to the spreading of christs doctrines but notwithstanding so mightily grew the word of christ and prevailed that it threw down all superstition and false religion which it could never have done had not the power of almighty god went along with it the preachers of the gospel were not princes of great wealth and authority but poor tradesmen they were not men of great learning educated in famous universities but mean obscure galileans men of peace and humility they were very unlikely to do any notable things since they wanted worldly wisdom and power to gain them reputation and authority this is the true character of the primitive preachers of the gospel these men therefore by their own cunning and strength could never have been able to baffle the wisdom of the greeks the power of the romans the malice of the jews and the obstinacy of idolaters we may as easily believe that a sheep could worry a hundred ravenous wolves as that these men should have prevailed against so many obstacles of men and devils and persuaded the world to forsake their old way of worship and to believe in christ crucified we must then conclude that since they have done all this the omnipotent god assisted them it must necessarily be an infinite power that by such weak obscure men could bring such mighty things to pass    as to the religion it self although as we have already proved it is the most excellent and perfect of all yet it had several articles of faith and rules of practice that were as so many stumbling blocks to the heathen among the former is the creation of the world which surely was strange doctrine to them who believed ex nihilo nihil fit i e out of nothing can be made nothing they that had hitherto believed there were many gods could not easily be persuaded there is but one the doctrines of the trinity in unity and the unity in trinity and of the resurrection of bodies seemed very absurd at rome and athens and yet all these doctrines as strange and disagreeable as they appeared were received in these places which could never have been had not gods miraculous providence given such wonderful success and had not the same power attended the preaching the rules of practice the corrupt world had never received them for the gospel commands us to deny all ungodliness and to live righteously justly and soberly it forbids not only evil actions but evil thoughts also it is so far from permitting us to do injuries that it will not allow us vengeance for those offered to us not only adultery but even impure imaginations are forbidden by it etc but it will seem yet more strange if we consider    the manner of the first propagation of the gospel it owes not its success to the eloquence or rhetoric of the apostles they were illiterate ignorant men and understood no more of schoollearning than one born blind does of colors their birth and fortune were mean and obscure they never assisted in senates or in the councils of princes they were not great lawyers able to defend any cause in short they had no bright qualifications to recommend them to the princes of the world under these heavy disadvantages they propagated the christian religion to a wicked perverse and powerful generation st paul indeed was a learned man and had all the benefits of a generous education nevertheless he tells us that he determined to know nothing but jesus christ and him crucified and that neither his speech nor his preaching was with the enticing words of mans wisdom so that the success of the christian religion is still owing to the power of god alone  war and the arm of flesh by which mahomet propagated his opinions had no share in the advancement of the gospel the jew nor the gentile need not be afraid of the sword of the apostles for they were forbidden all violence and cruelty their master did not send them out as beasts of prey but like sheep in the midst of wolves he was the master of peace and they his servants and therefore they came not to denounce war but to bring peace and gladtidings and to persuade the soldier to sheath his sword princes and states instead of protecting them use them cruelly and persecuted them from city to city and yet they had no other armor but faith in jesus christ nor any sword but that of the word of god and with these they overcame the nations and brought them under the obedience of the gospel the continual sufferings tribulations afflictions and persecutions which the apostles and their proselytes were exposed to one would think should very much hinder the spreading of the doctrine they preached prayers and tears were the only weapons they used and yet the blood of the martyrs was that fruitful seed of the church so that thousands daily embraced christianity this wonderful progress of it my guide laid before me as one argument that it is the only true religion he urged many more than what i have mentioned as the resurrection and ascension of christ his sending the holy ghost to his apostles the wonderful gifts they received by it of speaking all languages working miracles etc but i need not mention any more being convinced that every reasonable man if he considers what has been said must confess that the christian religion excels all others in its evidences object matters of faith precepts rewards and punishments and that it comes from god and is the only true religion  i shall in the last place proceed to tell you the objections i brought against the christian religion and the answers my good guide made to them  sect xi the objections i made against the christian religion with their solutions the arguments i brought against the existence of a god his attributes and the necessity of a revealed religion were so weak that they are not worth mentioning they were only the common opinions of my countrymen and my guide answered them so clearly that i could make no manner of reply so that the first objection that seemed to have any force was this  object   how can i now be certain that what the evangelists and apostles assert is truth for they might impose upon us and write things which never were performed  answer to this my guide answered   that he supposed the divine writers were able to tell us the truth and to give us a true and perfect history of the life and death of the blessed jesus   that they were very willing to do so no man can doubt that they were able to speak the truth for they did not write the history of things which happened in ages past and long before they were born or of what was done in remote parts of the world but the things they deliver down to us they saw with their own eyes heard with their own ears and felt with their own hands etc as the apostle st john observes most of these writers were constant attendants on our savior from his first preaching to the end of his life so that if they published any untruths we must attribute them rather to their designs and intentions to impose upon us than their ignorance but by the following considerations it will appear they were willing as well as able to tell us the naked truth    it cannot be imagined they could forge the history of the life of christ how could poor fishermen ignorant mechanics men without learning contrive such a fiction as should in all respects so exactly agree    supposing they had been cunning sophisters and subtle enough to invent such a history could they have the face to undertake such a design and impose such a forgery on the world when there were multitudes of living witnesses and those their implacable enemies to contradict them if these writers had been found liars they would soon have been detected and carried before the magistrate and punished according to their deserts besides it was the interest and resolution of those magistrates to hinder the propagation of that doctrine whose author they had with the utmost malice and aversion persecuted even unto death    these writers were godly righteous and sober men they have confessed their own faults publicly which before were unknown to us as their slowness in believing their disputes about preeminence their leaving and forsaking their lord and master etc and consequently they cannot be thought guilty of this wicked design    and lastly for what end should they thus delude us what advantage could they expect by so doing not honor and glory for they were continually reviled and derided as fools and madmen not riches or any other temporal benefit for the gospel they preached taught them to renounce all and follow christ and accordingly their reputation goods and lives were daily in danger they were hurried from one place to another as rebels and blasphemers they were persecuted and tormented and at last suffered the cruellest deaths that malice could invent impostors would never have submitted to such trials is it possible for men joyfully and with alacrity to undergo all manner of racks and tortures for the sake of a religion they knew to be false especially when they might have been crowned with honors and preferments had they denied it these things well considered we cannot but believe the divine writers were true and faithful historians  object   how can i be sure that the books we now have of the new testament are the same the evangelists and the apostles penned and that in succession of time they have not been changed and altered  answ   he answered me that the vast numbers of these books which have been dispersed through the whole world and translated almost into all languages their still bearing the names of the same authors and the agreement of the different versions plainly prove they have been always the same neither can it be conceived that distant nations that scarce ever had any commerce or correspondence with each other should all conspire in the same cheat and alter the holy writings    since there are such divisions and so many sects amongst the christians had either of them added or diminished any thing in favor of their own opinions the rest would have done the like but it appears through all ages the bible has been appealed to by all parties this satisfied me that the holy scripture is now the same as was generally given to us  object   i objected against the miracles of the christian religion as not sufficient to denominate it the true religion for the jewish and some of the pagan religions have been established by miracles so that were miracles sufficient all these religions would be true which is contrary to what has elsewhere been asserted  answ   miracles are not alone a sufficient proof of the true religion but only a confirmation of it as we have before observed if therefore they are not agreeable to the doctrines and precepts of the true religion they will be of very little value    the wonders done by the pagans have not the three conditions of a true miracle viz   he that does the miracle must know it and be willing to do it   it must exceed all art and natural power   it must be certainly performed and come to pass but the wonders these pagan prophets are reported to have done was only the foretelling the calamities that should befall their country their predictions did not exceed the knowledge of natural philosophers they only told you of the probability of thunders lightnings earthquakes and other effects of natural causes lastly there is no certainty that these things happened according to the times they mentioned for the jarhabadiond or the pagans book of their law in which these wonders are recorded is so carefully kept by their priests that no man else is suffered to read it if he were able these wonders therefore of the pagans wanting the three necessary conditions cannot properly be called miracles but those done by our savior i have abundantly proved to have these three conditions and consequently were true miracles  object   if you will not believe the wonders or miracles that were done by the pagans at least you will give credit to what i my self have seen viz that our god appears in a bodily visible shape in our temple for instance if he be angry with us he appears in the form of a lion but if well pleased in the shape of a bull or a ram in a few hours sometimes he changes his shape and in the same day he is seen angry and pleased by all that are in the temple  answ   it is beneath the majesty of the supreme being to appear and that frequently in the shape of such wild and ravenous creatures as a lion etc    this seems rather to be a cheat of the priests for they change the scene and shut up the place whilst one beast is led back and another brought from his den to be shown to the people   they will not suffer any of the congregation to come near it but if it were the almighty god that thus changes himself he would not do it privately but publicly before all the people so that before a man can believe this he must see a cloud of miracles to confirm it  object   i replied for the same reason i may deny the resurrection of christ for if he really rose from the dead why did he not appear to his enemies but since he only was seen by his disciples i may with the jews say that they came by night and stole him away and then gave out that he was risen from the dead so that this miracle wants other miracles to confirm it  answ   the apostles did many miracles in confirmation of it for when they raised the dead or cured the sick etc it was always in the name of jesus christ whom god has raised from the dead  answ   we may as well ask why god did not translate the enemies of christ into heaven and show him sitting at his righthand for i am confident had the jews seen him after his resurrection they would have said as upon another occasion it is a spirit an apparition or something like it for if they believed not the innumerable miracles that christ did before his crucifixion they would never have been convinced that he was the messiah though they had seen him after his resurrection  answ   that assertion of the stupid jews that his disciples took away his body will appear most absurd if we consider the following circumstances of his death and resurrection the jews themselves deny not christs death and burial and that his sepulcher was strongly guarded by soldiers but they say whilst these soldiers slept his disciples came and stole him away but we must think it impossible for them to attempt so bold an action for when our savior was betrayed his disciples were struck with such fear that they all ran away and left their lord in the hands of his murderers even st peter who was the most forward zealot of them all and said though all should be offended yet will not i though i should die with thee yet i will not deny thee in any wise nevertheless fear made st peter fly and thrice deny his master but supposing the disciples recovered from their fear and surprise and that they courageously attempted to take away his body how can we imagine the whole company of soldiers slept at the same time without setting one vigilant sentinel but yet granting they did all sleep together how was it possible the disciples should know at what hour the soldiers were all asleep let us suppose they knew this also how could they roll away the great stone enter into the sepulcher and take away the body etc without making noise enough to awake one soldier but again supposing hitherto they did all softly and secretly yet they must do every thing hastily for fear of being apprehended but on the contrary there was no disorder no confusion the gravecloaths in which the precious body was wrapped were decently folded up and laid in one place and the napkin that was about his head in another which shows it was done with a presence of mind and deliberately granting still that the disciples did carry away the body why did not the jews accuse them before the magistrates who certainly would have condemned them to death could it have been proved against them and supposing the soldiers had slept whilst the body was stolen why did not these soldiers suffer death according to the laws of both jews and romans lastly the assertion of the jews plainly contradicts it self for if the soldiers were awake why did they not hinder the disciples from taking away the body but if they were asleep how can they tell which way it was taken or who did it thus you may see the stupidity partiality and unbelief of the jews who give credit to the miracles of moses and the prophets for which they had only history and tradition and yet would not believe the miracles of jesus christ of which they every day were eyewitnesses  object   it is probable that the devil can do such miracles as christ did how then shall i certainly know whether christ did them by the power of god or of the devil  answ it is true indeed that we do not well know how far the power of satan extends but this we are certain of if he could work all the miracles that christ did he could not do them for the same end viz for confirming the true religion which wholly destroys the empire of the devil and commands nothing but what is for the glory of god and the good of mankind the devil is too great an enemy of both to do the least thing for the honor or good of either if then we suppose the devil can work any great miracles those of the pagan religion must be attributed to him for that religion is far more agreeable to the nature of the devil than to the attributes of our almighty creator as may appear by its precepts commanding the sacrifice of infants the worship of the sun moon and stars and even of the devil himself and many other absurdities contrary to the very essence of a god  object   christ did acknowledge the miracles of moses as wrought by the power of god why then did he abolish his religion and law  answ we grant that christ did acknowledge the miracles of moses and therefore he did not pretend to condemn the law for he assures us he came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it so that he only abrogated those rites and ceremonies which were not needful for the future the very covenant god made with the jews proves that the time would come that they should be abolished and he did not condemn them as false and contrary to the nature of god but only as imperfect and wanting that full accomplishment which came by jesus christ who has taught us not to worship god with sacrifices incense burntofferings etc but in spirit and in truth  object   why has not christ left to his church a continual power of working miracles  answ we are not to be too busy in enquiring into the secrets of the almighty it is sufficient for us that it is his will we ought to be satisfied and thankful that he showed his omnipotency in confirming that holy religion he was pleased to reveal but since the time of its infancy is past and the church is so propagated and established god needs not do any more miracles for the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  these were the chief arguments which i brought against the miracles of the christian religion to which having received satisfactory answers in the next place i opposed the great work of redemption and asked first  object   since god had determined to redeem mankind from their sins by the sufferings of his only son why did he not send him sooner into the world or rather immediately after the fall of adam that those who lived between adam and christ might have been partakers of this deliverance and salvation  answ   supposing you should ask why god did not create the world sooner and neither i nor any else can give you a reason this does not destroy the evidence of the creation so if i am not able to assign the cause why god did not send his son earlier into the world this does not invalidate the efficacy of our redemption all that can be said to it is that the infinite wisdom of god made choice of this fullness of time and thought it more convenient than any other  answ   though jesus christ came into the world some thousands of years after the sin of adam yet those that died before his nativity were partakers of the benefits of his redemption as well as we provided they lived according to the knowledge god had given them  object  0 could not god have delivered us from our sins by any other way than by the death of his only son  answ   nothing less it seems could satisfy his justice for we had offended an infinite god and consequently our sins were of infinite magnitude so that nothing could make an infinite atonement but a sacrifice of infinite value even his only son jesus  answ   had there been other means to satisfy our angry god and he had accepted one way you would have said why is god pleased this way rather than another so that if this method of arguing be allowed god would be obliged to act according to every mans humor and foolish capricios  answ   you may as well ask why god did not create men as perfect as the blessed angels and free from sin for this he could do if his infinite wisdom had thought fit and then we should not have stood in need of a redeemer  answ   the allknowing god has taken such methods as he thought proper to manifest his justice goodness mercy etc but his ways are incomprehensible so that we are obliged submissively to admire his infallible government who desires not the death of sinful man but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live must we not pay as great duty and deference to the king of kings as to our earthly sovereign shall a poor ignorant subject condemn his prince who has always approved himself a tender father of his country shall he i say censure the actions of his governor because he cannot conceive the political reasons for them as for instance how many subjects of france condemned the french king for concluding the peace at reswyck they knew indeed he was an ambitious prince and thought he would never make a peace if he had not a prospect of some great advantage by it yet they condemned him because they could not imagine the reason for his so doing which he has now told the world was to acquire the crown of spain for his grandson if then a subject ought to be obedient to and not to criticize upon his governors though he understands not the secret springs of state much more ought we humbly to submit to god though his ways are past finding out  object    christ could not pay that infinite satisfaction which you say the sin of adam required because as god he could not suffer much less could he die and as man he was mortal and therefore his sufferings and death were not a sufficient ransom alone to satisfy the infinite justice of god and atone for the sins of all mankind  answ   the meritorius death and passion of christ might be doubly satisfactory   in regard to gods holy will which required nothing more for the deliverance of us all but has been fully appeased by that victim only god sure might declare which way he would be satisfied and if in the old testament the sacrifices of beasts were sufficient to expiate the crimes of particular offenders much more can the sacrifices of the son of god atone for the sins of the whole world   in regard to the dignity of christs person who is god above all blessed for ever for though he suffered only in his manhood yet because that human nature was hypostatically joined to the godhead we may affirm that the everlasting son of god suffered all that the humanity of christ endured for us  answ   considering christ as a man his person so infinitely excelled all others that the sacrifice of it was an infinite atonement for our sins he was conceived by the holy ghost made man in the highest perfection called the son of god and predestined by the father to be our redeemer to this let us join the power he had to work miracles and the miracles likewise the father did to show he was his beloved son in whom he was well pleased and then we shall confess his person was most excellent even beyond expression and must give the greatest value to his sufferings for if the captivity of a prince be sufficient to ransom all his subjects much more may the death of christ atone for the sins of all mankind  object    god could never satisfy his own justice by giving his son for our redemption for he then would satisfy himself by himself which is as absurd as for a creditor to pay himself out of his own money  answ   if this be granted not only the efficacy of all the sacrifices that ever were offered must be destroyed but even the worship of god would cease for we cannot offer any thing but what entirely depends upon him  answ   we must consider that in the great works of our creation and redemption god acted not only by one of his attributes but by the harmony of them all as for example supposing there had been a man so excellently perfect and so little depending upon god that he could have paid the infinite ransom for all mankind it is true god by accepting him would have acted agreeable to his justice but not to his mercy goodness etc for god would not have shown his mercy by accepting a sacrifice proportionable to the transgression but now he has shown his love goodness and mercy to us by giving his own son to be a propitiation for us as he has satisfied his justice by christs sufferings and violent death  object    to whom then was the price of our redemption paid  answ to god the father whose eternal wrath we had deserved by sinning against his infinite majesty  object    but god the father gave us the redeemer  answ yes but though god sent him into the world yet it was necessary he should suffer and die for our redemption and as this great work was gods gracious and willing acceptance of his sufferings so there was something particularly for the man christ jesus to do for us viz that he who could have commanded more than twelve legions of angels should meekly submit and offer himself a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world this inestimable offering god was well pleased to accept and to blot out all our offenses for the sake of it and thus the great work of redemption was finished  object    if the sacrificing of children by the pagans seems so very unnatural surely the death and passion of christ show much more cruelty it is harder therefore for me to believe that god should require the sacrifice of his only son than of some thousands of infants  answ we will not positively affirm that the sacrificing of children is always unjust and cruel for if there be any cruelty in so doing it is against the very being of a god an example of which we have seen in abraham who would never so cheerfully have attempted to sacrifice his son isaac had he thought it contrary to the attributes of god and as to the sacrifice of the son of god the father did not act against his justice by accepting it for the better understanding of which let us consider   that injustice is a voluntary depriving another of what we are neither willing nor able to make restitution so then god was neither unjust nor cruel by giving his son once to die for us since he the third day after raised him from the dead and gave him a life far more glorious than that he had before god has amply rewarded the sufferings of his sons human nature by taking him into heaven and placing him at his own right hand for evermore   christ offered his life as a ransom for us and to be a mediator between god and man so there could be no injustice or cruelty in the fathers accepting what the son voluntarily offered on the contrary had not god accepted the full satisfaction which his son offered we should have more pretense to charge him with cruelty and injustice for we must condemn that creditor as cruel and unjust who will not accept the money his debtor is not able to pay when it is offered to him by some other charitable and generous man  object    why did god require the scacrifice of his only son when he had forbidded the jews to offer human sacrifices  answ   when god commanded the jews not to sacrifice their children he did not eternally oblige himself never to require upon the most extraordinary occasion especially any such sacrifice as we noted before in the example of isaac  answ   god did not command the jews to crucify jesus christ he only permitted him to fall into the hands of malicious and sinful men and christ like a lamb dumb before his shearers opened not his mouth against his murderers but though the jews through malice and envy condemned our savior nevertheless we may readily believe that god the father accepted his death as an expiatory sacrifice for the sins of the whole world  object    but the sin of adam and his depraved posterity is only a disobedience to gods commands so that christ by his perfect obedience might atone for these transgressions and therefore it was not absolutely necessary he should suffer and die for our redemption  answ   supposing god could have taken an easier way for our deliverance must we condemn him because he took this christ with a word could cure all diseases shall he then that is born blind murmur against him for putting clay and spittle upon his eyes and sending him to wash in the pool of siloam  answ   he that thinks the sin of adam was disobedience only is mistaken for his sin was threefold   he was guilty of infidelity because he believed the serpent rather than god   of ambition when he thought to be like god   of disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit  answ   lastly he is mistaken also who thinks the sinless life of christ was the complete and necessary satisfaction for the complicated sin of adam the satisfaction chiefly answers the penalty god almighty threatened adam with which punishment was death and christ has obtained our pardon by laying down his life for us  object    adam was threatened with death by which i understand eternal death but has christ suffered eternal death  answ christ did not suffer the eternal punishment we deserved but his agony and bloody passion were most severe and painful his death cursed and he perfectly innocent so that although we have deserved everlasting death yet god was pleased to accept the sufferings which our savior for our sakes willingly submitted to this sacrifice has made an atonement for our sins and we are again received into gods favor so that christ may properly be said to have died  that is for us  object    it is strange to me that christ who as a man was adorned with all virtues in perfection and who voluntarily offered himself to die for us should not bear his sufferings with as much joy and courage as many of the martyrs are reported to do but he said his soul was troubled even unto death his anguish was so great that he sweat drops of blood and prayed three times to his father that this cup might pass away and lastly upon the cross he cried out saying my god my god why have thou forsaken me  answ   we need not take for granted all that is contained in the books of martyrs some things therein perhaps were written purposely to encourage the christians in times of persecution and to exhort them to imitate the virtue and constancy of these martyrs  answ   these martyrs exerted their courage and subdued their passions in public that they might the better remove the fears of the remaining confessors but its probable in their confinement and private retirements they felt themselves to be but men  answ   if all be true that the writers of these books have said it must be attributed to the operation of gods holy spirit who gave them such an undaunted courage and an assured hope that they should receive everlasting glory but god permitted his son to be more troubled under his intense sufferings   because if one of us should be exposed to such trials for christs sake and this man should shrink and tremble at the approach of torments and death instead of showing that cheerfulness and presence of mind which the primitive martyrs did he should not therefore think his death unacceptable to god for it certainly would be grateful to god if he according to the example of christ meekly submitted to his holy will   that christs sufferings and death might be of greater value lastly that christ might be our helper and defender that he who was tempted suffered and died may be the more ready to assist and comfort us in all our trials and afflictions  these and the like objections i made against the work of redemption which being answered by my guide i began in the last place to attack the mysteries of the christian religion with the following arguments  object  0 we have hitherto spoke of christ and the holy ghost as two distinct persons in the godhead and the christian religion obliges us to believe the mystery of the trinity in unity and unity in trinity and that the second person in the trinity came into the world and took our nature upon him etc all which are mysteries indeed to me and seem contrary to my reason and the nature of god  answ we must not confound what is above reason with that which is contrary to reason we now by experience know many things which at first seemed above our reason one or two familiar instances will make this matter clear suppose a man born in a very cold climate should go into a hot country where the natives never saw snow nor ice and should tell them that where he was born the water at a certain season of the year was so hard that a horse can run over it these people would say it is against reason and contrary to the nature of water to grow hard and therefore because neither reason nor experience taught them otherwise they would conclude the traveller had a mind to impose upon them but if these inhabitants were persuaded he was a faithful honest man and said he saw it with his own eyes and would not tell a lie for the greatest advantage then certainly they would believe it upon his testimony though they could not conceive how such a thing should be another instance is the use of the loadstone the first that found it out was surely contradicted some perhaps believed him upon his word some doubted and others utterly denied the possibility of it but experience having convinced us now no body in these parts disputes it though we cannot conceive the reason for it the wisest philosophers have inquired into the nature of it but after all their suppositions and pretended demonstrations they are forced to place it amongst aristotles occult qualities and to say with me it is above reason so we may say of the christian mysteries a jew or a gentile who was never instructed in this doctrine takes it to be absurd against reason and the very being of a god but when they are convinced that christ was the author of it and that he was greater than all the prophets the son of god that could not impose upon us or be imposed upon that he had confirmed this doctrine by almost an infinite number of miracles that god from heaven had declared him to be his beloved son and commanded us to hear him i say after we are convinced of all this we must then conclude it is above but not against reason then we must condemn our too great presumption and confess the weakness of our reason which would comprehend the mysteries of god and yet cannot understand a multitude of natural things by these means it was that this holy doctrine was propagated and prevailed afterward some writers began to argue upon it and some endeavored to render it intelligible but their explanations are rather a disservice than advantage to it it is too true this holy doctrine has been condemned by some sects of christians but that never will destroy it i am very much mistaken if there be any truth let it be never so clear and evident but has been contradicted by some sort of men or another  the authors application  i dont wonder then that so many christians deny this for my own part i must to my shame confess that for some time after my conversion i had my share of doubts and scruples about it but having farther examined it i have been obliged to acknowledge my weakness and ignorance my too great presumption and too little humility in believing rather what my reason than what my blessed savior taught me but blessed be our merciful god my conviction is the stronger i shall not detain the reader by citing all the texts of holy scripture which teach this truth every one has his bible at home and i wish they frequently may read mark learn and inwardly digest what is contained therein i shall conclude this point by saying if we believe nothing but what we can comprehend we must list our selves amongst the skeptics and doubt of every thing we taste see or feel  object    did christ when he was an infant know he was god  answ did you know when you were but six months old that you were a rational creature you cannot say you did but let this satisfy you the godhead is not obliged to manifest it self in its glory wheresoever it is for the ubiquity of god fills all places imaginable however it does rarely manifest it self as it did on mount sinai etc  object    lastly i objected since the christian religion has such plain evidences and its precepts far excel what the prophets and philosophers taught why is it the least observed why dont the christians live according to these most excellent rules methinks if they believed what they profess they should with the greatest awe and diligence observe it  answ you must ask those unreasonable men who do not practice what they profess they have as much evidence as you and more too for they are not full of the prejudices of other religions and i am persuaded that the evidences i have brought to you are able to convince any thinking man i must with great concern acknowledge that the true religion is the least observed though it is ever the same but the evil practices of these professors ought not to be a scandal to you for since they have been educated in the true religion and so carelessly deviate from it their condemnation will be the greater let them remember our saviors words the servant that knows his masters will and does it not shall be beaten with many stripes therefore in another place he says they shall come from the east and from the west from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god but you your selves shall be thrust out that is many jews and gentiles who have lived according to the light of their reason that god bestowed upon them shall be received into the mercy of the father and be saved by christs blood whilst many christians who despise the grace of god and persist in their sinful courses shall be rejected and receive eternal damnation god of his infinite mercy grant we may not be of this number  these were the principal objections i brought against the christian religion and blessed for ever blessed be god that directed me to such a man who could give me such satisfactory answers that by the divine grace assisting i professed my self heartily willing to leave my old pagan idolatry and to embrace the true christian religion to this almighty god be all honor and glory ascribed now and for evermore amen  a description of the isle formosa by mr george psalmanaazaar chap i of the situation magnitude and division of the isle the island formosa which by the natives is called in their language gad avia from gad beautiful and avia an isle and by the chinese is called pacando is one of the most pleasant and excellent of all the asiatick isles whether we consider the convenient situation the healthful air the fruitful soil or the curious springs and useful rivers and rich mines of gold and silver wherewith it abounds for it enjoys many advantages which other islands want and wants none of those which they have  formosa and japan are the remotest parts toward the east which are hitherto known or discovered and so they are the first countries that are visited with the rays of the morning sun formosa has on the north side japan distant about  00 leagues on the north and west china from which it is distant about  0 leagues and on the south side luconia from which it is distant about  00 leagues  this isle formosa extends it self in length from north to south above  0 leagues and in breadth from east to west    leagues being about   0 leagues in circumference it is divided into five isles whereof two are called avias dos lardonos or the isles of thieves the third is called great peorko the fourth little peorko and the fifth which lies in the middle and is called kaboski or the principal island is greatest of all the five being    leagues in length and    in breadth is most strictly called gad avia or the island formosa though all the rest which for distinction sake are called by several names are comprehended under the general name of formosa and in this sense we shall use the word in the following account of this isle  chap ii of the great revolutions which have happened in the island formosa we find in our chronicles that above  00 years ago the island formosa had been governed for some ages by one king who in his administration depended upon the representatives of the people who are two or three men chosen in every city and village to take care of their public concerns this king whom the natives in their language called bagalo had one governor in each of the aforementioned isles subject to his power and accountable to him for their administration and this governor was called by the natives tano but about  00 years ago the emperor of tartary invaded this island and subdued which continued under the dominion of the tartars until the third generation but the third emperor who succeeded after this conquest being an austere tyranical prince who was very cruel to the natives and had formed a design to extirpate their religion did so provoke their natural rage that at last they did all with one consent take up arms and rose against his deputy and the forces by which he ruled them and drove them all out of the country after a bloody battle and thus they shook off the yoke of tartarian bondage under which they had groaned above  0 years and restored their natural prince to the rightful throne of of his ancestors who now became independent not only of a foreign prince but of all the little commonwealths within his own dominions in which state they continued above  0 years during which time the eueopeans came thither viz the dutch and english who maintained a great trade with the natives especially in great peorko where the dutch built a castle called tyowan at the same time while the dutch were there the chinese came and attempted to land in the island with a design to conquer it but were stoutly repulsed by the natives who took up arms in defense of their country and maintained a war with the chinese for some years until at last they drove them back into their own country and the formosans finding that the dutch under a false pretense of joining with them to force back the chinese had treacherously underhand assisted them to conquer formosa hoping at last to wrest it out of their hands and make it their own the hollanders were thereupon banished and prohibited to come any more into that island and their castle tyowan was demolished yet upon some fair promises they were afterward permitted again to land there provided they should stay but a little while and a sufficient guard should attend them and observe their motions thither therefore they come and when they can find what they have a mind to in formosa they go no farther but when they miss of their aim there then they travel further into japan viz to the isle of nangasaque for they are not permitted to go to any other place however under these commotions formosa still preserved its form of government independent of a foreign prince until meryaandanoo first ravished japan by villainy and then conquered formosa by a trick of both which revolutions i shall now give the reader a short and true account as it is to be found in our histories and is firmly believed by all the people of formosa upon a constant tradition from father to son for the space of fifty years and upwards  meryaandanoo was by nation a chinese but coming to japan while he was young he was by the favor of some great man admitted to some mean office in the court of the emperor chazadijn where he continued some time and had his education but the emperor perceiving that he was a a very ingenious young man and well qualified for a better office gave him at first some inferior place in the army in which he behaved himself so well that he was quickly preferred to a higher post and by his winning behavior and admirable conduct he so far insinnuated himself into the favor of the emperor that he was gradually advanced from one post of honor in the army to another until at last he arrived at the highest and was made carilhan or chief general of all the imperial forces which is the highest office in the empire not only for honor but for power and trust and in the administration of thi office he behaved himself with so much prudence and courage that the emperor loved him exceedingly but much more did he win the heart of the emperess who was so taken with his gallant mien that she could not live without him so great was her kindness to him and she put such an entire confidence in his fair speeches that she would often meet him in private places which was a favor very rare and unusual in that country especially from so great a person as the emperess having thus gained the love of the emperor and emperess to so great a degree this ungrateful villain made use of that familiarity to which the empress admitted him and of that confidence they both put in him first to raise a jealousy in the mind of the emperor against the emperess and then by this means to contrive an opportunity for murdering them both which barbarous design this bloody villain accomplished after this manner first he persuaded the emperor that his emperess was in love with a certain nobleman whom he supposed and she often met him and had private conversation with him in the garden whereupon the emperor being highly enraged both against this nobleman whom he falsely accused and against the emperess who was supposed to have kept company with him desired meryaandanoo to enquire diligently at what hour and in what place they were to meet together in the garden if it were possible for him to find it out and then says he come and acquaint me with it and i will take care that neither of them shall escape out of my hands until they have both suffered death according to the demerit of their crime this meryaandanoo promised to do as the emperor had desired him and sometime after he came out of the emperors presence he went to the apartment of the emperess and having good assurance of her ready compliance by his former private conversations with her he prayed her to meet him at a certain hour of that day in a certain place of the garden which she mistrusting nothing readily promised to do and appointed the time and place for their meeting having gained this point which was a great step toward finishing his design he went and acquainted the emperor that at such an hour the nobleman was to come and to meet his emperess in such a place of the garden whereupon the emperor presently commanded his guards to be got ready with which he intended to seize them both together and bring them to deserved punishment in the mean time meryaandanoo having changed his clothes and masked his face that he might not be known to the emperor under this disguise meets the emperess at the time and place appointed whom he most barbarously stabbed with a poisoned dagger to conceal the murder by stopping the effusion of blood the emperor comes at first all alone into that place of the garden to satisfy his curiosity of seeing them together fearing lest the appearance of the guards would make them run away and he perceived a certain nobleman as he supposed lying upon the emperess in an unseemly posture he called for his guards who were at some distance from the place but while he advanced toward the nobleman not knowing him to be meryaandanoo meryaandanoo was too nimble for him who come fully prepared to execute the wicked design he had plotted for he had no sooner called for his guards but he closed in with him and gave him his deaths wound with the same poisoned dagger and immediately after he had struck the blow he fled away with all possible speed through unbeaten paths among trees and bushes and so made his escape without being discovered when the guards came and found the emperor and emperess both killed they stood for some time astonished at this strange and surprising event but they wondered most of all at the murder of the emperor who so lately parted from them and whom they heard but a little before call upon them to come to him some condoled the sudden death of two such great persons while others searched every where about the garden among the trees and bushes to find out the murderer but when they saw that no discovery could be made the soldiers began to mutiny had not the captain of the guards diverted their fury by telling them that they must do nothing until they had first acquainted the carilhan with what had happened whereupon a party was immediately dispatched to his house whither he had made his escape after he had committed the murder and when they came there and told him he seemed to be mightily surprised and troubled as if he knew nothing of the matter but to lose no time in a case of so great consequence he went in all haste to the place where having viewed the dead bodies he evpressd his great sorrow with many sighs and tears for the loss of two persons so great and so good to whom he had been infinitely obliged and declared that this execrable murder had been committed by a certain nobleman naming him who had frequently kept company with the emperess in private and had appointed a meeting with her this very day as he was well assured this discovery gave great satisfaction to the guards who being glad of the opportunity to revenge the death of their master went presently and struck off the innocent noblemans head by his order who was the murderer himself meryaandanoo having thus far succeeded in his design wanted now only to be declared emperor which met with some opposition from those in the army who favored the family of chazadijn though he had no children by his emperess but only by his concubines and for some time there were many cabals and factions about the next successor to the empe but at last meryaandanoo having preengaged a great party for him and being generally beloved by the soldiers by his prevailing interest in the army was chosen and declared emperor of japan which was the finnishing of the great design he intended to accomplish by all the aforementioned villainies and cruelties  about two years after he was promoted to the imperial crown of japan he counterfeited himself to be sick and d innumerable sacrifices to be offered to the gods of japan for the recovery of his health but all these sacrifices proving as he pretended ineffectual so that these gods seemed either unable or unwilling to relieve him he declared though in deep dissimulation that it was necessary for him to seek for relief from the gods of other countries and to this end he sent an ambassador with a letter to the king of formosa who was to entreat the king of formosa in his name that he might have leave to send and offer sacrifices to the god of his country by whom he hoped to find that cure of his disease which in vain he had expected from his own gods though he had offered  0000 sacrifices to appease them  his letter to the king was to this purpose meryaandanoo emperor of japan to the king of formosa my friend etc being afflicted with a very grievous disease and having endeavored by my oblations to pacify the gods of my country that i might recover my health i have found all my endeavors hitherto ineffectual whether through the anger or impotence of the gods i know not and therefore having a great veneration for your god of whose great power and goodness i am fully persuaded i must entreat you to give leave that some of my subjects may be sent into your island who shall bring along with them the beasts they are to offer in sacrifice to your god for the recovery of my health and if your god shall be so far appeased by these sacrifices as to restore me to health i do hereby promise you that through all the empire of japan and in all the other isles subject to my dominion i will plant and establish your religion and so your god shall be our god and we shall live in perpetual friendship with one another  i expect your answer to this request by my ambassador   after the king of formosa had read the letter he sent for his priests and acquainted them with the contents of it and commanded them to consult their god whether he would grant what the emperor of japan had desired the priests hoping that they should reap great profit and advantage from the emperor by the japannesss coming into their country to offer sacrifice told the king that they had consulted their god and he had consented that they should come here to offer sacrifices but he had not declared what success their oblations should have as to restoring the health of their emperor the king having received this answer from his priests sent for the ambassadors of the emperor of japan and told them go and salute your emperor in my name and tell him that he has leave from my god and from me to send some of his subjects to offer sacrifices to our god and if our god shall restore his health i hope he will perform what he has promised of establishing the worship of our god in all his dominions  the ambassadors having taken their leave of our king returned home into their own country and acquainted the emperor of japan with the answer of the king of formosa to his letter who was very glad at the good success of their negotiation having further designs in it than they were aware of and therefore he presently commanded a great army to be made ready and ordered the soldiers to be put in great litters carried by two elephants which will hold thirty or forty men and to prevent any suspicion of the the formosans they placed oxen or rams to be seen at the windows of the litters thus he covertly conveyed a numerous army into the isle formosa with many of the nobility of his court under the religious pretense of offering sacrifice for the recovery of his health but really with a design to conquer the country the numerous chariots were divided into three parts the greatest of which was sent into the capital city xternetsa and the two other parts into two other cities called bigno and khadzey and at a certain hour appointed the chariots were opened in all the three cities the soldiers came out and with sword in hand threatening present death to the king and all the inhabitants of the city xternetsa which was likewise done in the other cities at the same time unless they would submit themselves to be governed by the emperor of japan the king considering that he had no other prospect but that of imminent and unavoidable death before him and that there was no hopes by his death to preserve the ancient liberties of his country chose rather to submit to the fatal necessity he was under than throw away his life to no purpose and the rest of the inhabitants every where followed his example in this surprising danger of death so that the whole kingdom was quickly reduced under the yoke of the emperor of japan without the effusion of much blood and from that time the emperor of japan sends a king into the isle formosa who is called tano angon or the superintendent king but he who was king before in that isle is only as a bagalandro or viceroy or one that is next to the king in dignity without any power and this is a short history of the manner how the isle formosa was subdued by the villainy of the emperor meryaandanoo who instead of sacrificing beasts to the god of the country as he pretended would have sacrificed the inhabitants to his own ambition if they had not prevented him by a voluntary submission to his rule and government i shall therefore in the next place give an account of the form of government in this isle which is now almost the same with that which is in the other isles of japan  chap iii of the form of government in the island formosa and of the new laws made by the emperor meryaandanoo meryaandanoo being thus settled emperor of japan and formosa made new laws relating to the deputy king and enforced the old laws relating to the subjects with grievous penalties as will appear hereafter  the first law is concerning the kings that are subject to him who are twenty five in number besides the eight who are not properly called angons or bagalos but viceroys or bagelanders and these kings are obliged by this law twice in a year to wait upon the emperor and then every one of them is to give an account of his administration of the government and of all the notable occurrences which have happened in his kingdom for the space of half a year and to receive the new commands of the emperor if he shall think fit to give any  the second law is that none of them shall transgress the commands of the emperor unless he first acquaints him with the necessity that forces him to do it yet in a case of urgent necessity this law is moderated by equity  the third law is that they shall do nothing to the detriment of the people subject to their government that they shall not be unjust or cruel to them or any ways prejudice them in their life fortune or reputation without a just cause which law he mde to gain the love of the people  the fourth is that none of the kings shall suffer a christian to live in his country but every one of them shall keep searchers or sentinels in the several sea ports who shall try all foreigners as soon as they arrive in the harbor whether they be christians or no by this test of trampling upon the crucifix which test was chiefly designed against the papists who worship the crucifix and therefore dare not trample upon it but as to other foreigners who do trample upon the crucifix the governor is to grant them a pass to travel through all the cities under his dominion provided they are not above twenty in number  the last is that no king can prohibit or enjoin any religion in his country but every subject shall enjoy the liberty of his conscience to worship his god after his own way except there shall be any found that are christians for the discovery of whom there shall be searchers appointed in all cities and villages who shall try them by the test aforementioned and to all these laws this sanction is added that if any person shall violate any one of these laws they shall presently be put to death which is the true reason why the commands of the emperor are every where so exactly obeyed  he made no new laws relating to the subjects but only revived the natural and ancient laws which he enforced with new penalties proportionable to the crimes  the first is against the christians that if any foreigner shall be found who is a christian and who has seduced or endeavored to seduce the inhabitants to christianity he shall be imprisoned together with all those whom he has seduced and if he will renounce the christian faith and worship idols he shall not only be pardoned but have a certain pension allowed him for his subsistence but if he refuse to do this he shall be burnt alive and as to those who have been seduced if they will return to their former idolatry they shall be set at liberty but if they will not they shall be hanged  the second is against murderers thieves and robbers viz whosoever shall kill another man unjustly shall be hanged up by the feet with his head downward and after this manner shall hang alive a longer or shorter time according to the aggravation of his crime until he be shot to death with arrows but if he be both a robber and a murderer he shall be crucified a thief shall be punished according to the heinousness of his crime either with hanging or continual imprisonment or with whipping or a fine  the third law is against adulterers viz they shall for the first offense pay a fine of  00 copans each copan being a piece of gold weighing a pound and those who have not money to pay such a fine they shall be publicly whipped by the hand of the hangman but if any person be guilty of the same crime a second time he or she shall be beheaded for though as will appear in the following chapter about religion every man may have as many wives as his estate is able to maintain yet if any man shall carnally know another woman besides his own wives to whom he has promised fidelity he is guilty of adultery the same law obliges all those who are unmarried provided they be natives of the country but this law does not extend to foreigners to whom the natives are wont to offer virgins or whores to be made use of at their pleasure with impunity  but here i must desire the reader to observe that the husband has such full power over his wife that if he apprehend her in the act of adultery he may punish her after what manner and to what degree he pleases even unto death but if the thing be not commonly known he may spare her if he thinks fit upon her promise of amendment for the future  the fourth law is whosoever shall suborn false witness against any man both he and the false witnesses shall have their tongue cut out and be further punished according to the heinousness of the crime and the damage done to the party against whom they testified  the fifth law is whosoever shall balspheme the god of the country he shall be burnt alive  the sixth is if a son or a daughter shall strike their father or mother or one of their kindred that is ancient or one that is superior to them in power their arms and legs shall be cut off and a stone being tied about their neck they shall be thrown into the sea or a river but if any one shall strike a priest their arms shall be burnt off and then their body shall be buried alive  whosoever shall strike his king intendant or governor shall be hanged up by the feet till he die having four dogs fastened to his body to tear it in pieces  the seventh is whosoever shall reproach or slander any man shall have his tongue bored through with a hot iron but whosoever refuses to obey his superior in things lawful shall be beheaded  the eighth is whosoever shall plot any treason against the emperor or any of the kings or shall endeavor the subversion of the religion established he shall be tortured with all imaginable torments  all these laws meryaandanoo made or revived in the fourth year of his empire at a meeting of all the kings of his empire and of all the chief priests of every city and by verture of them all the inhabitants enjoy a profound peace for as the subjects do readily obey the laws relating to themselves so the governors and officers are careful to put them in execution whenever there is occasion  this is what i chiefly intended in this chapter to give an account of the laws and their sanctions by which meryaandanoo governs his deputykings and their subjects and though there are other things which might be placed here under this head of government yet because they are hereafter to be inserted in their proper places they are here omitted  chap iv of the religion of the formosans since my design is only to give an account of the isle formosa i shall briefly mention but three kinds of religion that are observed in japan because of the affinity some of them have with that which is established in formosa  the first kind of religion is idolatry or the worship of idols and this kind of worship most generally prevails above all others in japan so that in one temple called amida in the capital city of meaco there are no fewer than   00 idols whereof  000 are of gold  000 of silver and  000 of brass and  00 of wood and stone and to these idols they sacrifice oxen rams goats and such like beasts and sometimes they sacrifice infants to them when their god is not appeased by other sacrifices  the second kind of religion is that of those who acknowledge one god whom they believe to be so sublime and great that they dare not sacrifice to him and therefore they have established the sun as the great power of god which rules and governs the world and the moon and stars as powers inferior to the sun which more exactly inspect and take care of terrestrial affairs wherefore they sacrifice infants to the sun and beasts to the moon and stars  the third sort is rather a sect of atheism than religion for they deny the being of god and affirm that the world was from eternity and shall continue to eternity hence some of them think rhat the soul is mortal and dies with the body like that of beasts but others of them say that the soul is not mortal but informs another body after death and so it passes out of one body into another to eternity whenever the soul has done well they think it passes into the body of a rich man who lives in great ease and pleasure but if it has done evil it passes into the body of some poor wretch to suffer pain and misery and so the soul is liable to endless vicissitudes of virtue and vice of pleasure and pain these atheists use no religious worship saving that they all offer sacrifice to evil spirits or devils that they may not hurt them but the transmigration of souls is believed not only by them but by all the jappannese except those who think that the soul is mortal  but my business is not to give a particular account of their several opinions and different ways of worship and therefore i have noted these things only en passant to show wherein they agree and wherein they differ from the religion established in formosa  the religion of the formasans was revealed by their god if we may believe their jarhabadiond i e the election of the land which makes mention of the revelation upon which they found the religious worship now used among them and gives the following account of it that about  00 years ago the inhabitants of formosa knew no other gods but the sun and the moon whom they believed to be supreme and the stars which they looked upon to be as it were semidei or subordinate gods and then their whole worship consisted in adoring them morning and evening and offering them the sacrifices of beasts but after some time there arose two philosophers who had led a pious and austere kind of life in the deserts and pretended that god had appeared to them and spoke to them to this purpose i am much troubled for the blindness of this people because they worship the sun moon and stars so devoutly as the supreme deity go and tell them i am the lord of the sun moon and stars of the heaven the earth the sea and all things that are in them i govern the creatures by the sun and moon and the  0 stars and without me they cannot exist go and tell them that god has appeared to you and said if they will worship and adore him he will be their protector and will appear to them in the churches which they build to his honor and promise them in my name that if they worship and obey me they shall receive great rewards after this life the names of these two philosophers were zeroaboabel which is a name unknown to to the japannese and chorhe mathcin which in the japan language signifies creator annunciat for chorhe signifies the creator and mathcin declares now these two pretending that god had spoke to them came to a certain mountain called tanalio near the capital city where the people were met together to offer sacrifice to the sun and told them to this effect o ye blind mortals who worship the stars so devoutly and are ignorant of the god who is above them that god who created the sun and moon and all things in heaven and earth has this day taken pity on you and appeared to us and commanded us to declare him unto you and after they had said this they demonstrated by many arguments that there is one supreme god who is above all the visible things in this world this discourse so much affected the people that they desired to know of them how that god would be worshipped whether they should worship him after the same manner as they now worshipped the sun to which they answered no but if they would worship him according to his mind in an acceptable manner they should first build him a temple and in that they should make a tabernacle and an altar and upon the altar they should burn  0000 hearts of young children under   years of age and when ye have done these things said they then god will appear to you in this tabernacle and tell you what you are to do further for his service when the people heard these things they could no longer refrain themselves but exclaimed against these two prophets as hypocrites and impostors and asked them in great rage how can your god be so cruel as to require us to kill so many of our sons and offer them up in sacrifice to him whereupon the two prophets fled away into the desert again having left these threatening words behind them we have told you what our god commanded us to say unto you but if ye will not believe our words and obey his will ye shall quickly find that the divine vengeance will pursue you  a little while after it was observed that the sky was darkened there fell much rain with hail which destroyed the fruits of the ground innumerable claps of thunder were heard in the air there were great earth quakes in several places and the air became so pestilential that the greatest part of the inhabitants were visisted with the plague the wild beasts came into their cities and even into their houses and devoured their young children and these calamities lasted for a day and a half which were so terrible that the whole island seemed to be in danger of utter ruin and destruction which sad prospect moved all the inhabitants to return unanimously to the mountain aforesaid and there they confessed their great fault in refusing to believe the two prophets and cried earnestly with all their hearts to that god who had spoken to them by those prophets deprecating his wrath for their past offenses and promising they would do whatsoever he should command them if he would now spare them and at length after long and humble supplication that god sent them a prophet which should declare a new peace and reconcilation between him and them upon which account they called him psalmanaazar a temple fig   page      i e the author of peace after he had published this joyful message unto them he commanded them to build a temple and in it an alter above that alter to make a tabernacle and then to sacrifice upon the alter  00 oxen  00 rams and  00 goats and to burn upon it  0000 hearts of young children under   years of age and then god would appear to them they built therefore a temple after the form described in the first figure  the first figure explained a the tower in which god appears in the tabernacle  b the tower in which are the singers and players upon instruments  c the windowtower which lets in the skylight  d the head of an ox or a symbol of god  e an image of the sun  f an image of the moon  g the gate of the temple  h the windows  i the parts covered with gold  k the place for the men  l the place for the women  the whole temple is built of foursquare stones after an exact model and is a most finished piece of architecture being of great bigness and height in the tower which looks toward the east is the tabernacle wherein god appears and the altar all which they built by the command of the prophet psalmanaazaar  the second figure explained   a crown hanging from the roof over the top of the tabernacle    the head of an ox or the symbol of their god   the top of the tabernacle with   burning lamps   a little pyramid upon which is the figure of the sun   another upon which is the figure of the moon   a lamp to the honor of the moon   a lamp to the honor of the sun     courtins which cover the concavity of the tabernacle on the ordinary days   the concavity of the tabernacle adorned with a skycolour and stars of gold representing the firmament in which god appears  0 their god showing himself to the people in the shape of an ox      two lamps burning to the honor of their god      two pyramids upon which are the  0 stars which are worshipped and all these things are to be the tabernacle and altar fig   page      made of gold or silver    the gridiron upon which the hearts of the young children are burnt      the furnace of fire for burning them      the chimmeys by which the smoke goes out    the caldron in which the flesh of the sacrifice is boiled      the furnace of fire for boiling them    the sanctuary or the place in which the young children are slain    the pit in which their blood and bodies are placed  0 the holy place wherein the beasts are slain for sacrifice    a marblestructure in which is a gridiron    a stonestructure that encompasseth the caldron in the form of an altar    the smoke of a furnace    the round part of the roof    the wall  this is the figure of the tabernacle as the first was of the temple which psalmanaazaar commanded to be built  the first temple was built in the capital city xternetsa and the tabernacle was placed in it and after these were finished every magistrate in the several cities and villages took an account how many sons there were in each family that they might be obliged to furnish their proportion for the sacrifices that were to be offered to this new god according to the number of sons that was in every family all things being thus prepared a great festival of  0 days was celebrated and every day of the  0 000 infants were sacrificed and then after the festival was ended and the last sacrifice was offered their new god begun to appear in the shape of an ox and spoke to the people and to psalmanaazaar and dictated to him whatever he would have done to his honor  he said therefore ye shall divide the year into  0 months which ye shall call by the names of the  0 stars viz dig damen analmen anioul dattibes dabes anaber nechem koriam turbam every month shall have four weeks and five of these months shall have    days viz the first   d   th   th and   th the other   shall have only    days every week shall have   days but in the months which have    days the last week shall have  0 days and the  0 th day shall be a day of fasting  ye shall begin the year from this day which is the first day of the month dig and the first of the festival of  0 days and at this festival ye shall sacrifice to me every year the hearts of   000 young boys under the age of   years on the first day of the year every month ye shall sacrifice in all your temples  000 beasts viz  00 bulls  00 sheep or rams and the rest in calves or lambs and every parish shall furnish their proportion for these sacrifices according to their ability every week ye shall offer of fowls as you are able and all these things you shall carefully observe every year  of the festivals ye shall celebrate two great festivals to my honor the first at the beginning of the new year which shall last for a whole week and the second in the last week of the  th month which shall also last for nine days the first and last of these days shall be observed by rising early in the morning and adoring and after ye have worshipped ye shall come into the temple and pray and sing hymns from one a clock until two at two a clock ye shall go to a fountain or river without the city and there ye shall throw water upon your head twelve times and then ye shall return into the temple ye shall go and return all together and while ye are on the way which shall take up the space of an hour in going and returning ye shall be all the while praying and after ye are returned then the beasts shall be slain and divided into parts and purified and boiled in their blood and every one shall come before the altar and take a piece of the flesh from the hand of the priest and shall eat it bending his left knee and bowing his head down to the ground and during all that time the instruments of music shall play and the singing men and all the people present shall sing hymns together the time of slaying and offering the sacrifices shall last for three hours viz from three a clock till six and at six there shall be a sermon or an explication of the first principles of religion and then a thanksgiving which being ended ye shall return home and continue there eating and drinking until the second hour after which ye shall return to the temple again and continue there until the sixth hour praying and singing with the instruments of music playing and then there shall be again a lecture upon the catechetical doctrins which being ended ye shall return home and recreate your selves with any lawful diversions  on other days between the first and last of the month ye shall rise in the morning and worship ye shall throw water upon your head three times and then go to the temple and stay there from the first hour to the sixth after the sixth ye shall return home and then ye may follow any lawful employment  but here the reader is desired to take notice that the day with them is divided into four parts and each part into fix hours when therefore it is said they shall stay in the temple from the first hour to the sixth it is to be understood they shall stay from   a clock to    according to the way of reckoning time used in europe  ye shall call the first and last day of the festival a double feast and the other days simple feasts on the first day of the month ye shall celebrate a double feast and on the second a simple feast and ye shall sacrifice oxen and sheep etc and ye shall eat of them the first day of the week shall be a double feast and ye shall sacrifice fowls and eat of them  note that a festival is therefore called double because the people go twice to the temple on that day and it is called simple because they go but once  and further it is to be noted that instead of our clocks and watches they measure time by an instrument made of wood in the form of our hour glass which being filled with sand runs all out in the space of an hour and this being observed by certain watchmen appointed on purpose for that end as soon as the sand is run out they beat a drum and give notice what hour it is which is the custom used in all cities but the country people judge as exactly as they can what hour it is by the sun moon or stars  chap v of fastingdays their god said moreover to psalmanaazaar besides those   days aforesaid ye shall observe   fasts the first shall be in the last week of the year which shall last for   days and it shall be a preparation for the new year the second shall be in the third week of the fifth month and it shall also last for eight days on these fastingdays ye shall neither eat nor drink any thing until the sun sets but after it is set every one may eat and drink to the full until he satiate himself on these fastingdays ye may pray to me but on your common days ye shall not dare to adore me these fasts shall be observed after this manner when ye rise in the morning ye shall worship and then wash your head and hands and feet and after that every one shall employ himself in some lawful business but neither you nor your cattle shall eat or drink any thing all that day until the sun set these fasts shall be every year observed as they are prescribed and indeed they are so rigorously observed that a man would sooner die for thirst then taste a drop of water on these days and all the cattle are shut up in such places where they have nothing to eat all day and all eatables are laid up where they cannot be seen lest any one should be tempted to break the fast in fine these are true fasts and strictly kept as far as human frailty will permit and not like the fasts of the papists wherein they can feast upon fish and wine  chap vi of the ceremonies to be observed on festivaldays on the double festivals the people wash their head hands and feet and then they go to the temple where the jarhabadiond is publicly read before them all by one of the priests and after that is read they all of them fall prostrate on the ground and the priests return thanks to their god with a loud voice who of his infinite mercy has called them to the true knowledge of himself the people in the mean time joining in their hearts with the words of the priest after the thanksgiving the people rise up and some hymns made by the chief priests are sung the flute and tymbrel and other instruments of music playing all the while then the priests begin to pray for the sanctification of the victims and after that they slay them and receive the blood into a copper they divide the flesh into pieces and then boil it with the blood in a chaldron which is upon the altar while the flesh is a boiling the chief priest prays to god that he would be pleased to accept of these sacrifices for the remission of the sins of the people and after the flesh is boiled the people draw near before the altar and every one of them receives a piece of it from the hand of the priest bowing down his head when he takes it and all this time the rest are singing and the instruments of music playing after these ceremonies are ended a priest goes up to a place higher than the seats of the people and there he preaches and instructs the people who ask him questions and he answers them at last thanks are returned and prayers are made for all things necessary and then all the people go home to dinner where they are to continue only for the space of two hours which is all the time allowed them between morning and evening service during which time they must not indulge themselves to excess or do any thing that is unlawful but behave themselves very modestly and then they return to the temple where the same ceremonies are used as were in the morning except the sacrifices and the service being ended they go to their own houses and after supper they may walk play or use any other lawful recreation but they must not do any servile work on that day  simple festivals are celebrated after the same manner as the vespers of the double festivals  it is further to be remarked that on festival days after the sacrifice is ended and the tabernacle in which their god dwells is opened when god appears in the form of a lion or a bear or some other fierce beast that then god is thought to be angry with the people and therefore in such a case the tabernacle is to be shut up again and new sacrifices of beasts are to be offered until god shall appear in another shape viz of an ox a calf a lamb or such like beasts and if these sacrifices of beasts are not sufficient to change the angry god into another shape then infants are to be offered in sacrifice unto him until such time as their god appearing in another form shows himself to be pacified and reconciled unto the people and if at any time he appears in the form of an elephant then we hope that he will do great things for us  the priests are to prepare themselves by fasting and prayer before they presume to speak to god in secret and after they have been with him they declare to the people what he says  it is yet further to be noted that their god always assumes the shape of a masculine creature and never of a female from whence they have been induced to believe that a woman is so impure that she can never attain to happiness until she be transformed into the body either of a man or some male beast  chap vii of the election of priests after this their god spoke to psalmanaazaar and said you shall choose one priest who shall preside over all the rest in the whole isle and he shall give power to others to exercise the priestly office this high priest shall never marry a wife while he continues in his office but if his constitution obliges him to marry then the other priests shall choose another in his room and he shall resign his office and marry when he pleases the other inferior priests may marry and keep one wife except they be regulars and then they are obliged to continue unmarried and to live in convents with their brethren under one superior who shall admit them to the priestly office but if these regulars also should have a violent inclination to marry then they must first leave the convent and resign their office and after that they may marry the office of these regulars is to instruct the youth in the principles of their religion to teach them to read and write and whatsoever else may conduce to their edification besides these regulars are obliged to lead religious lives and to cloth themselves in distinguishing habits they are to shave their head but not to cut their beard they are to wear a gown that does not open before or behind and a hood upon their heads and lastly they may retire from the world and live in desert places if they think fit to choose such an austere kind of life  as their god had commanded so did psalmanaazaar he created one ancient philosopher of the royal progeny high priest to whom he gave the power of ordaining all the other inferior priests this high priest therefore chose three out of the citizens of every city whom he ordained priests and one in every village until such time as temples were every where built and then the number of priests was more increased insomuch that in the city xternetsa the number grew at last to   0 and was proportionably augmented in other places whether cities or villages psalmanaazaar established also a monastery in xternetsa and in many other cities in which the regulars were to live according to the rules abovementioned which were prescribed by their god lastly he gave order that this high priest should ordain in every city one priest who might ordain others and he was called the chief sacrificator and has the power to ordain other subordinate priests and sacrificators these are the rites and ceremonies delivered to the formosans from their god by his prophet psalmanaazaar which have been ever since observed in their country  now the names of all the several kinds of priests in our language are these the high priest is called gnotoy bonzo the chief sacrificator is called gnotoy tarhadiazar the inferior sacrificators are called os tarhadiazors the priests who read the book of the law and the prayers are called ches bonzos the secular priests are called bonzos leydos and the regular bonzos roches and the superior who is set over the regulars is called bonzo soulleto the masters who teach the young children are called gnosophes bonzos and lastly the preachers are called bonzos jatupinos  the office of the high priest is to ordain others to speak to god in private and declare his will to all the other priests and to chastise those who do not faithfully discharge their office  the office of the chiefsacrificator is to ordain other priests within his own precinct which is as it were his diocese to rule over them and to take care of the sacrifices but chiefly of the infants that are to be sacrificed for which end he is to take an account how many boys each family can furnish and to admonish them in time to send in their number  moreover he alone is to cut the throats of the infants and pluck out their hearts others are to lay them upon the gridiron but he is to pray publicly all the time they are a burning  the office of the subordinate sacrficators is to slay the beasts to wash and boil them and distribute pieces of their flesh to the people and some of them are obliged to pray with the high priest all the time that these things are a doing  the office of the secular priests is various for some of them are readers others preachers or instructors of youth and others of them look after the temple and tabernacle to see that all the utensils belonging to them be kept in good order  the regular priests as i have already told you use to instruct youth and to preach but moreover they should live retired from the world preserve chastity and continue in celibacy they should submit themselves to their superiors fast once a week and by all means improve in virtue but if once they be debauched they do no longer observe the rule delivered as they believe by their god and their ancestors  and here it is to be noted that these regulars do not make such vows as the popish monks do for they only take the vow of celibacy neither do they vow that so absolutely but that they are still left at liberty if they find that they cannot refrain from women to leave the monastery and then to marry a wife but they make no vows of a blind obedience to their superiors of an affected poverty and humility and of renouncing the riches of this world the only general law of these societies is this whosoever finds himself fit and disposed to embrace a retired kind of life provided he be pious learned and sincere whether he be rich or poor is to be admitted into a convent and when he enters he is to bring with him that part of his fathers estate that belongs to him and add it to the revenues of the convent but if he be obliged out of a desire of marrying to leave it then all the goods he brought with him into the convent are restored to him and necessary food and raiment are gratis given him while he continued in it but if he require any thing extraordinary over and above the common allowance of the convent as some do then this is to be furnished at his own proper charge yet he is never permitted to go out of the bounds of the convent until he leave it for good and all if any one die in the convent he is to leave all his goods to it and while he lives in it he is to obey his superior in all things which concern their rules but no further for if any superior should command one of the regulars to eat only roots while others fare deliciously he may refuse to obey him but this is a case that has never happened  thus all religious rites and ceremonies are administered by one high priest by some sacrificators and some that are subordinate to them and by regular and secular priests but because all that has been hitherto said relates only to the worship of their god we shall now add something concerning the way of worshipping the sun moon and stars which are their ancient visible deities  chap viii concerning the worship of the sun moon and stars moreover the god of formosa said unto psalmazaaraar it shall not be lawful for you on common days to invoke or worship me but only the sun moon and  0 stars which i have appointed governors to rule the world and to provide all things necessary for you and ye shall sacrifice the same beasts to them as ye do to me but none of your infants shall be offered up in sacrifice to them for this is my peculiar worship which belongs to me only and after this manner ye shall worship and adore them  in the morning at the first hour at least on the common days ye shall rise up and throw water thrice upon your head and then ye shall ascend to the roof of your house and there ye shall adore the sun and   stars and pray to them not for any thing in particular but only in general that they would grant you such things as they know to be necessary for you and return them thanks for the favors ye have formerly received from them and in the night time at the first hour ye shall worship the moon and the other five stars after the same manner for ye must know that the sun is the first and most excellent creature which i have created to govern you and to him i have given power of conferring benefits upon you according as you deserve well of me and him the moon i have placed in the next degree below him and the  0 stars likewise in their proper places as being inferior to the other two but if ye neglect to worship them i have given them power not only to keep back the good things they can bestow but also to do you mischief by afflicting your bodies with grievous diseases by destroying the fruits of your ground and poisoning the air you breath with pestilential vapors and therefore ye shall account it your daily duty on the common days to worship and adore them after the manner before prescribed moreover ye shall observe three festivals in the year one to the honor of the sun another to the honor of the moon and a third to the honor of the  0 stars the first shall be in the first week of the second month called damen and shall last from the third until the ninth day of the week the second shall be in the first week of the   th month called dattibes and shall last from the third unto the   th day of the week the   d shall be in the third week of the   th month called koriam and shall last from the   th to the   th day of the week  ye shall make choice of a mountain on which ye shall build three alters one to the honor of the sun another to the honor of the moon and the   d to the honor of the  0 stars every city shall choose such a mountain to it self in some place near adjoining in which all the citizens and countrymen shall meet together on the first and last day of their festival and there ye shall sacrifice the same number of beasts as ye do to me ye shall not eat of the flesh of them but consume it wholly in the fire and every one shall carry home with him part of the ashes during all these festival days ye shall not work at your ordinary trades but after the sacrifice is ended ye may use any lawful recreation the sacrifice shall begin at the   d hour in the morning and shall last until the   th but at night every family shall worship on the top of their house as they use to do on the common days the sun moon and stars at least all of them together on the days between the first and last of the festival ye shall go to the mountain not to offer sacrifice there but for adoration and then ye shall sing and play upon instruments of music the high priest shall take care to appoint other priests to do sacrifice to them they are employed to offer sacrifice to me and these priests shall have leave to keep   wives and no more  these rules of worship psalmanaazaar delivered as from our god to the people whereupon the citizens of every city built   altars upon a mountain after the fashion represented in the following figure  the third figure explained   the image of the sun    two pots of incense wherein incense is burnt before the sun on its feast days   the top of the altar   the altar   the holy place in which the beasts are slain   the place in which they are burnt   and      the stonewall wherewith it is encompassed  the fourth figure explained a the image of the moon b two incensepots smoking on the festival days c the top of the altar d the altar e the holy place wherein the beasts are slain f the place where they are burnt g g the wall that

of it is built an altar to the sun and in a place a little below that is built one to the moon and in a place yet lower there is one to the  0 stars  thus the people did punctually obey the commands of our god and his orders as to religious worship are strictly observed to this very day  fig   page      the altar of the sun the altar of the moon the altar of the  0 stars   chap ix of the postures of the body in adoring the formosans in adoring god use various postures of body according to the several parts of religious worship they are performing for  st when the jarhabadiond is publicly read in their temples every one of them at least if he be capable of doing it bends a little the right knee and lifts up the right hand toward heaven   when thanks are given to god then all of them fall prostrate on the ground   after the thanksgiving when they sing songs or hymns they are to stand up with their hands joined together   when prayers are made for the sanctification of the sacrifices then every one bends the left knee and stretches out his arms wide open but when the victims are a slaying every one may sit upon the ground for they have no seats or pews such as you use here in england only the richer sort have a cushion to sit on while the flesh is a boiling every one stands with his hands joined together looking toward the upper part of the tabernacle after the flesh is boiled every one of the people takes a piece of the flesh from the priest and eats it and what remains the priests keep for themselves  when all these ceremonies are ended the tabernacle is opened and then every one for sometime lies prostrate on the ground to adore and after they rise up they may look upon their god and if he appears in the shape of an ox or suchlike tame beast then they leap for joy because they believe that god is wellpleased with them but if he appears in the shape of a lion then they think some great crime has been committed whereby god is much offended and therefore they endeavor by new sacrifices to appease him after the tabernacle is opened and every one has adored then there is a sermon and while that lasts the people stand and after sermon there is a short prayer and then a thansgiving after which the people bow down their body and touch the ground with the forefinger of their right hand and then depart  when the sun moon and stars are adored upon the mountain then they bend the right knee and hold up the right hand toward heaven when that chapter of jarhabadiond is read wherein our god commands them to worship the same posture of body is observed in their songs and hymns they stand with their hands joined together in their prayers they bend the left knee and stretch out their arms at their thansgiving the people stand looking toward heaven with their arms extended and wide open and the same posture they use on their common days when they worship the sun and the   stars but at night when they worship the moon and the   stars they stand with their hands joined together and this is all that is remarkable as to the several postures of body they use in their religious worship  chap x of the ceremonies that are observed at the birth of children by the command of our god the following ceremonies are observed at the birth of children  st when the mother feels the time of birth approaching she ought to offer sacrifices to the  0 stars more or less precious according to her ability after she is brought to bed of a child she is to keep the infant until the  st day of the week and on that day she is to wash her self and the infant and go unto the temple with her husband and to carry the infant with her and there to offer a sacrifice to our god then prayers are made for the infant and thanks are returned for her safe delivery then the mother and father do solemnly promise that they shall be ready to deliver up the child if it be a son and not the firstborn to be sacrificed to the honor of god whenever it shall be called for then a small fire being kindled of straw the chief sacrificator takes the child and makes it pass through the flame    times after which there comes another priest and anoints the childs skin with oil least it should suffer any prejudice by the flame all these things being ended the mother takes the child and the priest having read the thanksgiving she returns home with it where it is usual upon such occasions for the father and mother to make an entertainment for their kindred friends and some of the priests  when the child arrives at   years of age then the child is to go on a festival day unto the temple with its father and mother and there to make a vow unto god that since he was pleased not to desire him for a sacrifice he will faithfully observe whatsoever is commanded him in jarhabadiond and the father and mother do promise on their part that they will do whatever lies in their power for the honor of our god and then the priest reads a prayer and thansgiving and they all return home the  st ceremony is called abdalain or the purification the  d is called blado or the vow  but here it is to be noted that tho we use this ceremony of purification yet we do it not upon the account of any original sin in the infant which we are altogether ignorant of and yet because our god has commanded this purification to be used some of them believe that it is for the corruption of our nature and others that it is for the sins of our ancestors and chiefly of our father and mother for we think that god created this world in time and replenished it with men but we believe that god did not create mankind in the same corrupt state in which it now is but that men by degrees corrupted themselves and that they do daily more and more degenerate from their primitive state as we find too plainly by experience this is no article of our faith but only the opinion of some concerning the creation of the world and the state of the  st men created by god but our scripture makes no mention of these things  chap xi of our marriage or groutacho since our god requires the hearts of so many young boys to be offered up in sacrifice therefore lest the whole race of mankind should by degrees be extirpated he has permitted the men at least those of the laity to keep more wives than one and so some of them have         or more wives every one according to his estate whereby he is able to maintain a greater or lesser number but if any one takes more wives then his means will maintain he is to be beheaded and therefore to prevent this before any one marries a wife he is to be examined whether he has sufficient means to maintain her thus they may have many wives that they may beget many children every year of whom some of the sons are sacrificed but the daughters are all preserved for matrimony as will appear more fully hereafter  in the mean time this is well worthy to be observed that neither the brother can marry his sister nor the brothers son his own brothers daughter all marriage within these   degrees of consanguinity but not within the other degrees being so absolutely forbidden that the high priest himself cannot dispense with it  whenever therefore a man has a mind to take a wife whether he has one or more wives before or no he is first to agree with the father and mother for their good will and then to get the consent of the daughter after this before he is married he is to make known his design to the sacrificator who is to enquire whether he has sufficient means to maintain this wife he intends to marry and if he has then all the friends and relations are called together and the bridegroom and bride come along with them to the gate of the temple where they are met by a priest or the chief sacrificator who asks them what they desire to have done to which the bridegroom and bride answer they desire to be joined together in matrimony after which answer they are permitted  nter into the temple the reason why they are thus interrogated before their admission is this because no man may enter into the temple with any woman but his wife except at the time when he is to be married being thus introduced into the temple in order to their mre which is always to be celebrated on aple festivalday viz on the  d day  e month they are first to say their prayers and then to offer sacrifice after which the husband promises to be faithful to his wife i e that he will know no other woman besides those to whom he is joined in matrimony that he will exercise no tyranny over this woman nor do any thing to her contrary to the law of nature of god or of man etc likewise the wife promises to be faithful to her husband that she will know no other man besides him that she will be obedient to him in all things etc then they are both to swear before their god the sun moon and stars that they will faithfully keep this promise and to imprecate the divine vengeance if they shall break this solemn vow then prayers are said for them after which they return home with all their company at which time it is customary to make a great feast for them according to the estate of the bridegroom these things concern the ceremony of marrying but as to other things relating to a married state they shall be mentioned in their proper places  chap xii of the ceremonies toward the dead the same ceremonies are observed toward every one that is dead whether it be a man or a woman  in the first place many prayers are put up and sacrifices offered for the sick person but after death the dead body is to be kept    hours and to be anointed with oil whether it be to be burnt by day or by night after this a little while before the hour wherein it is to be burnt all the friends and relations of the decasd are sent for and in their presence the dead body is placed in a coffin which coffin is placed upon a table and then all the company that had been invited sit down at this table which is furnished with all sorts of meat of which they eat freely at last when the hour is come that the body must be carried away to the place of burial then come the priests both regular and secular and the players upon musical instruments and the mourners i e those who act the part of mourners for money and all these being come the coffin is laid upon a litter carried by   elephants all which may be better understood by the figure here annexed but it is to be remarked that in the description we have given of the funeral rites we suppose the person deceased to die rich for as to others the poorer they are the fewer ceremonies are observed at their funeral supposing therefore that the person deceased was rich after all the aforesaid ceremonies are ended which are to be observed at home then all the company which ought to be present at the funerals meet together in the house of the deceased and having placed the dead body in a litter they walk from the house to the place where the body is burnt in this order first one of the officers of the city leads the van carrying the banner of the deceased then follow several players upon instruments making a doleful noise after them if the person deceased be a nobleman but not else follow the soldiers who are to guard the body whereof some are armed with lances some with bows and arrows and others walk with naked swords in their hands after them follow the regulars before whom goes the officer of the convent carrying the arms of god and of the abbey after him follows the monks and last of all comes the abbot after them come the secular priests and before them the officer of the parish walks carrying the ensigns of god and of the temple then come all the common priests and after them the sacrificator of the sun and then of the moon and of the  0 stars after them come the sacrificators of our god and last of all the chief sacrificator with his servants attending him as to the high priest he never uses to be present at any funeral but when a king or a viceroy are dead but after the chief sacrificator follow the priests and then come the chariots full of beasts for sacrifice which are carried by elephants or camels after them come the mourners who walk before the dead body which is carried in a black litter like yours saving that the middle is raised up to a point like the top of a turret by   elephants the first whereof that which goes before the corpse is covered all over with black cloth so that nothing of it is to be seen but the head and on the cloth are fastened the coats of arms of all the ancestors of the deceased as his grandfathers great grandfathers and his parents all which are distinctly placed and lastly after the litter follow first the parents and kindred and then the friends of the deceased now when all this company is come to the place where the dead body is to be burnt then the priests regular and secular are to pray for the purification of the sacrifices after this the beasts are slain and burnt upon an altar which is built there upon this occasion and the ashes of the burnt sacrifices are thrown upon the pile of wood in which the dead body is to be burnt and after the coffin containing the dead body is placed upon the pile the fire is put to it which burns till all is consumed to ashes and then the ashes are buried in a place under ground near the place where the pile of wood stood and thus the whole ceremony is ended and all the company having saluted one another return home  chap xiii of our opinion concerning the state of souls after death since our scripture or the book which they call jarhabadiond promises great happiness after this life to those who have lived according to the natural divine and human laws but says nothing expressly of the state of souls after death hence we are divided into various opinions about it the transmigration of souls is generally believed by all of them which appears to have been the common and ancient opinion of almost all pagans but as to the manner of this transmigration we differ for some believe that the soul after death passes into the body of some beast either wild or tame some that it passes into the body of another man either poor or rich happy or miserable according to its behavior in the former body good or bad and so it continues to pass out of the body of one beast into another or of one man into another in endless circuits of happiness and misery others have more sublime notions of a departed soul for they believe that the soul which is to be rewarded with happiness after this life shall at last be transformed into a star and then being placed in heaven it shall enjoy all imaginable happiness which will consist in the vision and fruition of our god but because the sins of such a soul designed for this happiness which have been committed in this life are not always fully and perfectly blotted out before death but only covered by the sacrifices that have been offered for them therefore they appoint a certain place in which the soul before it arrives at this happiness may do penance for its sins which place they think to be the bodies of some beasts and for this reason they believe that god forbids the use of these beasts for food and will not suffer them to be killed but only for sacrifices viz oxen rams elephants hearts goats doves dogs horses camels etc all which beasts are forbidden to be slain by any one but only for sacrifices and if any of them die of themselves then they are buried after their death least they should be devoured by wild beasts they believe therefore that these souls designed for happiness shall remain in the bodies of beasts until they have done penance for the sins committed in their former bodies but after such a beast dies of it self or is offered in sacrifice to our god then they believe that the soul which was in it shall be transformed into a star in heaven where it shall enjoy eternal happiness  but all this seems to me to be a fiction invented by our priests because they reap great profit and advantage by it for when any one dies the relations of the deceased are to pay them a great sum of money more or less according to their ability which they promise to convey to the soul under penance for they persuade the people that the souls under penance stand in need of money which none know how to transmit to them but themselves and besides they receive as much money for the prayers and sacrifices that are offered for these souls while they continue in a state of penance  as for the damned souls they determine nothing for a certain truth but are divided into various opinions for some think that these souls shall inform the bodies of evil beasts as they call the lions wolfs tigers apes cats swine serpents and other such like beasts others believe that they are in a manner annihilated after they depart out of the body of a man but the more common opinion is that of those who believe that they wander eternally in the air and that god creates in them such a pain for the loss of their happiness and such a shame for the sins they have committed as fills them with a grief too great for human nature to bear and these damned souls they believe to be what here in europe you call devils and there they call os pagostos and therefore they offer sacrifices to these evil spirits because they believe that these sacrifices give them some ease of their pain and so hinder them from doing themselves a mischief  chap xiv of the priestly garments the priests were formerly left at their liberty to wear any kind of garments they pleased provided they were such as would distinguish them from the laity but now they have different kinds of garments every one according to their several offices which custom is never any more to be altered what these garments are may appear by the following description of them  the high priest has a skycolourd mitre the lower part of which is shaped like a crown and is placd upon a bonnet the hair of his head is short and of his beard long he wears a little cloak of a skycolour which is round before tapering behind and reaches down only to the elbow he wears also a long cloak like a gown which has sleeves open in the middle through which he puts his arms and that also is of a skycolour under this cloak there is a cloth of a violetcolour which hangs down before and behind and also a white tunick his stockins are such as are commonly worn but he has no breeches he wears shoes like sandals such as are commonly used by the capuchines in the romish church he carries an ironrod in his hand being a cubit long having a round head on which his coat of arms is engraven  the chief sacrificator has also a mitre upon his bonnet but no shape of a crown and from the round part of the bonnet there hangs a cloth which reaches down to the ground he has also a long gown which is tied about with a girdle the mitre is of a skycolour signifying his dignity and the bonnet of a redcolour signifying his office of sacrificator the cloth which hangs down from his bonnet is of a skycolour and his gown is red he always carries a sword in his hand in token of his bloody office his shoes and stockens are like those of the high priest and his girdle is usually of a whitecolour  the common sacrificator of our god has a sharppointed bonnet of a redcolour bending a little downward behind he wears a cloak like that of the high priest but of a redcolour and it is so short before that it covers only the knee but behind it hangs down to the ground he has also a red gown under his cloak  the sacrificators of the sun moon and  0 stars have the same garments but of a different color the sacrificator of the sun has a white bonnet with the figure of the sun on the top of it he wears also a red cloak and a white tunick the sacrificator of the moon has a white bonnet and the figure of the moon for distinction upon the top of it a white cloak and a red gown the sacrificator of the  0 stars has the figure of them upon a white bonnet and behind there is a short piece of cloth hanging down from the bonnet he wears a red cloak with a white sleeve and a white tunick all sacrificators carry a sword in their hand  the common priests have a kind of a bonnet upon which there is a short mitre shorter behind then before they wear a long gown of a white color whose sleeves are long and broad they do not tie their gown with a girdle but they have a short tunick under it made of cotton  the officers or servants belonging to the temples have also a habit distinct from the laity for they wear a bonnet different from the common people a black gown and a black rod about a cubit long and at all the common meetings they carry the arms of the parish and of religion like a banner  the regular priests wear the like garments with the secular but they are of a different color according to their several abbeys they have a sharppointed cowle upon their head they shave the hair of their head often but never their beard they have a long tunick and over it a short one but both of them are close the sleeve of their upper gown which is short but large usually hangs down low their stockens and shoes are like those of other priests their superior at public meetings has a mitre upon his head and his cowle hangs down behind besides he has a little short cloak like that of the highpriests but it is of a violetcolour and a violetcolourd cloth hanging down before and behind and a long tunick of a whitecolour and lastly a long cloak between the tunick and the little cloak which usually is of diverse colors he ought to have a long beard and short hair on his head he carries an ironrod in his hand like the high priest his shoes and breeches are like the rest of the regulars but when he is in the abbey he wears the same kind of clothes as the other monks  the servants of the abbey are clothed after the same manner as the servants of the temple except as to the bonnet which is such a bonnet as the boys wear here in london their other garments are distinguished only by their colors and this is all that occurs to me at present as to their habits and religion  all which habits may be seen in the figure of their funerals where all these habits of the priests are exactly represented  chap xv concerning their manners and customs it is certain that the manners of the formosans are not so corrupt as the people are in other places and the reason is because they are strictly obliged to observe the laws of their policy and religion under severe penalties with which the laws are enforced against the commission of any villainy or impiety so that none dare to violate them being restrained by the dread of their penalties which are certainly and impartially executed  they have diverse customs which will please some and displease others for first it is customary with them to adore the emperor as a god he never sets his foot upon the ground nor suffers the sun to shine upon his face none but noblemen are permitted to visit him nor are the inferior people admitted to see him except at the great festivals which are but   in a year and then he shows himself to all the people but first they are to bend their knees and fall prostrate on the ground and adore him after they have done this they may rise up and look upon him  they salute the kings by bending their knee joining their hands and bowing their head they salute the viceroys also by bending one knee  viz the left if he be the viceroy of a foreign king and the right if he be viceroy of one of his own kings and also by carrying his right hand from his head down to the ground  they salute an high priest as they do a king and the chief sacrificators as they do viceroys the noblemen and priests are saluted by carrying the hand from the head down to the shoe and by bowing the head one friend salutes another by kissing both his hands and joining them with his friends superiors do not salute an inferior but by a nod of their head they signify that they have seen him saluting them servants salute their masters by carrying their hand from their mouth down to the ground and falling prostrate on their face wives do salute and are saluted after the same manner as their husbands in speaking to noblemen they use not any particular distinct language as the chinese do nor any circumlocutions or different way of construction from what is used to inferior persons but calling them by their title and in speaking to them and even to the emperor himself they make use of the second person of the singular number and this is the customary way of speaking to great men which is observed in all japan  no conversation is allowed between any man and another mans wife nor between a bachelor and a maid but in the greatest feasts and diversions every one keeps among those of their own family the wives with their own husband the sons and daughters with their father and mother for if any man should see one man with anothers wife or a maid with a bachelor that is a stranger he would certainly account them adulterers  supposing that a man has   wives each wife has a private chamber for her self in which she lives with her own sons and daughters and takes pains in some kind of work and when the hour of dinner or supper comes a servant goes and knocks at their doors and then they come out of their chambers into the parlour where they are to eat after dinner they may walk for sometime with their husband in the garden and then every one of them returns to her own chamber again and continues there until the time of supper only sometimes they are allowed to meet and drink together such liquors as thee chila etc as soon as the hour of supper is come then a servant goes and calls them all and they come to supper after supper they walk and divert themselves with dancing singing or telling old stories or any such like recreation at last at the third hour of the night which is the  th hour here in england every one of them goes to her own chamber and the husband sends for one of them whom he has a mind to lie with that night and in the daytime he sometimes visits one of them sometimes another according to his fancy this kind of life is sweet and pleasant enough as long as every one of them is of an agreeable humor but if the husband begins to love one wife more then another then arises envy and emulation against that woman whom he loves most and hence strife and discord is spread through the whole family but when the husband is civil and discreet and imparts to each of them an equal share of his good will and friendship then all the wives endeavor to please him in all things and the house is like a paradise by their good agreement and dutiful care of their husband the women employ themselves in some kind of work proper for them in teaching and taking care of their children and sometimes they visit one another or spend their time in innocent recreations and while they continue dutiful and peaceable they may have any thing of their husbands that they desire who always marry them when they are very young viz between  0 and    years of age that they may the more easily bend them to comply with their humor every wife takes care of her own children but if one die and leave children behind her then the husband marries another and commits the care of them to her  this prerogative is granted to the first wife above all the rest that she is to take care of the family and is not so much subject to the husband as the others are for the other wives cannot go out of the house unless the husband be with them but the first wife may besides her first son is never to be sacrificed but is the heir of the family as we shall show hereafter and when the husband dies the first wife governs the family and the rest are subject to her and this custom prevails also among the japanners but with this difference that the japan women after the death of their husband may marry again but the formosan cannot the former receives some portion of their fathers estate but the latter do not  when any man has a mind to marry a maid with whom he is in love he must first acquaint the father and mother with his design and discover to them what estate he has etc and if the father and mother consent to give him their daughter in marriage then he is permitted to speak to the daughter but never before neither then is he allowed to converse with her in private but only in the presence of the father or mother or one of the maids kindred and if the daughter consent then the father and mother present him with some gift of small value as a ring some clothes or the like but they give him no portion out of the fathers estate with her  the first born son of the first wife as has been already noted is not to be sacrificed and is the heir of the family now the right of inheritance consists in this that he receives one half of the estate after the fathers death but the brethren divide the other half among them and if any one of them will marry a wife before the death of the father then the wife whom he marries continues in the husbands family until the father be dead and then the estate is divided and each brother takes his share of it and lives by himself  it is customary on solemn days between the first and last day of a festival for all sorts of people to feast their relations and friends as they use to do at births marriages and burials which has been already observed  the poor are not suffered to beg in the isle formosa but every precinct has some public house wherein they keep all their poor who are fed and clothed at the charge of the whole precinct and those of them who are able are put to work and labor but others who are disabled by age or sickness are maintained gratis this public house is called the house of god for the poor or in the language of the natives caa tuen pagot ack chabiscollinos if any stranger who comes from some other island of the japan empire happens to want subsistence while he is traveling through the country he is furnished with necessaries in every city and village that he passes through at the expense of the public  they have also taverns and victuallinghouses which men frequent for eating and drinking smoking and playing etc but no woman must come into any of these public houses  all japanners were wont to be very curious to see strangers and to entertain them very civilly but ever since the great slaughter was made of the christians that were there they hate all strangers that come into their country unless they come from some other island of japan as will appear more fully hereafter  chap xvi a description of the men in formosa although the country be very hot yet the men in all formosa are very fair at least those who can live upon their means but the country people servants and others who are exposed to the heat of the sun and are forced to work in the open air all day are very much tawnd by the burning heat the men of estates but especially the women are very fair for they during the hot season live under ground in places that are very cold they have also gardens and groves in them so thick set with trees that the sun cannot penetrate through them and they have tents which they use to sprinkle with water so that the heat can do them no hurt and hence it comes to pass that although the formosans live in a hotter country than the english yet they cannot so well endure heat  they use distilled waters not only to wash themselves but also to remove any speck upon the skin which is not rooted in the flesh and this is one means which makes them so fair  and here i must not omit to give some account of a controversy between the chinese and japannese on the one side and the natives of formosa on the other relating to the customs of these countries ye must know then that the chinese and japannese make their teeth artificially black but the formosans preserve theirs white the jappanese plead for their custom that all beauty consists in variety of colors and therefore as an ethiopian is counted most beautiful who has a black face and white teeth so the beauty of the natives in our country who have a fair face must consist in having black teeth but the formosans granting this argument answer for themselves that beauty may consist in some things which cannot be had thus it would be beautiful to have black eyes which yet cannot be made so and therefore say they nothing artificial ought to be made use of to make us appear otherwise than nature has framed us  hence the reader may observe that the formosans are also white and very fair but chiefly the women and if we may believe the proverb turkey and japan breeds the fairest women in the world the formosans generally speaking are of a short stature but they make up in thickness what they want in tallness they are commonly strongbodied men and indefatigable in labor they are very good soldiers and love war better then peace they are very kind and goodnatured toward their countrymen whom they love they love so well that they would lose their lives for them in a case of necessity but whom they hate they hate mortally and usually contrive their death in any way that is possible to them they are very industrious and cunning and quickly learn any thing they see done before them they abhor all falsehood and lying and therefore they have no value for merchants because they use many lies to commend their wares and put them off at a better price  chap xvii of the clothes worn in formosa by all ranks of people the formosans are certainly very curious in their clothes but they affect no new fashions as the europians do wherefore they seem to be still clothed according to their ancient custom in this they excel the europeans that the qualities and conditions of men may be discerned there by the distinction of their habits whereas here a nobleman cannot be known from a tradesman by his clothes the habits of the fomosans are not much different from those of the jappannese especially as to the common sort of people but the kings and viceroys and noblemen have different sorts of garbs the great difference between the jappannese and formasans consists in this that the jappannese wear   or   coats which they tie about with a girdle but the formosans have only one coat and use no girdle they walk with their breast open and cover their privy parts with a plate tied about them made of brass gold or silver the jappannese also wear little the king the queen light bonnets but the formosans use larger bonnets with a train hanging down to the ground made of some light stuff as silk cotton etc and when they walk they wrap it about their arm  we shall add no more about the jappannese since our design is only to give an account of the isle formosa and seeing as i have said the dignity and condition of every one may be discerned by their different habits i shall now briefly describe them  the king wears a short coat of silk which he ties with a most precious girdle and above that a long open gown made of very costly silk wrought with gold and silver he has a scarf that hangs over the right shoulder and reaches down to the left side of cloth of gold or silver curiously wrought with the needle which is the badge of his dignity he wears also a bonnet from whose top the stuff hangs down to the ground which bonnet is encompassed with a kind of a crown that glisters with precious stones and carbuncles he has no breeches but his knees are naked he wears stockens made of silk adorned with many ribbons his shoes like those of the priests aforementioned are a sort of sandals but most curiously wrought when he or any nobleman rides then he wears stockens and breeches together in one piece and a little bonnet his collar is made of silk but set with precious stones the hair of his head is short as is usual through all japan and his beard is about a thumbs length  the queen wears most beautiful garments that glister with precious stones she has no such headgeer as the women wear here in england but something made of gold or silver wrought with silk and so adorned with diamonds that it seems to be a crown her neckcloth is made of some precious matter her garments are very precious curiously wrought with the needle and long enough to reach down to her heel and the upper part of her sleeve is so broad that it touches the ground as does also her manto which hangs down so low behind her shoes and stockens are like her husbands but of a less size and have a higher heel she wears her hair hanging down behind over her gown which is not wide nor has many plaits she wears a girdle tied about her body very precious  the sons are clad after the same manner as the father only instead of the short gown they go with their breasts wide open and have a halfgirdle about their loins they wear not a bonnet until they be   years old the daughters also are clothed after the same manner as the mother except the viceroy the viceroys lady as to their headgear for they wear nothing upon their head but a little crown made of flowers or the feathers of some bird and they have no manto  the viceroy who had formerly been a king is still very splendid in his clothes his bonnet is very great and precious both for the matter of it and the curiosity of the workmanship and it is adorned with precious stones the hair of his head and his beard is short his collar is of black silk finely wrought with silver he wears a short coat of white silk which is tied about with a precious girdle and over that a long gown open and wide he has also a scarf like the king which hangs on the rightshoulder down to the leftside and lastly over his shoulders he has a little cloak made of red and black silk his vest is lined with the skin of some tiger or leopard he has no breeches but only stockens and his shoes are like those aforementioned  the viceroys queen is dressed much after the same manner as the queen saving that the queen has a coyff such as abovedescribd but the viceroys queen wears only her own hair adorned with silk and ribbons her gown is made after the same fashion as the queens but her manto is different in this that the queens manto hangs down behind only from her shoulders but that of the viceroys queen is like a large morninggown which is worn here in england only it wants sleeves and is lined with some beautiful skin the viceroys son has   coats a short one and another long but the shorter one is uppermost and comes down only to the knee his daughters are clad after the same manner as the mother saving that they have no manto  the noblemen wear the same coats as the viceroy but with this difference that the viceroy has no girdle about his long coat which the noblemen have they wear a scarf of silk from the rightshoulder to the leftside but their bonnet is like that of the citizens  the carillan or chiefgeneral has a bonnet like the viceroys but not so great in the forepart it is adorned with a diamond and precious stones his collar is of silk which encompasses his neck but does not hang down instead of a scarf he has a short cloak of silk which covers only his shoulders and a short tunick of silk his breeches and stockens are tied together his shoes are like other mens and lastly he has a long and wide open gown like the morning gowns that are worn here but much larger whose sleeves being open in the carillan or general  the generals lady  a gentleman  a gentlewoman  a burger  a country bumpkin  a virgin  a bride  the middle he puts his arms through and the rest of the sleeves hang low down toward the ground his wife is clad like the viceroys queen saving that she does not wear a manto his sons and daughters are clothed after the same manner as the viceroys  the wives of noblemen wear a little bonnet made of artificial flowers they have   tunicks one that is long and a short one over that which comes down only to the knee which they tie about with a girdle there is an handkerchief fastened to their bonnet which hangs down to their shoulders their sons and daughters are clothed after the same manner as those of the carillan  the citizens wear one gown only ought to keep the hair of their head short have a bonnet like the noblemen whose top made of silk or cotton reaches down to the ground they wear a collar but no shirt except in the nightime when they go to bed which is the custom of them all they walk in a long gown with naked breast and thighs but their privyparts are covered with a plate tied about them made of brass or silver or gold their stockens and shoes are such as are commonly used by others  their sons have a little bonnet a short gown tied about with a girdle which reaches down to the middle of their thigh they have shoes like their father but neither breeches nor stockens  the country people who dwell in villages and desertplaces wear nothing but a bears skin upon their shoulders and a plate to cover their privyparts made of brass or the shells of fish or the bark of trees their sons have nothing but a scarf hanging on their right shoulder down to their left side but otherwise they are stark naked when the countrymen are rich they and their sons wear a girdle about their loins which half covers their thighs instead of a plate tied with a girdle to cover their privyparts  the female sex is distinguished also among the common sort of people by   kinds of habits infants virgins brides married women and widows all which are clad in different apparel infants wear a short gown that reaches down to the middle of their thigh they have stockens and shoes like others but they do not cover their head until they be   years old virgins after they are   years old adorn their head with birds feathers or artificial flowers done up with ribbons they wear a short gown above another that is long and a married woman  a gentlemans nurse  a widow  a country woman  reaches to the ground both which they tie about them with a green girdle the long gown is divided into two in the lower part so that their legs appear as high as their knee they have stockens and shoes like other women  the brides at the time of their marriage do wonderfully adorn themselves their head is encompassed round with flowers laurels and feathers which make a great show they have two coats equally long whereof the under coat is white and the upper black and both of them are tied with a black girdle they wear a scarf of red silk hanging on the left shoulder down to the right side the black gown which is uppermost is open so that the white petticoat underneath may be seen and after this manner they are clad during all the time of courtship but   days after the celebration of marriage they put on the habit of married women  the married women wear a long open gown and below it a short coat which reaches down to their knee they have a kind of a cap upon their head like a platter and let their hair hang down in wreaths before their breast and when they go out they so cover their face that it can hardly be seen  widows have another kind of a cap which is twofold the first which they put on their head is almost round like an english womans coyff the other is a little sharppointed they dress their hair in wreaths they wear   gowns one long and another short one over it the short one ought always to be of a black color but the other which may be of any other color has long and broad sleeves which reach down to the knee and both the gowns are tied about with a girdle  the country women have nothing but a bears skin upon their shoulders and a cloth about their middle which reaches down to their knee they tie a piece of linen about their head and hair they have no stockens but shoes such as are worn by others their daughters wear nothing but a cloth about their middle and a scarf on the right shoulder hanging down to the left side and they have shoes like their mother  and here it is to be observed that all of them generally wear a bracelet about their arm but the women wear it both about their arm and their neck and this is all that i know to be remarkable as to their apparel i shall now only add something as to the military habit  the viceroys castle  a city house  a countreymans house    the king of the isle formosa has his own guards and so has the viceroy and therefore for distinctionsake they are differently clad all the officers in the kings guards are clad like the carillan saving that the carillan wears a carbuncle upon his bonnet which they have not and they wear a scarf which he has not  the kings guards have a round bonnet whose forepart is like a mitre and has the kings arms upon it the hair of their head is short and of their beard long and they have also a breast plate or stomacher made of silver on which are the kings arms a belt made of silk a short gown and stockens and breeches in a piece they wear a sword hanging by their left side and the weapons they use when they guard the king are the halberd or lance  the officers of the viceroys guards are clothed like the tanos or noblemen saving that they have not a scarf and use a short bonnet like the kings guards all the several degrees of officers are distinguished by colors at the pleasure of the king or viceroy  the guards of the viceroy wear a large long bonnet having   wings a long gown which they take up behind when they walk breeches and stockens in a piece the common sort of shoes the hair of their head and beard is short and their arms are short lances arrows and a sword by their side  all the soldiers which serve to guard the cities are clothed after the same manner viz they have a short bonnet with a crest of   or   feathers a short gown stockens and breeches in a piece all of them wear black clothes some are archers and carry a bow under their arm and have a quiver full of arrows others are spearmen and carry a long spear upon their shoulders but others have short spears  the drummers have a bonnet sharppointed at top with a piece of brass in the frontispiece of it whereon are engraven the arms of the isle they wear a short gown and a long one underneath it which they throw behind them their clothes are of a light red color  the ensigns have a bonnet like the noblemen and they are all such who are in this post they wear a long gown and a short one over it  this is all that i thought worthy to be remarked as to their apparel which although it may appear ridiculous to the europeans yet is there accounted very beautiful and splendid both for the colors and the materials of which it is made such as hair silk cotton which are curiously wrought with the needle for tho they do not affect new fashions of clothes yet they are very nice in choosing the finest stuff or cloth whereof to make them  chap xviii of their cities houses palaces castles there are only six towns in the isle formosa which deserve the name of a city two of them are in the principal island and they are called xternetsa and bigno there is one in great peorko which is called chabat and the  th is in one of the isles of robbers and is called arriow the  th and  th are in the other isle of robbers and they are called pineto and jarabut but in the little isle peorko there are none as will appear afterward  xternetsa as it is the capital city so it is the most beautiful of all the rest being situated in a very pleasant plain it is walls are  0 cubits high and   broad it is length is about    days journey for an elephant i e about six english miles there are in it desertplaces fields and mountains orchards meadows and the like places which are not inhabited but about the middle of it the houses are very magnificent and stately not far from it there is a mountain which abounds with many wholesome springs it is built by the side of a river which was made there on purpose for its convenience it abounds with fish and runs over the whole isle that which contributes much to make it beautiful are the many palaces that are in it viz of the king the viceroy and the nobles of the high priest and chief sacrificator all which are built after a wonderful manner as may appear by the figure here annexed which is a representation of the viceroys palace  this palace is built of apiece stones curiously cut as all the rest are whereof the greatest part is covered with gold this house alone is three english miles in circumference having a great ditch round about it besides there belong to it greens gardens walks groves all which are enclosed with a wall  the high priest and viceroy have palaces there almost as good but the king and carillan whose offices do not descend by succession to their posterity do not care to have such stately houses but the nobles have there very beautiful and magnificent houses there are also in the city xternetsa   great abbeys and   temples and many beautiful houses of the citizens it is observable that in the whole isle formosa there are no houses very high but in most great houses there are   stories one above ground for the cold season and the other under ground for the hot season which in all respects are very magnificent whether you look upon them within or without  the rich men and nobles build their houses of apiece stones but others build the outerpart of plain timber while the innerpart is adorned with painted wood or fine earthen ware gilded and painted which the natives there call porchellano but the english chinaware the citizens houses are long and the country peoples round in such manner as they appear in the figures here annexed  a the place above the roof of the house where they adore the sun moon and stars twice a day b the roof of the house c the place above ground d the place of the house which is under ground  nevertheless such long houses are sometimes to be found in the villages and those that are round in the cities at least in the remote places of them  bigno is a fine city but has nothing peculiar that is remarkable in the same principal island is the seaport town called kadzey which is very large and contains many villages and yet because it is not walled about it is accounted only a village  chabat arriow and pineto are cities which have nothing peculiar that is remarkable but in jarabut it is worth observation that the city is build round about a mountain which is a mile high and upon the top of it is built the palace of the governor who from his house can see the whole city and so can every citizen from the roof of his house behold the governors palace besides in the same city there is a fountain representing an elephant dancing upon   feet which is  0 cubits high and throws forth water out of all the parts of the body  this fountain is believed by the jappannese to have been built above    00 years ago by a certain god or hero who had been banished thither when the isle was yet uninhabited this god was called arbalo or wanderer and the story says that when he had built this fountain there it furnished him with fruit flesh and sweet wine but that after such time as he left the island it became barren and produced none of these things after this island came to be inhabited some men coming there and finding the curious fabric of this fountain conveyed water into it by aquaeducts from a mountain which is in the midst of the city from whence the jappannese have still in their temple amida the god arbalo with a painted fountain but the natives of the isle formosa give no credit to this story tho they know not by whom nor when this fountain was built yet they call the place of the fountain by the name arbalo  the history i do not deliver for a certain truth but neither do i account it altogether fabulous for it seems to me very probable that there is something of truth in it and therefore for the explication of it i shall add the following remarks  and first the reader is to take notice that all the gods which are called by any particular name such as amida xakha nakon arbalo etc are only saints or heroes and illustrious men who in former times were deified either for their reputed sanctity or some noble exploits or wonderful feats which they had performed such an one was arbalo who is the god of harvest among the japonese and whose image is commonly set in the husk of a grain of barley he is called arbalo i e a wanderer because he continually went about the fields and woods blessing the fruits of the ground  now it is possible that this man while he was alive did something that displeased the emperor or the dairo for which reason he was banished from his native country and there is no difficulty in conceiving this but how he should travel from japan to formosa which is  00 leagues distant from it and was then unknown to the japonese and uninhabited is something difficult to apprehend let us therefore suppose that this god arbalo was descended of some noble race for such are all the heroes in japan who were either come of some illustrious family or had been promoted to some eminent post of honor and this is the more probable because if he had been some inferior and mean family he would rather have been punished with death than sent into banishment for his offense this being granted we may suppose further that this honorable person carried along with him as his retinue a great multitude of servants and was sent at first at an isle next adjoining to japan and from thence passing on in a direct line through many little isles which are so near that you may see from one to the other in a clear day he came at last in sight of formosa where out of curiosity he landed with his servants and finding it a pleasant and fruitful country he settled there for some time and built the fountain abovementioned and then we may suppose that he returned again to japan and sent from thence some colonies to inhabit formosa but i must confess that we have no history in formosa so ancient as this which is only to be found in japan and therefore we can give no account of any thing that happened between us and the japonese after this first settlement for we have lost all the memoirs of our first original and the transactions which happened after the first plantation of our country until the japonese ravished our kingdom from us and restored it to the empire of japan however it may appear from what has been said that the story of arbalo is not fabulous nor so improbable as at first blush it may seem to be  besides these cities already named there are   seaport towns which exceed some cities for bigness but because they are not walled about they are held only villages or towns these   are called aok louctau and voo and besides them there are many other villages of the like bigness but this is to be noted of villages seaport towns and others that they all depend on their own cities and that the other cities depend upon the capital city xternetsa  in the little peorko there is neither city nor village to be found but concerning this island it is to be observed that at first it belonged to the king who is now viceroy but afterward the priests purchased it to feed in it the fourfooted beasts which are designed for sacrifice and now every one is obliged to give not the first fruits of their flocks but one out of every three beasts that fall which is to be kept there until it be fit to be sacrificed and therefore in little peorko there are only some shepherds who look after the beasts that are fed in that island which is very fruitful in grass and hay and might perhaps produce many other things if they were planted there but this is not done because it is designed only for the beasts aforesaid  these are all the notable things that occur to me concerning their cities villages and houses yet it must be acknowledged that there is a great deal of difference between the cities of formosa and those of japan both for their bigness and the richness of their materials tho the jappannese when they come to formosa cannot sufficiently admire its cities for their beauty situation and conveniences  chap xix of the commodities which they have and some that they want the great quantity of gold and silver that is in formosa is that which brings them the greatest profit for in the principal island they have two mines of gold and two of brass tho none of silver in great peorko there are   mines one of gold and another of silver in one of the isles of robbers there is a mine called a goldmine which is not valued in others counties because it is not truly and properly gold but it is highly esteemed in the isle where it is found because it is fitter for many necessary uses among them than gold it self is in the other isle of robbers there are   little silvermines so that in all there are   mines of gold and   of silver all these mines formerly pertaind to the viceroy but now the king has one third part and the emperor another  silver in formosa is almost esteemed as much as gold because it is fitter for use being a softer metal which is more easily wrought into any shape they have no iron or steel but what the jappannese bring thither who have one mine of iron and therefore iron and also copper which is brought from other parts is more esteemed there than gold and silver but brass is very common among them  utensils and dishes are usually made of gold or china earth their temples and houses are often covered with gold both in cities and villages but since the hollanders came there and exchanged their iron for our gold the natives have more rarely made any gold  lead and tinn are not the product of the isle but they are abundantly supplied with it from the neighboring countries  silks and cotton of two sorts they have in great quantities which are very artificially interwoven with gold and silver one sort of cotton grows upon trees in bags and is the finer sort another grows upon a shrub like a thistle and is a coarser sort and this is the great employment of the women who of these materials make clothes carpets tapestry and such kind of things wonderfully fine of silk and hair are made velvet and plush but this kind of work belongs to the men and not to the women they have not woollencloth because they know not how to make it but they receive great quantities of this cloth from the hollanders they make stuffs of hair and cotton but no cloth of flax which does not grow there but flaxen cloth they receive from the dutch they work paint and gild chinaearth very wonderfully nay even much finer then they do in china they have learned from the hollanders to make a kind of paper which they knew not how to do before for they wrote either upon plates of copper or upon parchment but now they write on paper made of silk after the same manner as it is made here  instead of leather to make shoes of they use the bark of trees for the soles and some skins of beasts to serve for the upperleather  chap xx of weights and measures before the dutch arrived on our coasts we had a certain way of reckoning things whereby we could know when their numbers were equal or unequal but we had no kind of weight such as a pound or an ounce and therefore we bought and sold things by view and not by weight but after the hollanders came among us and showed us how profitable the use of pounds and ounces would be in commerce we begun to weigh things that are rare by ounces and pounds but things that are common and less valuable by  0 or  00 l weight at a time as the buyer and seller had a mind our pound agrees with the dutch pound which consists of    ounces and is more then that pound which is used in france which i found by a copan of our money that i brought with me to france which weighed more then one of the french pounds tho it was but a dutch pound  things are measured in formosa according to the peoples various humors for some use a greater some a less measure but the price is always fixed according to the greatness of the measure  the instrument wherewith they weigh things is such as is used by the butchers here in england when they weigh their meat but some are bigger some less as their occasions require  they had no names for numbers before the dutch came here but they sufficiently declared to one another what number they meant by their signs and fingers but because the dutch did not understand this way of reckoning they persuaded us to invent names to signify numbers which now we use after the same manner as they do proceeding from one to ten from ten to twenty and so to a hundred a thousand etc as appears in this example  taufb   bogio   charhe   kiorh   nokin   dekie   meni   thenio   sonio   kon  0 amkon    or taufkon    bogiokon    charhekon    kiorhkon    nokiekon    dekiekon    menikon    thenikon    soniokon    borhny  0 after this borhny  tauf   or am borhny   bogio   and so on to chorhny  0 kiorhny    nokiorhny  0 dekiorhny  0 meniorhny    theniorhny  0 soniorhny  0 ptommftomm  00 and ianate  000 so  000  000 etc and this may suffice for this article  chap xxi of the superstitious customs of the common people the common people are so much addicted to the superstitious ways of foretelling things future that nothing happens to them either ordinary or extraordinary of which they do not make a good or bad omen and particularly they lay a great stress on dreams of all which i shall give some instances so far as i can remember if any one dreams that he is at a great feast among women this signifies that he has many enemies who are contriving to kill him or do him some mischief if any one dreams that he is bit or hurt by a lion a serpent or some such beast he ought to have a care of a certain enemy who will attempt to do him an injury but if he dreams that he has killed a wild beast then he thinks himself secure from all danger until a contrary dream happens if any one dreams that one of his relations or himself is dead they believe that god is angry with him and therefore they usually consult the priests what they are to do in this case who always advise them to give something wherewithal to atone their angry god if any one dreams that he has lice gnats or ants upon his body then they think that the soul of some of their deceased relations is detained in the body of some beast as was beforementioned and wants money and other things which they therefore take care to give to the priests that they may convey them to the soul in distress if any one dreams that he has lain with another mans wife then he is afraid lest some man lie with one of his wives and therefore he more narrowly observes them then at other times and so much may suffice concerning dreams  they observe also other omens as the first thought that comes into their mind in a morning after sleep and the first beast they see in a morning but then they say if such a thing which comes into their mind do not strike their fancy the omen concerns some other body but if it strikes the imagination then they apply it to themselves there were a certain sort of men who pretended to explain very clearly all kinds of omens for a very small matter but being for the most part mistaken in their conjectures the people complained of them to the priests who accused them to the viceroy as guilty of a capital crime for which the viceroy condemned them to dye and ever since the priests alone challenge to themselves the privilege who so explain all sorts of omens that they can never be convicted of lying in what they say for either they pretend that their god is wellpleased or that he is angry with such a man or that the souls of some of his deceased relations want money or that in the same instant when they saw such an omen the soul of some of his relations was transformed into a star all which the people do easily believe who are therefore persuaded by the priests to acquaint them with all the omens they meet with  and here i shall briefly relate a notable story concerning this matter a certain rich countryman being much addicted to this kind of superstition had used for a long time to consult the priests who were wont very often to expound his omens of the need some of his relations souls stood in of money because he was rich the countryman at last grew weary of such expensive enquiries and thought he had given money enough to redeem all the souls that belonged to the isle and therefore contrived a way to cheat the priest for which end he went and told him that in the morning he had seen in his garden more then a  00 birds singing which after a short stay flew away but the priest told him if these birds had continued a longer time in the garden then for certain the souls of your deceased relations had been transformed into stars but their sudden departure signified that they still wanted something which being furnished then says he you may see them this night ascending into heaven for which end you must give me so much gold so much rice and so much of other commodities and then you may remain two hours upon the roof of the house and you shall see the stars as it were moving themselves which are the souls signified by the birds you saw in the garden the countryman though much against his will gave the priest what he demanded and perhaps did still believe that there was something of truth in what he said and therefore he went up to the top of his house and as the priest had said he saw the stars moving themselves but having continued there all night he observed a great multitude of stars thus moving and this observation he renewed every night for a whole week until at last he recckoned more stars thus moving then the number of men who were known to be dead in the whole island for the space of three years amounted to whereupon he went to the priest and told him of it and the priest perceiving that he had detected the imposture carried him before the chief sacrificator who carried them both before the high priest or their pope who upon hearing the whole matter condemned the priest to perpetual imprisonment because he had expossd to the countryman the mystery of transforming souls into stars but condemned the countryman to death for not yiedling due deference and submission to the priest from whence every one may clearly perceive what tyranny the priests exercise over the common people who are not permitted to declare publicly any doubt they have even of those things they know to be false i could add several other things to the same purpose but that i think they will be tedious to the reader as the noise which is made by the dogs when they bark aloud or houle the crowing of a hen like a cock the time when the serpents hiss in the fields when the bears do not go out of the wood when the eagles sit upon some turrets houses or trees all which are interpreted to be good or bad omens but i have said enough of these fopperies  chap xxii of the diseases in formosa and their cures the greatest disease to which the natives are subject is the plague which they believe does not proceed from natural causes but from the common consent of the sun moon and stars who agree in sending it for a punishment to men and therefore they rather make use of sacrifices than medicines for the cure of it this does not happen frequently for it is now   0 years since there was a plague in formosa if we may believe their written books and tradition one custom they have during the time of the plague which is very remarkable they ascend to the tops of the highest mountains that at other times are not inhabited for the thinness of the air which is then accounted very wholesome and there they seek out a fountain of water of which they drink to excess eating nothing but herbs and certain fruits and this they continue to do till they think that the plague is ceased and then every one returns to his own house  as to other diseases which are very common here as the gout the tertian and quartan ague they are not at all known there yet they are sometimes but very seldom troubled with burning fevers at other times they have a pain in the head or stomach but it lasts not long if at any time they find themselves indisposed or any disease coming upon them they commonly use this method for a cure they run   or   miles as swiftly as they can and in the mean time one prepares a potion for him that runs made of some herbs and roots which he drinks off after he has run his race while he is very hot and immediately goes to bed where he sweats till he has cured the disease and besides their temperate way of living conduces very much either to prevent or cure their diseases especially when they take tobacco which purges the head and body of ill humors here in england the generality of people frequent taverns or alehouses and the constant custom of drinking such liquors as are sold there proves prejudicial to the health but in formosa they commonly spend their idle hours in walking or chatting together and smoking a pipe of tobacco and if they drink any thing it is only a dish or two of tea or chila which if it does not any good at least is no ways hurtful to the health and hence it comes to pass that men generally live longer there than they do here and are free from many diseases to which englishmen are liable it is a mistake to think that the air alone will preserve our health unless we be also temperate in eating and drinking and this i have found true by experience that no distinction of climates has ever depraved my temper and constitution of body but by the help of temperance i have still preserved my health thanks be to god not only in my own country but in all the other countries through which i have traveled but to return to the iseases of formosa the small pox is very rife there and scarce one escapes them but they have them commonly whilst they are very young as in the   st or   th month or the   st or   d year after they are born but they very seldom have them after they are three years old neither do i remember that i have ever heard of one that died of that disease  after the smallpox there commonly succeeds a certain disease which we call schimpyo which is only a redness of the flesh together with a great internal heat and the infants which are troubled with this disease run the hazard of death unless they be kept at a distance from a serene air and must live in places that are very warm until they be cured but these   diseases incident to children last no longer then   or at most   weeks  colicks are also very frequent in formosa in which the pain is sometimes so intolerable that some kill themselves others command another to kill them  women in childbed are in great danger of death which i think proceeds from want of exercise because when they are with child they never stir out of the chamber but sit and work there all the day long many of them die before they bring forth or if they escape death yet at least they are cruelly tormented with pains which some of them endure for a whole month before they are brought to bed  maids for the most part when they come to be    or  0 years old are troubled with a certain disease which we call chatarsko and here in england is called the green sickness which makes them melancholy and destroys all their appetite to any thing except matrimony corrupts the blood and makes them palecolourd this disease is peculiar to the female sex for which there is no other remedy but marriage  these are all the diseases which i can remember but there may be others unknown to me i will conclude with this general observation that both men and women for the most part die rather of a great old age than of any other pains except in childbearing and fits of the colic and you may frequently see men a  00 years old without laboring under any grievous disease if any ask me whether there be any such thing as the french pox there i answer i never heard of any such disease and probably there is no such thing in formosa because they allow polygamy and prohibit adultery  chap xxiii of the revenues of the king the viceroy the general of the army and of all others in high places of power and trust the king besides the third part of the gold and silver dug out of the mines which is paid him by the viceroy as has been observed in the chapter of metals receives also from the emperor of japan  00000 copans out of which revenue he is to pay   000 japan soldiers above mentioned his own guards and to maintain the port of his court the carillan or general has every year about  0000 copans the viceroy has      0 copans out of which he pays to the gnotoy bonzo or the high priest  0000 for himself to the seven gnotoi tarhadiazos or chief sacrificators   00 to the four governors of the four isles   00 viz to each of them  00 to the six governors of the six cities  000 viz to each of them  00 to the sixteen governors of the villages and towns  000 viz to some of them  00 to others   0 and to others  00 but the secular priests are maintained by the people after all which disbursements there remains in the hands of the viceroy  00  0 out of which he is to pay his soldiers and all officers employed by the government as searchers guards and suchlike but this revenue of the viceroy is not always a certain stated sum for sometimes he receives more sometimes less but the others abovementioned receive always the same salaries  this revenue of the viceroy arises partly from the mines partly from a tax of a fifth part of all goods which is paid by merchants countrymen and all others who have no office under the government and is called tuen koon bogio i e two parts out of ten and from another tax which is raised upon all goods exported and imported which is called tuen dekie bogio because they pay a third part to the viceroy  chap xxiv of all the fruits of the ground no corn such as wheat and barley does grow in the isle formosa and the reason of it is this because the sun being very hot the soil is sandy and dry and so the grain is dried up not having sufficient moisture before it is fully ripened but instead of corn they make use of roots to make bread withal there are two roots of which they make bread whereof one is called chitok and the other magnok both these roots are sown like rapeseed and when they are grown ripe they are as big as a mans thigh these roots grow twice and sometimes thrice in a year when it is a good season and as soon as they are fully ripe they are cut off and laid in the sun to be dried and when they are dried they are cut in pieces and ground into a kind of flower and then this flower being mixed with milk water sugar and spices is baked and so it makes a very good sort of bread which is as white as snow and is called by the natives kahatzadao they have bread also made of wheat whichis brought thither from foreign parts but that is too dear for the common sort of people they have a kind of bread also made of rice boiled with saffron which bread is like an english pudding and is called by the natives kdekh but this bread will not keep like the former  they have vines also and make wine of the grapes in some few places but this wine is not so sweet as the spanish wine in europe from whence they have that and other wines and also ale brought thither by the dutch but they are very dear and are not so much loved by the natives as they are by the europeans they have many other kinds of drink as armagnok puntet charpok chilak caffe and tea armagnok i e the fellow of magnok because these two are an agreeable mixture for health which liquor is made after this manner they boil a great quantity of rice in spring water till it grows very thick and then they make balls of it as big as a mans fist which they dry in the sun and then boil them in fresh spring water and when it is boiled enough they put it into great earthen vessels and let it ferment and after that it is as strong or rather stronger than english beer and the longer it is kept the stronger it grows puntet is a liquor that runs from some trees which they tap at a certain season of the year and the liquor that comes from them they receive into vessels and mix it with sugar and then having kept it for some time it has the same taste as soft ale made of oatmalt charpok is the name of the fruit of a tree and of the liquor that comes out of it the trees is like a wallnut tree but in this differs from all other trees that whereas their fruit hangs downward the fruit of this stands upright the fruit in shape and bigness resembles a gourd and when it is ripe it is cut off and pierced through that the liquor may run out of it which is very strong for if it be not pressed the liquor is more intoxicating than distilled waters or brandywine chilak is a kind of a powder made like coffee and is boiled after the same manner either with milk or water but in this it differs from coffee that it may be drunk cold whereas coffee is always drunk hot tea and coffee are of the same sort and the liquors are made after the same manner there as everywhere else besides these liquors they have many others sorts such are the bullan which is made of apples and pears or of oranges and lemmons and another liquor which is made like the orgeat of the same materials and lastly they who can get no other liquor drink milk and water  besides all sorts of fruits which are to be found here in england as apples pears cherries nuts plums etc they have many other things such as oranges lemmons sugar in great quantities and spices as pepper cinnamon cloves nutmegs tea cocos coffee and the like which are either wholly wanting here or at least grow very rarely in england their trees bear twice in a year and the fig tree three or four times and these fruits ye have here of the same kind with theirs are not half so good or so great or so welltasted so that the ground there seems to have a peculiar virtue for ripening and improving the fruit which here it has not as for instance ye have here the same sort of trees which are there called puniet but pierce these trees here when you will and ye will find they will not run the  0th part of the liquor which they yield there neither is it so welltasted and this is confirmed by the experience of many  chap xxv of the things which they commonly eat besides bread and fruit of which we have spoken already they eat also flesh but not of all sorts of beasts for the flesh of several beasts as has been formerly observed is forbidden but they are permitted to eat of swines flesh of all sorts of fowl except pigeons and turtles of all sorts of venison except the heart and the do of all the fish that swims in the sea or the rivers without any exception they some times roast or boil their flesh but they know not what it is to stew any meat and therefore do not use it though it is not forbidden they commonly eat the flesh of venison and of fowls raw and which may seem strange here in england they eat serpents also which they look upon as very good meat and very savoury being broiled upon the coals but before they eat them they take care to extract all the poison out of them which they do after this manner they take them when they are alive and beat them with rods until they be very angry and when they are in this furious passion all the venom that was in the body ascends to the head which being then cut off there remains no more poison in the body which may therefore be safely eaten they feed also upon heneggs gooseeggs and the like and all sorts of wholesome herbs and roots  chap xxvi of the animals in formosa which do not breed here in england generally speaking all the animals which breed here are to be found in formosa but there are many others there which do not breed here as elephants rhinocerots camels seahorses all which are tame and very useful for the service of man but they have other wild beasts there which are not bred here as lions boars wolves leopards apes tigers crocodiles and there are also wild bulls which are more fierce than any lion or boar which the natives believe to be the souls of some sinners undergoing a great penance but they know nothing of dragons or landunicorns only they have a fish that has one horn and they never saw any griphons which they believe to be rather fictions of the brain than real creatures  besides the animals abovementioned they have also familiar serpents which they carry about their body and toads which they keep in their houses to attract all the venom that may happen to be there and weasels for eating of mice and tortoises for their gardens there is also a kind of animal much like a lizzard but not so big which the natives call varchiero i e the persecutor of flies its skin is smooth and clear like glass and appears in various colors according to the situation of its body it is wonderful to see how eagerly and industriously it pursues the flies wheresoever it sees them upon a table or on flesh or in drink and it seldom fails of catching them this kind of animal is to be found only in japan and america besides the isle formosa  though the foresaid animals do not breed here in england yet they are too well known here to need any particular description  chap xxvii of the language of the formosans the language of formosa is the same with that of japan but with this difference that the japannese do not pronounce some letters gutturally as the formosans do and they pronounce the auxiliary verbs without that elevation and depression of the voice which is used in formosa thus for instance the formosans pronounce the present tense without any elevation or falling of the voice as jerh chato ego amo and the preterperfect they pronounce by raising the voice and the future tense by falling it but the preterimperfect the plusquam perfectum and paulo post futurum they pronounce by adding the auxiliary verb thus the verb jerh chato ego amo in the preterimperfect tense is jervieye chato ego eram amans or according to the letter ego eram amo in the preterperfect tense it is jerh chato and the voice is raised in the pronunciation of the first syllable but falls in pronouncing the other two and in the plusquam perfectum the auxiliary verb viey is added and the same elevation and falling of the voice is observed as in the preterit the future tense of jerh chato is pronounced by falling the voice in the first syllable and raising it in the rest and the paulo post futurum is pronounced after the same manner only adding the verb viar as jerh viar chato ego ero amo but the japannese say jerh chato jerh chataye jerh chatar pronouncing the auxiliary verb always after the same manner  the japan language has three genders all sorts of animals are either of the masculine or feminine gender and all inanimate creatures are of the neuter but the gender is only known by the articles e g oi hic ey haec and ay hoc but in the plural number all the three articles are alike  they have no cases and they use only the singular and plural number but not the dual as for example oi banajo hic homo os banajos hi homines but since i do not intend to write a grammar of the language but only to give some idea of it it may be sufficient to add this general observation that it is very easy sounds musically and is very copious if any one shall ask from what language it is derived i answer that i know of no other language except that of japan that has any great affinity with it but i find many words in it which seem to be derived from several other languages only changing either the signification or termination  the japannese wrote formerly in a sort of characters most like those of the chinese but since they have held correspondence with the formosans they have generally made use of their way of writing as more easy and more beautiful insomuch that there are few now in japan who understand the chinese characters  but here it is to be noted that the same prophet psalmanaazar who delivered the law to the formosans did also teach them this way of writing as is commonly believed  they use only twenty letters in their language which are to be read from the right hand to the left whose names and figures are as follows  alphabet   they have many particular rules as to the use of these letters which it would be endless as well as useless here to set down and therefore i shall only add the names of some things that are most common and subjoin to them the lords prayer the creed and ten commandments in that language to give the reader some idea of it  the emperor is called in that language baghathaan cheveraal i e the most high monarch the king bagalo or angon the viceroy bagalendro or bagalender the nobles tanos the governors of cities or isles os tanos soulletos the citizens poulinos the countrymen barhaw the soldiers plessios a man banajo a woman bajane a son bot a daughter boti a father pornio a mother porniin a brother geovreo a sister javraijn kinsmen arvauros an isle avia a city tillo a village casseo the heaven orhnio the earth badi the sea anso water onillo  the reason why the japan language differs from that of the chinese and formosans is this because the japannese being banished from china settled in the isles of japan upon which account they so much hate the chinese that they have changed all things they had in common with them as to their language religion etc so that there is no affinity between the japan and chinese language but the japannese being the first inhabitants of formosa brought their language along with them into that island which is now much more perfect than it was at their first coming yet the formosans preserve still the purity of their language without any considerable alteration whereas the japannese are continually changing and improving it every day  but that the reader may have some idea of the formosan language i have here subjoined the lords prayer the apostles creed and the ten commandments in that language printed in roman characters  the lords prayer koriakia vomera amy our pornio father dan who chin in ornio heaven viey art gnayjorhe hallowed sai be thy lory name eyfodere

floating villages or arcacasseos which belong only to noblemen and are made use of by them to travel or take their pleasure upon the river the emperor the king viceroy and the noblemen have every one a balcon for himself and a floating village for their guards which vessels will be best explained by the following figures  the kings balcon  a floating village    a gentlemans balcon  a litter    you must note that there is no difference between the balcon of the emperor a king and a viceroy but that one is a little more magnificent than the other the arcacasseos or floating villages in which are the guards of him to whom the balcon belongs are all alike only the others are not so long nor so broad and splendid as that of the king  they have no coaches to travel in by land but they have another kind of carriage which is much more convenient for they are carried by two elephants or camels or horses in a thing like a litter called by the natives norimonnos into which thirty or forty men may enter the figure whereof is to be seen in the following cut  all these litters whether they belong to noblemen or inferior people are made after the same manner saving that some of them are more stately than others  chap xxix of the money of the formosans the japannese have three sorts of money whereof some is made of gold and the other two sorts are of silver and brass all these kinds of money are current in the isle formosa and besides them they have some of iron and steel  the highest piece of gold that is coined at japan is called rochmoo and is in value nine copans and a half a copan is a piece of coined gold worth seven talos and a talo is a piece of silver coin worth    stivers according to the dutch way of reckoning and very near worth an english crown but the brass money is of little value as the caxae which are only worth about two pence of english money and yet there are half caxae and quarter caxae but this last kind of money is only used in japan and not in formosa  but in the isle formosa a rochmoo is valued only at eight copans and each copan at six talos and a talo at forty eight stivers not that these several pieces of money weigh less in formosa for they are of the same weight but because gold and the several figures of money rochmo copan taillo taillo colan riaon   silver is more plentiful there than in japan and besides them the formosans have a piece of steel money which they call colan and is of the same value with a talo though it is not so big they have also money made of iron which they call riaon a half riaon and a quarter riaon now a riaon is worth fifteen dutch stivers they have a little piece of brass money which they call capchau worth about seven farthings the figures of all which may seen in the following table  a rochmoo which weighs eight pound and half of gold is of this shape a is the upper part of it whereon is the head of the emperor on the lower part of it are his arms but on the other side are the arms of the king who reigns in that province where the money is coined there are also half rochmoos of the same shape and of half the weight  a copan is a piece of gold which weighs one pound in the upper part on one side it has the head of the emperor and in the lower part the head of the king but on the other side it has their arms there are also half copans and both these sorts of money have a hole in the middle  a talo is a piece of silver coin which weighs four ounces and on one side it has a sword and on the other are the ancient characters of the japannese denoting its value  of the caxae some are round others four squared and triangular but these are coined only in japan  the steel money which is peculiar to the isle formosa weighs one ounce and three quarters of an ounce it is four squared and is called colan on the one side it has the arms of religion with this inscription in formosan letters honor to god and on the other side are the arms of the king  a riaon is a piece of iron money almost of the same bigness as a kolan and is worth fifteen dutch stivers it has the same inscription with a kolan but its figure is almost round  the kapchau is a piece of brass money almost of the same value with a japan casiens or cax its figure is almost round but it has no inscription there are also half kapchaus and quarter kapchaus  chap xxx of the arms of the japanners and formosans every one i think knows that the japannese use no such arms as are commonly used here in europe but after the jesuits and dutch came there they gave them some guns and muskets which are not so many as to be serviceable to them in making war against their enemies but are laid up and kept as curiosities to be shown the warlike instruments which they make use of are as follows  first the batteringram which is an engine they make use of for destroying the walls of a city fachos which are made of a certain tough wood to which are fastened many sharp plates of steel and are covered all over with pitch rosin and suchlike combustible ingredients and when it is kindled it is thrown out of an engine with so much force that the sharp plates of steel will cut three men through the middle standing directly behind one another next they use in fighting long and short spears bows and arrows and cymiters  this must be confessed by all that know them that they are wonderfully skilful in all the ways of exercising their arms especially in shooting an arrow which they will direct as exactly to the mark intended as any european can a bulletshot out of a musket  they make swords and daggers so wonderfully fine that they are highly esteemed in all the eastern countries metals are there so plentiful and they are so skilful in melting and mixing purging and tempering them that in these arts of preparing metal they far excel the europeans iron is the metal of which the japannese make their swords and daggers of which they have one mine and their swords are so curiously and exactly tempered that one of them is more precious than a sword made of the purest gold for some of them are found to have so good an edge that they will cut the biggest tree in two with one blow or divide a piece of iron in two without blunting their edge their daggers are made of such a mixture of metals that if any one be but slightly wounded with them unless he cut off the wounded flesh in the same instant the wound becomes incurable of the same materials they make the heads of their lances arrows and spears so that their wounds are always mortal unless the spreading of the poison be presently stopped which practice seems to be unjustly condemned by the europeans since they themselves make use of more deadly weapons than are usual there neither is it any great matter when we intend to destroy an enemy after what manner we kill him nay in this respect the most deadly weapons seem the best because the more they kill the sooner war is ended which is the best for all parties  however all over the east the soldiers formerly made use of these japan weapons but now the emperor has prohibited to export them under the pain of death so that none dare bring them into formosa yet the king who is sent thither has a magazine full of these arms which are laid up for a time of war and so they are far from being very rare and precious there nay notwithstanding the prohibition there are some who venture to export them clandestinely for i remember i saw many of them in goa which are there publicly exposed to sale they use also slings wherewith they throw stones yet this they do but very seldom  chap xxxi of the musical instruments of the japannese and formosans it must be acknowledged that the art of music was not known for many years in any of the eastern countries neither had they any certain method of singing and playing upon instruments of music though they had then such as resembled the drum and the tabor the trumpet and flagellet the lute and harp but since the time that the europeans came thither they have learned the way of making and using these instruments which are now made almost after the same fashion as they are here in england for when they heard the jesuits play upon the organs in their churches and sing musically after the manner of the romish church they were mightily taken with it and inflamed with a desire of learning the art of music which now by their industry and ingenuity they have attained though not in perfection yet to such a degree as wonderfully pleases themselves and therefore they commonly use both vocal and instrumental music at their marriages funerals sports and recreations and at their offering sacrifices chiefly when they sacrifice infants  thus it is in japan but in the island formosa the natives still observe their ancient method of singing and playing upon musical instruments if their way of singing may be called a method for except some few particular prayers which are sung by the priests only the people sing all other things every one after a different manner according to his fancy which they do not look upon as ridiculous because they know no better but on the contrary the different voices and tones which every one uses at pleasure seems to them to make a pleasant harmony after the same irregular manner they play upon the instruments of music which are used in temples such as the drum the tabor etc  in which a is the hand that strikes b the finger which makes the sound e e the skin or parchment which is struck d d the plates of gold or silver or some other metal which make a tinkling like a cymbal they use also the harpsichord and lute trumpets and flagellets but the harp they do not use in their temples they have also kettledrums which make a harsh and warlike sound when they go to battle but they are so big that they must be carried by an elephant other instruments of music they have not  chap xxxii of the way of educating their children i have already said that every wife takes care of her own children but if she be the wife of a nobleman she has servantmaids to look after them they begin to teach a child to read at three years of age and some of them will both read and write very well when they come to be five years old and from five to eight they instruct them in the principles of religion and morality and teach them how to behave themselves in company after eight they send them to the schools or academies which they do not before that time because they think their understanding is not ripe enough to apprehend such things as are taught there though many of them go to schools before they are seven years of age the mothers take a great deal of care in their education and their fathers often examine them what progress they have made in their learning but their parents never beat them which they think improper even when it may seem necessary to reform their manners and deter them from the vices to which they are addicted much less do they use such imprecations upon them as some europeans do upon their children but they instruct them the more carefully in their duty admonish them of their faults and by the most winning persuasives exhort them to amend for they hope that as their reason increases with their years they will of themselves abandon their vices and indeed this gentle method of admonition and exhortation does commonly prove so effectual that young men of six or nine years of age will behave themselves with as much civility and modesty in their discourses and gestures as an old man can do which deserves no small admiration  they have a very sharp natural wit which readily learns the languages and liberal arts and if any one think that i boast too much of my countrymen they may read the account that is given of them in the relations of several authors  when they are arrived at the fifth or sixth year of age then their parents send them to the school and after that though they be negligent in their studies they never force them by threats to do any thing to mind their book but encourage them by good words and fair promises and by proposing to them the examples of others either real or feigned who by improvement in their studies have arrived at great honors and dignities and by these and suchlike means they prevail more over the youth than they could by blows and menaces for to speak the truth it must be confessed that the natives of japan and formosa are naturally so stubborn and surly that they cannot endure blows and hence it often happens that servants when they are undeservedly and unmercifully beaten will in revenge kill their masters  the infants of noblemen are carefully tended and very carefully brought up by their mothers and nurses who constantly attend them to see that they want for nothing and cover them with silk or cotton to keep them warm but never wrap them in swaddling cloths as they europeans do but their country people are careless in clothing their children and keeping them warm while they are infants and when they come to be two years old they suffer them to run naked over the mountains meadows and woods  chap xxxiii of the liberal and mechanical art in japan though the japannese are inferior to the europeans in the knowledge of the liberal arts yet this must be said for them that as to all arts whether liberal or mechanical they excel all the other eastern people and though the jesuits do mightily extol the chinese above all the other orientalists for their ingenuity yet i think they are much inferior to the japannese in sagacity and sharpness of wit for many of them chiefly the bonzii spend their whole life in studying but their wit for the most part consists in riddles paradoxes and darksayings they write many books of theology which are chiefly designed for the explication of their articles of religion and the defense of their idolatrous worship and in all their meditations they chiefly apply themselves to the study of philosophy which with them is nothing else but a collection of the opinions of all the ancient philosophers they know which favor their own superstition  although the bonzii are bound to minister in holy things and by their office are peculiarly set apart for that service yet they do not only study philosophy and theology but mathematics medicine and law so that their academies seem to resemble universities here in teaching all the liberal sciences they teach also the greek tongue in the isle formosa and every one may learn it in their academies who has money enough to pay the priests but the japan bonzii teach it only among themselves but not to the laity  these colleges in which the youth are taught are endowed with great revenues for all princes noblemen and gentlemen send their sons thither and give great gifts to them  as to the law they have no rules but such as are discovered by natural light or the dictates of reason or are founded upon the authority of their superiors whose will is a law to their subjects thus the answer of the prince decides any controversy and puts an end to the suit of the contending parties but as we have before observed meriandanoo made new laws to restrain the kings and princes from enslaving their subjects so much as they were wont to do  the physicians and chyrurgeons in formosa are very ignorant and unskilful though they are very much honored by all sorts of people they know nothing of the art of music as has been before observed but as to the other liberal arts all the sons of citizens and gentlemen study them in their academies provided their fathers have sufficient means to maintain them there they are excellent at making verses but chiefly the bonzii in the isle formosa who do not only compose prayers but also sermons in verse they mightily affect brevity in all their writings and labor only to express in a few words the substance of any matter of fact without taking notice of many circumstances which set off the history and therefore when they write libels to any prince they contrive them wonderful short yet so that nothing which is pertinent to the matter or substance of the libel is omitted some of them are great lovers of eloquence but chiefly the bonzii and practice it very much in their sermons the better to move the affections of their hearers and persuade them to do what they have a mind to  the japannese did formerly write from the top down the bottom which way of writing they learned from the shape of a man whose head is the highest part and the feet the lowest but after that meriandanoo had once obtained the isle formosa and annexed it to the empire of japan the japannese seeing the way of writing that was used by the formosans to be much better and more easy have ever since continued to write after that manner and this they do so generally that none but the bonzii understand the ancient way of writing for the rest are altogether ignorant of it  hitherto i have treated of their liberal arts i shall only add a few words of their mechanical arts the formosans have painters who draw fine pictures with great art and skill and their engravers are very famous for working both in wood and stone they have also potters who are very curious in making dishes which they call porcellane and the english chinaware and it is very well known that in this art they excel the chinese and all the oriental people but they have no shoemakers brewers or bakers there neither do they know the way of making candles as you do here but instead of them they use lamps with oil links and torches made of the pine tree and the country people kindle straw or any kind of wood which will flame and give light the art of making glass is not known over all the east and when it was first brought to japan it appeared to the natives so admirable for its clearness and transparency that the mariners would sell a piece of glass worth no more than a penny here for half a copan but now since ships have frequently arrived in these parts the value of them is very much fallen and yet they cost twenty times more there than here some noblemen have glasswindows in their houses but these cost so much that they are very rare for the generality of the natives use a thin waxen silkstuff or paper made of silk for their windows which they receive from the chinese their chief arts are the potters art and the art of working with the needle in which they are ingenious to admiration but above all they excel in the art of purging and preparing metals as has been observed in the chapter of their arms and lastly their husbandmen are skilful enough in ordering and improving the ground according to the nature of the soil  and here it is to be noted that all artificers and such as get their livelihood by their labor are very little esteemed and the merchants the richer they are are so much the less valued because they believe they must use many lies in commending and putting off their merchandise to increase their gain and riches and because the japannese abhor a lie therefore they despise the merchants whom they look upon as great liars as the english despise the mountebanks who tell many lies of the operations of their medicines which they sell upon a stage i shall only add that as to other mechanical arts which are used here in europe the natives are always learning something new from the hollanders having a very sharp wit which easily apprehends any arts they once see  chap xxxiv of the splendid retinue that attends the viceroy of formosa when he goes to wait upon the emperor since all kings have not the same dignity and revenues but some are more some less rich and honorable therefore every one of the kings subject to the emperor of japan has a retinue proportionable to his dignity but the king of the isle formosa being sent from the emperor is therefore always attended by the viceroy and carillan when he goes to wait upon the emperor it is the office of the carillan to give the emperor that account of the isle which is made by the king and the viceroy relates as from himself the same things which the king relates by the carillan viz all things which concern the government the subjects or the commonwealth  the viceroy of formosa does usually travel twice a year to wait upon the emperor of japan and then he has his own balcon which has been before described and thirty six balcons of the noblemen who attend him but the carillan travels in the same balcon with the king as being his companion besides these balcons there are eighty floating villages in which are the guards of the viceroy and carillan and the litters or palanquins in which they travel when they pass through the island all things are set in order when they come to the isle xyphon forty floating villages go before and eighteen balcons of noblemen then comes the balcons of the viceroy and after it eighteen balcons of noblemen and last of all forty floating villages whereof one or two belongs to each nobleman  in this order they make their progress till they come to the seaport town where they are to land and then they all go out and noblemen go into the litters which are carried ashore for them and the balcons remain there till the viceroy returns there are thirtysix litters which belong to the noblemen who accompany the viceroy and there is one for the viceroy with whom the carillan travels to bear him company all the litters of the nobility are an ell and a half in height and length and are made of wood curiously adorned within and without with silks and tapestry finely wrought with the needle with plates of brass or copper and many pictures and are usually carried by two elephants  the viceroy and carillan travel in one litter which is two else and a half high and three else long and is carried by two elephants inwardly it is adorned with silks and cloth of gold finely wrought with the needle and outwardly it is covered with most pure gold in this litter besides the viceroy and carillan are one nobleman and ten ladies of honor which are branches of the kings family it goes in the middle of all the other litters and is guarded with soldiers before and behind and on both sides  all things being thus disposed they enter into the emperors palace where they continue for a month and then return into their own country the emperor does them this honor as to send twenty of his courtiers to receive them when they land at the seaport town and as many to accompany them in litters guarded with soldiers when they return to the seaport and during all the time they stay at the emperors court he puts all kinds of honor upon them for he diverts them with hunting sports and comedies and admits them to a hearing every day for an hour in a public assembly and lastly when they are to go away he loads them with gifts and very honorably takes a farewell of them  it is a part of the office of the king of formosa to accompany the viceroy to the seaport town called khadsey where he takes shipping and to receive him at the same place when he returns and attend him as far as the castle and lastly it is to be noted that although the emperor gives him only the title of viceroy who was formerly king of formosa yet he does him greater honor than any other king of the empire  chap xxxv of the success of the jesuits in propagating the christian faith in japan from      to      more especially of the reasons of the terrible slaughter that was made of them about the year      and of the law prohibiting christians under pain of death to come into japan since my design is only to give an account of the isle formosa and to touch upon the affairs of japan so far as they have relation to it i shall not pretend to give a particular history of the various success the jesuits met with in propagating the christian religion through the several kingdoms of japan of which i have received no certain information but in general i am very well assured by the constant uncontrolled tradition of my countrymen that notwithstanding all the difficulties they met with they made a wonderful progress in the conversion of that empire between the year      in which xaverius says he first arrived at cangoxima and the year      or thereabout for it is commonly believed in formosa that in this space of time more than a third part of japan was converted to the christian religion and tampousamma himself who was emperor of japan in the said year       though many other causes might concur to promote the spreading of the christian religion in japan by the jesuits of which i can give no particular account yet i am very certainly informed that one thing which contributed very much to the propagation of it was their proposing the christian religion after such a manner as was most agreeable to natural reason and the doctrines and practices commonly received among the japannese  thus the jesuits taught them in their first lectures that there was but one god the creator and governor of all things in heaven and earth and demonstrated his eternity and other attributes by natural reason but said nothing of a trinity of persons in the unity of the godhead lest it should shock their belief of the one true god and as to christ they affirmed that he was a divine virtue residing in a human body or a mighty hero sent from god to reveal his mind and will to mankind and they enlarged upon the holiness of his life the reasonableness and excellency of his doctrine the many miracles he wrought for confirmation of it and the bitter and painful death he endured on the cross for the expiation of the sins of mankind all which were agreeable enough to the opinions the japannese had conceived of their pretended heroes that they had done many wonderful feats and endured great and lasting pains to deliver their followers from future torments but all this while the jesuits said nothing of his being god and man in one person but concealed that mystery as being too difficult for the apprehension of the japannese until a more convenient opportunity  they taught the japannese to worship the only true god and his son jesus christ who was raised from the dead by the almighty power of god and ascended into heaven and was exalted in the humane nature to all power in heaven and earth to assist and relieve his faithful servants which was agreeable enough to the notions they had of their deified men such as xaca and amida to whom they prayed for relief in all their straits and necessities and as to the worship of images and saints departed there was such a perfect harmony between the jesuits and the japannese that they desired them only to change their idols for the images of jesus christ the virgin mary and other saints of the only true god and to continue the same way of worshipping and trusting to the saints as intercessors with god for them but not to offer sacrifices to them  they administered baptism in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost as the rite of admitting men into the christian church and never declared the holy ghost to be a divine person in the everblessed trinity but represented him as the power of god  they administered the lords supper in commemoration of the death of christ but never offered to explain the mystery of transubstantiation or the sacrifice of the mess  and by this way of representing the christian religion and concealing those mysteries which are more difficult to be apprehended and believed and the peculiar absurdities of the popish doctrines it appeared to contain nothing but what was agreeable to natural reason and the notions and practices commonly received among the japannese and so it easily gained credit and spread mightily among the ingenious japannese especially being recommended by some peculiar advantages it has above all other religions as particularly by the full assurance it gives of a future state of eternal life and happiness  but as this artifice gained the jesuits many followers while they concealed the aforesaid doctrines which they did for many years until they found their party very strong and powerful so when they declared them to the people and imposed them as necessary articles of faith the christian converts murmured against them for changing the religion they had formerly taught and the pagans but especially the bonzies exclaimed against them as impostors for deceiving the people with new devices which occasioned many to make defection from them and raised in all a strong suspicion of their insincerity so that this declaration of these new doctrines proved very much to their disadvantage and may be reckoned one cause of their utter ruin and extirpation  a second cause was the great envy and indignation which all the pagans but chiefly the bonzies conceived against the jesuits because they insinuated themselves so far into the favor of kings and princes and all the rich men who were converts to their religion that they settled great revenues upon the christian monasteries which used formerly to be given to the bonzies nay the fathers disinherited their sons to enrich their monasteries which so exasperated the minds of the pagans against them that they endeavored by all means to extirpate them  a third cause was the discovery of a conspiracy carried on by the jesuits to betray the empire of japan into the hands of the king of spain for which end they had sent him letters which were found out giving him an account of the situation of their harbors and of their several cities castles and forts and the manner how they might be besieged and taken the jesuits confess that the great dominions which the king of spain possessed in the east and west indies gave the japannese a great umbrage and this they say moved them to set on foot a design of abolishing their religion and driving them out of their country but they deny that they ever wrote such letters to that king giving him an account of the strength of the japan empire and the ways of attacking it and pretend that these letters were forged by the hollanders on purpose to render the portuguese odious and get their trade in japan out of their hands but this forgery was never proved against the dutch and therefore it is commonly believed in formosa that the jesuits were the authors and contrivers of the aforesaid letters which must certainly render them very odious to all the pigans  but all these three causes were only preparatory to that which follows which was the last and immediate cause of the great slaughter of the christians in japan for the better understanding of which we must consider that in the great progress which the christian religion had made in japan by the preaching of the jesuits and other missionaries of the romish church there were not only several kings and princes and many great lords but also an emperor who had embraced christianity whose name was tampousama and he gave them not only a toleration but all manner of encouragement to propagate and settle their religion in all parts of the empire the jesuits being puffed up with this success and supported by so great an authority ventured boldly to expose their peculiar dogmata of transubstantiation and the sacrifice of the mess etc which they required all the christians to believe under pain of damnation and to use all the pious frauds they could invent for draining the riches of japan into their own coffers and having by this means given great offense to the christians and incurred the great hatred of the pagans and raised a vehement suspicion in all sorts of people of their being impostors they began to be afraid lest the pagans should conspire together to work their ruin and therefore were resolved to be beforehand with them and to take the shortest way for converting the whole empire to their religion  to this purpose they forged a lie which they went and told the emperor that the pagans were contriving to raise a rebellion against him and to cut the throats of all the christians that they had already had several consultations about carrying on this wicked conspiracy which they would certainly put in execution unless they were timely prevented the emperor who looked upon them as very wise men and put an entire confidence in them asked them what they would have him to do to which they readily answered that to secure himself and the christians from this conspiracy he could do nothing better than to send his letters to all the christian churches requiring the christians everywhere throughout the empire to rise up in arms on such a day about a certain hour of the night and kill all the pagans for by this means continued they the wicked design against your majesty and the christians will be prevented and the christian faith alone will flourish through all your empire and there will be none left alive to trouble you or disturb the peace of your government besides the better to excite the emperor to this undertaking they assured him that he was obliged to do it not only in point of policy but of religion because this would be such a commendable and meritorious work to extirpate heathenism and settle christianity in all his dominions that he might certainly expect the blessing of god and of christ upon himself and all his christian subjects for finishing such a glorious design but added they if you delay much longer to put it in execution you will certainly find by woeful experience that your majesty and all the christians will be murdered in one night the consequence of which must be the utter extirpation of christianity in japan  these things they represented with so much seeming zeal and affectionate concern for the christian religion that the emperor was prevailed upon as is commonly reported to grant them his letters to be sent to all the christians requiring them to destroy all the pagans in his dominions though others say that the jesuits presumed so far upon the emperors good affection to their cause that they wrote these letters in the emperors name without his knowledge and dispatched them to all the christian churches however this is certain that all the churches received orders written in the emperors name to rise up in arms on such a day at such an hour of the night and destroy all the pagans and though this design was managed with all the artifice of the jesuits to conceal it until the time of execution yet they could not carry it on so secretly but the pagans came by some means or other to hear of it time enough to prevent the fatal blow for either the christians who had fathers or mothers or other near relations that were pagans out of natural affection to them discovered the plot that they might have an opportunity to save their lives or others being touched with an horror of the bloody conspiracy against their countrymen and friends found their good nature too hard for their religion and therefore gave timely notice to the pagan kings and princes to fortify themselves against the intended massacre which they did so effectually that having got all things ready they rose up in arms with their pagan subjects on the very day before that in which the christians were to put their design in execution and fell upon them and destroyed them with a very great slaughter wheresoever any christians could be found the emperor being a christian and having too much countenanced the jesuits in their intended massacre was forced by the pagans to leave his own dominions and went into the city of goa where he died and his body is still preserved in the church of the jesuits where a stately monument is erected to his memory with an inscription to this purpose here lies tampousama emperor of japan who was banished out of his dominions and died a martyr for the christian religion at the same time there were five kings and two viceroys apprehended who had promoted the christian religion in their several kingdoms and they were thrown into prison and there remained until they died  the slaughter was so general that not only the jesuits and other missionaries of the romish church but all the japannese that had been converted by them were put to death whenever they were seized some were hanged some thrown into the rivers or old ditches others were beheaded and great numbers suffered the most cruel deaths the pagans could invent but though the slaughter was very general yet it cannot be imagined that all the christians were apprehended at the same time but many of them lay concealed and skulkd up and down in corners for several years before they were discovered and after the first heats of the persecution were over many of those jesuits and monks who were seized were for some time respited and being cast into prison continued there until a new emperor was created and then were put to cruel deaths with most exquisite torments  after this time the name of a christian grew so odious through all the empire of japan that no christian was suffered to live in it but the pagans slew them all whenever they discovered them and this wicked and bloody conspiracy which was so contrary to the mild and charitable spirit of christianity was such a scandal to the pagans and reproach to the christians that henceforward they were all esteemed villains rebels impostors and the worst of men and therefore when any of them were found out all the people cried out away with them crucify them and searchers were appointed to enquire diligently in all places if any of them could be discovered as has been already observed in the chapter of laws  and this relation of the conspiracy of the jesuits and other popish priests against the pagans and the great slaughter of the christians which followed upon the discovery of it is as firmly believed in formosa by tradition from father to son as the gunpowderplot is believed here in england to have been contrived by the jesuits and other papists but i must confess that i cannot positively determine the time when it happened only i think it most probable that it was about the year       chap xxxvi of the coming of the dutch into japan with their success and the tricks they played the dutch hearing of the great slaughter of the papists in japan and that they were for ever banished from that empire laid hold of this opportunity to settle a great trade with the japannese and for that end having laded several ships with great stores of such commodities as they thought most vendible in that country they sailed to japan where being arrived they were presently called to an account what they were and from whence they came they answered they were hollanders and when the japan inquisitors urged them farther to declare whether they were christians or no they pretended at first they did not understand what they meant by that name and therefore they could only tell them they professed the hollands religion but at last some of them told the japannese that they had heard of some called christians who were impostors and worshipped a crucified man by which character the japannese understood that these were the christians who had formerly been in japan and then the dutch added farther that there were none such in their country but in other parts of europe and that the hollanders were so far from being of the same religion with them that they had always been hated and persecuted by these christians upon the account of religion  these things being related to the emperor he commanded that they should have leave to land and to bring them before him when they were come into the emperors presence they presented him with two great guns and a striking clock with an alarm and a musical bell both which wonderfully pleased the emperor but chiefly he admired the two guns when he saw them charged and discharged before him whereupon he gave them free leave to come and import their commodities into his country as thinking that their commerce would be not only safe but very advantageous to japan but after they had traded there for some years they begged leave of the emperor to build a great storehouse in which they might lay up all their merchandise pretending it was a great loss to them to carry their goods up and down the country before they could sell them and that it would be more convenient not only for themselves but also for the japannese to have a certain place appointed whither all persons might resort either to buy their commodities or take them in exchange for the product of their country the emperor granted them leave to build such a house for containing their goods but they instead of a warehouse built a very strong castle with very good fortifications yet none of the natives ever suspected them of any ill design but thought that the house was built after the dutch way until some time after it was finished but their design was discovered when a new fleet of ships arrived from holland in japan for these ships were laden with guns muskets pistols and all sorts of warlike instruments and great stores of gunpowder and bullets as plainly appeared by this accident the dutch having concealed their arms and ammunition in wooden frames that they might not be seen by the japannese conveyed them out of their ships and laid them upon carts to be carried to their castle but it happened unluckily for them that some of the carts were broken by the way and the wooden frames burst in pieces by the fall which discovered their hidden treasure of arms and ammunition and alarmed the japannese who saw them with the apprehension of some wicked design which was to be executed by such great quantities of warlike preparations whereupon some of them run presently and acquainted the emperor with what they had seen and the danger that threatened his country by the tricks of these deceitful hollanders and he sent away in all haste  0 or    companies of soldiers who killed as many as they could find of them but the greatest part of them had escaped from the castle and were got into their ships which had put to sea before the soldiers arrived which happened by the oversight of the natives who might easily have encompassed the castle at some distance so that none could enter in or go out of it whereby all that were in it would have been forced either to surrender themselves or die for hunger after this their castle and all the guns they could find were seized by the japannese for the use of the emperor and the dutch were for some time prohibited any commerce with japan but upon their humble petition and fair promises the emperor gave them leave to come into formosa which was then under his dominion and thither they resorted for some time but the hollanders not finding in formosa all the commodities they wanted did again beg leave of the emperor to trade into japan which the emperor would not allow until at last the king of nangasak interposed on their behalf and prayed that he might be permitted to receive them into his isle which is not far distant from the rest of japan and this the emperor granted upon the following conditions   st that they should trample upon the crucifix   dly that the inquisitors should take out of their ships all their guns and ammunition all their sails masts ropes and other furniture to be kept in a storehouse as long as the dutch stayed in the country   dly that he should appoint soldiers to go along with them through the country and observe them   thly that they should not stay any longer than the emperor pleased but as soon as he should send his orders for their going away they should make all things ready for sailing and depart presently  these conditions have been hitherto very exactly observed whenever therefore they have sold off or bartered all their commodities and are ready to put to sea again then all their warlike instruments and shiptackle that were taken away at their first coming are restored to them again and they have free liberty to return into their own country  after the dutch had got footing in japan and the christians were prohibited to come there under pain of death the dutch advised the emperor to distinguish christians from all other foreigners by this test viz by making an image of christ crucified which these christians adore and keeping it in all their seaport towns and requiring all foreigners to trample upon this image for said they if these foreigners be christians they will not trample upon it and all others who do trample upon it are certainly no christians  this test was afterward tried upon some jesuits or other monks of the romish church who ventured to come into japan hoping perhaps to conceal themselves under the disguise of being hollanders but when they came into the harbor an image of christ crucified was brought to them and they were required to trample upon it which they refused to do whereupon they were all apprehended being about    in number and within a few days crucified according to the laws of japan and the festival in commemoration of their martyrdom is celebrated by the jesuits to this day but the hollanders make no scruple to trample upon the crucifix whenever they are required to do it and therefore they are not accounted christians by the japannese according to the common opinion of all japan that those foreigners only are christians who refuse to trample upon the crucifix  chap xxxvii of the new devices of the jesuits for getting into japan thus the hollanders by denying christianity secured their freedom of trade in japan but the papists were for ever shut out of that country by this test of christianity until the jesuits by their subtilty invented a new way for procuring their admission into it which was this they learn in the first place the japan language in the city of goa where it is taught in the academy and when they can speak it very well they put on the japan habit and thus accoutred they go to some port in japan and being examined by the searchers what country they belong to and from whence they come they readily answer that they are japannese and come from such an island and such a city in japan naming them which is easily believed by the searchers because of their language and habit  and having thus securely passed the test when they come ashore they disguise themselves under various shapes for some set up for merchants and toysellers others for tutors or mechanics and they live in a private house and follow their several employments with as much care and industry as if they depended upon them for a livelihood though it is certain they are otherwise provided with sufficient means to maintain them by those who send them thither for the pope of rome sends every year a certain number into japan and takes care to furnish them with all things necessary and they are allowed two years for learning the japan language four years for their stay in japan and about three years for their journey backward and forward they have a certain japan word which they pronounce after a manner peculiar to themselves whereby they know one another the word is abo which in japan signifies quickly by which the newcomers as they walk through the cities and villages know their brethren that have been there before them and after they know one another they meet together in private places to discourse about their own affairs  thus there is a continual succession of a new missionary after four years are expired to supply the place of him who then returns home as i am very well assured by my own experience though it is not easy to guess for what end they are sent or what good they do when they come there for it is in vain for them to pretend that they convert many of the natives during their four years stay to the christian religion as i know that some of them boast after their return since it is impossible they should escape the diligence of so many searchers as are everywhere appointed to detect them if they should publicly own themselves to be christians and endeavor to convert the pagans and indeed if it were true what they relate that one had converted twenty another thirty and a third fifty during their stay in japan ever since the time of their banishment there would be very few pagans left in that country according to their account of conversions it is true that some years ago there were jesuits or popish priests who made some converts to christianity but in a little time they were discovered by the searchers and both they and their converts were burnt alive except a few who renounced christianity and embraced their ancient idolatry for fear of the torments of such a cruel death but at rome they talk nothing of any such disasters but every one boasts of the numerous converts he has made in the empire of japan and pleases himself with the relation of his travels and the many wonderful things he has seen being greatly puffed up with an opinion of the great glory and fame he has merited by such a difficult and noble undertaking upon the whole matter it seems to me most probable that the great design of the missionaries who are sent to japan since the time of their banishment from it is to spy out the country and to inform themselves exactly of the situation of their harbors the number of their forts and castles and all the strength of the empire and to take aim by what methods they may be attacked with best success hoping that at length some magnanimous christian prince will undertake a glorious expedition with sufficient forces to conquer that empire by their direction and to plant the christian religion among the natives in spite of all the prejudices wherewith they are possessed at present against it for indeed i cannot perceive what other benefit and advantage they can propose to themselves by all the trouble and expenses they are at in sending so many missionaries into japan  within a few years after the persecution of the christians in japan the emperor having obtained the isle formosa as has been above related began to persecute also the christians that were in that country but though he treated the jesuits and popish priests there with the same severity he had used in japan burning some alive crucifying others or hanging them up by the legs till they were dead yet to the natives who were christians he showed more mercy leaving it to their own free choice either to renounce christianity or to depart for ever out of their own country whereupon many of them chose rather to fly into other countries than deny christ but others being unwilling to leave their estates and their country renounced christianity and embraced their former superstition and after that time the same law was in force against the christians in formosa as was made against them in japan  the conclusion from what has been said of the causes of the great persecution of the christians in japan we may clearly understand how great a prejudice the jesuits have done to christianity and what a reproach and disgrace they have brought upon the christian name by imposing their popish errors upon the people as necessary articles of faith and by contriving that barbarous and bloody massacre which they intended against all the poor pagans whereas if they had proposed the christian religion in its purity and simplicity and behaved themselves toward their proselytes with that meekness charity and sincerity which became their apostolical office i dare be confident to affirm that in all probability the whole empire of japan had now been christian but now by their misrepresentations and wicked practices the japonese have such a false notion of christianity and such strong prejudices against it that it would be much more difficult now to convert them nay the door is shut against any christians who might have such a charitable design or would attempt to remove their prejudices and possess their minds with a just idea of christianity how detestable then was the wickedness of the jesuits which occasioned all this mischief and how deplorable is the case of these poor pagans who are now so fettered in chains of darkness and bound up to their idolatrous practices that they can never hope to see the glorious light of the gospel or feel the power of it in their hearts and lives as might have been reasonably expected from them for if they do so exactly observe the precepts of their own religion although it be uncertain and contrary to the divine nature although it enjoin them such a horrible and cruel practice as to sacrifice their own sons with what cheerfulness humility and veneration would they have performed the reasonable service and obedience of christianity had they been enlightened with that heavenly doctrine in its purity and tasted the power of it in purging their hearts and reforming their lives  some perhaps may think that i have done too much honor to the pagan religion as it is professed in formosa by giving such a long and particular explication of it as if i were still persuaded of the truth of it which god forbid and therefore i must desire such persons to consider that i was obliged to give an account of all things relating to that religion as they are to be found in jarhabadiond which is our scripture though i am very far from believing them to be true nay i am fully persuaded that they are false by the following reasons which i shall briefly mention it is a certain and infallible argument of the falsehood of any religion that it commands such things as are contrary to the divine nature and to those notions which every one has of gods infinite goodness such is the command in our jarhabadiond which requires us to sacrifice so many thousand innocent babes every year which is a thing so cruel and so contrary to the tenderness of human nature that we cannot believe it to be the command of a good and gracious god but of some evil spirit who delights in human blood and in the misery and destruction of mankind and when once i was convinced of the falsehood of our religion by requiring such a cruel and bloody sacrifice i presently concluded that all the miracles pretended to be wrought in confirmation of it were mere trick and forgery because i am certain that god would not exert his omnipotent power to confirm a lie and maintain an imposture besides that any one may quickly be satisfied how little reason there is to believe that the pretended miracles were really wrought since they are only mentioned in our jarhabadiond which the priests keep in their own hands and will not suffer any of the common people to have a copy of it which gives a shrewd suspicion that there is some trick and imposture since they do so studiously avoid any means of discovering the truth which suspicion is very much increased by the tyranny which the priests exercise over the common people in exacting an implicit faith to their dictates without giving them any rational grounds for believing and obliging them under pain of death never to accuse the priests of any falsehood though they be very certain that he is guilty of it the priests indeed pretend that their god does sometimes appear to the people in the form of a lion when he is angry with them and at other times in the form of a camel when he is pacified but every one may plainly perceive that this pretended miracle is nothing but a trick of the priests who have the opportunity of showing such or such a beast to the people without being discovered since the whole management of the matter is left to themselves having the beasts ready to set up at their pleasure with all secrecy if any one should ask me how can the priests put such tricks upon the common people and carry on such impostures i answer there are many instances of the same nature in other nations who having no revelation believe and do such things as are more absurd than what is here pretended such were the egyptians who were famous for all parts of learning and yet were persuaded to worship crocodiles and onions nay even in the roman church we see that many absurdities  mposd upon the common people to be bvd contrary to sense and reason and why then may not such a rude and ignorant people as the formosans be imposed upon by the tricks of cunning men but how this imposture is managed it is not my business at present to enquire it is sufficient for me that i am fully persuaded by undeniable arguments of the falsehood of the religion of formosa now to this omnipotent and merciful god who has by the grace of his holy spirit called me from error and superstition to the true knowledge of his will and of his son jesus christ my redeemer and mediator be ascribed eternal praise honor magnificence and glory by all the creatures for ever and ever amen  appendix concerning the authors journey from avignon to rome in the year   00 being the year of jubilee i was invited by the jesuits to accompany seventeen young gentlemen to rome who undertook that journey rather out of curiosity than devotion to see the pomp and magnificence of the ceremonies that are then observed in that city and the jesuits persuaded me to go hoping that by the sight of these ceremonies i should be induced to embrace their religion i was easily prevailed upon to comply with their desires and so we traveled together to rome the other gentlemen in pilgrims habit and i in japan clothes and arrived there a little before the death of the pope who being then sick would not admit of any to come and see him but we saw all the valuable curiosities that are kept in that famous city and the jesuits at avignon having given me letters of recommendation i was nobly entertained thereby the jesuits of that city who were very civil and obliging but when they exhorted me to embrace the christian faith i excused my self for not complying with their desire and told them that i intended to return again to avignon and to be baptized there by the same father who had brought me out of my own country after we had stayed above a month in rome we returned again to avignon where i was civilly received by the jesuits who as i have reason to believe had charged the young gentlemen my fellowtravellers to take care of me that i should not make an escape for they watched me as narrowly during the whole journey as sergeants use to do a prisoner presently after my return the jesuits asked me how i liked all these ceremonies i had seen at rome to whom i answered that i was very well pleased with them and did greatly admire them but then withal i added since you condemn our pagan religion because our religious worship consists only in externals how can you allege your external ceremonies in confirmation of your religion to which they answered well enough that they did not condemn our ceremonies merely as external but because they were destitute of any internal virtue whereas the christian religion consists much more in its internal power than any external show and therefore said they all our ceremonies are unprofitable unless the heart be joined with them and we only make use of them to excite men to devotion and to inspire them with greater reverence and fervor in the worship of god with this answer i seemed to be so far satisfied that i made no reply though i might have told them that we used the external ceremonies of our pagan religion for the same ends and purposes as they do theirs this indeed was a great scandal to me to see the corrupt lives of all sorts of people both great and small at rome where they appeared so publicly to be guilty of adultery and sodomy that all travelers might perceive them which made me say to my self certainly if these men did heartily believe their religion they would better observe its preceps and live according to it but by their wicked practices it appears that they impose such things upon the common people which they themselves do not believe to be true besides i had heard so many stories of the miracles wrought by the relics of st peter and other saints and chiefly of those which are pretended to be done in the chapel of loretto which i believe to be false that from thence i concluded their relations of the miracles wrought by christ to be no less false so that my journey to rome was so far from inducing me to embrace the christian religion that it rather prejudiced me strongly against it  finis the contents of the several chapters of this description of the isle formosa chap i of the situation magnitude and division
