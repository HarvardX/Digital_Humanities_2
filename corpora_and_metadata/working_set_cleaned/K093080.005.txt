elegance an ode to the duchess of somerset frances eldest daughter of the honorable henry thynne only son of thomas first viscount weymouth she was married to algernon earl of hertford afterward duke of somerset and died at percy lodge july        she was the intimate friend of mrs row on whose death she wrote some verses and likewise author of the epistles signed cleora in the collection of letters from the living to the dead mr walpole says she had as much taste for the writings of others as modesty about her own  written in    0 by william shenstone esquire i while orient skies restore the day and dewdrops catch the lucid ray amid the sprightly scenes of morn will aught the muse inspire oh peace to yonder clamorous horn that drowns the sacred lyre ii ye rural thanes that over the mossy down some panting timorous hare pursue does nature mean your joys alone to crown say does she smooth her lawns for you for you does echo bid the rocks reply and urged by rude constraint resound the jovial cry iii see from the neighboring hill forlorn the wretched swain your sport survey he finds his faithful fences torn he finds his labored crops a prey he sees his flock  no more in circles feed happily beneath your ravage bleed and with no random curses loads the deed iv nor yet ye swains conclude that nature smiles for you alone your bounded souls and your conceptions crude the proud the selfish boast disown yours be the produce of the soil o may it still reward your toil nor ever the defenseless train of clinging infants ask support in vain v but though the various harvest gild your plains does the mere landscape feast your eye or the warm hope of distant gains far other cause of glee supply is not the redstreaks future juice the source of your delight profound where ariconium pours her gems profuse purpling a whole horizon round athirst ye praise the limpid stream it is true but though the pebbled shores among it mimic no unpleasing song the limpid fountain murmurs not for you vi unpleasd ye see the thickets bloom unpleasd the spring her flowery robe resume unmoved the mountains airy pile the dappled mead without a smile o let the rural conscious muse for well she knows your froward sense accuse forth to the solemn oak you bring the square and span the massy trunk before you cry it is fair vii or yet ye learned nor yet ye courtly train if happily from your haunts ye stray to waste with us a summers day exclude the taste of every swain nor our untutored sense disdain it is nature only gives exclusive right to relish her supreme delight she where she pleases kind or coy who furnishes the scene and forms us to enjoy viii then hither bring the fair ingenuous mind by her auspicious aid refined lo not an hedgerow hawthorn blows or humble harebell paints the plain or valley winds or fountain flows or purple heath is tinged in vain for such the rivers dash their foaming tides the mountain swells the dale subsides even thriftless furze detains their wandering sight and the rough barren rock grows pregnant with delight ix with what suspicious fearful care the sordid wretch secures his claim if happily some luxurious heir should alienate the fields that wear his name what scruples lest some future birth should litigate a span of earth bonds contracts feoffments names unmeet for prose the towering muse endures not to disclose alas her unreversd decree more comprehensive and more free her lavish charter taste appropriates all we see x let gondolas their painted flags unfold and be the solemn day enrolled when to confirm his lofty plea in nuptial sort with bridal gold the grave venetian weds the sea each laughing muse derides the vow even adria scorns the mock embrace to some lone hermit on the mountains brow allotted from his natal hour with all her myrtle shores in dower his breast to admiration prone enjoys the smile upon her face enjoys triumphant every grace and finds her more his own xi fatigued with forms oppressive laws when somerset avoids the great when cloyed with merited applause she seeks the rural calm retreat does she not praise each mossy cell and feel the truth my numbers tell when deafend by the loud acclaim which genius graced with rank obtains could she not more delighted hear yon throstle chaunt the rising year could she not spurn the wreaths of fame to crop the primrose of the plains does she not sweets in each fair valley find lost to the sons of power unknown to half mankind xii ah can she covet there to see the splendid slaves the reptile race that oil the tongue and bow the knee that slight her merit but adore her place far happier if aright i deem when from gay throngs and gilded spires to where the lonely halcyons play her philosophic step retires while studious of the moral theme she to some smooth sequestered stream likens the swains inglorious days pleased from the flowery margin to survey how cool serene and clear the current glides away xiii o blind to truth to virtue blind who slight the sweetlypensive mind on whose fair birth the graces mild and every muse prophetic smiled not that the poets boasted fire should fames wide echoing trumpet swell or on the music of his lyre each future age with rapture dwell the vaunted sweets of praise remove yet shall such bosoms claim a part in all that glads the human heart yet these the spirits formed to judge and prove all natures charms immense and heavens unbounded love xiv and oh the transport most allied to song in some fair villas peaceful bound to catch soft hints from natures tongue and bid arcadia bloom around whether we fringe the sloping hill or smoothe below the verdant mead whether we break the falling rill or through meandering mazes lead or in the horrid brambles room bid careless groups of roses bloom or let some sheltered lake serene reflect flowers woods and spires and brighten all the scene xv o sweet disposal of the rural hour o beauties never known to cloy while worth and genius haunt the favored bower and every gentle breast partakes the joy while charity at eve surveys the swain enabled by these toils to cheer a train of helpless infants dear speed whistling home across the plain sees vagrant luxury her handmaid grown for half her graceless deeds atone and hails the bounteous work and ranks it with her own xvi why brand these pleasures with the name of soft unsocial toils of indolence and shame search but the garden or the wood let yon admired carnation own not all was meant for raiment of for food not all for needless use alone there while the seeds of future blossoms dwell it is colored for the sight perfumed to please the smell xvii why knows the nightingale to sing why flows the pines nectareous juice why shines with paint the linnets wing for sustenance alone for use for preservation every sphere shall bid fair pleasures rightful claim appear and sure there seem of human kind some born to shun the solemn strife some for amusive tasks designed to soothe the certain ills of life grace its lone vales with many a budding rose new founts of bliss disclose call forth refreshing shades and decorate repose xviii from plains and woodlands from the view of rural natures blooming face smit with the glare of rank and place to courts the sons of fancy flew there long had art ordained a rival seat there had she lavished all her care to form a scene more dazzling fair and call them from their green retreat to share her proud control had given the robe with grace to flow had taught exotic gems to glow and emulous of natures power mimickd the plume the leaf the flower changed the complexions native hue molded each rustic limb anew and warped the very soul xix awhile her magic strikes the novel eye awhile the faery forms delight and now aloof we seem to fly on purple pinions through a purer sky where all is wondrous all is bright now landed on some spangled shore awhile each dazzled maniac roves by sapphire lakes through emrald groves paternal acres please no more adieu the simple the sincere delight  the habitual scene of hill and dale the rural herds the vernal gale the tangled vetchs purple bloom the fragrance of the beans perfume be theirs alone who cultivate the soil and drink the cup of thirst and eat the bread of toil xx but soon the pageant fades away it is nature only bears perpetual sway we pierce the counterfeit delight fatigued with splendours irksome beams fancy again demands the fight of native groves and wonted streams pants for the seenes that charmed her youthful eyes where truth maintains her court and banishes disguise xxi then hither often ye senators retire with nature here high converse hold for who like stamford harry booth the fourth earl of stamford he died the   th of june      her delights admire like stamford shall with scorn behold the unequal bribes of pageantry and gold beneath the british oaks majestic shade shall see fair truth immortal maid friendship in artless guise arrayed honor and moral beauty shine with more attractive charms with radiance more divine xxii yes here alone did highest heaven ordain the lasting magazine of charms whatever wins whatever warms whatever fancy seeks to share the great the various and the fair for ever should remain xxiii her impulse nothing may restrain  or whence the joy mid columns towers midst all the citys artful trim to rear some breathless vapid flowers or shrubs fuliginously grim from rooms of silken foliage vain to trace the dun far distant grove where smit with undissembled pain the woodlark mourns her absent love borne to the dusty town from native air to mimic rural life and soothe some vapourd fair xxiv but how must faithless art prevail should all who taste our joy sincere to virtue truth or science dear forego a courts alluring pale for dimpled brook and leafy grove for that rich luxury of thought they love ah no from these the public sphere requires example for its giddy bands from these impartial heaven demands to spread the flame itself inspires to fifth opinions mingled mass impress a nations taste and bid the sterling pass xxv happy thrice happy they whose graceful deeds have exemplary shone round the gay precincts of a throne with mild effective beams who bands of fair ideas bring by solemn grott or shady spring to join their pleasing dreams theirs is the rural bliss without alloy they only that deserve enjoy what though nor fabled dryad haunt their grove nor naiad near their fountain rove yet all embodied to the mental sight a train of smiling virtues bright

the rest is vain pleasure ending soon in pain anguish lightly gilded over close thy wish and seek no more nancy of the vale a ballad nerine galatea thymo mihi dulcior hyblae candidior cygnis hedera formosior alba  by the same the western sky was purpled over with every pleasing ray and flocks reviving felt no more the sultry heats of day when from an hazles artless bower soft warbled strephons tongue he blessed the scene he blessed the hour while nancys praise he sung let fops with fickle falsehood range the paths of wanton love whilst weeping maids lament their change and sadden every grove but endless blessings crown the day i saw fair eshams dale and every blessing find its way to nancy of the vale twas from avonas banks the maid diffused her lovely beams and every shining glance displayed the naid of the streams soft as the wildducks tender young that float on avons tide bright as the waterlily sprung and glittering near its side fresh as the bordering flowers her bloom her eye all mild to view the little halcyons azure plume was never half so blue her shape was like the reed so sleek so taper strait and fair her dimpled smile her blushing cheek how charming sweet they were far in the winding vale retired this peerless bud i found and shadowing rocks and woods conspired to fence her beauties round that nature in so lone a dell should form a nymph so sweet or fortune to her secret cell conduct my wandering feet gay lordlings sought her for their bride but she would never incline prove to your equals true she cried as i will prove to mine it is strephon on the mountains brow has won my right good will to him i gave my plighted vow with him i will climb the hill struck with her charms and gentle truth i clasped the constant fair to her alone i gave my youth and vow my future care and when this vow shall faithless prove or i those charms forego the stream that saw our tender love that stream shall cease to flow ode to indolence    0 by the same ah why for ever on the wing persists my wearied soul to roam why ever cheated strives to bring or pleasure or contentment home thus the poor bird that draws his name from paradises honored groves ceaseless fatigues his little frame nor finds the resting place he loves lo on the rural mossy bed my limbs with careless ease reclined ah gentle sloth indulgent spread the same soft bandage over my mind for why should lingering thought invade yet every worldly prospect cloy lend me soft sloth thy friendly aid and give me peace debarred of joy love thou yon calm and silent flood that never ebbs that never flows protected by the circling wood from each tempestuous wind that blows an altar on its banks shall rise where often thy votary shall be found what time pale autumn lulls the skies and sickening verdure fades around ye busy race ye factious train that haunt ambitions guilty shrine no more perplex the world in vain but offer here your vows with mine and thou puissant queen be kind if ever i shared thy balmy power if ever i swayed my active mind to weave for thee the rural bower dissolve in sleep each anxious care each unavailing sigh remove and only let me wake to share the sweets of friendship and of love ode to health    0 by the same o health capricious maid why do thou shun my peaceful bower where i had hope to share thy power and bless thy lasting aid since thou alas art flown it vails not whether muse or grace with tempting smile frequent the place i sigh for thee alone age not forbids thy stay thou yet might act the friendly part thou yet might raise this languid heart why speed so swift away thou scornst the cityair i breathe fresh gales over furrowed ground yet have not thou my wishes crowned o false o partial fair i plunge into the wave and though with purest hands i raise a rural altar to thy praise thou will not deign to save amid my wellknown grove where mineral fountains vainly bear thy boasted name and titles fair why scorns thy foot to rove thou hearst the sportsmans claim enabling him with idle noise to drown the muses melting voice and fright the timorous game is thought thy foe adieu ye midnight lamps ye curious tomes mine eye over hill and valley roams and deals no more with you is it the clime you flee yet midst his unremitting snows the poor laponians bosom glows and shares bright rays from thee there was there was a time when though i scorned thy guardian care nor made a vow nor said a prayer i did not rue the crime who then more blessed than me when the glad schoolboys task was done and forth with jocund sprite i run to freedom and to glee how jovial then the day what since have all my labors found thus climbing life to gaze around that can thy loss repay were thou alas but kind methinks no frown that fortune wears nor lessened hopes nor growing cares could sink my cheerful mind whatever my stars include what other breasts convert to pain my towering mind should soon disdain should scorn  ingratitude repair this mouldering cell and blessed with objects found at home and envying none their fairer dome how pleased my soul should dwell temperance should guard the doors from room to room should memory stray and ranging all in neat array enjoy her pleasing stores  there let them rest unknown the types of many a pleasing scene but to preserve them bright or clean is thine fair queen alone to a lady of quality lady luxborough  fitting up her library      by the same ah what is science what is art or what the pleasure these impart ye trophies which the learned pursue through endless fruitless toils adieu what can the tedious tomes bestow to soothe the miseries they show what like the bliss for him decreed who tends his flock and tunes his reed say wretched fancy thus refined from all that glads the simplest hind how rare that object which supplies a charm for too discerning eyes the polished bard of genius vain endures a deeper sense of pain as each invading blast devours the richest fruits the fairest flowers sages with irksome waste of time the steep ascent of knowledge climb then from the towering heights they scale behold contentment range  the vale yet why asteria tell us why we scorn the crowd when you are nigh why then does reason seem so fair why learning then deserve our care who can unpleasd your shelves behold while you so fair a proof unfold what force the brightest genius draws from polished wisdoms written laws where are our humbler tenets flown what strange perfection bids us own that bliss with toilsome science dwells and happiest he who most excels upon a visit to the same in winter      see lady luxboroughs letters p    by the same i on fair asterias blissful plains where everblooming fancy reigns how pleased we pass the winters day and charm the dulleyd spleen away ii no linnet from the leafless bough pours forth her note melodious now but all admire asterias tongue nor wish the linnets vernal song iii no flowers emit their transient rays yet sure asterias wit displays more various tints more glowing lines and with perennial beauty shines iv though rifled groves and fettered streams but ill befriend a poets dreams asterias presence wakes the lyre and well supplies poetic fire v the fields have lost their lovely dye no cheerful azure decks the sky yet still we bless the louring day asteria smiles  and all is gay vi hence let the muse no more presume to blame the winters dreary gloom accuse his loitering hours no more but ah their envious haste deplore vii for soon from wit and friendsips reign the social hearth the sprightly vein i go  to meet the coming year on savage plains and deserts drear viii i go  to feed on pleasures flown nor find the spring my loss atone but mid the flowery sweets of may with pride recall this winters day an irregular ode after sickness       melius cum venerit ipsa canemus by the same i too long a stranger to repose at length from pains abhorred couch i rose and wandered forth alone to court once more the balmy breeze and catch the verdure of the trees ere yet their charms were flown ii twas from a bank with pansies gay i hailed once more the cheerful day the suns forgotten beams o sun how pleasing were thy rays reflected from the polished face of yon refulgent streams iii raised by the scene my feeble tongue essayed again the sweets of song and thus in feeble strains and slow the loitering numbers gan to flow come gentle air my languid limbs restore and bid me welcome from the stygian shore for sure i heard the tender sighs i seemed to join the plaintive cries of hapless youths who through the myrtle grove bewail for ever their unfinished love to that unjoyous clime torn from the sight of these etherial skies debarred the luster of their delias eyes and banished in their prime v come gentle air and while the thickets bloom convey the jasmins breath divine convey the woodbines rich perfume nor spare the sweetleast eglantine and may thou shun the rugged storm till health her wonted charms explain with rural pleasure in her train to greet me in her fairest form while from this lofty mount i view the sons of earth the vulgar crew anxious for futile gains beneath me stray and seek with erring step contentments obvious way vi come gentle air and thou celestial muse thy genial flame infuse enough to lend a pensive bosom aid and gild retirements gloomy shade enough to rear such rustic lays as foes may slight but partial friends will praise vii the gentle air allowed my claim and more to cheer my drooping frame she mixed the balm of opening flowers such as the be with chymic powers from hyblas fragrant hill inhales or scent sabeas blooming vales but ah the nymphs that heal the pensive mind by prescripts more refined neglect their votarys anxious moan oh how should they relieve  the muses all were flown viii by flowery plain or woodland shades i fondly sought the charming maids by woodland shades or flowery plain i sought them faithless maids in vain when lo in happier hour i leave behind my native mead to range where zeal and friendship lead to visit luxboroughs see lady luxboroughs letters p     honored bower ah foolish man to seek the tuneful maids on other plains or near less verdant shades ix scarce have my footsteps pressed the favored ground when sounds etherial strike my ear at once celestial forms appear my fugitives are found the muses here attune their lyres ah partial with unwonted fires here hand in hand with careless mien the sportive graces trip the green x but whilst i wandered over a scene so fair too well at one survey i trace how every muse and every grace had long employed their care lurks not a stone enriched with lively stain blooms not a flower amid the vernal store falls not a plum on indias distant plain glows not a shell on adrias rocky shore but torn methought from native lands or seas from their arrangement gain fresh power to please xi and some had bent the wildering maze bedeckt with every shrub that blows and some entwined the willing sprays to shield the illustrious dames repose others had graced the sprightly dome and taught the portrait where to glow others arrangd the curious tome or mid the decorated space assigned the laureled bust a place and given to learning all the pomp of show and now from every task withdrawn they met and friskd it over the lawn xii ah woe is me said i and barrells the seat of lady luxborough in warwickshire hilly circuit heard me cry have i for this with labor strove and lavished all my little store to fence for you my shady grove and scollop every winding shore and fringe with every purple rose the sapphire stream that down my valley flows xiii ah lovely treacherous maids to quit unseen my votive shades when pale disease and torturing pain had torn me from the breezy plain and to a restless couch confined who never your wonted tasks declined she needs not your officious aid to swell the song or plan the shade by genuine fancy fired her native genius guides her hand and while she marks the sage command more lovely scenes her skill shall raise her lyre resound with nobler lays than ever you inspired thus i my rage and grief display but vainly blame and vainly mourn nor will a grace or muse return till luxborough lead the way anacreontic      by the same twas in a cool aonian glade the wanton cupid spent with toil had sought refreshment from the shade and stretched him on the mossy soil a vagrant muse drew nigh and found the subtle traitor fast asleep and is it thine to snore profound she said yet leave the world to weep but hush  from this auspicious hour the world i ween may rest in peace and robbed of darts and stripped of power thy peevish petulance decrease sleep on poor child whilst i withdraw and this thy vile artillery hide  when the castalian fount she saw and plunged his arrows in the tide the magic fount  illjudging maid shall cause you soon to curse the day you dared the shafts of love invade and gave his arms redoubled sway for in a stream so wondrous clear when angry cupid searches round will not the radiant points appear will not the furtive spoils be found too soon they were and every dart dipped in the muses mystic spring acquired new force to wound the heart and taught at once to love and sing then farewell ye pierian quire for who will now your altars throng from love we learn to swell the lyre and echo asks no sweeter song ode written      by the same urit spes animi credula mutui hor twas not by beautys aid alone that love usurped his airy throne his boasted power displayed it is kindness that secures his aim it is hope that feeds the kindling flame which beauty first conveyed in claras eyes the lightnings view her lips with all the roses hue have all its sweets combined yet vain the blush and faint the fire till lips at once and eyes conspire to prove the charmer kind  though wit might gild the tempting snare with softest accent sweetest air by envys self admired if lesbias wit betrayed her scorn in vain might every grace adorn what every muse inspired thus airy strephon tuned his lyre  he scorned the pangs of wild desire which lovesick swains endure resolved to brave the keenest dart since frowns could never wound his heart and smiles  must ever cure but ah how false these maxims prove how frail security from love experience hourly shows love can imagined smiles supply on every charming lip and eye eternal sweets bestows in vain we trust the fairones eyes in vain the sage explores the skies to learn from stars his fate till led by fancy wide astray he finds no planet mark his way convinced and wise  too late as partial to their words we prove then boldly join the lists of love with towering hopes supplied so heroes taught by doubtful shrines mistook their deitys designs then took the field  and died the dying kid by the same optima quaque dies miseris mortalibus aevi prima fugit  virg a tear bedews my delias eye to think yon playful kid must die from crystal spring and flowery mead must in his prime of life recede erewhile in sportive circles round she saw him wheel and frisk and bound from rock to rock pursue his way and on the fearful margin play pleased on his various freaks to dwell she saw him climb my rustic cell thence eye my lawns with verdure bright and seem all ravished at the fight she tells with what delight he stood to trace his features in the flood then skipd aloof with quaint amaze and then drew near again to gaze she tells me how with eager speed he flew to hear my vocal reed and how with critic face profound and steadfast ear devoured the sound his every frolic light as air deserves the gentle delias care and tears bedew her tender eye to think the playful kid must die  but knows my delia timely wife how soon this blameless era flies while violence and craft succeed unfair design and ruthless deed soon would the vine his wounds deplore and yield her purple gifts no more ah soon erasd from every grove were delias name and strephons love no more those bowers might strephon see where first he fondly gazed on thee no more those beds of flowerets find which for thy charming brows he twined each wayward passion soon would tear his bosom now so void of care and when they left his ebbing vein what but insipid age remain then mourn not the decrees of fate that gave his life so short a date and i will join thy tenderest sighs to think that youth so swiftly flies love songs written between the year      and      by the same song i i told my nymph i told her true my fields were small my flocks were few while faltering accents spoke my fear that flavia might not prove sincere of crops destroyed by vernal cold and vagrant sheep that left my fold of these he heard yet bore to hear and is not flavia then sincere how changed by fortunes fickle wind the friends i loved became unkind she heard and shed a generous tear and is not flavia then sincere how if she deigned my love to bless my flavia must not hope for dress this too she heard and smiled to hear and flavia sure must be sincere go shear your flocks ye jovial swains go reap the plenty of your plains despoiled of all which you revere i know my flavias love sincere song ii the landscape how pleased within my native bowers erewhile i passed the day was ever scene so decked with flowers were ever flowers so gay how sweetly smiled the hill the vale and all the landscape round the river gliding down the dale the hill with beeches crowned but now when urged by tender woes i speed to meet my dear that hill and stream my zeal oppose and check my fond career no more since daphne was my theme their wonted charms i see that verdant hill and silver stream divide my love and me song iii ye gentle nymphs and generous dames that rule over every british mind be sure ye soothe their amorous flames be sure your laws are not unkind for hard it is to wear their bloom in unremitting sighs away to mourn the nights oppressive gloom and faintly bless the rising day and cruel twere a freeborn swain a british youth should vainly moan who scornful of a tyrants chain submits to yours and yours alone nor pointed spear nor links of steel could ever those gallant minds subdue who beautys wounds with pleasure feel and boast the fetters wrought by you song iv the skylark go tuneful bird that gladst the skies to daphnes window speed thy way and there on quivering pinions rise and there thy vocal art display and if she deign thy notes to hear and if she praise thy matin song tell her the sounds that soothe her ear to damons native plains belong tell her in livelier plumes arrayed the bird from indian groves may shine but ask the lovely partial maid what are his notes compared to thine then bid her treat yon witless beau and all his flaunting race with scorn and lend an ear to damons woe who sings her praise and sings forlorn song v ah ego non aliter tristes evincere morbos optarim quam le sic quoque velle putem  on every tree in every plain i trace the jovial spring in vain a sickly languor veils mine eyes and fast my waning vigor flies nor flowery plain nor budding tree that smile on others smile on me mine eyes from death shall court repose nor shed a tear before they close what bliss to me can seasons bring or what the needless pride of spring the cypress bough that suits the bier retains its verdure all the year it is true my vine so fresh and fair might claim awhile my wonted care my rural store some pleasure yield so white a flock so green a field my friends that each in kindness vie might well expect one parting sigh might well demand one tender tear for when was damon unsincere but ere i ask once more to view yon setting sun his race renew inform me swains my friends declare will pitying delia join the prayer song vi the attribute of venus yes fulvia is like venus fair has all her bloom and shape and air but still to perfect every grace she wants  the smile upon her face the crown majestic juno wore and cynthias brow the crescent bore an helmet marked minervas mien but smiles distinguished beautys queen her train was formed of smiles and loves her chariot drawn by gentlest doves and from her zone the nymph may find it is beautys province to be kind then smile my fair and all whose aim aspires to paint the cyprian dame or bid her breathe in living stone shall take their forms from you alone the rape of the trap a ballad written at college      by the same twas in a land of learning the muses favorite station such pranks of late were played by a rat as gave them consternation all in a collegestudy where books were in great plenty this rat would devour more sense in an hour than i could write  in twenty his breakfast half the morning he constantly attended and when the bell rung for eveningsong his dinner scarce was ended huge tomes of geo  graphy and maps lay all in flutter a river or a sea was to him a dish of tea and a kingdom  bread and butter such havoc spoil and rapine with grief my muse rehearses how freely he would dine on some bulky schooldivine and for desert  eat verses he spared not even heroics on which we poets pride us and would make no more of king arthurs sir richard blackmores poem under that title  by the score than  all the world beside does but if the desperate potion might chance to over  dose him to check its rage he took a page of logic to compose him a trap in haste and anger was bought you need not doubt on it and such was the gin were a lion once in he could not i think get out on it with cheese not books twas baited the fact i will not belly it since none i tell ye that whether scholar or rat minds books when he has other diet but more of trap and bait sir why should i sing  or either since the rat with mickle pride all their sophistry defied and dragged them away together both trap and bait were vanished through a fracture in the flooring which though so trim it now may seem had then a dozen or more in then answer this ye sages nor think i mean to wrong ye had the rat who thus did seize on the trap less claim to reason than many a sage among ye dan priors mice i own it were vermin of condition

till examined have his conduct cleared charge not on me alone that fatal day your own commanders bore too great a sway think sir with pity think what i have lost my native realms and my paternal coast all that a firm confedrate could bestow even faith and fame if you believe the foe think what a heavy load oerwhelms my breast with its own sorrows and with yours oppressed after one battle lost and country gone vanquished again alas and twice undone oh where shall i begin what language find to heal the raging anguish of your mind or if you deign a willing ear to lend oh where will my disastrous

our towering thoughts overthrown the belgian host while we surveyed our own destroyed their provinces with sword and flame let in their seas and sacked their amsterdam already had we shared the fancied spoil imaginary trophies crowned our toil batavian standards to this temple gave in that the british crosses doomed to wave a rural seat assigned each captive chief in flowery gardens to assuage his grief and by his arts and first escape prepared on marlbro had bestowed a double guard paris impatient for the conquered foe hastened the tuneful hymn and solemn show triumphal chariots for the victor stayed and finished arches cast a pompous shade with nicest art the bards had dressed their lays of nothing fearful but to reach our praise but all our hopes and expectation crossed what lines have we what fame has boileau lost your army now fixed on its high designs rush forth like vernal swarms and quit their lines eager the dyle they pass to seek the fight judoinas fields with sudden tents are white the foe descends like torrents from the hills and all the neighboring vale tumultuous fills preluding cannons tell the approaching storm and working armies take a dreadful form soon your victorious arms and stronger force tore all the left and broke the belgian horse their scattered troops are rallied to the fight but only rallied for a second flight as when high heaven on some aspiring wood which in close ranks and thickest order stood pours its collected stores of vengeance down cedars are seen with firs and oaks overthrown long ravages and intervals of waste so gored their lines appeared and so defaced the third attack had ended all the war sunk their whole force and saved your future care had marlbro only marlbro not been there as some good genius flies to save the realms which in his absence born a plague oerwhelms through opening squadrons did the hero haste and raised their drooping courage as he past amidst the routed belgians he arrived turned the pursuit the fainting fight revived supplied each rank filled every vacant space and brought the battle to its former face with trembling hearts we see our fate decreed where marlbro fights how can a foe succeed to reach his life our boldest warriors strive on him the storm with all its thunder drive he stems the war and half encompassed round still clears his way and still maintains his ground amazed i saw him in such dangers live and envied him the death i wished to give at this battle the duke of marlborough was twice in the utmost danger once by a fall from his horse and a second time by a cannon shot that took off the head of colonel bringfield as he was holding the stirrup for his grace to remount but how our rising pleasure shall i tell the thundering steed and the great rider fell we thanked kind heaven and hoped the victor slain but all our hopes and all our thanks were vain free from the guilt of any hostile wound alive he lay and dreadful on the ground as when a lion in the toils is cast that uncontrolled had laid the country waste the insulting hinds surround him who before fled from his haunts and trembled at his roar so round beset the mighty briton lies and vulgar foes attempt the glorious prize till fresh battalions to his succor brought contending armies for the hero fought the wanted steed some friendly hand prepared and met a fatal but a great reward a glorious death of his loved lord bereft the pious office unperformd he left the rescued chief by the past danger warmed our weakened household the household troops on this important day behaved with great bravery they more than once raied and renewed the battle with new fury stormed while all around to our admiring eyes fresh foes and undiscovered squadrons rise the boasted guards that spread your name so far and turned wherever they fought the doubtful war with heaps of slaughter strowd the fatal plain and did a thousand glorious things in vain broke with unequal force such numbers die that i myself rejoiced to see them fly but oh how few preserved themselves by flight or found a shelter from the approaching night thousands fall undistinguished in the dark and five whole leagues with wide destruction mark scarce at ramilia did the slaughter end when the swift victor had approached ostend after the battle says bishop burnet the duke of marlborough lost no time but followed them close louvain mechlin and brussels submitted besides many lesser places antwerp made a show of standing out but soon followed the example of the rest ghent and bruges did the same in all these king charles was proclaimed upon this unexpected rapidity of success the duke of marlborough went to the hague to concert measures with the states where he staid but few days for they agreed to every thing he proposed and sent him back with full powers the first thing he undertook was the siege of ostend a place famous for its long siege in the last age the natives of the place were disposed to return to the austrian family and the french that were in it had so lost all heart and spirit that they made not the resistance that was looked for in ten days after they sat down before it and within four days after the batteries were finished they capitulated history of his own times vol i p      took in whole states and countries in his way brussels nor ghent nor antwerp gained a day within the compass of one circling moon the lis the demer and the scheld his own what in the foes and what in williams hand did for an age the power of france withstand though each campaign she crowded nations drained and the fat soil with blood of thousands stained those forts and provinces does marlbro gain in twice three suns and not a soldier slain none can suspend the fortune of their town but who their harvest and their country drown compelled to call his valor to evade the less destructive ocean to their aid oh were our loss to flandrias plains confined but what a train of ills are still behind beyond the adige vendome the duke de vendome at this juncture commanded the french troops in italy as the marshall de villars did in germany feels the blow and villars now retires without a foe the fate of flanders spreads in spain the flame and their new monarch robs of half his fame but france shall hear in some late distant reign an unborn louis curse ramillias plain whither oh whither shall bavaria run or where himself or where the victor shun shall i no more with vain ambition roam but my own subjects rule in peace at home thence an abandoned fugitive i am driven like the first

title more invites pardon great prince the failings of a muse that dares not hope for more than your excuse forced at a distance to attempt your praise and sing your victories in mournful lays to cast in shadows and allay the light that wounds with nearer rays the dazzled sight nor durst in a direct and open strain such acts with her unhallowed notes profane in towering verse let meaner heroes grow

rosy hue why should i search my brains for rhyme to sing those eyes of glossy blue ii the power as yet is all in vain thy numerous charms and various graces they only serve to banish pain and light up joy in parents faces iii but soon those eyes their strength shall feel those charms their powerful sway shall find youth shall in crowds before you kneel and own your empire over mankind iv then when on beautys throne you sit and thousands court your wished for arms my muse shall stretch her utmost wit to sing the victories of your charms v charms that in time shall never be lost at least while verse like mine endures and future hanburys shall boast of verse like mine of charms like yours vi a little vain we both may be since scarce another house can show a poet that can sing like me a beauty that can charm like you a song upon miss harriet hanbury addressed to the rev mr birt by the same i dear doctor of st marys in the hundred of bergavenny i have seen such a lass with a shape and a face as never was matched by any ii such wit such bloom and such beauty has this girl of ponty pool sir with eye that would make the toughest heart ach and the wisest man a fool sir iii at our fair the other day she appeared sir and the welchmen all flocked and viewed her and all of them said she was fit to have been made a wife for owen tudor iv they would never have been tired with gazing and so much her charms did please sir that all of them staid till their ale grew dead and cold was their toasted cheese sir v how happy the lord of the manor that shall be of her possessed sir for all must agree who my harriet shall see she is a heriot of the best sir vi then pray make a ballad about her we know you have wit if you would show it then dont be ashamed you can never be blamed for a prophet is often a poet vii but why dont you make one yourself then i suppose i by you shall be told sir this beautiful piece alas is my niece and besides she is but five years old sir viii but though my dear friend she is no older in her face it may plainly be seen sir that this angel at five will if she is alive be a goddess at fifteen sir to mr garnier and mr pearce of bath a grateful ode in return for the extraordinary kindness and humanity they showed to me and my eldest daughter now lady essex      by the same i what glorious verse from love has sprung how well has indignation sung and can the gentle muse whilst in her oncebelovd abode i stray and suppliant kneel an ode to gratitude refuse ii garnier my friend accept this verse and thou receive wellnaturd pearce all i can give of fame let others other subjects sing some murderous chief some tyrant king humanitys my theme iii for arts like yours employed by you make verse on such a theme your due to whom indulgent heaven its favorite power of doing good by you so rightly understood judiciously has given iv behold obedient to your power consuming fevers rage no more nor chilling agues freeze the cripple dances void of pain the deaf in raptures hear again the blind transported sees v health at your call extends her wing each healing plant each friendly spring its various power discloses over deaths approaches you prevail see chloes cheek of late so pale blooms with returning roses vi these gifts my friends which shine in you are rare yet to some chosen few heaven has the same assigned health waits on meads prescription still and hawkins sir caesar hawkins sergeant surgeon to the king hand and ranbys john ranby esquire sergeant surgeon to his majesty he died    aug      skill are blessings to mankind vii but hearts like yours are rare indeed which for anothers wounds can bleed anothers grief can feel the lovers fear the parents groan your natures catch and make your own and share the pains you heal viii but why to them hygeia why do thou thy cordial drop deny who but for others live oh goddess hear my prayer and grant that these that health may never want which they to others give ode to death translated from the french of the king of prussia by dr hawkesworth dr john hawkesworth was born about the year      and was bred to the law a profession which he soon relinquished at the latter part of his life he was one of the directors of the east india company and died nov          yet a few years or days perhaps or moments pass with silent lapse and time to me shall be no more no more the sun these eyes shall view earth over these limbs her dust shall strew and lifes fantastic dream be over alas i touch the dreadful brink from natures verge impelled i sink and endless darkness wraps me round yes death is ever at my hand fast by my bed he takes his stand and constant at my board is found earth air and fire and water join against this fleeting life of mine and where for succor can i fly if art with flattering wiles pretend to shield me like a guardian friend by art ere nature bids i die i see this tyrant of the mind this idol flesh to dust consigned once called from dust by power divine its features change it is pale it is cold  hence dreadful spectre to behold thy aspect is to make it mine and can i then with guilty pride which fear nor shame can quell or hide this flesh still pamper and adorn thus viewing what i soon shall be can what i am demand the knee or look on aught around with scorn but then this spark that warms that guides that lives that thinks what fate betides can this be dust a kneaded clod this yield to death the soul the mind that measures heaven and mounts the wind that knows at once itself and god great cause of all above below who knows thee must for ever know immortal and divine thy image on my soul impressed of endless being is the test and bids eternity be mine transporting thought  but am i sure that endless life will joy secure joys only to the just decreed the guilty wretch expiring goes where vengeance endless life bestows that endless misery may succeed great god how aweful is the scene a breath a transient breath between and can i jest and laugh and play to earth alas too firmly bound trees deeply rooted in the ground are shivered when they are torn away vain joys which envied greatness gains how do ye bind with silken chains which ask herculean strength to break how with new terrors have ye armed the power whose slightest glance alarmed how many deaths of one ye make yet dumb with wonder i behold mans thoughtless race in error bold forget or scorn the laws of death with these no projects coincide nor vows nor toils nor hopes they guide each thinks he draws immortal breath each blind to fates approaching hour intrigues or fights for wealth or power and slumbering dangers dare provoke and he who tottering scarce sustains a centurys age plans future gains and feels an unexpected stroke go on unbridled desperate band scorn rocks gulphs winds search sea and land and spoil new worlds wherever found seize haste to seize the glittering prize and sighs and tears and prayers despise nor spare the temples holy ground they go succeed but look again the desperate hand you seek in vain now trod in dust the peasants scorn but who that saw their treasures swell that heard the insatiate vow rebel would ever have thought them mortal born see the worlds victor mount his car blood marks his progress wide and far sure he shall reign while ages fly no vanished like a morning cloud the hero was but just allowed to fight to conquer and to die and is it true i ask with dread that nations heaped on nations bled beneath his chariots fervid wheel with trophies to adorn the spot where his pale corse was left to rot and doomed the hungry reptiles meal yes fortune wearied with her play her toy this hero casts away and scarce the form of man is seen awe chills ray breast my eyes overflow around my brows no roses glow the cypress mine funereal green yet in this hour of grief and fears when aweful truth unveiled appears some power unknown usurps my breast back to the world my thoughts are led my feet in follys labrinth tread and fancy dreams that life is blessed how weak an empress is the mind whom pleasures flowery wreaths can bind and captive to her altars lead weak reason yields to phrenzys rage and all the world is follys stage and all that act are fools indeed and yet this strange this sudden flight from gloomy cares to gay delight this sickleness so light and vain in lifes delusive transient dream where men nor things are what they seem is all the real good we gain the hymn of dionysius translated from the greek by the rev mr merrick i to the muse lend thy voice celestial maid

wanton wind hail fire of day whose rosy car through the pathless fields of air by the winged coursers borne opes the eyelids of the morn thou whose locks their light display over the wide aetherial way wreathing their united rays into one promiscuous blaze under thy allseeing eye earths remotest corners lie while in thy repeated course issuing from thy fruitful source floods of fire incessant stray streams of everlasting day round thy sphere the starry throng varying sweet their ceaseless song while their vivid flames on high deck the clear untroubled sky to the tuneful lyre advance

why wears my pensive friend that gloomy brow say whence proceeds the imaginary woe what prosperous villain have thou met today or has afflicted virtue crossed thy way is it some crime unpunished you deplore or right subverted by injurious power be this or that the cause it is wisely done to make the sorrows of mankind your own to see the injured pleading unredressd the proud exalted and the meek oppressed can hurt thy health and rob thee of thy rest your cares are in a hopeful way to cease if you must find perfection to find peace but reck thy malice vent thy stifled rage inveigh against the times and lash the age  perhaps just recent from the court you come over public ills to ruminate at home  say which of all the wretches thou have seen has thrown a morsel to thy hungry spleen what worthless member of that medley throng who basely acts or tamely suffers wrong he who to nothing but his interest true cajoles the fool he is working to undo or that more despicable timorous slave who knows himself abused yet hugs the knave perhaps you mourn our senates sinking fame that show of freedom dwindled to a name where hireling judges deal their venal laws and the best bidder has the justest cause what then they have the power and who shall dare to blame the legal wrong that bears astraeas name besides such thoughts should never stir the rage of youthful gall  reflection comes with age it is our decaying lifes autumnal fruit the bitter produce of our latest shoot when every blossom of the tree is dead enjoyment withered and our wishes fled thine still is in its spring on every bough fair plenty blooms and youthful odours blow season of joy too early to be wise the time to covet pleasures not despise yours is an age when trifles ought to please too soon for reason to attack thy ease though soon the hour shall come when thou shall know it is vain fruition all and empty show but late examine late inspect mankind if seeing pains it is prudence to be blind let not their vices yet employ thy thoughts laugh at their follies ere you weep their faults and when as sure you must at length you find what things men are resolve to arm your mind too nicely never their demerits scan and of their virtues make the most you can silent avert the mischief they intend and cross but seem not to discern their end if they prevail submit for prudence lies in suffering well  it is equally unwise to see the injuries we will not resent and mourn the evils which we cannot prevent  eugenio you counsel well to bid me arm my mind would the receipt were easy as it is kind but hard it is for misery to reach that fortitude prosperity can teach could i forbid what has been to have been or lodge a doubt on truths myself have seen could i divest remembrance of her store and say collect these images no more could i dislodge sensation from my breast and charm her wakeful faculties to rest could i my nature and myself subdue i might the method you prescribe pursue but if unfeigned afflictions we endure if reasons our disease and not our cure then seeming ease is all we can obtain as one who long familiarizd to pain still feels the smart but ceases to complain though young in life yet long inured to care thus i submissive every evil bear if unexpected ills alone are hard mine should be light who am for all prepared no disappointments can my peace annoy disuse has weaned me from all hopes of joy the vain pursuit for ever i give over repulsed i strive betrayed i trust no more mankind i know their nature and their art their vice their own their virtue but a part ill played so often that all the cheat can tell and dangerous only where it is acted well in different classes ranged a different name attends their practice but the hearts the same their hate is interest interest too their love on the same springs these different engines move that sharpens malice and directs her sting and thence the honeyd streams of flattery spring long i suspected what at last i know i thought men worthless now i have proved em so reluctant proved it by too sure a rule i learned my science in a painful school he buys even wisdom at too dear a price who pays my sad experience to be wise why did i hope by sanguine views possessed that virtue harbored in a human breast why did i trust to flatterys specious wile the april sunshine of her transient smile why disbelieve the lessons of the wise that taught me young to pierce her thin disguise i thought their rancour not their prudence spoke that age perverse in false invectives broke i thought their comments on this gaudy seen the effects of phlegm and dictated by spleen that jealous of the joys themselves were past their envy tried to pall their childrens taste like the deaf adder to the charmers tongue i gave no credit to the truths they sung but happy in a visionary scheme still sought companions worthy my esteem the tongue the hearts interpreter i deemed and judged of what men were by what they seemed i thought each warm professor meant me fair each supple sycophant a friend sincere the solemn hypocrite whose close design mirth never interrupts nor love nor wine who talks on any secret but his own collecting all communicating none who still attentive to what others say observes to wound or questions to betray of him as guardian of my private thought in morning counsels cool resolves i sought to him still open cautiously consigned the inmost treasures of my secret mind my joys and griefs delighted to impart in sacred confidence unmixed with art that dangerous pleasure of the honest heart whenever i purposed to unbend my soul in social banquets where the circling bowl to gladness lifts all sorrows but despair and gives a transient lethe to our care i chose the men whose talents entertain and season converse with a lively strain who thoughtless still by hope nor fear perplexed enjoy the present hour and risque the next these not the luxury of slothful ease soft downy beds nor balmy slumbers please while wakeful kings on purple couches own the secret sorrows of their envied crown and wait revolving light with shorter rest than even those wretches by their power oppressed this jocund train devoted to delight in cheerful vigils still protract the night nor dread the cares approaching with the day through each vicissitude for ever gay with such i commund pleased that i could find recess so grateful to the active mind and while the youths in sprightly contest try with humorous tale or apposite reply or amorous song or inoffensive jest the test of wit to glad the lengthened feast my soul said i depend upon their truth for fraud inhabits not the breast of youth indulge thy genius here be free be safe mirth is their aim they covet but to laugh pure from deceit as ignorant of care their friendship and their joys are both sincere i judged their nature like their humor good as if the soul depended on the blood and that the seeds of honesty must grow wherever health resides or spirits flow i see my error but i see too late it is vain inspection to look back on fate  what are the men who most esteemed we find but such whose vices are the most refined blind preference for vice like poison shows the surest death is in the subtlest dose  to such reflections when i turn my mind i loath my being and abhor mankind what joy for truth what commerce for the just if all our safetys founded on distrust if all our wisdom is a mean deceit and he who prospers but the ablest cheat  atticus o early wise how well have thou defined the worth the joys the friendship of mankind  eugenio blessed be the powers i know their abject state  atticus yet bear with this and hope a better fate thrice happy they who view with stable eyes the shifting scene who temperate firm and wise can bear its sorrows and its joys despise who look on disappointments shocks and strife and all the consequential ills of life not as severities the gods impose but

oppressed with this restorative still soothes his breast this suffering virtue chears this pain beguiles and decks calamity herself in smiles when mead and friend have ransacked every rule taught in hippocrates and galens school to quiet ills that mock the leechs ie the physicians an ancient word now almost obsolete art which opiates fail to deaden in the heart this cordial still the incurable

he lavishly scattered his lays and in every wilderness planted his bays then chaucer and spenser harmonious were heard then shakspeare and milton and waller appeared and dryden whose brows by apollo were crowned as he sung in such strains as the god might have owned but now since the laurel is given of late to cibber to eusden to shadwell and tate apollo has quitted the isle he once loved and his harp and his bays to hibernia removed he vows and he swears he will inspire us no more and has put out popes fires which he kindled before and further he says men no longer shall boast a science their flight and ill treatment has lost but that women alone for the future shall write and who can resist when they doubly delight and lest we should doubt what he said to be true has begun by inspiring sapphira the name by which mrs barber was generally known among her friends and you mrs bindons answer when home i returned from the dancing last night and elate by your praises attempted to write i familiarly called on apollo for aid and told him how many fine things you had said he smiled at my folly and gave me to know your wit and not mine by your writings you show and then says the god still to make you more vain he has promised that i shall enlighten your brain when he knows in his heart if he speak but his mind that no woman alive can now boast i am kind for since daphne to shun me grew into a laurel with the sex i have sworn still to keep up the quarrel i thought it all joke till by writing to you i have proved his resentment alas but too true sir charless reply i will not believe that phoebus did not smile unhappily for you i know his style to strains like yours of old his harp he strung and while he dictated orinda a name given to mrs catharine philips sung did beauteous daphnes scorn of proffered love against the sex his indignation move it rather made you his peculiar care convinced from thence ye were as good as fair as mortals who from dust received their birth must when they die return to native earth so too the laurel that your brow adorns sprang from the fair and to the fair returns to a lady who sent compliments to a clergyman upon the ten of hearts your

the be the ant and the sparrow a fable addressed to phebe and kitty cotton at boarding school by dr cotton my dears it is said in days of old that beasts could talk and birds could scold but now it seems the human race alone engross the speakers place yet lately if report be true and much the tale relates to you there met a sparrow ant and be which reasoned and conversed as we who reads my page will doubtless grant that phes the wise industrious ant and all with half an eye may see that kitty is the busy be here then are two  but where is the third go search your school you will find the bird your school i ask your pardon fair i am sure you will find no sparrow there now to my tale  one summers morn a be ranged over the verdant lawn studious to husband every hour and make the most of every flower nimble from stalk to stalk she flies and loads with yellow wax her thighs with which the artist builds her comb and keeps all tight and warm at home or from the cowslips golden bells sucks honey to enrich her cells or every tempting rose pursues or sips the lilys fragrant dews yet never robs the shining bloom or of its beauty or perfume thus she discharged in every way the various duties of the day it chanced a frugal ant was near whose brow was wrinkled over by care a great oeconomist was she nor less laborious than the be by pensive parents often taught what ills arise from want of thought that poverty on sloth depends on poverty the loss of friends hence every day the ant is found with anxious steps to tread the ground with curious search to trace the grain and drag the heavy load with pain the active be with pleasure saw the ant fulfill her parents law ah sisterlabourer says she how very fortunate are we who taught in infancy to know the comforts which from labor flow are independent of the great nor know the wants of pride and state why is our food so very sweet because we earn before we eat why are our wants so very few because we natures calls pursue whence our complacency of mind because we act our parts assigned have we incessant tasks to do is not all nature busy too does not the sun with constant pace persist to run his annual race do not the stars which shine so bright renew their courses every night does not the ox obedient bow his patient neck and draw the plough or when did ever the generous steed withhold his labor or his speed if you all natures system scan the only idle thing is man a wanton sparrow longed to hear their sage discourse and strait drew near the bird was talkative and loud and very pert and very proud as worthless and as vain a thing perhaps as ever wore a wing she found as on a spray she sat the little friends were deep in chat that virtue was their favorite theme and toil and probity their scheme such talk was hateful to her breast she thought them arrant prudes at best when to display her naughty mind hunger and cruelty combined she viewed the ant with savage eyes and hopt and hopt to snatch her prize the be who watched her opening bill and guessed her fell design to kill asked her from what her anger rose and why she treated ants as foes the sparrow her reply began and thus the conversation ran whenever i am disposed to dine i think the whole creation mine that i am a bird of high degree and every insect made for me hence often i search the emmet brood for emmets are delicious food and often in wantonness and play i slay ten thousand in a day for truth it is without disguise that i love mischief as my eyes oh fie the honest be replied i fear you make base man your guide of every creature sure the worst though in creations scale the first ungrateful man it is strange he thrives who burns the bees to rob their hives i hate his vile administration and so do all the emmet nation what fatal foes to birds are men quite to the eagle from the wren o do not mens example take who mischief do for mischiefs sake but spare the ant  her worth demands esteem and friendship at your hands a mind with every virtue blessed must raise compassion in your breast virtue rejoined the sneering bird where did you learn that gothic word since i was hatched i never heard that virtue was at all revered but say it was the ancients claim yet moderns disavow the name unless my dear you read romances i cannot reconcile your fancies virtue in fairy tales is seen to play the goddess or the queen but what is a queen without the power or beauty child without a dower yet this is all that virtue brags at best it is only worth in rags such whims my very heart derides indeed you make me burst my sides trust me miss be  to speak the truth i have copied men from earliest youth the same our taste the same our school passion and appetite our rule and call me bird or call me sinner i will never forego my sport or dinner a prowling cat the miscreant spies and wide expands her amber eyes near and more near grimalkin draws she wags her tail protends her paws then springing on her thoughtless prey she bore the vicious bird away thus in her cruelty and pride the wicked wanton sparrow died ode on a storm written on board his majestys ship the canterbury after she had lost all her masts  with gallant pomp and beauteous pride the floating pile in harbor rode proud of her freight the swelling tide reluctant left the vessels side and raised it as she flowed the waves with eastern breezes curled had silvered half the liquid plain the anchors weighed the sails unfurled serenely moved the wooden world and stretched along the main the scaly natives of the deep press to admire the vast machine in sporting gambols round it leap or swimming low due distance keep in homage to their queen thus as life glides in gentle gale pretended friendship waits on power but early quits the borrowed veil when adverse fortune shifts the sail and hastens to devour in vain we fly approaching ill danger can multiply its form exposed we fly like jonas still and heaven when it is heavens will oertakes us in a storm the distant surges foamy white foretell the furious blast dreadful though distant was the sight confedrate winds and waves unite and menace every mast winds whistling through the shrouds proclaim a fatal harvest on the deck quick in pursuit as active flame too soon the rolling ruin came and ratified the wreck thus adam smiled with newborn grace lifes flame inspired by heavenly breath thus the same breath sweeps off his race disorders natures beauteous face and spreads disease and death stripped of her pride the vessel rolls and as by sympathy she knew the secret anguish of our souls with inward deeper groans condoles the danger of her crew now what avails it to be brave on liquid precipices hung suspended on a breaking wave beneath us yawnd a seagreen grave and silenced every tongue the faithless flood forsook her keel and downward launched the laboring hull stunned she forgot awhile to reel and felt almost or seemed to feel a momentary lull thus in the jaws of death we lay nor light nor comfort found us there lost in the gulf and floods of spray no sun to cheer us nor a ray of hope but all despair the nearer shore the more despair while certain ruin waits on land should we pursue our wishes there soon we recant the fatal prayer and strive to shun the strand at length the being whose behest reduced this chaos into form his goodness and his power expressed he spoke  and as a god suppressed our troubles and the storm isaiah xxxiv come near ye nations and give ear o earth ye distant isles and continents remote wherever dispersed beneath the vast expanse of heavens high roof attend attend and hear your doom tremendous ratified above sad retribution of enormous guilt which calling loud for justice and revenge flew swift as light up to the throne of god and pulled down dire destruction on the earth the mighty god with all his thunder armed will east abroad the terrors of his wrath and shower down vengeance on the guilty land the lord of hosts amidst a night of clouds and with the majesty of darkness crowned thundered aloft and from the inmost heaven hurled down impetuous fury swift as thought through the azure void widestretchd from pole to pole to ravage all the boundless universe as when a blustering wind rolls from the north and shakes all autumn with the driving blast so shall the fury of the omnipotent destroy the nations and confound their arms swords shields and spears and all the powers of war with eager speed rush over the embattled ranks and through the thick battalions urge its way jehovahs arm will shake the vast unequal and wrap the whole circumference around in wasting desolation ruin wide destructive slaughter ghastly to behold dire specimen of wrath omnipotent shall march tremendous over the burdened earth oppressed and conscious of unusual weight shrinking beneath the heavy load of death the purple piles and mountains of the slain expiring wretches pouring out their souls with bursts of groans shall fill the laboring world each slaughtered corpse shall breath a pestilence and wide around diffuse the scents of death the eternal hills shall float in seas of blood and mountains vanish in the crimson tide natures huge volumes shall be folded up like a vast scroll and all the glittering orbs drop from the heavens like autumnal leaves or the ripe fig when sultry sirius reigns while peals of thunder rattling in the skies shall roll incessant over the astonished world death and destruction threatnning all below and in substantial darkness high enthroned shall draw the curtains of eternal night and spread confusion hideous over the earth as when the embryo world ere time began in one rude heap one undigested mass of jarring discord and disorder lay the sun amazed to see the wild obscure no more with radiant light shall gild the skies no more diffusing his all genial beams on the high mountains spreads the shining morn but downwards flaming through the vast immense shall hide his glory in eternal night thus in loud thunder speaks the almighty sire  in copious slaughter will i take my sword and idumea thou shall swim in blood the lord shall hasten from the lofty skies destruction on his aweful footsteps waits death stalks before ruin on every side proclaims the terror of an angry god the ravenous sword pampered with reeking gore drunk with the blood of half the rebel world shall there be sheathed in israels stubborn foes bozrab with human sacrifice shall smoke and idumea thoughtless of her fate shall feel the smart of heavens avenging rod the great the small the oppressor and the oppressed shall join promiscuous in the common heap and one vast ruin shall involve them all for israels god is girt with burning rage and vows a last revenge to zions foes the silver streams that shine along the plain and chide their banks and tinkle as they run shall stop and stagnate to a sable pool and black with mud unconscious of a tide no more shall charm the sense or lull the soul or in soft murmurs die upon the ear but in crude streams and deadly stench exhale and with contagious vapors load the sky rapacious flames in pyramids of fire shall burn unquenchable and sulfurous smoke advancing over the horizontal plain in dusky wreaths roll ever to the skies the inhospitable land left desolate unfruitful but in every noxious weed shall be a lonely desert waste and wild within whose silent confines none shall dwell nor ever more be heard the harmonious voice of warbling birds that heretofore were wont in vocal choir to animate the grove and from the shady covert of the trees dispense sweet music to the listening vale but hooting owls that spread their lazy wings over the dark gloom and with their boding screams double the native horrors of the night these with the cormorants shall dwell therein securely in the upper lintels lodge and in the windows direful dirges sing god shall extend and bare his thundering arm and with confusion circumscribe the land where are the nobles and the mighty chiefs that in soft ease their silken moments waste to whom their prostrate vassals throng in crowds striving who first shall aweful homage pay and adoration them shall they invoke but all in vain their names shall be no more but in their stead more worthy savages with rapine uncontrollable shall reign and nobler brutes shall canton out the land those regal domes and towering palaces that high in clouds exalt their impious heads reflecting through the liquid firmament home to the distant ken a dazzling blaze thorns shall surround and nettles grow within ivy shall creep along the painted walls the matted grass overspread the polished floor and brambles vile entwine the empty throne while beasts from different climes joyous to find a place of rest to man alone denied shall take possession of the gilded domes the shaggy satyrs that old forests haunt the ostrich and his mate and dragons huge shall sport and revel in the dreary waste there the hoarse screechowls that in dead of night upon the chimney tops perch ominous while songs obscene the silent hours disturb shall in loud shrieks their sad presages tell shall unmolested solitude enjoy and desolation make more desolate ravens and vulturs scenting from afar the universal slaughter shall come forth from the high mountain and the humble vale croaking in hideous concert as they fly darkning the heavens with their ghastly train and glut their hungry jaws with human prey not one of these shall fail none want her mate but shall for ever such the lords decree in edoms ruins wanton undisturbed this is the fate ordained for zions foes isaiah xxxv when idumea and the nations round the inveterate foes of israel and of god lie vanquished dormant on the dreary waste of far extended ruin and involved in hideous woe and desolation wide then shall judea lift her cheerful head put forth the leaves of glad prosperity and after all the gloomy scene of grief and sad affliction flourish and revive in all the bright serenity of peace as the gay rose when winter storms are past warmed with the influence of a kinder sun comes from the bud with a vermilion blush cheering the sight and scattering all around a balmy odor that perfumes the skies she shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and fraught with richest blessings from above spring forth in all the pride of lebanon whose lofty cedars wondrous to behold in bodies huge and to the skies erect stand eminent branch over branch outspread in reglar distances and verdant shades emblem of happy state nor shall the hills of fragrant carmel rich in fruitful soil nor sharons flowery plain in all its bloom arrayed in natures goodliest attire and breathing fresh a gale of heavenly sweets spring forth in greater glory for the lord his goodness will declare that knows no bounds and all the people shall behold his might and see the wonders of omnipotence strengthen the languid nerves ye seers and bid the trembling hand be strong call into life the dissipated spirits and confirm the feeble knees the unactive joints support and bid the lazy blood flow briskly on and circulate with joy through every vein comfort the oppressed and smooth the ruffled mind say to the afflicted heart devoid of hope behold the almighty rushes from the skies even israels god from his refulgent throne of glory comes but not with radiant blaze of light even light invisible as when to moses on mount horeb he appeared and sent his faithful servant to redeem ungrateful israel from egyptian bonds nor with the music of a still soft voice as when h informed the prophet of his will but in a black and dreadful hemisphere of darkness armed with flaming thunderbolts and flashes of red lightning to increase the woe and make even darkness visible the hills shall tremble at his dire approach and fearful mountains pild up to the clouds fall down precipitant with rapid force and spread a plain immense for god will come full fraught with vengeance to consume your foes you in his bounteous mercy to protect then shall the eyes long closed in blackest night to whom no gladsome dawn of light appeared but comfortless unpenetrable shade shake off the film of darkness and behold the longexpected day new scenes of joy shall then appear and various prospects rise to cheer the newborn sight the deafend ear on whose dull nerves sadmoping silence dwelt and locked from musics note or voice of man shall open glad its labyrinths of sound again the stringed instrument shall feel and the sweet words of social converse hear the lame infirm creeping with slow advance dragging with pain reluctant feet along and scarcely by the friendly crutch sustained shall throw the unserviceable prop aside and stand erect exulting like a roe upon mount tabor frisking nimbly round on the soft verdant turf with wanton tread skimming along the surface of the plain or lightly bounding over the rising ground the dumb for melancholy silence framed cut off from friendly converse with mankind striving in vain the sad defect to mend with gabbring noise of broken syllables confused shall talk in dialects complete and tongues that knew not how to speak shall sing new scenes of joy shall gladden every face and universal peace overspread the land the glowing ground gaping with burning thirst shall greedily suck in the humid tide pouring from caverns of the craggy hills in limpid streams still warbling as they fall melodious murmurs down the ample glade and crystal springs refresh the thirsty land where heretofore the curling serpent lay in many a wily labyrinth selfrolld or swept deceitful over the dusty plain in horrid spires and many a towering maze the trembling reed shall wave his fringed top and the tall rush in slender spires uprise the swampy marsh shall its broad flag produce with bending willow sport of every wind and vegetable earth new bloom display delightful with prolific verdure clothed a wasteful desert now and barren soil a way shall be prepared a path direct marked out by line with an unerring hand even a straight path which god himself shall make it shall be called the way of holiness a way to sacred footsteps only known where the unhallowed shall no entrance find nor impious feet profane the sacred ground god shall attend the motions of the just watch over their steps and guide them as they go and none shall wander from the obvious path for who can err when god directs the way the rampant lion shall not wander there nor fiery tiger roaring for his prey nor prowling wolf that howls along the plain with the keen pangs of raging hunger stung nor surly bear in nebos mountains bred or carmels forest ranging merciless such as came furious from the neighboring groves of ancient bethel with voracious speed grinning destruction as they roamd along and flew the mockers of the good old seer but free and unmolested shall they walk whom heaven protects and god vouchsafes to guide the ransomed captives weary of the yoke the heavy yoke of long oppressive thrall shall cheerfully return to happier climes in melody break forth the gladdend heart that speaks deliverance and the voice of joy judah shall witness to the grateful song and faithful zion echo back the sound no signs of woe shall hang upon the cheek no shuddering fear nor horrible despair but grief with all its melancholy train of huge dismay

vol ii p     observed that the publication of this poem has been objected to but without sufficient reason the irony is so obvious that it cannot well be mistaken the fact was that a young officer a friend of mr brownes wanted to carry a mistress with him to his country quarters and he desired our author to write a copy of verses to persuade some lady of easy virtue to comply with his request mr brown wrote these verses which were designed as a strong ridicule and severe reproof of such kind of criminal connections and they produced an immediate effect for the young gentleman gave up all thoughts of his intended companion the whole must be considered as written in the character of a rakish officer during a time of profound peace bishop hoadly said that the verses would do more good

with success but he whose bounties only rise from prospects of a future prize with sorrow shall compute his gains and reap repentance for his pains precepts are often found to fail so take instruction from my tale in ancient days there lived a priest inshrind within whose pious breast fair virtue shone his open look gave sanction to each word he spoke fixed to no home in mean array from place to place he took his way instructing as he went along and dealing blessings to the throng the truth he labored to express in language plain as was his dress yet all with secret rapture hung on every accent of his tongue a silent eloquence there ran through all the actions of the man they marked his souls unblemished frame his precept and his life the same it chanced as musing once he strayed around him nights descending shade unheeded stole through paths unknown with darkling steps he wandered on and wished to shroud his weary head beneath some hospitable shed when through the gloom a sudden ray sprung forth and shot across the way led by the light a cott he found a pious dame the mansion owned whose open heart though small her store never turned the stranger from her door think at the sight of such a guest what transport rose within her breast with joy the friendly board she spread and placed him in her warmest bed deep sunk in sleep the travler lay tired with the labors of the day it is best as ablest critics deem to suit your language to your theme obsequious to their rules the muse in humbler strain her tale pursues the matron while her thankful guest had shared with her the slender feast with curious eye had viewed him over had marked the tattered garb he wore and through the yawning frieze had seen no traces of a shirt within and now her hands with pious care a shirt of homespun cloth prepare twas coarse but would the longer hold and serve to fence him from the cold the toil employed her all the night and ended with the rising light the priest arose at break of day and hastened to pursue his way with thanks he took the finished vest the hospitable dame he blessed and that thy charity he said may fall with interest on thy head may thy first work when i am gone continue till the setting sun she heard but soon her household care had banished from her thoughts the prayer the remnant of her cloth she took and measured out her little stock beneath her hands the lengthening piece surpised her with a vast increase astonished at a sight so new she measured still and still it grew as when in sleep with winged pace over hills and plains we urge the race with eager hopes we onward bend and think our labor near its end but mimic fancy soon supplies new scenes to cheat our wondering eyes before our feet new plains extend new valleys sink new hills ascend and still the goal when these are over appears as distant as before in such a dream with such surprise from morn to eve the woman plies her task but when the setting ray had closed her labor with the day with joy the wondrous heap surveyed and saw her bounty well repaid a neighboring dame the story known much wished to make the case her own for though she never was seen before to lodge the stranger or the poor she wisely thought on one so good her charity were well bestowed as by her door his journey lay she stopped the travler on his way begged him to enter and receive such welcome as her house could give the priest complied and entering found the board with various plenty crowned on heaps of down he passed the night and slumberd till the morning light at break of day the dame addressed in friendly guise her reverend guest linen so coarse she said was never designed for christian backs to wear and as it grieved her to survey such virtue in so mean array herself had toiled with sleepless eyes to furnish him with fresh supplies fine was the texture such as comes from wealthy hollands skilful looms the priest accepts the proffered boon he thanks her for her kindness shown and grateful as he leaves her door repeats the prayer he made before just parted from the holy man with eager haste the matron ran to reach her cloth and had designed to measure what was left behind but thinking first that as the prayer for the whole day had fixed her care one labor would employ it all and leave no time for natures call ere to the destined work she goes she deems it best to pluck a rose the hissing geese as forth she went gave omens of the dire event the herds that grazed the neighboring plain looked up and snuffd the coming rain the bird that screams at midnight hours diviner of approaching showers full on the left with hideous croak stood fluttering on a blasted oak amazement seized the trembling dame when first she saw the plenteous stream she wondered much and much she feared and think how niobe appeared when changed into a rock she stood and at her feet the headlong flood with downward force impetuous ran high foaming over the deluged plain so looked the dame when all around the torrent smoked upon the ground still spreading wider than before it seemed a sea without a shore your bards that wrote in heathen days had such a theme employed their lays had tortured their inventive brain with dire portents to fill the strain had bid the neighboring river mourn his altered stream and tainted urn or made the naiads lift their heads astonished from their watery beds and seated on the rivers side squeeze from their locks the briny tide but little skilled in pagan lore i pass such idle fancies over truth is my care whose lovely face shines brightest in the plainest dress at eve the torrent stopped its course stung with vexation and remorse the dame laments her fruitless cost her hopes deceived her labor lost nor think that here her sufferings end reproach and infamy attend surrounding boys wherever she came with insults loud divulge her shame and farmers stop her with demands of recompense for damaged lands the wish by the same how short is lifes uncertain space alas how quickly done how swift the wild precarious chase and yet how difficult the race how very hard to run youth stops at first its wilful ears to wisdoms prudent voice till now arrived to riper years experienced age worn out with cares repents its earlier choice what though its prospects now appear so pleasing and refined yet groundless hope and anxious fear by turns the busy moments share and prey upon the mind since then false joys our fancy cheat with hopes of real bliss ye guardian powers that rule my fate the only wish that i create is all comprised in this may i through lifes uncertain tide be still from pain exempt may all my wants be still supplied my state too low to admit of pride and yet above contempt but should your providence divine a greater bliss intend may

wood came where the industrious bees had stored in artful cells their luscious hoard oerjoyd they seized with eager haste luxurious on the rich repast alarmed at this the little crew about their ears vindictive flew the beasts unable to sustain the unequal combat quit the plain half blind with rage and mad with pain their native shelter they regain there sit and now discreeter grown too late their rashness they bemoan and this by dear experience gain that pleasures ever bought with pain so when the gilded baits of vice are placed before our longing eyes with greedy haste we snatch our fill and swallow down the latent ill but when experience opes our eyes away the fancied pleasure flies it flies but oh too late we find it leaves a real sting behind hymn to the creator by the same god of my health whose bounteous care first gave me power to move how shall my thankful heart declare the wonders of thy love while void of thought and sense i lay dust of my parent earth thy breath informed the sleeping clay and called me into birth from thee my parts their fashion took and ere my life begun within the volume of thy book were written one by one thy eye beheld in open view the yet unfinished plan the shadowy lines thy pencil drew and formed the future man oh may this frame that rising grew beneath thy plastic hands be studies ever to pursue whatever thy will commands the soul

at leisure i the beast surveyed extended in the cooling shade it is green it is green sir i assure ye   green cries the other in a fury  why sir  do you think i have lost my eyes twere no great loss the friend replies for if they always serve you thus you will find em but of little use so high at last the contest rose from words they almost came to blows when luckily came by a third  to him the question they referred and begged he would tell em if he knew whether the thing was green or blue sirs cries the umpire cease your pother  the creatures neither one nor the other i caught the animal last night and viewed it over by candlelight i marked it well  twas black as jet  you stare  but sirs i have got it yet and can produce it pray sir do i will lay my life the thing is blue and i will be sworn that when you have seen the reptile you will pronounce him green well then at once to ease the doubt replies the man i will turn him out and when before your eyes i have set him if you dont find him black i will eat him he said then full before their sight produced the beast and lo twas white  both stard the man looked wondrous wise  my children the camelion cries then first the creature

yorkshire dances to claim the great mans promise given some six years since or some say seven no one can blame that curious writer that says they will both return the lighter but can we hence affirm that no miss of all the sex can keep a promise or say from what our courtier speaks that all mens faiths are papercakes that courts make rogues is my belief as it is the mill that makes the thief but cause one limb is none of the best shall i for that cut off the rest sure it may be with safety said a parsons promise duly made beneath a prelates holy roof must stand against all assaults a proof yet he who thinks the church unshaken may find himself in time mistaken i know the man and grieve to say it who so did fail  and that was straight and can we then no more depend on our good forgetful

and tail are taught deceit from her not knowing where to eat the courtier too has some excuse to think wordbreaking small abuse and midst the hurry noise and bustle of crowds that at his levee jostle no man can be in such a taking to see a little promisebreaking but what indulgence what excuse can plead for thee or for thy muse for thee on whom the sisters wait pleased with the task imposed by

an eminent brewer  no better ever sat in a box to be sure his coach was kept clean and no mothers or nurses took that care of their babes that he took of his horses he had these  ay and fifty good

other goodnature as for that says the teacher goodnature and love and sweetness of temper are gifts from above and as coming from thence we should give em their due grace is a superior blessing it is true ay sir i remember an excellent sarment wherein all along you gave grace the preferment i shall never forget it as how you were telling that heaven resided where grace had its dwelling why john quoth the teacher that is true but alas what heaven can do is quite out of the case for by day and by night with the woman you wed it is you that must board and it is you that must bed and a

his obsequies the sickening sun shines dim and in the sight of gazing crowds resigns his waning light mark how he labors with relapse of night how his diminished face a crescent seems like cynthia newly silvered with his beams but as in full eclipse his light expires back to its source our gelid blood retires chilled with surprise our trembling joints unbrace and pale confusion sits on every face the bleating flocks no more the shepherds care stray from those folds to which they would repair home to his young the raven wings his way and leaves untasted his yet bleeding prey while towering larks their rival notes prolong they drop benighted in their morning song darkness and horror reign over earth and skies and nature for awhile with wharton dies o speak refulgent parent of the day with beamy eye who do the globe survey thou radiant source of wits diviner fire thou truest judge of what thou do inspire say have thou seen in any age or clime since thy bright race began to measure time so great a genius rise in every part so formed by nature finished so by art such manly sense with so much fire of mind judgment so strong to wit so lively joined no prepossession swayed his equal soul steady to truth she pointed as her pole convinced of varying in the least degrees her pliant index she reclaimed with ease early through customs and prescriptions yoke tyrants of weaker souls his reason broke good sense revering from the meanest hand he durst authority in robes withstand determined always on maturer thought still by new reasons to new measures brought firm but not stubborn thoughtful not involved swift to perform what slowly he resolved no tempests raged within his peaceful breast where kindling passion reason soon suppressed midst all events his firmness he maintained struggled with great but slighter ills disdained thus what philosophers could only preach his inborn virtue did in practice reach nature designed him master of address none knew it more nor seemed to know it less it worked like magic on your yielding heart sure was the charm but secret was the art in human nature most exactly learned the artful man he through his masque discerned with chosen baits that every temper take he knew of knave or fool good use to make his easy breeding free from form and rules that stiffen the civility of fools of various turn for all occasions fit was squared with judgment and well touched with wit free of access from affectation clean great without pride nor when familiar mean obliging always with goodnatured sense nor apt to give nor apt to take offense nor fond when kind nor harsh when most severe betwixt extremes he justly knew to steer in conversation wondrous was his art to guard his own and sift anothers heart to mirth and wit he led the cheerful way reservdly open and discreetly gay nor could the softest hour his secret soul betray bright as the youngest as the oldest wise in both extremes alike he gave surprise in body active yet his sprightly mind within that body felt herself confined  when thoughts important claimed no longer place then building planting and the speedy race paintings and books successive took their round no blanks of time were in his journal found skilled in the ends of his existence he to be unuseful thought was not to be polite his taste of arts but vain was art where nature had so greatly done her part through tiresome mediums we at truth arrive his easy knowledge seemed intuitive no copied beauties meanly formed his mind by heaven a great original designed the seeds of science in his blood were sown born with philosophy twas all his own the poet designed by this to cover the marquiss want of literature for he studied men and the world more than books  nor bribes nor threatnings could his zeal abate to serve his country and avert her fate firm to her laws and liberties he stood submitting private views to public good who could obsequious with the current swim whigs might be called but tories were to him persons or parties he no longer knew when swerving once from honest just and true often has he stemd the rage of impious times when patriot virtues bore the brand of crimes to check proud tyrants born and factions awe but most devoted to good kings and law twice his dear country was on ruins brink resolved to save her or with her to sink his brave attempts successful twice he saw once in wise brunswick once in great nassau no bolder champion in religions cause none fought more battles nor with more applause to arms he flew as danger pressed her home and snatched the hopeless prey from france and rome but as from conscience pure religion springs he freedom pressed in unessential things coercive laws he rightly understood might make men hypocrites but never good all genuine virtue is by nature free and will when forced no longer virtue be who justly would his eloquence declare ein se must whartons fertile genius share would you conceive it see how over the sands fair thames advances where augusta stands gentle he flows but with resistless force not like the rapid rhones impetuous course though deep so clear are his transparent streams his bottom rising to his surface seems full in his spreading current but restrained and still within its flowery banks contained alternate wealth his two extremes unfold downwards he sends us bread and upwards gold flow swiftest river still thy course prolong thus deep and clear thus gentle full and strong that distant ages may the image see of whartons flowing eloquence in thee so shall no torrents soil thy crystal stream thou patriots emblem and thou poets theme ye nobles who surround the british throne reflect its luster and improve your own you who resemble in rich robes of state that majesty august on which you wait witness how often his decisive sense his wit his art and copious eloquence have singly won the question on his side made oxford blush and st john drop his pride whilst every year was

ministers who sat with thee to guide the great machine of state a more consummate character could boast than that which britain in her wharton lost oh had kind heaven if prayers were not too late another lustrum added to his date how would his head his heart his hand conspire to punish traitors as their crimes require to crush rebellion bridle factious rage and quell the monsters of an impious

mantle from his musky wing the morn unbarrd the ambrosial gates of light westward the ravenpiniond darkness flew the landscape smiled in vernal beauty bright and to their graves the sullen ghosts withdrew the nightingale no longer swelled her throat with lovelorn plainings tremulous and slow and on the wings of silence ceased to float the gurgling notes of her melodious woe the god of sleep mysterious visions led in gay procession before the mental eye and my freed soul awhile her mansion fled to try her plumes for immortality through fields of air methought i took my flight through

wind pale want had withered every furrowed face bowed was each carcass with the weight of years and each sunk eyeball from its hollow case distilled cold rheums involuntary tears horsed on three staves they posted to the bourn of a drear island where the pendant brow of a rough rock shaggd horribly with thorn frowned on the boisterous waves which raged below deep in a gloomy grot remote from day where smiling comfort never showed her face where light never entered save one rueful ray discovring all the terrors of the place they held damned mystries with infernal state whilst ghastly specter glided slowly by the scritchowl screamd the dying call of fate and ravens croakd their baleful augury no human footstep cheered the dread abode nor sign of living creature could be seen save
