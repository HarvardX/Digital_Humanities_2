funnell mate to captain dampier  london printed by w botham for james knapton at the crown in st pauls church yard   0   to the honorable josiah burchett esquire secretary to his royal highness prince george of denmark lord highadmiral of england ireland etc sir having been employed on a voyage into the southseas under the command of capt dampier in the year   0  and having both in that expedition and in my return by the easternpart of the south sea and through the indianocean remarked not only faithfully but with all the accuracy i could whatever i conceived might be serviceable or instructive to such as should hereafter sail into those parts i hope you will pardon my presuption in laying my said observations before you  i humbly take the liberty to represent to you that i have launched forth into no descriptions or particular accounts of things which the course of my voyage gave me not sufficient opportunity to be fully and perfectedly instructed in and i spared no pains in the setting them down together with draughts of such places as i had time or convenience of taking and in all this i have not through any design of contradicting others or in hopes thereby to recommend my own performance either opposed or slighted any good and true observations which have already been made by those who have heretofore visited any of the same places this i presume to mention with a particular regard to the most material of captain dampiers own observations formerly published which i found by experience to be true but i hope i may without breach of modesty declare that i have remarked several things both new and useful which the uncommon course we steared and the unusual accidents we met with gave me particular opportunities to enquire into  sir i am not pretending to a meritorious claim of your protection but am encouraged to hope for it from your known candor and goodness and it is very natural to flatter our selves that persons of your judgment and experience in maritime affairs will look with a more favorable eye even on our meanest endeavors than those can be expected to do who know but little of those matters and are apt to prefer superficial accounts which are frequently very erroneous before the most useful though less diverting however it be if i can be so happy as to receive any countenance from your distinguishing judgment or at least your pardon for this my boldness i shall not fear that any opinion or prejudice of less discerning persons can discredit the truth or usefulness of my observations  i am sensible sir how little i ought to encroach upon your time which is so usefully and so diligently employed and therefore i humbly beg leave to conclude with subscribing my self  your honors most dutiful most obedient and most humble servant william funnell  the preface the voyages and descriptions formerly published by captain william dampier have met with so good reception and universal approbation in the world and there has been so general an expectation of the success of the present expedition under the command of a person so perfectly acquainted with those parts of the world to which we were bound and so well skilled in the trade shipping customs and designs of the spaniards against whom we were employed that i presume there needs no apology for publishing the following account  the success indeed of our expedition was not such as might at first have been expected from the skill of our commander and the resolution of our men disagreements and mismanagements having broken our measures and defeated our most promising hopes as they have often been occasions of the miscarriage of the greatest and noblest attempts  but though we failed in our chief designs yet the great variety of accidents we met with and the many discoveries we made and particular accounts of the manner how our attempts miscarried i hope cannot but be very acceptable to the inquisitive reader  i have chosen not to be large in the descriptions of towns and places of which others have already given us sufficient accounts but the whole western coast of america from the southend of california to the port of valdivia which is above sixty degrees i have given one continued and much more particular description of than has ever yet been made public and also i have given an exact account of the variation of the compass upon the whole coast and though it may perhaps by some be thought not so pleasant and entertaining as descriptions of the country within land yet it cannot but be much more useful especially to such as shall hereafter sail into those parts  and here i cannot in justice but take notice that upon all this coast and during our whole stay in the south seas we found captain dampiers descriptions of places very exact and his account of winds currents etc very extraordinary  after our parting from capt dampier in the gulf of amapalla and running over to india we met as with many hardships so also with some variety of new discoveries in our wandering among unknown spiceislands and particularly the misfortunes which necessitated us to put in at amboyna where we were detained prisoners by the dutch gave me an opportunity of making such enquiries into the state government product trade etc of that island as i persuade my self will be very acceptable to the ingenious reader  errata page lin read

off the sibbel de wards arrival at juan fernandos  we were at first two ships of twentysix guns and one hundred and twenty men each designed for the southseas the one was named the st george captain william dampier commander on board of which i was and the other was named the fame john pulling captain we were each of us supplied with all warlike stores and very well victualled for nine months and had commissions from his royal highness the lord highadmiral to proceed in a warlike manner against the french and spaniards and we both were upon the same terms of no purchase no pay but whilst we were in the downs there arising some difference between the two captains captain pulling in his ship the fame went away and left us intending as he said to go and cruize among the canaryislands and we never saw him after but before our going away from ireland we were joined by another ship sent after us on purpose she was a small ship named the cinque ports gally burden about ninety tuns sixteen guns and sixty three men charles pickering captain which ship was also very well victualled and provided for the said voyage our proposals were to go into the river of plate to buonas aires to take two or three spanish galleons which captain dampier gives an account are usually there and if by that expedition we got to the value of  00000 pounds then to return again without proceeding further but if we missed of success there then to cruize upon the coast of peru for the valdivia ships which commonly are said to bring down store of gold to lima but if that design should also fail then to attempt some rich towns according as captain dampier should think fit and after that we were at the usual time of the year to go down upon the coast of mexico to seek for a great galleon which trades from manila one of the philippine islands to acapulco on the coast of mexico and which is commonly reported to be worth thirteen or fourteen millions of pieces of eight the reason we did not go to buonas aires was because upon our arrival at madera we had advice that the galleons beforementioned were arrived at teneriff the success of our other designs are set down particularly in the following relation  th of april   0  we sailed out of the downs and on the    th of may anchored at kingsale in ireland here we refitted and victualled our ship and were joined by another ship named the cinque ports burden about ninety tuns sixteen guns and sixty three men charles pickering captain and on the   th of september we in company of our consort captain pckering left kingsale and on the   th we reached the island of madera where we did not anchor but lay off and on for our boats which were sent ashore for some necessaries by a good observation i make this island to lie in the latitude of    d  0 m n and longitude by my account from london w    d   m it is a very pleasant island inhabited by portugueze it abounds in corn wine honey sugar madder oranges lemons pomegranets etc  having done our business here we departed sept    and on the  0th saw palma and fero the two westermost of the canaryislands they being in all seven so called from canaria the chief they are also called fortunate from their fruitfulness being plentiful in several sorts of commodities but especially in the wine called canary brought from hence in abundance we did not stop here but made the best of our way for the cape de verde islands and october the  th saw the island of mayo lying in the latitude of    d  0 m n and longitude from london w    d    m the chief o what this island produces is salt o which here is plenty for fetching w ay off and on all night but could no october the seventh in the morning we bore away for the island st jago and at noon anchored at prior bay this bay lies in the latitude of    d  0 m n and west from london    d    m  this is one of the southermost and most fruitful of the cape de verde islands it abounding in hogs fowls guineahens monkies maiz oranges lemons dates watermelons plantains bonanoes etc here is good water to be had but troublesome fetching of it and wood is very dear by reason of its scarcity the natives of this place were formerly portugueze who were banished to this place for murders thefts and other villainies but now they are mostly black by reason of their converse amongst their womenslaves which are guinea negroes and although they have changed their color yet they still retain their vices thieving being commoner here than in any place i have been in insomuch that they will take your hat off your head at noonday although you be in the midst of company you must also be very wary how you trade with them for if you let them have your goods before you have theirs you will october we parted from the said island not fully resolved what place to touch at next on october the   d being in the latitude of   d    m n and longitude from london w about    d    m we caught four fish a shark a dolphin a jellyfish and an oldwife  the shark see fig i is a very ravenous sort of fish those that we catch at sea are commonly about five or six feet in length they have a great wide moh with three and sometimes four rows of teeth very sharp and jagged like a saw it is so fierce a fish that when it wants its prey it will seize upon any thing and make nothing of taking off a mans leg at a bite or two he has two stones between his eyes which are accounted very good if taken inwardly by any one that has the stone or gravel these stones we commonly take out and give to our doctor who makes use of them as he finds occasion when they are taken out of the head depiction of shark fig   a shark drawn on his back being the posture he is in when he takes his prey his mouth not appearing in any other posture depiction of dolphins fig     dolphins   the dolphin see fig ii is between four and five feet in length some more some less it is a very pretty colored fish and very good to eat but something dry they feed mostly upon flyingfish a sort of fish about the bigness of an ordinary herring and much like one the dolphins are so nimble as to catch them when they light in the water to wet their wings or rather fins for they can fly no longer than their wings are wet but then fall into the water and mount again it is very pretty to see what shifts and turns they will make to get clear of their great enemy the dolphin and rather than be taken by them they will often fly into a ship but when they are in unless they happen to fall into a puddle of water they cannot fly out again for want of moisture in their wings  jellyfish see fig iii was about fourteen inches long and about   inches deep with a very sharp set of teeth a very curious sparkling eye a long extended mouth a monstrous high fin on his back being of a slimy substance only the ribs which stretched it out being thirty two in number were firm and stiff he had one small fin under his jaw of the same slimy substance that part of him which is without small spots is a perfect green jelly whence he was called by us a jellyfish the rest of him was firm of a silver color with small spots and streaks or partings as is expressed in the figure  the oldwife see fig iv was a fish about two foot long and   inches high he has a small mouth a large eye a great fin on his back beginning at the hinder part of his head and stretching to his tail he has a large broad fin on each side near the gills with one pretty large one under his belly his body is of a deep blue and his fins of a very light blue the ends of which are yellow his body and head have a great many spots and cross streaks or partings as is expressed in the fig there is also another sort of oldwife such as is described by captain dampier in his third volume  on november   d   0  we

ill of a fever november    we anchored at the islands st anns which by my account lie in the latitude of    d  0 m   longitude w from london    d    m and we reckon here about  0 d easterly variation we went ashore here intending to wood and water but could find no water so we cut a longboatload of wood and came on board again and got up our anchors intending to wood and water at the iland le grand  anns not above a stones cast from each other they are very full of wood as is all the brasilian coast these islands are distant from the main about four miles this place is very much troubled with southerly winds which blow extraordinarily in gusts therefore the only way is to lay your best anchor to the southward and all little enough sometimes the islands produce nothing but wood and have a vast many seafowl upon them by sailours called boobies see a draught of the three islands of st anns see fig v   the booby see fig vi is much about the bigness of a duck some are quite white some gray they have feet like a duck being a waterfoul they feed mostly upon flyingfish which they catch flying i have made many a meal of this sort of birds but it was for want of other victuals they taste very fishy and if you do not salt them very well before you eat them they will make you sick they are so silly that when they are weary of flying they will if you hold out your hand come and sit upon it from thence i conjecture that they are called boobies  november    th we anchored at the island le grand whose latitude is    d  0 m s longitude from london w  0 d    m and found here about    d e variation map of part of brazil fig   part of brazile the great and small bay of le grande part of brazile etc  see fig vii this is a very woody island and has several very good springs of fresh water upon it the soil is black and the island is about nine leagues round and distant from the main about three miles it is not inhabited by any other than jaccals lions tigers etc which in the night make a most hideous noise enough to terrify any man about three miles from this place is the main land all very mountainous and woody where is a small town of the portugueze called by the name of le grand town who come out of the country for forty or fifty miles round on saint andrews day to pay their devotions to that saint here being a small church consecrated to his use they abide here about fourteen days and then return to their own dwellings here is rum sugar and several sorts of indian fruits to be had but very dear by reason of their supplying the town of st pauls with these necessaries near which town is said to be a goldmine accounted one of the richest yet known it is distant from the town of le grand about three hundred miles and is reckoned by reason of the difficulty of the way and the vast high mountains that intercept the passage to be sixty days journey at this place we wooded watered and refitted our ship here our first lieutenant with eight of charles pickering captain of the cinque ports our consort another main pillar of our voyage departed this life and his body was buried ashore at the wateringplace with the usual ceremony of firing of guns and mr tho stradling his lieutenant took command of his ship here is good fishing with the saine fish being very plentiful and of various sorts as the silverfish and several others  the silverfish see fig viii is about twenty inches long in height from the top of his head to the bottom of his belly eight inches he has five small fins on the hinderpart of his head and one large one reaching from the hindermost of the five small ones to the tail he has two midling ones one on each side near the gills and one large one stretching from the middle of the bottom of his belly to his tail which is halfmooned he has a large eye a wide pair of nostrils and a small mouth it is a very thin fish and very bony he is of a fine transparent white and thence called by us a silverfish

i suppose to be his having made longer runs in that voyage and so more liable to mistakes of this nature whether there be any water upon these islands i know not but never did hear of any from the time of our passing the latitude of  0 d s we saw a great many birds about the ship and when we were off the sibbil de ward islands we took one remarkable bird which we see fig ix his bill was yellow

stradling in the cinque ports who had been arrived three days before so we anchored in the little bay in twelve fathom water oazy ground but finding it not convenient lying here we weighed and went to

tree is so high and there is not any thing to hold by so that a man would find it a hard matter to get up for i have seen some of these trees after we we have cut them down which we always do to get the cabbage to be ninety or a hundred feet in length  there are in this island a great many wildcats of the finest color i ever saw which were put ashore here as i suppose by the spaniards to destroy the goats but their project has not taken effect for here are vast numbers of goals the old ones both male and female take turns to guard their young so that the cats durst not venture upon the young the old ones being always their guard i wonder the spaniards should think that by setting cats ashore here they should destroy the goats when at the same time there are such vast numbers of seals both young spaniards for the same intent but never saw any yet if they were i am apt to believe they would rather prey upon the seals than the goats  of goats as i said before here is great plenty and especially toward the west part of the island they resort thither by reason there is better pasture for them of these goats we used to get store and a joint of one of them roasted with about half a foot of our cabbage boiled makes a very good meal i have heard captain martin tell of some french pirates who were in these seas that having been sometime cruizing up and down and no meeting with a sufficient booty and being every where discovered by the spaniards and out of hopes of getting any more they concluded to come to this island o juan fernandos they being twenty in number and there to lie nine or ten months which accordingly they did and landed on the west side of the island then drew there little armadilla ashore and in a small time brought the goats t be so tame as that they would many o them come of themselves to be milked of which milk they made good butter an peru and off the bay of arica met with a spanish ship and took her in which was said to be two hundred thousand pieces of eight with about the value of half as much more in gold double doubloons  birds here are few or none of note except the hummingbird which is about the bigness of a be it has a bill no bigger than an ordinary pin his legs are small but in proportion to his bulk his feathers are very small and mostly black we seldom used to catch or see these birds unless toward evening and then they would come humming about us but if it was dark and we had a fire before morning we should have a hundred of them fly into the fire  of the sea inhabitants here are seals in such abundance that without driving them away there is no going ashore here are also a great many sealyons and for cavallies silverfish groopers breams and crawfish here is such great plenty that it is almost incredible  the sealyon is so called as i conjecture because his roaring is not unlike  the seals are much of the same kind only their heads are like a hounds they howl like dogs when old and bark like them when young they have a very fine furr the finest next the sable i ever saw some of them are of a bright silvercolour some of a chestnut they feed as the sealion being both amphibious creatures and sleep like them only when they go their hinder as well as forefins  the silverfish here see fig xii is quite different from those at brasil both in shape and substance this having but six fins viz four large ones two upon his back and two opposite under his belly and one small one on each side near his gills it has a small eye and a great bottlenose it is a very fleshy fish and the flesh is extraordinary white and good they are commonly about twelve or thirteen inches long and about seven inches deep with a halfmooned tail as is expressed in the figure  february the   th   0  at noon we saw a sail so we got on board all our people got up our yards and topmasts and he being pretty near we clapped our longboat on our moorings let slip and got under sail he seeing us get under sail tackt and stood from us and we made the best of our way after him and our consort made what haste he could after us and about eleven at night we came close up with him but did not think convenient to engage till day in this chase our pinnace towed under water so we cut her loose captain stradlings boat also broke loose and in her was a man and a dog at sunrise the next morning being march the  st we began to engage the said ship which was a french ship of about four hundred tuns and thirty guns wellmannd we fought her very close broadside and broadside for seven hours and then a small gale springing up she sheard off as for our consort he fired about ten or twelve guns and then fell a stern and never came up again during the fight we had nine of our men killed in the fight and several wounded we were desirous to have the other trial with him knowing it would be of dangerous consequence to let him go for if we did we were sure he would discover us to the spaniards which would spaniards should know of our being in those seas and so should hinder their merchantships from coming out yet that he knew where to go and could not fail of taking to the value of  00000 l any day in the year upon this we lay by for our consort who soon came up and it was quickly agreed between the two captains to let her go so the enemy stood from us i suppose very well satisfied that he had disappointed us both and we were very much dissatisfied that we should suffer our selves to be so baffled in our first attempt but however since it was so we concluded to return to juan fernandos to get our anchors cables longboats and several tun of water casked with a tun of sealions oil which we had left there and captain stradling had left five of his men who were gone to the west part of the island and knew nothing of our going out after the enemy he had also left behind him all his sails except those at the yards with a great many other stores accordingly we stood away toward the said island and on the  d saw the island bearing south distant about nine or ten leagues we had then the wind at south right off the land so that we found it cinque ports put out her oars and rowed toward the island presently after which we saw two sail the cinque ports was pretty near them and they fired at her several shots but she rowed away to us and gave us an account that they were two french ships each of about thirty six guns so the two captains thought it convenient not to go in but to go away for the coast of peru leaving behind capt stradlings five men with other necessaries that we could ill spare for now we had neither of us any boats however according to their agreement on march the  th we stood away for the coast of peru and on the   th fell in with the land it being very high three rows of hills one within another that toward the water lowest and that toward the land highest we were then in the latitude of    d    m s from thence we coasted along shore to the northward and on the   th past by the port of copiapo whose latitude is    d 00 m s we observed here and found the variation by az th compass to be   d  0 m easterly  this is said to be a very good port and to be fenced from almost all winds near to the port are four or five rocks and within land it is inhahited by indians who coquimbo we would very willingly have gone ashore here to have got some refreshment but could not for want of boats the land continues to be very high and mountainous so that i think it is the highest land i ever saw we kept still cruizing down along shore  the   th instant our men being all at dinner and our ship about ten leagues off shore going with a fine fresh gale of wind at east we were suddenly surprised with the change of the color of the water which looked as red as blood to as great a distance as we could see which might be about seven or eight leagues at first we were mightily surprised but recollecting our selves we sounded but had no ground at one hundred and seventy fathom we then drew some water up in buckets and poured some into a glass it still continued to look very red till about a quarter of an hour after it had been in the glass when all the red substance floated at top and the water underneath was as clear as usual the red which floated at top was of a slimy substance with little knobs and we all concluded it could be nothing but the spawn viz arica ylo and attiquipa  the port of arica is in the latitude of    d  0 m s longitude from london by my account w    d  0 m and just off it we found   d    m easterly variation this port of arica is a very good port and it is the embarcado to most of the minetowns of peru it is a place of vast trade and extraordinarily wellpeopled it is said to be seldom without shipping although we saw none there at our passing by on the south side of the harbor is a pretty town situated on each side of a river called after the name of the town of arica and near the town is a great mountain called the mountain of arica under which the shipping commonly lie in eight fathom water and at the other end of the bay is another mountain called the mountain of sama under which mountain are four whitish cliffs and between the two mounts of sama and arica are three rivers the northermost is called the river of sama the middlemost the river of john deus and as i said before the other the river of arica on the banks of which the said town is situated see fig xiii as we past by i took a draught ylo and attiquipa i shall say little of them till i come to speak of them in my description of the coast of chili peru and mexico  from the latitude of    d    m s where we met the red water we kept still standing away to the northward and on the   d of march found our selves just off lima the capital city of the two great empires of peru and chili here we furled all our sails to our mainsail because we would not be seen by the spaniards and laid our ship by intending to watch all ships going in or out at five in the morning we made sail again and before we were aware had like to have been upon the rocks of ormigas these rocks are distant from the island calan which is the port for lima about eight leagues and they bear from each other s s e and n n w they are large rocks and in the middle of them are some bays about which is said to be abundance of good fish so that the fishermen come to these rocks a fishing here they likewise make abundance of seafishoil having narrowly escaped these rocks we stood away to the northward and soon descryed two sail we presently made a clear ship and gave chase and soon came up with the sternmost she proved to be the ship we fought with off the island juan fernandos and was now just off the port of lima into which she was bound to trade we were very eager to stop her going in for if we could it would hinder the spaniards from having intelligence of us besides we did not question the taking of her because now our men were all in health whereas when we fought her before we had between twenty and thirty men very sick and weak but being willing to show themselves they had done what good they could we knew also if we took her that she must needs prove a good prize and her guns ammunition and provisions would have been very welcome to us so we concluded to engage her our selves and to send captain stradling after the other which seemed not so big but our captain thought it not advisable to venture upon her and whilst the matter was disputing the two ships got into lima from whence i question whether twenty such ships as ours could have forced them out  being therefore very much discontented we again stood along shore to the northward and the next day in the morning being march the   th we saw a sail which we gave chase to and came up with her and took her without any resistance she spanish ship of about   0 tuns laden as far as we could perceive with snuff flanderslace vvoollencloth wrought and unwrought silk pitch tar tobacco turtleshell beeswax soap cinnamon jamaica pepper jars of balsom of peru a few planks and a pretty good sum of money we kept her with us till march the  0th and then having taken out a little of every thing our captain discharged her alleging that if we kept her it would be a hindrance to his greater designs we were forced to be as well content as we could so they stood for lima whereunto they were bound and we stood along shore to the northward and the next morning by break of day we found our selves just aboard of a strange ship which we soon took not firing above   guns she was a new ship of about two hundred tuns and sailed very well considering her built she was laden with several very good commodities as indico cochineel etc we were now just off the port of paita whose latitude is   d    m south its longitude from london i reckon to be west    d    m and we found variation by a good amplitude just off the harbor   d    m vvesterly a further description of the coasts i took a draught as we lay off the harbor april this second prize after we had taken out a few odd things was contrary to most of our minds dismissed the captain alleging that he would not cumber up his ship for that he intended to make a voyage at one stroke upon some rich town on which he had a speedy design  on the fifth of april we began to prepare for our intended action our carpenters fixing our two launches or spanish longboats with two patereroes to each launch on the   th being just in sight of the island gallo which at a distance looks like three islands we saw a sail came up with her and soon took her she was a bark of about fifty tuns laden with plank and had a considerable quantity of turtleshell on board at first sight of us their men had all took to their boat and got ashore this bark our captain intended to keep for the design in hand and the next day being april the   th we anchored at the island gallo see fig xiv whose latitude is   d    m northward longitude from london w    d    m and we found variation   d westerly  it is distant from the main about five leagues it is in length about two segnetta is the best anchoring here peru here are some few wild monkies with abundance of lizards and a large sort of lizard called a lionlizard  they are about the bigness of a mans arm i measured one which from the head to the end of the tail was three foot eleven inches he has a large sort of a comb upon his head which stands up like a helmet or headpiece to defend his head when he is assaulted or frightened he sets his comb up an end but otherwise it lies down flat in a deep dent in his head just fitted to it so that when it is down it can hardly be perceived he has two very large eyes a large mouth with a great many fine small sharp teeth his skin is very tough of a sad color full of black yellow and blueish spots in all other things he resembles the common lizard when they are pursued they will run very swift yet our dog used often to catch them about six leagues to the s s w of this island is a small island or rather rock called gorgonilla tumaco hereabouts upon the main are a great many rivers which make the currents very uncertain about this island  on april the   th having lain here five days just as we were going to get up our anchors we saw a sail standin for the island so we lay still till she was pretty near in and then we all three got under sail viz our selves the cinqueports and a small spanish bark whom we took six days before she stood boldly to us and we soon contrary to their expectation made a prize of them they were going for the river tumaco to get some provisions there but as they past by seeing us and not hearing of an enemys being in the seas but thinking us to be spaniards they made toward us being in hopes to get some provisions of us for their money but on the contrary they lost both themselves their vessel and money she was a small vessel of about fifty tuns in her balast commanded by an half indian they had on board a guernsey man whose name i have forgot he was taken in the bay of campeachy having strayed from his companions cutting of logwood he was sent prisoner to mexico where after he had been imprisoned for two years upon his turning roman catholic he was at liberty either mexico or to go aboard any ship belonging to the spaniards in the south seas but they would not let him come any nearer the north sea for fear he should make his escape so he being a seafaring man thought it most convenient to go on board some ship where we found him he was very glad he was released from the spaniards for had we not met with him he must probably have continued there all days of his life  chap iii departure from gallo design upon the town of sancta maria cape corrientes point garachina attempt upon santa maria how it miscarried a prize taken very seasonably when we were in great want of provisions the two captains part company the island

dangerous sea fight point gallera the bay of tacames cocotree and nut described plantain described bonanoes described the bay of st matthew departure from the bay of tacames for the gulf of nicoya  from gallo we stood along to the northward our captain letting us know that his design was upon the town of santa maria where we did not question but to get gold enough because it is the first place that they send all the gold to which they dig out of mines not far from santa maria the last vessel we took sailing very heavy and knowing it would be a hinderance to our design we sunk her the captain of her after some fair promises that we would give him a better and that if we succeeded in our attempt on the town of santa maria we would satisfy him otherwise to his hearts content promised he would be our pilot up to santa maria so preparing for our intended enterprise we sailed along shore to the northward and in our way passed by cape corrientes and several other noted places  this cape corrientes lies in the latitude of   d n it is a very high land and when you are at sea it looks like an island by reason the land near it at the sea side is not so high on the top of the capeland are three hillocks it is a very good coast and clear from rocks and shoals and almost steep from hence we proceeded on for point garachina since we left the island of gallo we had fine fresh gales of wind commonly at s w and s s w on the   th of april having past by several good ports as port santa clara port quemado port pinas and several others of which i shall speak in my description of the coasts we anchored at point garachina in eighteen fathom water claiey ground distant from the point two miles  i make this point of garachina see fig xv to lie in the latitude of   d  0 m n and distant from port pinas seven leagues and from the island gallera six leagues n w you may sail very well between the island gallera and the main but have a great care of a shoal of sand which lies middway and on which many good ships have been lost but it is something dangerous to sail between the island gallera and the kings islands for there are many rocks and if the water should abate you must of necessity return to point garachina point garachina makes the south point of the gulf of st michael as cape st laurenzo makes the north  into this gulf we were bound so having laid here two days on the   th one hundred and two of our men with captain dampier and captain stradling in our bark with three spanish launches went from our ships which we left at point garachina with sixty men to guard them with positive orders not to remove from the place where we left them till our return and we proceeded on our intended expedition for santa maria at eight at night we anchored depiction

board but they answered they would not so our captain ordered them to be fired at which accordingly was done whereupon they made what haste they could from us one of our lanches was sent after her but in vain for they soon got from us this was of ill consequence for we were sure they would discover us to the spaniards at santa maria who we knew if they heard of an enemy so near them would not only lay ambuscades to annoy us going up the river but which was worst of all would carry all that was valuable out of the town so two of our lanches were immediately sent away with twenty two hands each captain stradling indian pilot to take the town of schuchadero and captain dampier and we in the bark were to follow as soon as the tide served just as our two lanches entered the river of santa maria they saw a canoa with three indians come out of the river congo whereupon our men put in behind a point of land in the river just by the entrance so that the indians in the canoa not having seen them were upon them before they suspected any thing and our men immediately stepped out and seized them it growing now toward even they took one of the prisoners into the lanch and sent the other two in the canoa with five of our men to seek the town of schuchadero which our captain told them was on the northside of the river and about three leagues within the mouth but it being dark they could not find it however they heard the barking of a great many dogs on the other side the river whence concluding there must be some town they immediately put over for the other side as soon as they approached near the town the two indians which were in the canoa with our five men for the outscout jumped overboard and we lost them immediately one of our men in the canoa snatched up his gun and fired at one of the indians whether etc but little else the next morning being april the   th captain stradling sent the canoa to see for us in the bark for after they were gone to take the town as soon as the tide of flood began we got under sail intending to be soon after them but mistaking the riversmouth we ran past it and not finding any other way to go in we came to an anchor and so were forced to lie all night and the next day till noon the time of the seabreeze at which time we met a canoa coming out which at first we suspected to be enemies but found they were our own men who gave us an account of the taking of the indian town aforesaid and that in the canoa they took a packet of letters the letters were immediately opened and in them was found as follows from the president of to the governor of the town of santa maria that this was to let him know he had advice that two hundred and fifty english from jamaica had landed on the northside of the isthmus and had a design upon the said town of santa maria and that it was seven days since he had sent four hundred soldiers to reinforce them at santa maria and that he did not question but by the time he received the letters they would be with him that he would have him always keep himself upon his guard till this advice was either disproved or confirmed by that time we had read this packet we were up as high as the town that we took which we called schuchadero there being another of the same name on the northside against it and came to an anchor just in four fathom water the next day in the afternoon which was april the  0th captain dampier and captain stradling with three launches and the canoa with eighty seven of our men proceeded for santa maria and our chief mate and my self with thirteen hands were left to guard the bark with orders not to stir from the place where we lay till our mens return which was soon afterward for about twelve this night they returned on board frustrated of their design our men gave us an account that they were up within a quarter of a mile of the town that they dampier advised that since the spaniards knew of our coming and had had so much time as to provide ambuscades for us it could not be doubted but they had made the best use of their time and had taken care to convey their wives and children and all that was valuable out of the town which is always the first thing they do when they hear of an enemy so it was resolved to return to us at schuchadero and on may the   st betimes in the morning we left schuchadero and went down the river in order to return on board our ships which we left at anchor at point garachina  at our return on board may the   th we were so scant of provisions that there were five green plantains ordered to be boiled for every six men but to our great comfort when we were almost at our witsend we descried a sail at    this night who came to an anchor close by us we soon got up our anchor and took her without any resistance this was a great ship of about   0 tuns she was deeply laden with flower sugar brandy wine about  0 tuns of marmalet of quinces a considerable quantity of salt dampier and our ships company and the master of the cinqueports was put on board as chief for captain stradling and their ships company then we sunk our bark which had carried us up to santa maria and with our two ships and great prize stood across the bay of panama to the westward amongst the kings or pearl islands may the   th we saw the kings island bearing n did   leagues the   th we anchored in the bay of panama the island tabago bearing n did   leagues the kings island e s e did   leagues the   th we weighed and ran nearer to the island tabago and brought it to bear n by e did three leagues here we anchored on purpose to romage our prize the   th   th   th and   th we continued taking provisions out of her as wine brandy sugar flower etc and on the   th a small bark of about  0 tuns coming in sight we sent our longboat and canoa and took her she had little in her only a small quantity of money this bark captain stradling kept for his own use  here our captain and captain stradling having some disagreement concluded stradling and five of his came to us we were told by the prisoners that there were  0000 dollars on board our prize that they were taken in by stealth at lima and lay at the bottom in the run of the ship our captain did not believe this and was unwilling to tarry longer that we might have romaged her to the bottom because he thought loss of time would spoil his greater designs having therefore taken out a quantity of provisions she was dismissed and we on the   th of may parted from the cinque ports intending to beat up upon the coast of peru again and this day passed by the island iguanos  this island is not very high it is very vvoody and has a very good anchoringplace over against the main land in    fathom water here is also very good fresh water and if occasion be you may haul your ship ashore and clean for the water rises and falls ten or eleven foot and on the landside is good sandy ground this will defend you from the s e for these winds often blow very hard the marks of this island are that to the s w is puntamala or bad point you must not puntamala we stood away to the southward for the coast of peru and on the twenty ninth of may we saw land which proved to be the island of gallo from puntamala and during our stay in the bay of panama we had for the most part dirty squally weather with much thunder and lightning and very uncertain gales but mostly between the south and the west we stood off and on for five days endeavoring to weather the island gallo but here being a strong current setting to the northward we found it difficult to do yet after much turning on the  th of june we weathered it and proceeded along the shore for the coast of peru  on june the  th we saw a sail gave chase came up with her and took her she was about  00 tuns came from truxillo and was bound for panama laden with flower sugar brandy etc with some bales of wrought silk in her we took a packet which we opened the first letter we happened to read was from the captain of the french ship we fought off the island juan fernandos and met with again off the port of lima it was directed to the president of panama and gave an he fought two english privateers off the island j fernandoes that the smallest of the two fired but eight or ten guns at him and then fell astern and did not come up again during the fight as he believed for want of wind that the great ship meaning us fought him broadside and broadside for more than six hours that we killed them a great many men and that at his coming to lima he sent ashore thirty two of his men each of which had either lost a leg or an arm or an eye and that it was a great chance we had not taken him for that at our parting they had given themselves over as lost not having men to defend themselves we also had account by other letters that the two frenchmen which we saw off the island juan fernandos had met with a boat at sea in which there was an englishman and a dog this was the boat which belonged to captain stradling and which broke loose from him as we chased the french ship off juan fernandos that the said two french ships had been in at juan fernandos and had taken up our anchors cables longboat with all captain stradlings stores and his five men and our negro which was left there we also had advice that the spaniards had fitted out two men of war against us the one of    brass guns    pounders each the other of    guns of the some bigness guiaquil between point st hellena and cape blanco from the  th to the   th we were forced to go away with an easy sail because of our prize who sailed very heavy and seeing it was likely to be a great hindrance to us in beating to windward we concluded to go into some place to romage her accordingly on the   th we went into sardinas bay and anchored with our prize in ten fathom water about four miles off shore we durst not venture any further in by reason of so many shoals and banks of sand which lie off it the seacoast here is inhabited by indians but they are not very numerous here are several small rivers which run with fresh water down to the seaside and from this place by the seaside all along to the southward till you come to the bay of tacames are white cliffs and many shoals as far as to point gallera  from this bay of sardinas six leagues to the southward is the great river of st jago the mouth of which is said to be  of a mile over but in it is no good anchoring until you are got well within the mouth and if you must needs go into the river keep near the land on the south side this river is seldom made use of by shipping it lying out of the way sardinas wherein we careend our ship and romaged our prize and watered at one of the fresh water rivers the water of which was white like milk and both smelt and tasted very strong of musk occasioned by the many alligators swimming in the river  we shot several of them one of which measured thirty feet in length and was bigger about than a large bullock he is very full of great scales from the neck to the end of his tail he has a very large sharp set of teeth with very long claws on his feet it is an amphibious creature living on land as well as in the water when they are lying on shore they look like a great fallen down tree and for such one would take them at a distance they will run very fast on the land and are of such strength that they will take a horse or cow and carry it down to the water and there devour it they will seize on any thing as well on land as in the water and commonly make great havoc amongst cattle if there be any near the place where they harbor which is commonly in fresh water rivers indians are not greatly afraid of them neither in the water nor on land if they are pursued by them on land they run in a circle and this great creature is not able to turn his unweildy body so quick but that they easily get from him the indians likewise go into the water to seek them with a piece of iron like a harpoon at both ends and two pieces of iron across this they hold by the middle in their hand and the alligators when they bite raise their head out of the water  then the indians hold out this piece of iron to them at which they bite and it fastens in their mouth and keeps it open like a gag these creatures lay eggs about a hundred at a time their eggs are about the bigness of a gooses but the shell is almost as thick as an ostridges i have seen many of them they are quite round although captain dampier in vol ii part ii page    says that these eggs are longer than a gooses which i suppose he took only upon hearfay the flesh of the alligators is not fit to be eaten it being very strong and musky nay the very water of the rivers which they were in tasted so strong of them that is of musk that a draught of it would almost suffocate us by the rivers side here were about fourteen or fifteen indian fishermens houses who as i suppose  on the   th having done all our business here and dismissed our prize after having taken a few odd things out we departed from this place and stood to the southward for the coast of peru and the prize stood to the northward for panama being the place whereto she was bound the   st we saw a sail being then off cape st francisco but in the night lost her again this cape st francisco is a high cape but far higher within land than it is near the waterside when you are north or south from it it seems like three capes it is a woody mountainous land and has white cliffs it lies in the latitude of   d n longitude from london west    d  0 m and we found the variation to be   degrees    min westerly on the   th we saw the sail we had seen the other day we soon came up with her and took her she was a small bark of about forty five tuns came from ria lexa and was bound for guiaquill laden with pitch tar and cordage and after we had taken out a small quantity of each she was dismissed on the  th of july we saw the island of plata bearing e s f distance five leagues this island lies in the latitude of d laurenzo s e it is a pretty high island but highest at the north end at some time of the year here is said to be plenty of very good turtle and on it are some small trees or rather bushes not fit for any use it is all round steep rocks unless near the anchoring place which is on the east side and at both the north and south points there are small steep rocks and shoals which stretch out into the sea for a mile or two upon this island is said to be no fresh water  from hence we stood to the southward and on the   th fell in with point saint hellena this point is distant from the island of plata eighteen leagues it is high land and at a distance looks like an island because the land to the northward is lower than it this point is the north point of the bay of guiaquil as cape blanco is the south point in this bay is the great town or city of guiaquil which is said to consist of nine hundred and fifty spanish houses besides indians and to have five parish churches besides private chapels it has a governor who is next to the president of panama although under none but the viceroy of peru it is said to be pretty well fortified to hinder the approach of an enemy having two forts the one standing at  on the   st we saw a sail and stood toward her and next day being july the   d came up with her she proved to be one of the spanish men of war which was fitted out on purpose to take us this was the ship of thirty two guns we being pretty near each other they gave us a broadside but we did not mind them all our care was to get the weathergage in order to which while we carried too much sail and the wind blew very fresh our foretop mast unfortunately came by the board immediately we got our hatchets and cut all clear way and our captain ordered the helm to be clapped a weather and bore away the enemy seeing this immediately bore away after us with all the sail they could hoping to come up and take us for now they doubted not but they should take us we observing that our running had increased their courage resolved thereupon to lie by and fight it out captain dampiers opinion was that we could sail better upon one mast than the enemy and therefore that it was best to put before the wind but however we being embayed chose rather to fight than to be chased ashore so hoisting the bloody flag at our maintopmast head with a peru and told us he designed to go into the bay of tacames where he did not doubt but we should get provision enough for now we had little besides flower we were pretty well contented and stood away for the said bay and on the   th of july we passed by the point of gallera  this point is low toward the seaside and plain even ground on the top you must steer n e keeping off from it about a mile to leeward by reason of a shoal which lies off it which shoal is full of rocks and stones and lies all hid under water and in the point is a bay of sand which you may see when you come in with your ship within the point and coming over the said bay you will see a little lake of fresh water running into the sea and when the tide is at the highest the salt water runs into it wherefore if you would take in fresh water here you must take care to go to the right of the said spring and you will come to the head of it where you will find excellent good water in a pond near unto a pleasant grove of trees about a musket shot within land but you must be sure to go well indians who are always at war with the spaniards and will rob and kill any white men thinking all white men to be spaniards here is said to be abundance of ostridges and wild asses  we passed by this point of gallera and the same day anchored in the bay of tacames which was the place whereto we were bound and is distant from the point of gallera between two and three leagues we anchored at this tacames in six fathom water point gallera bearing vv s vv distant between two and three leagues at our coming in we sent our boat ashore with twenty men armed hoping to get some provisions but the inhabitants having notice of an enemys being in those seas as soon as they saw us drove the cattle from the vvaterside up into the country and they themselves retired to the mountains with their wives and children and all they had so our men went into the village which consisted of about fifty indian houses deserted by the inhabitants here in the river we found a bark upon the stocks a building of about fifty tuns with new plank enough by her to build another and we took another small bark of about ten tuns laden with plantains this bark we intended dragon  the road on the coast of tacames is lower land than the bay of st matthew it is indifferent clear ground but not very deep where you may anchor near the mount and if you do not like to anchor near the mount you may anchor where you will by the main land on the vveatherside and there is water enough and no danger and if you send your boat ashore you may supply your self with both vvood and water in the river are pleasant groves of trees and it has in the entry of it a little rock the landmarks of the river are that the land on the leeside is high and you may see a white spot on it like a white sheet  to the northward eight leagues is the bay of st matthew in this bay is a large river the breadth of which is three quarters of a mile but till you get within the mouth you will find no good anchorground if you would go into it keep near the land on the vveather or south side this river is seldom used by the spaniards but only for refreshment for there is plenty of all sorts of provisions and if their ships be out of repair they can here have them repaired two leagues indian people who sell to the spaniards when they come here all sorts of fruits as coconuts plantains bonanoes etc  the coconuttrees are from  0 to  0  0  0 and  00 foot in height mostly slender and straight they have leaves some four fathom and four fathom and a half long and produce a nut called a coconut which with the outer rind on is bigger than any mans head the outer rind being taken off there appears a shell some of which will hold near a quart within the shell is the nut and within the nut is about a pint and a half of pure clear water which is very cool brisk pleasant and sweet the kernel of the nut is also very good which if it be pretty old we scrape all to pieces the scrapings we set to soak in about a quart of fresh water for three or four hours and then strain the water which when strained has both the color and taste of milk and if it stand a while it will have a thick scum on it not unlike cream this milk being boiled with rice is accounted by our doctors to be very nourishing for which reason we often give o it to our sick men the leaves of the tree serve to thatch houses the outer rind of the nut to make linen cloth of it they also make ropes for ships a etc which are a good commodity in most places of the east indies the shell of the nut will make very pretty drinkingcups it will also burn very well and make a very fierce and hot fire the kernel serves instead of meat and the water therein contained instead of drink and if the nut be very old the kernel will of it self turn to oil which is often made use of to fry with but most commonly to burn in lamps so that from this tree as i may say they have meat drink clothing houses firing and rigging for their ships these trees may be known by any ships passing by for they are void of leaves except just at the top at the bottom of the leaves the coconuts grow  0    or  0 in a cluster and they hang by a small string which is full of joints  the plantaintree is about    or    foot in height and about four foot round the leaves of the tree are about eight or nine foot long and two foot broad and end in a round point the fruit grows at the bottom of the leaf upon a great stalk in a cod of about eight inches long and the bigness of a blackpudding the cod is of a fine yellow color often speckled with red the cod being taken off the inside of it is white but the plantain it east and west indies there is great plenty of them  the bonanoetree see fig xvii is much the same only the fruit is not so long as the plantain being as i said before about eight inches long and the bonanoe not above six it grows in the same manner as the plantain  0 or  0 in a cluster upon one stalk the fruit is very mellow and extraordinary sweet and good  the landmarks of this river in the bay of st matthew are that the bay is higher land than that which is behind it toward the inward parts to the cape of st francisco or thereabouts it has on the seacoast    or    pieces of broken ground which are white and in the middle of them is the said bay of st matthew  on the    st of july we left the bay of tacames and carried our little prize named the dragon with us not designing to touch at any place till we come to the gulf of nicoya  chap iv the island caneo the mountains called sierras de los coronadas the gulf of nicoya the ship cleaned mr clippinton the chiefmate leaves us a particular description of the gulf of nicoya the maccaw described the carrioncrow the pelican the guanoe the turtle the pearloyster the great oyster muscles departure from the gulf of nicoya two mountains of guatimala the one casting out water the other fire a prize taken vulcanoes the bay of tewantepeque subvartaneo another prize taken the bay of martaba the mountains called motines the mount of st jago and port of quelagna another prize taken attempt upon the manilaship unsuccessful the men desire to return home but agree to cruize six weeks longer and india the albicore described the crew divide part tarrying with captain dampier in the southseas and part resolving to go for india  from the bay of tacames in the latitude of about   d  0 m north we stood away to the n w across the bay of panama and on the  0th of august we fell in with an island which proved to be the island caneo it is an indifferent high island and lies in the latitude of  0d n it is not above a league round and the anchoringplace is on the n e side in    fadom water not above a quarter of a mile from the shore here is said by our indian pilots to be extraordinary good wood water turtle and store of wild hogs near this island are two islands more and between them are several shoals and not far off upon the main land is puntamala or bad point and within puntamala is a fine deep bay in which sir thomas cavendish formerly cleaned his ship  from hence we coasted away to the vvestward and past by the sierras de los coronadas or the crowned mountains these mountains are very remarkable there being none like them on this coast from spaniards farallones de queipo these rocks lie just at the vvestend of the crowned mountains and the coast runs n n vv and s s e near these rocks is the river estrella or the star river this river is in the bottom of a large bay and here is commonly a great sea from this bay to herradura is    leagues herradura is the south point that makes the gulf of nicoya as cape blanco is the north we arrived at herradura on the    of august but past by it and went further into the gulf till we came to many small islands called by the spaniards the middle islands because they lie in the middle of the gulf we anchored between them and the bay of caldera bringing the bay of caldera to bear east and the said middle islands to bear west here we lay all this day but sent our little prize the dragon to view the gulf and to find out a convenient place to lay our ship ashore in and the next morning being august the   th our captain and carpenter went in the canoa amongst the middle islands to see if there was any convenience amongst them for laying our ship aground in the evening our captain and carpenter returned in the canoa and brought on board two turtles which  the same evening our little prize returned to us again they had been up the river changel and found two or three indian houses and some plantainwalks the indians climbed the trees and cut down for them as many plantains as they would have they found also two canoas hauld up upon the sand and brought them both off in their way they caught eight turtles and eat nothing of their own provisions but fed upon turtle during the time they were from us they gave us an account that they had found out a very good and secure place at the island st lucas for us to lay our ship ashore in that it was in a fine deep bay which at the entrance was not above  pistolshot  over that with five or six guns upon each point at the entrance w might so fortify our selves as that no enemy durst approach us for that ten o us might desend our selves against fi middle islands to be as convenient as any place could be and our captain seeming to like this place as well and knowing we could fortify our selves as strongly here and with as little trouble we chose this place accordingly on the   th it being fair weather and calm we towed our ship in amongst the islands and lay within stones cast of the shore all round with one anchor a head and a cable out at our stern which was made fast to a great tree on the shore as soon as we had fastened our ship all hands went ashore and began to build tents for our cooper and sailmaker to work in and to put our goods and provisions in in the mean time our chief mate was sent in the little dragon with twenty men armed and two pattereroes to cruize in the gulf where after he had cruized five or six days he returned with a spanish bark of about forty tuns she had in her some few jars of brandy wine and some sugar they were going to repair her she being very old and for that purpose had five or six carpenters and caukers on board who came very opportunely to help us to repair our ship for we had great need of workmen we took out our powder shot and all our ammunition with all our bread some of our flower and our august we sent our canoas to an island just by us upon which there were several old fallendown houses the thatch of which we brought away to make use of in burning the bottom of our ship the bottom of our ship was in many places eaten like a honeycomb insomuch that the firm plank was no thicker than an old sixpence nay in some places in the hold we could thrust our thumbs quite through with ease our ship being in this condition and we in want of planks to new bottom her our carpenter was forced to make a hard shift and stop the leaks as well as he could with nails and oakam  september the  d our captain and mr clippinton the chief mate falling out mr clippinton with twenty one of our men seized upon the bark in which was all our ammunition and a great part of our provisions and got up her anchor and went without the islands from thence he sent us word that if any of us had  indian house to shelter it from the rain and sent us word of his so doing and we went with our canoas and fetched it aboard  and now our captains design being to take the manilaship we went to work in getting our things aboard and watering and rigging our ship and on the   d we haled out from the middle islands and anchored in the gulf which before i proceed i shall here give you some description of  see fig xxvii in this gulf are several islands as the island of st lucas and the island of chira to this latter island the spanish ships come to take in their lading which is brought from nicoya this island is inhabited and lies in the latitude of  0 d  0 m north and on the n e part is another island called the island guaiabas near which is a bar or shoal observe when you enter into this gulf that you leave all the islands to the westward except the island guaiabas which has the bar near it and steer close by the island of chira lucas eight leagues and they lie from each other north and south to the s s w of the island st lucas distant about four leagues are the middle islands they are a parcel of small islands and amongst them is a good harbor in which we wooded and watered and haled our ship ashore  we found here several sorts of very good fish as mullets breams silverfish etc of shellfish here is conchs clams pearloysters and another sort of oyster called the greatoyster of birds here is great store viz maccaws and pelicans and carrioncrows and of amphibious creatures the guano and the seaturtle  the maccaw is a very fine bird his feathers being of most sorts of colors he is about the bigness of a hawk and in shape like a parrot only his bill is perfectly white and his feet and legs quite black  the carrioncrow is as big as a small turkey and in all respects very like one for i never saw any difference neither in color nor shape the flesh of them both smells and tastes so strong of musk that there is no eating of it these creatures commonly resort to any place where any dead creature is and feed upon it for which reason they are called carrion crows i know not for they are nothing like them but altogether like a wild turkey  the pelican see fig xviii is almost as big as a swan its color is inclining to white only the tips of his wings are brown it has a long bill of about twenty inches with a very large crop joining to the lower part of his bill and so descending by the throat like a bag or satchel very observable and of a largeness almost beyond credit into which it receives oysters cockles conchs etc or any other shellfish which being not able to break it retains them until they open and then vomiting them up picks out the meat as for their making a hole in their breast to give their blood to their young i do not believe nor ever saw any such thing although i have seen thousands both young and old together and have eaten many of them they are good food only they taste somewhat fishy they have broad feet like a duck being waterfowls but they roost commonly on rocks and in trees and always set with their heads to the wind so that if the wind changes whilst they are at roost they turn about their heads to the wind they are heavy birds and fly very slow and always when they sit either on rocks  the guano see fig xix is a sort of creature some of which are found on land some in the water he is about three foot long more or less and is a very ugly creature to look at having great sharp black and green scales from the forepart of his head to the end of his tail and a set of great and sharp teeth with four long claws upon each foot they breed commonly in the roots of old trees near the water side and frequent the water as well as land when they are stewed with a little spice they make good broth and the flesh looks very white and eats very well but if they are not extraordinarily well boiled they are very dangerous to eat making men very sick and often putting them into a fever as we were informed by our prisoners  of seaturtles there are several sorts but we always account the green turtle to be the best meat they have several islands and sandy bays where they go to lay their eggs which they do in different places at different times for in some places as at the island of ascension in the atlantic ocean their common time of laying is in april may june and july in other places as in the bay of motines on the coast of mexico we took them ashore december and january here in the gulf of nicoya upon the same coast of mexico in the latitude of between  0 and    d north we caught a great many of them and commonly found them full of eggs in the months of august and september though therefore at one or at several constant places their season of laying is always the same yet in different places their seasons are different i have been at the catching of them in most times of the year and commonly found them full of eggs when they want to lay they go ashore in some sandy bay and with their fins make a hole in the sand about two foot and a half deep wherein they lay their eggs commonly about eighty or ninety at a time then they cover them up with the sand they had scraped out of the hole and so leave them for the heat of the sun to hatch thus they lay two or three times in a season and after they have laid they go off to sea and leave the young when hatched to shift for themselves who as soon as they get out of the shell and sand retire to the water the eggs are round about the bigness of a ducks with a white thin tough skin over them but no shell  both the eggs and the turtle are extraordinary good food as i have experienced many  the pearloyster is much about the bigness of our common oyster but more flat and broad it hangs to the rocks by a long stringy beard like a muscle the pearl lies in the thickest part of it some have five six or seven pearls in them the spaniards make several voyages to this gulf of nicoya and to the island california for them the indians go down in five six seven or eight fathom water and bring up eight ten or twelve oysters at a time while the men on board open them the meat of this oyster is very green and the oyster fat i have eaten of this oyster several times both boiled and stewed and found them to be tolerable good victuals  the great oyster grows to the rocks as other oysters not hanging to them by a beard as the pearloyster when they are opened one part looks of a fine red like a cherry the other part is of a fine white i have eat of this sort of oyster many times but it was for want of better victuals they are so large that one of them cut in pieces and stewed is sufficient for a meal for five or six men  muscles here are so large that one of them when dressed will suffice two men and they are tolerable good victuals when stewed with pepper and vinegar  from the middle islands beforementioned to the island of chira is clear ground and six or seven fathom water when you sail up the gulf you must keep nearer the islands than the main land because near the main are several sholes which stretch a considerable way from the island st lucas to cape blanco is nine leagues cape blanco lies in the latitude of  0 d  0 m north it has a small island at the point of it full of high trees the cape is high toward the inner parts and appears plain and even the chief of what they bring from this gulf is salt honey maiz some wheat and fowls which they send yearly to panama  on the    d of september having done our business here we with our little dragon prize left this place intending to cruize to the westward on the  th of october we had latitude by observation    d 0  m north variation   d  0 m westerly and at the same time we saw the land which proved to be two high mounts called the vulcans of guatimala the one being of water the other of fire these two famous mountains stand almost the one over against the other on guatimala which caused the inhabitants to remove the city three leagues further off where it now stands the vulcan of fire which stands opposite to that of water is at some certain times especially in the rainy season which is from april to november very terrible to the inhabitants it sometimes throws out stones as big as a house and breaks out with such a flame that if it be in a dark night although you be five or six miles of yet by the light thereof you may see to read a letter written in a small hand this was affirmed to us by several of our prisoners natives of the place  the  th we had dirty squally weather with very hard gusts of wind from the two vulcans aforesaid with such prodigious claps of thunder and flashes of lightning as none of us ever saw or heard the like on the  th we took a bark of about eighty tuns in ballast she came from suvartanejo and was bound for ria lexa christian martin a spaniard born at the canaries but brought up in london he was servant formerly to captain eaton and came with him into the south seas at which time he was captain eatons gunner but falling out with the men ran away from them at the island gorgonia where he lay concealed six days till the ship was gone after which he cut him down two small trees which he drew to the waterside and bound them together with twigs fixed a mast and of two shirts which he had with him made a sail and having filled a large bag with oysters which he made fast to the said two trees he in the morning betimes put off from the island gorgonia and the next day in the afternoon got into the river of bonaventure where he went ashore and had but ill usage from the spaniards who sent him to lima where he was examined cleared himself and was set at liberty he could speak very good english  the   th we had latitude by observation    d    m north variation   d 00 m westerly being then off the great vulcano of attitlan this vulcan commonly casts out smoke and under it are   small hills which are said to be always sapotitlan which throws out vast quantities of fire this and the vulcan of sacatapeque are reckoned two wonders of the world we observed off the vulcan of sapotitlan and found variation   d    m westerly and had latitude by observation    d    m north the   th we saw the hill of bernal which makes the east point of the gulf of tecoantepeque we observed off it and found the variation by a good amplitude to be   d    m westerly and had latitude    d 00 m n  the  0th we found our selves abreast of the bay of tecoantepeque which is very low land and full of little hills which look like small islands this place is very subject to hard gales of wind at n e called tecoantepequers from the place whence they come and they happen commonly about the new and full moons the best way therefore is to keep near the shore after you are past the bay or gulf in the gulf it self you may keep three or four leagues off for it is shoal to that distance but when you are to the westward of the bay keep within two leagues of the shore that you may come to an anchor if occasion be for if you should chance to be driven off from shore which frequently happens you will hardly be able to  november the   th in the even we saw four small white islands lying close together on the east end of which about two miles distance is a large hummock which looks like an island but is not the land going from it to the main being very low causes it till you are very near it to look like an island this place is called suvartaneo inhabited by spaniards and indians it lies in the latitude of    d  0 m n and has a small village of about forty houses standing by the seaside here we anchored in    fathom water not above pistolshot from the village at our coming in we saw about  00 spaniards and indians both horse and foot we fired eight or ten of our great guns at them and they retired into the woods then we landed about  0 of us and went to the village and romaged it in it we found a great many small things with    packs of very good flower we filled here two boats load of water but the sea running high overset our boats our men would have set the village on fire but the captain being ashore would not suffer them so on the   th we went out with the landwind and stood away to the westward  martaba under the mountains of motines here we watered our ship and found in a small river a great many large green turtles the best i ever tasted on the   th at sunsetting we spied a sail and immediately got every thing in a readiness for an engagement not knowing but it might be the manilaship which we now began to expect shortly to see we were at this time sixty four of us men and boys all well in health and did daily wish to have a sight of the manilaship we soon came up with the ship we saw and took her she was a small bark of about sixty tuns from california laden with plank and she had on board some parcels of pearl which they had fished in the gulf of california  in this bay of martaba is a very good anchoring place defended from the east and northwest winds and there is ten and twelve fathom water clear ground when you are ashore you will see a little river of fresh water it was at this rivulet that we watered our ship and in it found store of extraordinary large and very good green turtle near the rivulet is a road which strikes up into the woods this road leads to an indian town called mavota it is said to be four miles and a half from the seaside  martaba five or six leagues toward the seaside you will see broken ground which looks like an island it is called chasipi on the s e of which is a little pleasant valley of pure white sand called the valley of maguille under the jurisdiction of the city of colima observe that at the point of chasipi the motines end the motines are a long ridge of mountains reaching in length    leagues they abound in many rich towns of spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians to the n w of the point of chasipi you will find a plain even land toward the seaside which is full of coconut trees planted here for the use of those ships which come from the gulf of california two or three leagues distant from this row of trees to the n w is some broken ground and at the end of the broken ground stands a vulcan which is said always to smoke it is called the vulcan of colima and the broken ground is called the valley of corelan it is all planted with cocoas such as we make chocolate of this valley is distant from the town of colima n w    leagues and not far from the valley is a mount very round called the mount of st jago the mount of st jago is in the port of quelagna to know it you must observe that there is a rock close by the said quelagna you must steer straight to the bay for there are two very good harbors which have good anchorground and will hold a great many ships they are called the caletas on the n w side of the said bay is another very good port and close by it is the port of quelagna and between the port of quelagna and the white rock is a very good port in which you are landlockd from all winds and this is called the port of st jago but is not inhabited five or six leagues to the n vv of the white rock is a little mount coming near to which you will see an indifferent high mount full of broken ground and a rock joining to it which is in form of a sugar loaf and on the n w side of that rock there is a bay a league wide  it was on the  th of december that we came into this bay in which we saw a sail stood in after her and soon took her all the way we chased her they heaved their things overboard after which they all took to their boat and got ashore we took possession of the vessel which was a new vessel of about sixty tuns and in her we found a great deal manilaship but upon our chacing of her they threw most of it overboard this bay is called the bay of navidad  from this bay of navidad or the nativity we still coasted along to the westward at the n w end of this port is another port which is called chametla it is a port defended from the n w and s e winds two leagues to the n w of it is an island and about it lie four or five rocks which come from the main land they lie to the n n e and may plainly be seen and at the east end of them you may see the vulcan of colima  on the  th in the morning being off the vulcan of colima we saw a sail and soon came up with her she proved to be the manilaship so we being all provided gave her several broadsides before she could get any of her guns clear for they did not suspect us to be an enemy and were not at all prepared for us capt martin whom i formerly mentioned was then a prisoner on board us he advised to lay her aboard immediately while they were all in a hurry and that this would be the only way to take her but us our ship being very much decayed it would drive in a piece of plank of three or four foot so being much damaged and receiving particularly a shot from the enemy between wind and water in our powder room by which we had two foot of plank driven in on each side the stem the signal was made to stand off from the enemy  thus our design being disappointed all our men grew discontented and were for going home knowing we could do no good in these parts either for our selves or owners having provision but for three months and that very short and our india to some friends factory where we might all dispose of our selves as we should think most for our advantage to this we all agreed and accordingly cruized along shore to the eastward in sight of the land and passed by several noted ports as acapulco port angels port guatulco and several others of which i shall speak in my description of the coasts  our design now was to go into the gulf of amapalla to new water our ship and bark for our intended voyage to india on the  th of january   0   we met with vast quantities of fish so that in half an hours time we caught of albicores from sixty to ninety pound weight no fewer than fifty eight and small fish of about five inches were so numerous that with a bucket we hauld up fourteen sixteen eighteen and sometimes twenty at a time  the albicore see fig xxi is about four or five foot in length some more some less weighing from  0 to  00 and   0 pound weight he has eleven fins on his back one pretty large one middling one and nine small yellow ones near the tail he has one large fin on each side near the gills and etc  on the  th it was concluded between captain dampier and  0 of our men to continue in the southseas but upon what terms this agreement was made was kept secret we who were resolved to go for india used our endeavor to get into the gulf of amapalla which was the place we designed to water at with all the haste we could where we anchored on the   th of january   0  and the same day the provisions being equally parted according to the directions of the owners agent and four great guns with some small arms powder and shot etc being taken out for us we that is    of us who resolved to go in the bark for india went on shore in order to water our vessel for the said voyage  chap v a particular description of the coast of mexico the hill of

description of the coast of mexico peru and chili from the entrance of the gulf of california in the latitude of    d  0 m n to the port of valdivia in the latitude of  0 d s so far as i knew them my self or could get an account of them from the spaniards  zalisco it is a very high hill with a bending on the top and close to this hill is a white rock called maxentelbo which at three or four leagues distance looks like a ship under sail and behind the hill of zalisco is a great town of the same name inhabited by spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians and the main here all along is full of cocoawalks with estantions or farms of beeves  the cocoatree is small and the nut or kernel bigger than an almond and ripens in a great husk wherein are sometimes  0 nay  0 cocoas these cocoas are made use of to make chocolate and as in england we go to the tavern to drink a glass of wine so they do here upon this coast of mexico as frequently go to their markets to drink a dish of chocolate and the indians count it a very wholesome drink we were glad whilst we were upon this coast to make three meals a day of it for near a month we would much rather if we could have fed upon flesh but however living near a month upon chocolate it made us very fat and we found that it kept us very well in health whether if we had lived upon it much longer it would have done us hurt i know not but i am apt  from the white rock called maxentelbo twenty leagues to the south are three great islands called marias and a little one called the low island and amongst them are several small rocks these islands are of an indifferent height and are very full of wood the westermost is the biggest and between the islands and the main is said to be good anchoring in eight ten twelve and fourteen fathom water good fast ground the islands are not inhabited and about them is said to be commonly store of seals and turtle and several sorts of very good fish whether these islands have any fresh water upon them i know not but i am apt to think they may  fourteen leagues to the s s w of the islands marias are the rocks or islands of pontique they lie from the main about a league you may sail between them and the mainland without any danger they take up two leagues in length and the westermost of them looks like a ship without a mast you may sail between them for there is no danger but what is visible the land here by the seaside is low but within the country it is very high and ragged and about a league to pontique this point at a distance looks like an island it is a high round hill and very barren being only a ragged rock from this point to the eastward for fourteen leagues runs a deep bay and on the north end it is low land this bay is very well inhabited by spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians here are a great many gardens of cocoa and all this bay and the valleys are under the jurisdiction of the governor of the city of compostella  at the east end of this bay is the cape corrientes which cape lies in the latitude of about  0 d  0 m north it is high land and full of sharp ragged hills observe when you sail near this cape if it blow hard from the n w as it commonly does that four or five leagues to the s e of the cape is broken ground toward the seaside steer exactly to it and on the s e side of the said broken ground you will find a good convenient place where you may anchor and in it you are defended from most winds this place is called by the pilots salinas because near it they make salt the cape corrientes is very high land it has on it a few trees and within the land near the said cape is a high mountain which has three sharp pikes on the top somewhat coronada or the crownedmountain the seawinds hereabouts are commonly at n w and the landwind at north  from cape corrientes s e by e runs a great bay in which are three or four islands called the islands of chametly they are little low islands and between them and the main there is a very good place to anchor in and near this anchoring place the main is inhabited by indians who are fishermen and fish for the city of the purification which is a large city and said to be about fourteen leagues within land  from the bay of chametly to the s e twenty leagues is the port of st jago a very good port in which you are defended from all winds but near it are no inhabitants not far from this port is the vulcan of alima five leagues within the land  from the port of st jago to the s e sixteen leagues is the port of navidad or the nativity between which two ports are several small ports and many rocks and shoals so that it is bad going into them and besides for want of trade they are seldom or never made use of by the spaniards the port of navidad is a very good port in which is water and wood here the spaniards build ships america to the east indies at this place on the  th of december we took a new bark of about fifty tuns in which we found some bacon fowls bread and rice with some powder and shot at our chasing of her the men after they had heaved most of their things overboard took to their boat and got ashore this port lies in the latitude of    d  0 m n  from hence to the bay of salagua or salt water bay is eight leagues it was at this place that captain dampier vol i page     gives an account that the manilaship sets ashore her passengers that are bound for the city of mexico but now the viceroy finding an inconvenience in their so doing has given a positive command that they should not put any of their men or goods ashore till their arrival at acapulco because it was usual with them when they set ashore their passengers to convey away a great deal of the goods and so defrauded the king of his customs  from this place to the port desapan is sixteen leagues and half a league within the land is a town called jesuchristo said to be a large handsome town at this place begin the high hills called motines spaniards and indians and here are abundance of cocoawalks and farms of cattle the land by the seaside is mountainous and rocky and by the water it is all along planted with cocoanut trees for the use of those ships which come hereabouts and have occasion for chocolate hereabouts you will see the vulcan of colima which is said always to smoke and sometimes though seldom to burst out with fire under these hills on the   th of november we took a bark of about sixty tuns laden with plank she came from the gulf of california where they had been fishing for pearls of which we found a few parcels under the same mountains in the bay of stabata we watered our ship and found a great many very good green turtle  at the east end of these mountains of motines is the river sacaticli a league up which river is a town of the same name near this river are some pieces of broken ground the least of which is sandy and has no trees on the top of it from hence s e to estapa is sixteen leagues in all which distance there is neither hill nor high land but in most places it is full of trees and continues so till you come to a thick green spot of estapa are some great high mountains called the mountains of chequetan they lie within land and are ten or twelve leagues in length to the eastward of this place twenty leagues is the mount of petaplan by this mount are a great many cocoawalks and near to the cocoawalks is the town of petaplan which stands behind the mountain this town is said to be a large town and very well inhabited the land near it is full of small hills and valleys the hills are barren but the valleys are said to be green almost all the year the hill of petaplan is a high hill at a distance it looks like an island and about it are a great many rocks but all visible so that if you please you may go between them where if occasion be you may anchor and will not find less than nine ten or eleven fathom water this hill i make to lie in the latitude of    d    m north from hence to the port of acapulco is eight leagues all along a sandy bay and low even land  acapulco is a port of great trade it is the place where the spaniards embark from mexico for china and the philippine islands which is a particular privilege it has for no other port durst trade to any part of the east indies but from hence it is mexico eighty leagues and all goods are carried from hence thither on mules though it is a very bad way this is the chief port for mexico on the whole west side of america it is a very good and large port and in it may lie a hundred sail of ships all landlockd and secure from all winds and weather it lies in the latitude of    d 0  m north the town consists of about   0 families most spaniards and has for its defense a castle of between forty and fifty brass guns each said to carry a thirtysix pound ball the castle stands in a valley between two noted hills one of which is almost like a sugar loaf and the other is cut in two at the top this is called the hill cauca these hills are the highest land hereabouts and both to the east and west of them it is all low land for several leagues the town stands at the n w end of the harbor in a deep bay it is said to be a pretty compacted town if you would enter into this port bring the hill cauca to bear n e from you then go to the s e of the island which is at the mouth of the harbor called the least island and after that have a care of coming near a dangerous shole called the grifo but if the wind should be northerly then you may go to the westward of the great island chinaships entrance it is the narrowest channel and the water is very deep but ships coming from the eastward come in at the east channel between the main and a great shole of sand but in their entrance keep as near the main as they can you may know this port by the high land for it is all low to the east and west of it and all along for several leagues sandy bays  a league from this port of acapulco is port marquis it is a very good port and in it is good wood and water and here are three or four indian houses belonging to fishermen who fish for the town of acapulco a little to the eastward of these houses are   small islands with some indian fishermens houses on them and here they dry a great deal of fish with which they supply their town and ships at acapulco  from these three small islands to the river of naguala is six leagues it is a small river with only five or six poor fishermens houses from whence by land is a good path leading to acapulco and by sea it is a bold coast and deep water  from the river of naguala to the fishingplace of don garcia s e is five leagues all even land and a sandy bay here live    or  0 indian slaves who dry  from the fishingplace of don garcia to the hill of cecorillo s e is six leagues and near the waterside all even land and sandy this hill of cecorillo is a small round hill close to the waterside and right against it about a league from the shore are five or six rocks and all round them it is shole water  from the hill of cecorillo to the river of taclamanca is two leagues here live eight or ten families of indian people who employ their time in fishing  from the river taclamanca to point gallera is eight or nine leagues the first four leagues the land is all along wood and the other half way it is broken ground by the seaside there being seven cliffs of a whitish color and off of these cliffs about a league distance from the shore are several shoals and for two leagues off you have scarce two fathom water  from point gallera to the morro or mount of hermoso is seven leagues the land mountainous within and full of little rocks by the seaside this mount of hermoso is a plain mount and at the top very even and about a mile from the shore right off the said mount is a great sand on which several good ships have alcatrazes and over against it is a fresh water river where you may water your ship if you have occasion here live several indian people with a spanish friar and round about the island are several small islands or rather rocks and from the main on the east side of the island comes out a shoal of rocks and sand which stretch off to sea as far as the island therefore it is dangerous going in at the east end but at the westend you may safely go in and on the inside of the island is a good anchoring place  upon this coast of mexico for the most part the landwinds are at n w and n n w and the seawinds from the w to the s w according as the land trends away so that all the way if you keep within eighty or ninety leagues of the land you must make use of the land and seabreezes which commonly blow hereabouts pretty fresh the land here is not very high it is woody but within the country mountainous here are seven or eight whitish cliffs by the seaside which are very remarkable because there are none so white and thick together on all the coast  alcatrazes to the port of escondedo is eight leagues its east point butting into the sea more by half a league than the west it is a smooth and good port and here is good wooding and watering near this port is a little island which makes the port within which island you may ride with great security from the west and southwest winds and may venture to go ashore without any danger and from this port is a road leading to several great towns in the country  from escondedo to the river messiah is six leagues and between escondedo and the river messiah is the river of aqua dulce or sweetwaterriver right against which are two rocks one on each side at the mouth of the river messiah is fresh water and in the times of the rains it overflows its banks and hinders the inhabitants in their affairs and very often drowns many of their cattle which feed near the banks of it the banks of this river are very well peopled with indians but hereabouts the coast is much troubled with calms off from this river messiah at a league distance is a large island which has several small islands or rather rocks about it  from these islands to the river galler is eighteen leagues all mountainous within gallera about three quarters of a mile from the main and six leagues to the westward of port angels is a small rocky island between which and the main is very good anchoring in fifteen sixteen and seventeen fathom water the seawinds hereabouts are commonly at w s w and s w and the landwinds at north whether there be any water upon this island i do not know but never heard of any neither could any of our prisoners tell us the name of it it has some small trees or rather bushes growing on it but they are fit for no use  from this island as i said before to the port angels is six leagues it is a good port and seldom without shipping here is a small town of about thirty houses inhabited mostly by spaniards the town is situated on the west side of the port and in the town are said to be two pretty little churches this town has great trading to it for hides and tallow and sends a great quantity of goods by land to mexico and several other inland towns and villages when you enter this port you must keep to the eastward of a rock and shoal the port lies in the dampier in vol i page     makes the port of guatulco to lie in the latitude of    d  0 m north we did the same but then page     he makes port angels which is to the northward of it to lie in the latitude of but    d north which we made to lie in    d    m north that is    miles to the northward of guatulco whereas he makes it  0 miles to the southward of it but i suppose it is a mistake in the printing the coast runs here vv n vv and e s e the tide rises and falls five foot the flood setting to the n e and the ebb to the s w  from port angels to the caletta is two leagues it is a very good port but has neither vvood nor fresh water have a great care of four or five rocks which lie out from its s e point stretching a mile and half into the sea between the caletta and port angels is said to be a very dangerous shoal and that it bears from the point of port angels s s e distance one league  the port angels is in form like to guatulco but not so broad nor so good though the spaniards reckon it to be an extraordinary port yet there is a great deal of difference between it and guatulco in port angels are several anchoring places calettas or bays in which is good anchoring for a small vessel and in each of these two bays is a little brook of fresh water which have their beginning from a plain of sand and if you go to the end of the plain you will see their head in this port are very good trees that upon occasion will serve to make masts for ships here are also a great many farms of beeves with good store of maiz hogs fowls etc and here they make salt not only to serve their own occasions but also to supply several towns and villages hereabouts  from this port of angels to the port of guatulco is    leagues in the way are several rocks islands and rivers at the island sacrificio on the inside is secure riding from all winds in five six and seven fathom water and here you may wood and water your ship if you have occasion hereabouts are excellent pearls found in seven fathom water this port of guatulco is famous for its being taken by our english hero sir francis drake in the year      who in one house took a tho cavendish in the year      but it has always been famous for being the port in which from mexico they send all such goods as they design for peru it is also the seaport for the great cities of coaxica and orata it is distant from mexico    leagues from coaxica  0 and from orata    it is all along high and mountainous land the port lies hid and you cannot see it till you come within a league of it about a league from the port is a small round island called tangola which is full of hills and trees and close by the west point of the port is a rock and three quarters of a mile to the eastward of the rock and in the middle of the entrance of the port lies the buffadore which is a small rock and when the winds blow at s w the sea breaks a great height upon it when therefore you would enter this port keep west from tangola till you have brought the middle of the port to bear due north then keep an equal distance between the buffadore and the east point of the port the best anchoring is on the west side due north from the town which consists of about   0 houses spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians in it is also a large church with two small chapels and the houses are very view of port of guatulcoe fig    view of port of tequantepeque fig    view of port of sonsonate fig    see fig xxii and we found   d    m westerly variation  from guatulco to the river of capalita is one league it is a very deep and swift river and the tide rises and falls five or six foot  from the river of capalita to the river simatlan is three leagues this river is inhabited by indians and near to the seaside are a great many plantainwalks the river comes as it were from the point of ajuta by the seaside are a great many farms of cattle  from the river simatlan to the point of ajuta is two leagues thence to the islands of destata is five leagues all high mountainous land the country hereabouts is very populous four leagues within land is said to be a great town called elobispo it has as is said four churches and at least   00 houses all hereabouts are plantainwalks also several estantions or farms of cattle on the seaside upon the banks of the river of destata which is rightagainst the two islands of destata is a large indian town with not above three or four spaniards in it who lord it over the poor indians  from the islands of destata to the morro or mount of bamba is four leagues bamba is a pretty high land and very rocky  from this mount of bamba to the mount of mazatlan is three leagues this mazatlan has a river of fresh water and an anchoring place which is full of rocks the top of the port look white being all covered with fowls dung so that there is none like it on all the coast except it be at salina hereabouts the coast is very windy and from the n e come hurricanes or tecoantepequers  from the mount of mazatlan to the port of salinas is four leagues by this salinas the low land begins and near it are two rocks here is made abundance of salt and the inhabitants of tecoantepeque bring hither abundance of meat tallow and hides to sell from this port many commodities are shipped for the south sea to the great enriching of the town which consist of about fifty houses of merchants who have the advantage of trading in the north and south seas they trade from the north sea up the river of guasickwalpo in small barks and then have but    leagues hither good road as is said so that wagons pass it  tecoantepeque a bishops see and a very rich place all along here the coast is very populous and great store of pearl is found near the shore in the bay of tecoantepeque which is a good port but much subject to n and n e winds which at certain times blow very hard when you are off this port of tecoantepeque do not come nearer the land than two leagues for for   leagues it is all along shallow water but if you have occasion send in small boats or canoas it is all along low land excepting the hill carbon which is a round hill almost like a sugar loaf near it is the river of tecoantepeque on the banks of which the town is situated in going into this river you must go over a bar of sand near unto which bar are some small hills that lie a little within the low land in the river and are islands when they appear to you like hills you may know it to be the bar and on the n e side is the channel see fig xxiii this tecoantepeque is a harbor for small vessels such as trade to acapulco ria lexa guatimala and panama and here upon some occasions ships which come from the coast of peru call in in their way to acapulco this is the chief port for guaxaca as la trinidad is for guatimala ria lexa for nicaragua and golfo de salinas for costa rica some few years since a french pyrate being in this bay landed and after the loss of some of his men took this town of tecoantepeque with great slaughter of the inhabitants the women to the number of about fifty they detained as prisoners and carried them to the gulf of amapalla where after they had kept them two months and had made use of them according to their own wills they after an inhumane manner cut of their noses and ears and so sent them back to their husbands this port of tecoantepeque lies in the latitude of    d    m north and we found variation just off it by a good amplitude to be   d    m vvesterly  at our passing by this place we caught store of catfish these fish are of various sizes being from half a foot to six foot in length it has three fins one on his back and one on each side near his gills each of which fins has a sharp stiff bone so that we are very careful when we catch them in taking them off the hook least they should strike those sharp still bones into our hands which if they do it is ten to one but a man loses the use of his hand by it he has a great wide mouth and near it several small white grisly strings that come out like cats catfish they are a good sort of fish and the young ones eat much like a whiting  from the port of tecoantepeque to the bar of mosquitos is eight leagues it seems to the eastward to be a great many hills and from the bar of mosquitos to the hill of bernall is seven leagues in all which distance is very good anchoring when the tecoantepequers blow hard out of the port of mosquitos comes a river by which is abundance of shoals toward the seaside and to the n w hereabouts it is low land from the hill of bernal to elzerro de la encommendi or the hill of recommending is five leagues this bernal makes the east point of tecoantepeque as the point of salina does the west the land hereabouts is very hilly and mountainous but the hill of bernal is the greatest the mountain of encommendi is not very high it is plain on the top and lies half a league from the seaside and on the side of it is fixed an artificial cross for which reason it is called elzerro de la encommendi or the cross of recommending you may anchor where you please near to this mount for it is common for those ships that are bound to the port of tecoantepeque if the wind blows hard as it often does to anchor here when they cannot fetch the mosquitos this hill of bernal lies in the latitude of    d north and we found the variation by a good amplitude to be   d    m westerly  from the cross of recommending to the vulcan of soconusco is seven leagues it is all very high land and two or three leagues from the shore it looks almost like a sugar loaf in the country the land is very high but the great vulcan of soconusco is the highest hereabouts every night we saw abundance of fires up and down in the valleys these fires were made to burn down the timber the ashes of which they reckon does mightily fatten the land for after the trees and bushes are burnt down the ashes of them makes the land look very black but in a fortnights time if they chance to have two or three showers of rain the land will look very green and pleasant this is the best and only way they have of fattening their land near to this vulcan of soconusco to the s e is the river of soconusco upon the banks of which is situated a large indian town of the same name for you must observe that most of these towns and rivers take their name from some famous mountain hill or vulcan standing by them the coast here all along for many leagues runs n w and s e  soconusco to the vulcans of amilpas is twelve leagues this is all very high and remarkable land the two highest vulcans have each a river of fresh water right against them these vulcans send out smoke sometimes but not often  from the eastermost vulcan of amilpas to the vulcan of sapotittlan is seven leagues here and there a sandy bay full of little creeks the coast still stretching away s e this vulcan of sapotittlan is a great vulcan and it is all toward the seaside very full of trees i have heard that before the spaniards found out mexico this mountain burnt out most terribly and threw out fire in so large a quantity that it destroyed many towns and villages with many fields of maiz or indian corn and that the mexican priests foretold by this unusual accident that their kingdom should be lost to strangers who were contrary to them both in religion color habit and customs but since the coming of the spaniards i have not heard of its doing any hurt this vulcan lies in the latitude of    d    m n and we found variation near it   d    m westerly  from this vulcan of sapotittlan to the vulcan of sacatepeque is six leagues this vulcan is in form almost like to a beehive  from the vulcan of sacatepeque to the vulcan of attitlan is seven leagues the coast runs n w and s e this is a very large mountain commonly casting out smoke it lies in the latitude of    d    m n and we found variation off it   d westerly a little to the s e of the said vulcan is a river of the same name and upon the banks of the river are said to be several pretty little indian towns about which are several gardens of several sorts of fruits with several plantations of maiz and many walks of cocoas  from this river of attitlan to the river of anabaces is four leagues between which two rivers the land is not very high and by the seaside are a great many cocoanutwalks but the sea falls with such great force upon the shore that there is no landing with a boat to get them  anabaces to the fiery vulcan of guatimala is eight leagues the coast continues still to stretch away n w and s e this vulcan of guatimala commonly throws out fire but mostly in the rainy season which is from the latter end of april to the beginning of october for the rain then falling on it makes it burn the fiercer behind this vulcan is said to be the great city of guatimala which consists of   00 families besides the suburbs called st domingo in which may be about   0 families more besides innumerable of mullattoes mostese and indians it is accounted next to lima and mexico to be the biggest and best traded city in all america it is governed by a president who in his own territories is as great as the viceroys of peru and mexico and is not subordinate to either of them but only to the council of spain the natives of this place are very expert in featherwork they will make either fish fowl or beast flowers trees herbs and roots to admiration nay they will for a whole day eat nothing only to place one feather in its due perfection turning and tossing the feather to the light of the sun and then in the shade to see in which it looks best and so accordingly place it at this place grows abundance of cocoa spaniards have removed the city three leagues further off where they now live without fear of the two vulcans although as i said before that of fire continually burns all the winter but without doing them damage because the city is so far off off these two vulcans we took a bark of about eighty tuns in her ballast named the st john  from the fiery vulcan to the river of ystapa is eight leagues in it is a small village of indians who are most of them slaves to the spaniards of guatimala the coast here runs n w and s e the river ystapa bears with the mountains of guatimala n w and s e you may know where the river is by this following sign in the middle overagainst the highest part of the trees is the bar and it lies south east from the mountains of guatimala take them upon what point of the compass you please they will always appear in a triangle  ystapa to the river of monticalco de los esclavos or the river of slaves is thirteen leagues this river is much pestered with north winds to know the river you must observe there are on the seacoast some little high mounts in the bar there are no trees any further than half a league distance on each side but all this part of the coast except it be near the bar is full of trees along the seacoast from guatimala to this place is all good anchorground and safe anchoring  from the river monticalco to the point of remidias alias sonsonate alias trinidad is thirteen leagues the point of remidias is low land and there is a tract of shoals that come above a league from it into the sea take heed of them the best anchoring is in twelve fathom water right off the river which is the port of sonsonate see fig xxiv this sonsonate is one of the greatest places of trade on the coast of mexico it lies in the latitude of    d  0 m north this famous place leads to a country as populous as any in america at the seaside are said to be thirty houses most warehouses and it is governed by a teniente under the governor of trinidad  from this port to the city of trinidad is six leagues it is said to have five spanish families in each parish are spacious walks and gardens of pleasure all very artificially made along the coast is very high land when you are right off the port of sonsonate you will have the valley of salvadore open where stands a church and a small town called guagamoco the chief commodity along this coast is cocoa there is some trading from mexico to this place and from port cavalles in the north sea but the most and greatest trade they have is from the two great empires of peru and chili  from point remidias to the vulcan of isalco is three leagues this vulcan at certain times smoaks very much and about it are great heaps of ashes you may know it by its being situated amongst a great many high mountains that are higher than it and you may see them from the end of the deserts of balsamo from this vulcan begin the mountains of morcois although it has abundance of smoke issuing out of it yet i never heard that it cast out any thing else  from this vulcan of isalco to the vulcan of st salvadore is five leagues the appearance of it is like unto a turks turbant between the two said vulcans close by the seaside is the barnadillo barnadillo and the vulcan of st salvadore is a fresh water river whose banks are very well peopled with indians  from the vulcan of st salvadore to the great vulcan of sacatelepa is six leagues this vulcan stands near the seaside in the year      it was said to burst out throwing out sulphur and ashes which stopped the ways and spoiled several fields of corn  from hence to the great river of lempa is one league that river has a great many sands at the mouth but they are visible so that you may steer in amongst them without any danger it is one of the biggest if not the biggest on the west side of the empire of mexico it is also said by the spaniards to be a privileged river so that a man who has committed murder or any other crime worthy of death or imprisonment if he can make his escape to the other side he is free so long as he lives there and no justice or any other on that side can question or any way trouble him for the said crime at this river lempa begins the pleasant country of st michaels  the town of st michaels is a large town said to consist of eight hundred spanish families and has seven fair and st michaels is a great lagune whose borders are very well peopled with a mixture of spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians in a place here called the red creek are said to be built ships of  00 tuns this country is very plentiful of all necessaries the earth brings forth corn wine and oil almost without mans help at the mouth of the river of st michael on the banks of which the town is situated you will at low water have two fathom in going in the spaniards always keep the vulcan due north and then there is no danger it was from this vulcan that we took our departure when we quitted these parts to proceed on our voyage for india over the river of st michaels the spaniards have built a wooden bridge the coast still continues to run north east and south west  near to the vulcan of st michaels is the gulf of amapalla this gulf is eight or nine leagues deep and four wide at its mouth are two large islands the one called amapalla and the other mangera and within is the island conchagua at which we wooded and watered our bark at our going to india there are a great many other islands in the gulf but none of mangera and amapalla amapalla is the biggest and on it is a small indian town or two of the same name there are two entrances into this gulf the one between point casivina and the island mangera and the other between the island mangera and the island of amapalla but that between point casivina and the island mangera has the deepest water yet it is better going in at the other because with the seawind you can run in at once the nearer you come to any of these islands you will find the water the deeper for the gulf is mostly shallow water and we were forced to keep the lead going at our coming out in our bark between amapalla and mangera we had often not above two fathom water the chief town of amapalla is mightily increased of late for in it there is now said to be above a hundred spanish houses it has a great traffic for its cochineel cocoa hides indico and all sorts of provisions it is governed by a teniente under the president of guatimala there is another village at the bottom of the gulf called chuluteca in it are about thirty or forty indian houses with not above two or three spaniards amongst them they live by selling provisions which they truck for other commodities but these spaniards will not suffer the poor indians to trade for themselves saying that strangers will cheat them and fail not to do it themselves of three fourths of what they are entrusted with were it not for these unlawful shifts the lazy spaniards would not grow so rich as they do here are a great many sands rivers and shoals in this gulf and the chief place of anchoring for the spanish ships is on the n e side of the island of amapalla in nine ten and eleven fathom see fig xxv although we anchored at the island conchagua the island of amapalla makes the west as point casivina does the east point of the gulf the point casivina is a high rocky point which at a distance looks like an island it lies in the latitude of    d    n and i reckon longitude from london west    d  0 m we found here   d    m westerly variation the water we found to rise and fall nine foot and it is very full of worms at this place we caught several sorts of fish but the most remarkable was the shovelnosdshark and a fish by the indians called a ceawau  the shovelnosdshark is in all respects the same as the common one only his head is like a colliers shovel and the two extreme parts at the edge of which on each side are his eyes go a great deal map of part of mexico fig xxv part of mexico   the ceawau see fig xxvi was a fish of about four foot long he had three fins on his back viz one small one at the hinderpart

pretty large ones on each side near the gills he had a large mouth and teeth he was an extraordinary good fish and his head when boiled was nothing but a pure good jelly he was full of small spots and partings as is expressed in the figure and the tip of his fins and tail was yellow  from the point of casivina to the messa de roldon or the hill of roldon is   leagues it is a plain hill and at the top is a table near which is the port of martin lopez a fine port but very seldom made use of for want of trade it is a very noted place having on the top of it a great many white clifts  from this port to the south east distance four leagues is the port of ria lexa by some called rio leon it is a good and safe port from all winds if lexa or leon it is said to consist of about eight hundred and fifty families being a mixture of spaniards mullattoes mostcse and indians the houses are said to be very well built of brick and stone and that it has five or six large churches in it as you come from sea the mouth of this port is hard to be seen but look to the vulcan of vejo and steer toward it and you will see a point and near it a rock which is as high as a ship make toward that rock and you will see a rising until you open the mouth whose entry is at the north west part and the vulcan in the harbor lies east when you are in you will find it all low land except the vulcan of vejo which is a very great and high vulcan depiction of ceawau fig    a ceawau depiction of yellow tail ig    the yellow tail depiction of island of magon fig     shows the island magon the with most part

mexico this port of ria lexa is a place of great trade from most parts of peru and mexico and is seldom or never without shipping in it they build small vessels and some ships of   0 tuns this famous port lies in the latitude of about    d  0m n longitude from london    d  0 m and we found variation   d    m westerly the islands are very low so that every tide they are overflown and upon this low and swampy land are abundance of mangrovetrees within land they make a great deal of pitch tar and cordage of which they send great quantities by shipping and supply most of these western parts of mexico peru and chili  from the port of ria lexa to the river de tosta is three leagues this river is sometimes dry but if it were not yet the sea runs so high and falls with such force upon the shore that there is no landing near it  from hence to messa de sutaba or the mountains sutaba is six leagues all high land on which falls a great sea it is also a very windy coast and runs n w b w and s e b e  sutaba to the great vulcan of telica is four leagues this vulcan is a great deal higher than all the mountains near it and it continually throws out many stones and smokes very much it is a very windy and hard coast and no port near it  from the vulcan of telica to the vulcan of leon mamotombo is six leagues this vulcan formerly burst out at the top with fire and was said to do much hurt to all the country for nine or ten miles round but it has ceased since and suffers the inhabitants to live in peace although sometimes it will smoke all the sulphurous matter being not quite exhausted the spaniards tell a story of a spanish friar who thought to have discovered some treasure within this vulcan which might enrich himself and all the country he being possessed in his own mind that the stuff which burned within this mount was gold whereupon he caused a great ironkettle to be made and hung it to an ironchain and let it down thinking to draw up gold enough to buy him a bishopric but such was the power and great heat of the fire within that he had no sooner let it down but both kettle and chain melted away and so frustrated the poor friar of his hoped for bishopric beyond this vulcan more within land is s leon from which the vulcan took its name the spaniards say there are eleven churches in it and about a thousand houses well built with many good gardens and orchards in which are many fine waterworks in the shapes of birds beasts and fowls the inhabitants are said to be very rich driving a great trade both by the north and south seas it is ruled by a governor who is not subordinate to any but the viceroy of mexico and the council of spain  from this vulcan of leon to the mountain of martiare is two leagues this mountain is very plain and has a table on the top at the west end of it is a fine small cove and at the bottom of the cove a river of fresh water but here falls so great a sea upon the shore that there is no landing  from the mountain of martiare to the port of st john is five leagues in this port they commonly build small vessels but here often runs so great a sea that no boat can go ashore unless by chance this is a pretty good port and in it you are defended from the n w and other northerly winds at the east point of this port lie four small islands or rather rocks which make a good defense for the port against s e winds and at the bottom of the port in the middle is a river of fresh water  catharine is fifteen leagues and between them is the gulf of popogajo an ill place to go ashore in and worse to ride in being very windy but especially from april to the latter end of september which is the time for the north winds from this gulf you will see within land the great vulcan of granada and near the seaside stands the vulcan of bombacho both casting out much smoke they are two noted vulcans that of granada up in the country is in form of a beehive the other of bombacho which stands near the seaside has three high peeks on the top of it in the middle of the gulf is a river of fresh water but the sea falls with so great force upon the shore that there is no landing near it and in the middle of the gulf by the seaside the land is low till you come to the great mountain of popogajo which is a vast high mountain and is in form of a sugarloaf it is called popogajo from the abundance of parrots that continually resort about it this mountain stands upon the point of st catharine which is low land and off it lie two rocks or small islands  from these rocks or small islands to the port of velas is nine leagues the coast runs n n w and s s e about catharine are two rocks more which are of a whitish color and from thence to the s e distance two leagues is a river of fresh water called the river of velas but at the mouth of it are several sands and shoals at this river to the south eastward the land begins to be mountainous in the port of velas is the vulcan of zapanzas and in the east part of the port near the port are many sands stretching from the shore for a mile at the bottom of the port which is at the s e end is a good fresh water river at which you may water your ship if occasion be and right off the said river is the anchoring place to the west of the anchoring place is a bluff point stretching out into the sea and about this point are a great many shoals and rocks with foul ground which stretch near three leagues into the sea come not near them for they are very dangerous these rocks are called velas because at a distance they look like a ship under sail  from these rocks to the mount of hermozo is seven leagues s s e this hermozo is a high hill but higher at the west than east end it runs out butting into the sea and from thence grows higher and higher within land at this hermozo you may see the port of velas and between these two places is a little high island which is two leagues from the shore whether there be any sailing for a ship between it and the main i know not  from the mount of hermozo to the cape of gajones is eight leagues the coast runs s e by e and n w by w all along mountainous and very bad and rocky and no port for any ship to anchor in the cape of gajones is a very noted cape it is not altogether so high as the mount of hermozo but on the top it is very even and plain it goes down on the west with a bending like a saddle which joins it to the mount of hermoso and also on the east it bends down in like manner and is joined to another mountain which mountain is plain and even on the top and in all respects looks like the cape of gajones only the cape of gajones is something fuller of trees and to know them from each other you must note that the westermost of the said two even mountains is the cape  from the cape of gajones to cape blanco is twelve leagues in the way are two dangerous shoals they lie distant from the main about one league and at low water may be seen almost dry between the two aforesaid capes is a small caldera your best anchoring is at the northpart of it at which place you may see the river of sparca distant about half a league at which is said to be excellent good wooding and watering and upon the banks of the river are situated several small indian towns and villages cape blanco or white cape is the westermost point of the gulf of nicoya as the herradura is the east the cape lies in the latitude of  0 d  0 m north to the n w of it lie three small low islands distant from it about a league the cape is high land but higher within land than near the waterside it is very full of tall trees of several sorts and at the pitch of the cape is a small island very full of trees the land is of a whitish color perhaps occasioned by the dung of fowls of which there are a great many that resort thither as they do to all the islands in the gulf this island at a distance looks as if it joined to the cape and it being of a whitish color as i said before gives name to the cape from this cape blanco northward along the coast of mexico until you come to the gulf of amapalla many times for two or three days together you will meet with hard gales of wind from the land which are called popagajos these winds are very frequent in the may june july and august which is the worst of the bad weather monsoon or winter time here  from cape blanco to the herradura is nine leagues between which is the gulf of nicoya it is a place much used by the spaniards captain sharp in this place in the river de la despenza took some spanish carpenters who were building a ship and brought them to the island chira with all their tools on board of his own ship where they refitted her and in the river tempisque they took two barks laden with tallow in this same gulf in the year   0  near the island saint lucas we took a bark of about forty tuns she had on board some wine brandy and sugar with five or six indian carpenters and caulkers who came in a good time to help us to clean our ship and to refit her if we had plank to do it with at a heap of small islands lying in the middle of the gulf called the middle islands we hauled our ship ashore as has been before related and cleaned her as well as we could we found the water here at nepetides to rise and fall eight foot at springtides more we lay here about two months and refitted wooded and watered our ship near the cape is a small village of indians and before the village are a great many sands map of part of mexico fig xxvii part of mexico caldera and right over the bay is a plain even land called the table of macotela near to which are two or three poor indian fishermens houses all ships bound for nicoya anchor at the island of chira see fig xxvii from whence the town of nicoya is distant about ten leagues consisting of about seventy or eighty houses being a mixture of spaniards and indians this is said to be a pretty well compacted town and head of a spanish government it is governed by an alcade or mayor from it come fowls salt honey and other provisions which they yearly send to panama in small vessels the nicoyans are a people of a middle stature and tawny complexion before he coming of the spaniards they had very good laws among themselves only hey had no law against a mans killing is father mother or king they as i uppose thinking no man would or could e so very wicked as to murder either his wn parents or the common father of em all whom they used to adore as a god a thief they judged not to die ut to be made a slave to the man he spaniards frequently come to fish for pearl of which they often make very profitable voyages here are also vast numbers of extraordinary good seaturtle and up most of the rivers of which here are a great many are several good plantainwalks at which we got store of plantains in the island of chira which lies at the bottom of this gulf of nicoya and which as i said before is the common anchoring place for the spanish ships which trade to nicoya is a small village of indians of about thirteen or fourteen houses built of palmeto leaves here captain sharp formerly filled his water in a pond near the seaside and here the poor indians related to them the sad usage they met with from their cruel masters the spaniards who make them work for them because they have nothing to pay them tribute with they have a small chapel here and here they used formerly to make a great many earthen jars but now the indians are most of them run away to get free from their cruel masters the spaniards in this gulf are seaturtle and fish of several sorts of birds here are the pelican the carrioncrow and the maccaw birds of  from the herradura which makes the eastpoint of this gulf of nicoya to the river estrella or starriver is eleven leagues the coast runs n w by w and s e by e the land something mountainous and steep near this river are the sierras de los coronados or the crowned mountains these are very noted mountains so that there is none like them on all the coast they are five or six ridges of mountains each gradually surmounting the other and those within the land are highest at the west end of these mountains are four rocks called by the spaniards farallones de queipo you may sail between them and the main and there is deep water enough these rocks are bare having no trees or bushes on them  from hence to the island caneo is four leagues this island is a league round and indifferent high land well clothed with straight and tall trees it lies in the latitude of  0 d n the anchoring place is on the n e side in fourteen fathom water a quarter of a mile off the shore where you may wood and water upon this island are said to be some few wild hogs but for what purpose they were first set ashore here i know not punta mala o bad point and within this punta mala i a deep and fine bay wherein sir thoma cavendish formerly cleaned his ship the shore is full of shoals therefore keep a good league off it punta mala is low and from it there stretch out several sands and shoals and in the middle of the sands is a small island which at a distance shows like a ship under sail it is an even country but very woody and in the woods are said to be store of deer the coast runs n w by w and s e by e  from punta mala to the golfo dulce or sweet gulf is nine leagues the land pretty even and woody within this gulf is a very good harbor and the water is very smooth this is accounted as good a gulf to ride in as the gulf of nicoya and in it you are secure from all winds nay even from the spaniards themselves for the seacoast is clear of them but here are indians who are very friendly to the english they are but few and live here to shun the spaniards yet they are obliged to pay half the fish they catch to the friar of a town which is four leagues up in the burica is five leagues this is a low point running into the sea from the southward it shows like two islands it is shoal a good way off therefore with a great ship keep a good league and half off shore this point is full of coconuttrees right off it distance about a league and half is a rock and there is no going between it and the said point to the eastward of the point of burica which lies in the latitude of 0  d 00 m n the land makes a long and deep bay in which are a great many islands rivers rocks shoals and sands but the most noted is the river of chirique which lies in the middle and bottom of the bay and on the banks of which is situated a spanish town of the same name with the river in it are about fifty houses built of brick barn at whose foot is another small town of about forty or fifty houses the trade here is mostly for muntego butter indigo pitch tarr and provisions of all sorts which is the common trade of all this coast the river of chirique is seldom without shipping which bring trade to it from the city of panama and other places in the country it is said to be very well people with spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians and in the woods is said to be plenty of beeves deer and wild hogs the most noted island in this bay is the island of montuosa this island is round and high and near it are two rocks called the ladrones they are distant from each other three quarters of a mile and at the south end of the island is a shoal of sand which runs a mile into the sea further in the bay are several other towns villages rivers and islands particularly the town of puebla nova or the newtown although now it is of an old standing which is three leagues from the seaside up a river of the same name in which ships are said to ride in four fathom water not above half a mile from the town within the mouth of this river on the larboard side going in is a rock called silva from the continual noise it makes in the night like music but here captain sawkins formerly paid the piper for going ashore to take the town of puebla nova he was killed by an ambuscade of the spaniards at which they are very dextrous and had rather fight so lurking amongst trees and bushes than face their enemy in open field unless they happen to be fifteen or twenty to one and then they will face you bravely in the open field this coast is famous for pearlfishing for at most of these islands are built huts on purpose for the fishers who are indians and are servants to the spaniards that live upon the main not far from them the main is woody and full of wild deer who are not easily scared also here are a great many turtle who are very large fat and sweet here are also abundance of fish which are extraordinary good  not far from hence is the island of quibo this island lies in the latitude of   d  0 m north at it are a great many turtle the island is pretty low but stored with several sorts of medicinal herbs called by the spaniards herba maria the island is all round full of large and tall trees and upon it in several places is to be found very good water there is good anchoring at this island in ten and twelve fathom  off the southpoint of this island lies another island called quicara it bears s s w from quibo distance one league between these two islands is a very good channel through which you may pass securely without any danger and come to an anchor in quicara road which lies in a bay on the n e part of thi bay is pretty deep water and in the middle of it comes a river over against a rock near to which rock is twenty fathom water if you please to go ashore with your boat to get wood water and coconuts you must go between the rock and the point which will defend you from the s s w winds  on the northpart of the island o quibo is the island rancheria which is a small but very woody island and the trees which grow on it are said to b very good for masts which use the spaniards often put them to there are a great many islands more hereabouts with several good ports and rivers that you man enter with a ship of six hundred tun the bay is full of islands and no dange in any of them but what is visible the  from point canales to point mariato the land makes another bay in which are also a great many islands and rivers which have several of them large sholes stretching from them into the sea between these two points is an island called the govanadore on it is said to be good wood and water and here are some negroes who are slaves to the spaniards that come hither to cut timber of which here is good store this is a small round island and has at its west point a shole of sand which runs into the sea about a mile  a little to the northward of this island of govanadore and further into the bay is another island called the leones in which is good wood and water it is a much larger island than the island of govanadore and has a shole of sand quite round the east side of it there is a channel between these two islands but when you go through take care that you keep the lead going and have a care of the east point of leones and the west point of govanadore here are a great many other islands mariato neither is there any or but very little trade here by shipping  the point of mariato is high land and near it are the mountains of guarco which are very high mountains and very woody and amongst these mountains is the moro de porcos or the mountain of hogs it is a high round hill as high as any of the mountains of guarco there are great store of hogs which run wild up and down these mountains from whence i suppose this mount of porcos took its name  from the point of mariato to the point of higuera is eighteen leagues the coast running east and west in all which distance it is clear and good anchorground two leagues to the westward of point higuera is the mount of porcos and right against it is a fine bay at the entrance of which on the east side is a shole of sand and in the midst of the shole is a little rock take heed how you come near it on the other side at the west point of the said bay is a small island near which is the best anchorground and at the bottom of the bay is a river of fresh water  from the point of higuera to puntamala is fourteen leagues the coast runs two friars you may sail safely between them and the main land or in the channel between them both or without them both according as you think fit here are several small rivers of no great note or use as the river cascajales the river oria and several others upon puntamala is a small village of indians and spaniards called the village of captain luis del gado this puntamala is certainly very justly so named do not by any means come near it with your ship for it has an innumerable company of rocks and sholes that stretch out above a league into the sea near this point are kept a great many farms of beeves  a little to the northward of this bad point is the island guanoes which has a very good anchoringplace on the northeast side next the main land in eighteen fathom water in a sandy bay where you are defended from most winds the island is not very high and it is well clothed with many tall trees and on it is very good water right over against it on the main are several sorts of provisions to be had as beef pork bread flower etc if you are strong enough to take it and if you have a mind to lay your ship ashore to clean the island guanoes is a good place  nata is fourteen leagues the land pretty low by the seaside with several rivers but the chief next to that of nata is the river of saints on the banks of which is situated a village of the same name called by the spaniards villa de los santos it is a small village of not above eighteen or twenty houses mostly indians why it is called the village of saints i know not about seven leagues from this village of saints is the town of nata between which two places are four or five small rivers and abundance of sholes near the main land the town of nata is a large and wellcompacted town situated upon the banks of a river of the same name it has great trade with panama selling them provisions as cows hogs fowls maiz etc here are several other towns of note but though they are as great and populous as nata yet they have not any of them so many white men for the mixed blood is so spread that for one white here are a hundred blacks and mullattoes who are of a yellow color between black and white  from nata the coast stretches in mountains and hills and the water is so shole that there is scarce any coming in for a ship but if there were here is never a port although it is high and mountainous nata and the point de chain are several rivers and behind the hills is a valley called sapo from whence they fetch hogs and fowls for the city of panama as they do from most places hereabouts along this coast ships ought to keep two or three leagues off shore or else they will meet with broken ground and sunk rocks but the coast has many fresh water rivers full of several sorts of very good fish which the indians catch and send several leagues round fishing being an employ peculiar to these indians though it rewards them but very slenderly because they pay such great customs out of it to the spaniards  chap vi a particular description of the coast of peru the bay of panama the

and to contain six thousand and five hundred houses most of them well built of brick and stone it is very well fortified and walled all round with stone the city is governed by a president under the viceroy of peru it being part of his territories on the backside of the city is a very pleasant and fruitful country the land is not very high but full of small hills and fine pleasant valleys in which there are several fine gardens of several sorts of fruit this is a place of the greatest trade of any in the south lima the metropolis for this city has the convenience of trade both from the north and south sea from the north sea it receives all or most of the european goods which are brought by the spaniards to portobel or carthagena or by any other nation trading on the northside and these european goods are from hence by shipping in the south sea sent to guiaquill truxillo lima arica coquimbo govanadore valpirizo and valdivia with several other noted places from whence they return back richly laden with the commodities of these parts but now the french having a trade amongst them and supplying them with all european necessaries it hinders this city mightily and the spaniards as far as we could hear whilst we were in these parts had rather have their room than their company however the french at present make very great and profitable voyages and now that they find the sweet of it they will be sure if they can to settle a firm and lasting trade here for as we have been assured by several spanish captains whom we took they have made better than  000 per cent of their goods one with another this city stood formerly four miles to the eastward of the place where it now stands but it being taken and kept a month by henry morgan and by misfortune burnt three times since they thought the place unlucky and so built it by the seaside where it now stands it is now much larger stronger and better built than it was before the port of perica is the harbor for panama but distant from it three miles for the great ebbing and shoalness of the water will not suffer any great ship to come any nearer than the said island of perica which is far out of command of their guns at panama therefore shipping may easily be taken out but although great ships are forced to lie here yet small vessels run through a little creek close up to the city  from panama to the island tabago is between five and six leagues and they bear nearly north and south from each other this island of tabago is in length one league in breadth about half a league the island is high and mountainous but highest at the south end it is very well clothed with trees of several sorts and on it are several walks of plantains bonanoes coconuts etc which they send to sell at panama upon this island on the northside is a small village of thatcht houses inhabited by negroes who are slaves to the gentlemen at panama and are kept here on purpose to look after their negroes as there is upon most or all of these islands in the bay of panama  to the south east of these islands is a great range of islands called the kings islands they are most of them pretty low and pleasant islands and very well clothed with tall straight trees of several sorts about them are a great many very good anchoring places and upon most of them is good wood water and fruit they are in all about forty in number on the great island called the kings island which gives name to all the rest the spaniards build good vessels which are commonly counted pretty good sailers you must observe that amongst these islands you will hardly find much more or less than sixty fathom water unless you are very near them amongst these islands the water rises and falls ten foot perpendicular  from panama to the island chepelio is eight leagues upon this island are some mullattoes and negroes belonging to the panama the island is mostly planted with rice as are a great many of the kings islands which are about ten leagues distance from hence right against this island on the main is a large river called cheapo and seven leagues up the said river is a town of the same name which is very plentiful of provisions  from chepelio to the island of planta is seven leagues it lies a league from the main and the water about it is indifferently deep but near the main it is all along shole water not above four foot though you be a league from the shore  from hence to cape saint lorenzo is ten leagues this cape is low land full of creeks and near it is shole water at this cape begins the gulf of st michael in which are a great many islands rivers and sholes although in some places the water is deep and smooth and good anchoring it was up one of these rivers that we went designing to take the town of santa maria but were frustrated of our intent yet we took an indian town which we called scuchadero it was about three leagues within the mouth of the river and situated on the south side of it in it we found store of dunghilfowls parrots white and black beans yams potatoes maiz etc it consisted of about etc there is another town on the northside of the river called scuchadero which captain dampier mentions in his first vol p     but this we could not find and so gave the other town its name and from thence returned on board our ships again which we left lying at point garachina which point i make to lie in the latitude of   d  0 m north the tide runs here five knots and a half per hour it rises and falls three fathom and ebbs and flows n e and s w  from point garachina to port pinas is seven leagues north and south the port of pinas has two small islands at the mouth of it but if you please you may sail close by them for there is no danger neither is there less than twelve or fourteen fathom water at this place is good wooding and watering the land is high and very woody and goes up hollow in the middle it is very full of pinetrees and thence called port pinas in some part of this port is good anchoring and in the port are three rivers of fresh water and the banks of the rivers are full of tall straight trees the port lies in the latitude of   d north longitude from london west    d 00 m and a  from port pinas to port quemado is twentyfive leagues at its mouth are several rocks and islands and along this coast are several good harbors the land here is not so high as at port pinas but in many places here are very pleasant walks of coconuts the coast is very deep and dangerous in wintertime at the bottom of port quemado are two rivers of fresh water and at the entrance of the port both on the north and south side are several small islands or rather rocks keep midway between both points and you may go in very securely but this is no very secure port and seldom or ever made use of  a little to the southward of this port of quemado is the port of santa clara off this port lie four rocks and in the middle of it is a small river it is but a bad port lying open to the south west and other southerly winds which in the winter time blow very hard here this port lies in the latitude of six degrees north  from port st clara to the bay of saint antonio is five leagues all very low land which in the rainy time is covered with water only the tops of the trees to be seen along the shore are a great many small islands rocks and sholes therefore antonio is a small village now possessed by indians but formerly built by some franciscan friars who were put ashore here by the spaniards to convert the indians but it being a bad place often overflown with water and the indians being very poor the friars quitted the village of which the indians have now possession it is but bad going into this bay by reason of a great shole of sand which runs a great way into the sea from its northpoint and when you are in you lie open to the south the south west and other westerly winds  from this bay to the river sand is six leagues between which the land rises in six mounts not very high but at a distance they look like six islands they are called the anegadas and stretch from the bay of st antonio to the river of sand this river of sand is a great river and upon the banks it is well inhabited by indians who are not under the spanish government they are very poor and their poverty protects them from the spaniards who if there was any thing to be got would be sure to crowd in amongst them the coast all along here is deep and you may sail close to the shore in  0 and    fathom water clean owsie ground  sand to cape corrientes is twelve leagues cape corrientes is very high land and when you are at sea it looks like an island on the top it has three hillocks it is in the latitude of   d north and at the point of it lies a small rock it is a clear and good coast but often subject to rains  from hence the land runs into a great bay called the bay of bonaventura in which are a great many rivers islands and sholes from cape corrientes to the great river of bonaventura is twentythree leagues in the midway is the island palmas which is a small woody island and has a sand on the south east side stretching from one end of the island to the other whether there be any springs of fresh water on it i know not but very probably if any one stood in great need of water he might find some here for the rains fall very plentifully here so that in the valleys and holes there can hardly be any want of water this island lies in the latitude of   d    m n and we reckoned longitude from london w to be    d  0 m  from the river of bonaventura to the island gorgonia is twentyfive leagues s w between which are a great many small rivers at whose heads the spaniards wait for gold which washes down from gorgonia is in the latitude of   d north the island is pretty high and very remarkable for its two saddles or risings and fallings on its top it is a very woody island producing tall and large trees and on it are several springs of very good water the anchoringplace is at the west end of the island in a sandy bay but the water is pretty deep it is about   miles in length and   in breadth and at both the east and west ends is a small island which looks white occasioned by the dung of several sorts of seafowls which resort about them that at the east end is called flaminio and the other at the west end near the anchoringplace is called the isletta the coast near the waterside on the main is low land although very high within the country and here are some rivers that are shole for two leagues into the sea therefore keep off shore for if it be flowing water the currents will heave you ashore  from the island gorgonia to the island gallo is twentyfive leagues this island lies in a deep ensenada or bay off the island you will find not above four or five fathom water but at segnetta which is on the n e side you may ride safe in deep water and free from any danger london    d    m and we found variation   d vvesterly  to the north east on the main land distant three leagues is a large river called the river of tomaco and about a league and a half within the river is a town of the same name this is a small indian town the inhabitants of which commonly supply small vessels with provisions when they happen to come in here as they often do for refreshment at this river begins a great wood of trees which extends ten or twelve leagues to the southward if you stand in need this vvood may be very useful to you in making masts or otherways all along this coast are many rivers at whose heads both the spaniards and indians wait for gold which washes down from the mountains this is a very rainy place but especially from april to october which is the vvintertime here mexico you have continual thunder lightning and rain with many hard tornadoes your landmarks here are that the land is higher than the coast of gorgonia and is very full of hills and trees and particularly it has one very high mount  from the island gallo to point manglares is twelve leagues the coast runs n n e and s s w and between them is a little island or rather rock called gorgonilla from the point of manglares are several rocks and shoals which stretch out two leagues into the sea otherwise all the coast is clear and deep and good anchorground whilst we were here we found a strong current setting to the north but whether it be always so i know not from this point begins a deep bay called the ancon of sardinas it is about ten leagues over and in the bay are a great many sands and it is shoal a great way off so that it is ill venturing in with your ship close by the seaside it is all low land full of small rivers whose banks are very wellpeopled with indians the water of these rivers is very white and both smells and tastes very strong of musk occasioned by the many alligators which are in them at the south end of this bay begins francisco  from the ancon of sardinas to the river of st jago is six leagues all along the shore is full of white clifts and near the land the water is shole this river of st jago is a very great river yet ships enter but very seldom though the spaniards have a small village   leagues up and the banks of it are all along well inhabited by indians who have several plantations of maiz with walks of fruits and pens for cattle to wit beeves and hogs of which here is good store at the mouth of the river they say is four fathom water if you would enter keep nearest to the south east side and when you are over the bar there is very deep water it is a mile broad and the highest land on all the coast except st matheo which is seven leages from it this river lies in the latit of   d    m north longitude from london west    d  0 m  from this river to the bay of st matheo is seven leagues this bay is very high land and has a great many shoals running from it two leagues into the sea and for three or four leagues the water is shole not above four five or six fathom both to the northward and southward  from this bay of st matheo to the bay of tacames is seven leagues this tacames is lower land than the bay of st matheo and at its entrance between two sholes is a small island you may anchor in any part of the port to windward and the nearer shore the better anchorage and the deeper water here you may wood and water in this port were taken by don beltram a spaniard a few straggling english men he came hither unawares and took them as they were wooding and watering a small vessel off the two points of this bay run two dangerous sholes right off from the shore for near a league and half but between them both is pretty deep water and the southermost of the said two sholes stretches away along shore for   leagues to the point of gallera the coast here francisco  the point of gallera is a low point and off it lie many rocks and sholes you may know the point by this that there are two white cliffs upon it near the waterside  from point gallera to cape st francisco is two leagues it is a high cape but far higher within land than near the waterside when you are north or south from it it looks like three capes it is a woody mountainous land and has several white cliffs this cape is famous for the rich prize named the cacafogo taken just off it by sir francis drake in which was said to be eighty poundweight of refined gold twentysix tuns of silver with a considerable quantity of jewels we took off this cape two spanish ships one of   0 tuns laden with wine brandy sugar marmalett flower etc the other about sixty tuns laden with pitch tar and cordage this cape st francisco lies in the latitude of   d north and longitude from london west    d  0 m and we found here   d    m westerly variation  note that from this cape of st francisco to the southpart of the great island of california in the latitude of    d  0 m from april to november is the dirty june july and august also between the aforesaid places all the coast is full of worms and therefore very inconvenient for a single ship as we were but to the southward of this cape the spaniards constantly affirm there are no worms for those ships which trade only on the coast of peru and chili and never go to northward of this cape are never wormeaten this cape is as i may say the bounds of the rainy and bad weather it seldom reaching to the southward of it unless by chance perhaps not one year in twenty i have once heard that the rains came up as high as paita which lies in the latitude of   d    m s and is   d    m to the southward of this cape of st francisco but this was but by chance and i never heard from the spaniards that ever it went so high up excepting that one time in any of their memories  this cape of st francisco has at the pitch of it a small rock the coast here runs away more to the south eastward about three leagues distance from the cape is a small port called apottete near which is a round hill behind which is good wood and water and near it is  from appottete to the first river of cogimes is three leagues there are three rivers of this name and they lie close one by the other they are all full of sholes in most places stretching a league and more from the shore into the sea wherefore if you be two leagues from the shore you will do well to keep sounding but to windward of the said three rivers you may come nearer the land yet it is all along not very deep to coaque  a little to the southward of the southermost of these three rivers is a small and barren island right against which are the mountains of coaque these are very high mountains covered with large and tall trees at the foot of which is a small village of spaniards and indians called by the name of st johns village and near the village is the river of coaque which runs a great way up into the country  from the river of coaque to cape passao is twelve leagues between which two places is the river of sama and the baciabo the river of sama has a rock and shoal of sand just at its entrance and when you are about a mile further it divides into two branches the one running to the n e and the other to the s e but how far either of them runs up i know not the bay of baciabo which is about a mile to the southward of the river of sama is a pretty deep bay at the bottom of it are a great many white clifts which are supposed to lie directly under the equator the bay is rocky all round and at each of its points are some very dangerous sands which stretch four or five miles off to the sea from hence to the cape passao is about five leagues in all which way are many small points and bays most of which are very well clothed with several sorts of trees tall and straight and of various shapes and colors and the land is of an indifferent height this cape passao is a high round cape with but few trees on it it lies in the latit of 00d 0  m south longitude from london west    d  0 m and we found variation here   d    m westerly at the pitch of the cape are two rocks both of them visible above water and within the cape the land is pretty high and mountainous and very woody if you want to anchor near the cape you must  a little to the southward of the said cape is a small river from which to the bay of caracas is three leagues this is a pretty deep bay and at the bottom of the bay is a river called the river of charapoto which is said to run a great way up in the country in the middle of the bay is the common anchoring place and on the south side rightagainst the said anchoring place is a small village called the village of charapoto in it are not above eight or nine houses mostly built of palmetoleaves and inhabited by indian fishermen who have little or no other food but fish these people are very poor and the spaniards have little or no converse with them for that reason in the middle at the entrance  from the bay of caracas to the port of manta is seven leagues and they bear from each other n e and s vv between them are several points stretching out into the sea and between these points are several sandy bays the land is of an indifferent height and very full of trees right off the port of manta almost in the middle just at the entrance is a rock or small island which but just appears above water this port of manta is a small port but in it you are defended from the south west and other southerly winds which are the common winds upon this coast for from cape passao in the latitude of 00d 0  m south to and beyond cape blanco in the latitude of   d    m south there is seldom or never any landwind which is very observable because it is so contrary to all the rest of the coast for upon all the rest of the coast you have common manta is a small indian village said to be formerly a habitation of the spaniards in which they built a church that is still standing the best anchoring is over against it where you may anchor in seven or eight fathom water good fast ground the land hereabouts is very barren producing only a few shrubby trees and some small bushes the spaniards who had formerly possession of this place live now seven leagues within land where they have built them a large town called by the same name the other landmarks of this place are that on the northpart the land is of an indifferent height and monte christo looks like a sugar loaf from whence you will see the land run plain to the top of the cape of st lorenzo and is of an indifferent height also a little to the westward of the said port is a shole of quicksand which lies under water and the sea never breaks upon it many a good ship has been cast away upon it  two leagues to the southward of this port is a little rock pretty high above lorenzo is three leagues half a league before you come to the cape is a good anchoring place where if you want fresh water you may supply your self all the coast is deep and clear and you may ride in any part of the cape of saint lorenzo the cape is highest near the water side on it are only a few trees and bushes right against it are two rocks which look like two friars and are so called the one is high and slender and the other looks very bluff when you are off at sea the cape bearing north and distant about four or five leagues shows plain above and you may see the top of a steeple of a church or chapel this cape i make to lie in the latitude of 0  d south longitude from london west    d    m and we found variation   d 0  m westerly a little southward of the cape lies a shole of sand which stretches out to sea from the main about a league and is in breadth about half a league  from cape st lorenzo to the island plata is five leagues and they bear from each other e n e and w s vv this island is so called from the great quantity of plate which was shared here by sir francis drake and his company it lies in the latitude of 0  d  0 m south it is in length about a league and in breadth  from the island plata to the island salongo is six leagues this island is higher land than the island plata it has two small rocks which are pretty high the one at the south the other at the north end of it at this island is a pretry good place to ride in on the east side next to the main land and there is a parcel of white broken ground a little to the southward of the anchoring place  right against this island on the main land is the bay of picoya at the north side of which is a small anchoringplace picoya about three leagues up which live indian people who supply the spaniards with many necessaries  to the southeastward of this river and bay of picoya distant about two leagues are two small rocks called ahoreados or the hangdmen because machiaco the tyrant an indian king in a battle he had with the spaniards took two of them prisoners which he caused to be hanged one upon each of these rocks  from these   rocks a little to the southward is the river of colanche it is a fresh water river and in it is said to be four or five fathom water good anchorground the inhabitants who are indians carry water to the town of st hellena wherewith they supply that town right against the river but a good distance from it is the island colanche this island is said to be extraordinarily healthy and on it are some few indian inhabitants st hellena just by all round the island is ten fathom water close to the shore so that you may go from one part to another very securely  from the river colanche to the town of st hellena is four leagues this is a small town consisting of spaniards and indians they have commonly in it some store of provisions as biscuit pease flower corn dried fish salted beef pork and other necessaries with which they supply such ships as arrive here the best anchoring is in about seven or eight fathom water a little to the south west of the town the land is here very low and barren having no trees and so stretches away to the point of st hellena this point is high land and very even at the top it lies in the latitude of about   d  0 m south at a distance it appears like an island because the land about it is low and it bulges out into the sea directly to the west over against the point on the northside there is a bay and if you fall in there in the night keep your lead going and mind your depth till you can either get out or with convenience come to an anchor  hellena makes the north point of the bay of guiaquill as cape blanco does the south it is a great bay in which are some islands many rivers and abundance of sholes  from point st hellena to the point of chandy is about five leagues off this point lie several dangerous sholes therefore great care must be taken of coming near it  from the point of chandy to the island st clara is seven leagues north and south between which two places are a great many dangerous sholes and there is no going between the island st clara and the island of puna for all along on the east side of the island st clara and on the west side of the island puna are a great many sholes which stretch from one island to the other the island st clara which is the first island at going into this bay is an indifferent high island pretty well clothed with small trees it resembles a corpse in a shroud the east end representing the head and the west the feet  between this island and cape blanco which is about twenty four or twenty five leagues distant is the channel for ships who keep to the southward of the island and a good distance from the point of puna and steer away east till they have puna they have in the channel going in from thirty to twenty fathom water and when they are come up with the s e point of the island puna then the river turns away to the north and grows narrower and narrower to the town of guiaquill and the land all along by the sides of it is low swampy land over grown with small mangrovetrees  the town of guiaquil is a large town said to contain near five thousand inhabitants in it are several fine churches and other good buildings it is situated on the lower part of a declining hill so that the houses near the water side are often overflown it is pretty well fortified having two forts one standing upon the hill and the other in a valley near the south end of the town it is the third greatest place of trade on the coast of peru  from the town of guiaquil to the island puna is seven leagues this is a low island in many places overflown it is about thirteen leagues long and five broad at the point of arena is the common anchoring place for ships till they get a pilot to carry them close up to the town of guiaquil this point arena is a very low point from whence to cape blanco is twenty eight leagues all along tumbes upon the banks of which are fed store of cattle it is a passage for travelers there being a great road from it to several inland towns and villages  from the river tumbes to mancora is fourteen leagues a clear coast and from thence to cape blanco four leagues this cape is high land and from it blow such boisterous winds that it is a common proverb with the spaniards that the stoutest man of war must strike to cape blanco yet here is never any great sea this cape i make to lie in the latitude of   d    m s longitude from london west    d  0 m and we found variation   d    m westerly  from cape blanco to point parina is seven leagues in the midway is a small bay and port called malaca it is very seldom made use of and at its south point is a great shole which runs out to the n w into the sea above a mile therefore in going in it is best to keep nearest the north shore to avoid this shole between this shole and the point of parina malaca all is deep and clear so that you may ride where you please only you must mind that your groundtackling be good because of the hard gusts of wind which often blow here the point of parina is low land toward the sea side and at a distance it appears like two islands one of which looks round and the other cragged as if it was cut in pieces and to leeward of the point is a fine little bay  upon the coast of chili and peru from the island la moucha in the latitude of    d  0 m s to the point of garachina in the latitude of   d  0 n the wind is always southerly two points upon the shore thus when the coast runs north and south the wind will be at s s w when the coast runs s s e the wind will be at south etc except it be in the night and then the seawind commonly ceases and there comes a fine and moderate gale from the land  from the point of parina to the port of paita is seven leagues between which two places is the river of colan at the mouth of this river are two sands one on each side stretching about a mile toward the sea and in the middle of these two sholes is the channel which is pretty indian towns and villages the country hereabout is very mountainous and barren but the valleys are said to be very fruitful as they are all along to the southward upon this coast the highest mountains here are the mountains of motapa which are also barren and have many pieces of broken ground on them but at the top in two or three places the land is pretty even and looks like tables in this bay you have the land and seawinds constant the seawind is commonly at south and s by w which begins about nine in the morning and holds commonly till nine or ten at night then this wind dies away and about half an hour or an hour after the landwind springs up which is commonly at east right off the land and continues a fine fresh gale till about eight in the morning then it falls calm and soon after springs up the seawind as before up the river of colan is a town of the same name the indians of this town come down commonly with the landwind to paita in boats and bring fresh water to supply the town of paita and the shipping that be there for they have no fresh water at paita they also bring them wood and other necessaries and when the seawind blows the indians colan in paita bay is very good anchorground from twentyfive to six fathom water as you draw nearer the town the water grows shole gradually it is a fine large bay capable to contain near a hundred sail of ships it is all over sandy ground and in it you are defended from the south west and other southerly winds by a point of land which runs out between the bay and the sea so that ships riding within this point lie always in as smooth water and as safe as if they were in a pond it is in the latitude of   d    m south and we found variation here   d    m westerly within this point is the town of paita which is a pretty little town consisting of about eighty houses most of them spaniards although it is a place of no great trade yet it is seldom without shipping because it lies so very convenient for all ships going up or down and it is very seldom that any ship passes by without putting in here for refreshments of which this town is well supplied by those of colan  from paita upwards the coast runs w s w two leagues to pena oradada or golden rock from whence to the northermost island of lobos called lobos de terra is two leagues more and they bear from each other north east and south lobos has a shole and a great hollow rock at the north end of it which stretches out near half a mile into the sea the anchoringplace is at the north east end in four and five fathom water the island is of an indifferent height and is so like to lobos de la mar that though the spaniards are very well acquainted here yet they often mistake the one for the other it is a very rocky island not producing any thing and on it is no fresh water of seafowl here are boobies noddies penguins etc and of fishes here are sealions and seals in abundance  from this island to the point of paita is fifteen leagues north and south and between this island and the foresaid point is the bay of sechura a league from lobos de terra upon the main land is the chair of paita it is high land toward the seaside so that there is none like it between it and cape blanco the coast here runs east north east and south south west  a little to the south east is the port of monura which is said to be almost as good a port as that of paita there is very good fresh water to be had with abundance of several sorts of very good fish it is said to lie in the latitude of  from the windward point of this port of monura to the island of lobos de la mar is seven leagues this island lies in the latitude of   d  0 m south here is commonly a great sea the whole year through and the currents set along shore to leeward here paulo andrea and james querba two spanish captains were cast away it is dangerous coming near this island by reason of the many currents which always run here the island is not above two leagues round the harbor is toward the n e part whose passage is very narrow but it is indifferent safe going in to those that are any thing acquainted with it and within the entrance is a good port to lie and refit or clean a ship in but here is no fresh water and it is so barren that it does not produce any trees or bushes here are abundance of seals and sealions and several sort of very good fish  from the island lobos de la mar to the mount of etem is five leagues it i a high hill and appears round from which place the coast falls away lo by the seaside to the port of chiri yet up in the country the land is ver high and mountainous at this po ships often lade with flower  pacasmayo in this port is a rock which is hollow and which commonly has abundance of white birds about it here is fresh water but the spring is said to be three quarters of a mile from the sea whence they carry water to chiripi this port of pacasmayo is a brave port it lies in the latitude of   d  0 m south and the anchoring place is on the weatherside of the port near the mount of malabrigo here are said to be abundance of waterrats which often do great damage to ships cables  not far off is the port of malabrigo and near the port is a mountain called by the same name it is a high mountain and at the top of it is some broken ground near it you may perceive the breasts of chicama which stand above the town of pisan these are the marks for the port of malabrgo there is also to know the port by not above two leagues from the main a small rock called the rock of malabrigio this rock at a distance looks as if it was cut in two in the middle and it lies in the latitude of   d south the best place to anchor in is to leeward of the mountain of malabrigo bringing it to bear due south and there is no less than fifty fathom water good fast anchorground  malabrigo bears with the port of guanchaco alias truxillo south east and between these two places is the bay of chicama at the bottom of which bay is the river of chicama the banks of which are well inhabited by indians hereabouts is commonly a strong current setting into the bay of chicama and to the northward withal on the northside of the river of chicama is a small village of spaniards called the village de chao  hence a little to the southward is the port of guanchaco which is the harbor for truxillo in this port are two sholes of sand pretty near the shore but the anchoring place is without them it is but a bad port and without defense being exposed to all winds in it there runs so great a sea upon the shore that very often for three or four days neither can any boats go ashore nor come from the shore yet this is a place of great trade near the waterside is the town of guanchaquo which is a small fishing town and about six miles within land is the city of truxillo which is a large city and mostly inhabited by spaniards it has a great trade for flower brandy sugar wine and marmalett of which they export three or four shiploads every year with which panama guanchaquo is the port by which they export all these goods and it lies in the latitude of   d    m south  from hence not far to the s e is the mountain of guanapi a high mountain and which the sea falls very heavy upon to leeward of this mountain about a mile is a little island which runs out about a league and near to that island is a rock which is high and round and when you are at a distance from it it looks whitish this rock of guanapi and the island of saints are distant from each other nine leagues bearing n w and s e between them are two more islands one of which is called the island of clao four leagues before you come to this island it is somewhat dangerous and by that time you begin to draw pretty near the sholes you will see two little rocks one bigger than the other which rocks are rightagainst a small bay in which is a good port defended from the southwinds but here is no fresh water but what is fetched from a town three miles off from this bay toward the s e is another rock near unto the mainland off which rock is a shole about three cables length from it and more to the southward is the rock of santa distant about a league and a half near this rock is a santa and in entering into this port the spaniards commonly look out for a spot of land which is very plain and looks like a pathway when they see that spot or pathway they run in boldly and in the road they have not above   or   fathom water at this place at a small village a little within land called the village of orsa and inhabited by spaniards is commonly store of biscuit wood water and other necessaries to be had in the channel between the island and the main any ship may go keeping nearer to the island than the main and it is good to keep a pretty distance from the little island which lies near the land for there is foul rocky ground the island of saints is a league in length it is white ground and has three broken places one of which looks as if it were cut in two in the middle on the southpart of it is a little island at which there is good anchoring and it lies in the latitude of   d south  from this island to the port of cosma is ten leagues the coast runs n n vv and s s e at the south point of this port is a little rock and a small shole of sand all round it and within on the same side is a river of fresh water at the mouth of which is the common anchoring place and at the north point cosma is a very good port and in it you are defended from most winds it lies in the latitude of   d  0 m south and longitude from london west    d    m in the mouth or entry of this port there is no danger for all is clear and good ground on the southpart of the port is a great mountain called the mountain of mongon a little to the southward of the south point of the port and about a league from the mountain of mongon is a small low and even island called the isletta within which close in under the main are two small rocks  from the port of cosma to mongon is three leagues and from mongon to mongonilla four leagues this is a small port and seldom made use of yet in it you are defended from the southerly winds from mongonilla to the caletas is two leagues these are two small deep bays in both of which is good anchoring about a league to the southward of the southermost of these is the port of vermejo right before the mouth of which is a small and indifferent high island called the isletta this island has a bay on the east side called the bay of callibria and between the island and the port are some bad sholes this port of vermejo  the mountain of mongon which lies about seven leagues to the northward of this port is the highest mountain that is known on all this coast it may be seen at a great distance off at sea and many times ships stay a month or more by it by reason of the currents that set to the northward along the coast the best way is to keep off at sea as much as you can until you come into the latitude of callau  from the port of vermejo to guarmey is three leagues guarmey has a plain spot of sand and the land within is double and has some spots of sand on the top of it and within the port is a round white rock where there is good riding on the weather side in eight fathom water good clear fast ground in this port is a river of fresh water which runs into the sea near a parcel of rocks where the ships commonly unlade it is furnished with wood water and other necessaries it lies in the latitude of  0 d  0 m south and here the coast runs away s s w to the island of don martin  from the port of guarmey to jaquey of sarra is four leagues this piece of the coast runs away south between these jaquey of sarra to monjala is six leagues this is a little mountain which is nothing but a barren rock and at a distance to those off at sea it appears white and looks like a ship under sail from jaquey of sarra to the river barancis is nine leagues this is a fresh water river and runs a great way up in the country the banks of it are very well inhabited with indians and hereabouts are a great many fields planted with wheat from the river barancis to the port of supe is two leagues this is a small port and seldom made use of for want of trade although in it you are defended from the southerly winds the land hereabouts is high and mountainous and the mountains most of them very barren but the valleys are said to be very fruitful from this small port of supe to the island of don martin is three leagues this is a whitish island plain and even and lies about three quarters of a mile off the shore  from hence to the port of guara is one league this port lies in the latitude of    d 0  m south and we reckon longitude from london west    d  0 m on the windward part of this port is a mountain on the top of which are some pyramids a little to the northward of salinas it is the best port of the two but they are both something dangerous at this place is abundance of beef readysalted of which they send great store both to lima and panama  from the port of guara to tambo is four leagues the coasts runs n n w and s s e and in the midway is a small anchoringplace called the port of chancay it is all clear and good ground and this port of chancay is a very good port from whence is transported to lima wheat and store of other provisions in it you ride secure from the south winds from this port to the rocks piscadores is two leagues there are several of these rocks but the middlemost is the biggest about these rocks are abundance of several sorts of very good fish and upon these small islands or rather rocks are several indian huts inhabited by indians who are fishermen for which reason these rocks are called the piscadores within these rocks is a fine port called the port of anton de rodas in which is secure riding from most winds the land is pretty high and the hills mostly barren  the rocks piscadores lie due north and south with callau and east north east from the islands of ormigas which lie callau right off the shore the islands of ormigas are small on them are several pieces of broken ground with several small bays about them are abundance of several sorts of very good fish the fishermen come from lima to this place a fishing and here the indians make abundance of seafish oil  the island callau is very high and barren having neither wood nor fresh water nor so much as any green thing upon it it is two leagues long upon this island is the great city of lima which is the cityroyal for the empire of peru it is the seat of a viceroy and an archbishop it is a large city said to contain   000 spaniards besides a far greater number of mullattoes mostese and indians in it are said to be twentyfive parish churches all well built and very rich in gold and silver and precious stones the images of many of their saints being of massy gold it is well fortified having a castle of seventy brass guns fortyeight pounders close under which is the common place of anchoring and they commonly ride in six fathom water good fast ground the island is joined to the main land by a bridge of stone and almost one half of the city is on the other side upon the main land it is a place of the greatest trade of any on the west side of america and peruvian sheep which sheep they make use of to carry burdens for it is said one of these sheep will carry  00 pound weight with ease and that like a camel they will go two or three days without eating or drinking a little to the southward of the anchoringplace and off the point of callau is a shole of sand which runs a great way into the sea and right off the shole is a rocky island called the island of lima this island has several small rocks about it but the biggest of them lies at the south end this rock is called pena oradada or the golden rock because a galeon was lost near it in which was said to be a very great quantity of gold this pena oradada is very high and no ship can pass between these rocks or between the rocks and the island of lima but ships that come from the southward steer in between pena oradada and the point of callau till they come to the island of lima to avoid the great shole which runs off the point of callau and when they have past the point of callau they steer directly to the anchoringplace and in their way there is no danger in all this bay or port of callau is secure riding it being clear and good fast ground growing shallow gradually from twelve to four fathom water and in it you are defended from the southerly wind which is the common tradewind off this coast about this island and among the rocks are store of very good fish and upon most of them are some huts in which are indians who make it their constant employ to fish which fish they carry to lima to sell and then return to catch more this port lies in the latitude of    d  0 m south  four leagues to the southward of these rocks is pachacama near to which are two round rocks one bigger than the other and near them is another parcel of little rocks about eight or ten in number here the land is very high and mountainous having two or three rows of hills one within another  from these rocks to the port of chilca is three leagues it is a very good port and good anchoring the entry is on the north east side in this port is a rock called the tortois and when you are once within guiaquil the town stands two leagues from the port and is inhabited partly by spaniards and partly by indians it is but a small town consisting not of above twenty or twentyfive houses mostly ill built  from this port to the island asia is two leagues it is an indifferent high island about half a league long and has a defense for little ships near it lie two rocks  from this island to the port of canete of guarco is three leagues here the spaniards lade wheat for lima and several other places the marks of the port are that there is a high mountain called the mountain of guarco which appears as if it was split in two and the sea falls with a great force upon it it has a fort on the top of it which appears white when you are off at sea  from canete or guarco to chinca is nine leagues the coast runs n n w and s s e it is a bad port and in it is commonly a great sea here is laden whea and indian corn to be transported to lima and near it lie three islands which are distant from the customhouse of chinca three leagues and bear with it n e and s w  chinca to pisco is three leagues pisco is a bay in which is a port and at the bottom of the port is a river of fresh water all the coast is clear and good and there is good riding in six fathom water at this place they lade wine in great quantity with which they supply most places hereabouts the land is very high and mountainous the hills are barren but the valleys are full of pleasant vineyards with the grapes of which they make extraordinary good wine this being one of the chief places for wine on all the coast  from pisco to paraca is three leagues it is a good port and lies in the latitude of    d  0 m s hereabouts the valleys are planted with abundance of wheat and they also make store of wine  from paraca to the mount of st gallan is two leagues it is a high mount and barren having not any green thing upon it over against the mount is a high island called the island of lobos which is a league distant from the main about this island are many rocks and near the mount is a shole the mount lies in the latitude of    d south  the land here is of a prodigious height lying in ridges parallel to the shore three or four ridges one within the other and each surpassing the other  the weather upon this coast of peru from the latitude of  0 d south to cape blanco in the latitude of   d    m south is always fair here never being any storms of wind or rain although many times it is so hazey that there is no taking an observation with the quadrant also upon all this coast are but very few rivers they being in some places a hundred and sixty or a hundred and seventy leagues asunder whereas on the coast of mexico are abundance of rivers many within half a league or a league of each other also the rivers of the coast of mexico are always full and many times overflow their banks but these on this coast of peru are little and shallow and at some certain times of the year quite dry  in the island lobos is a good harbor which has two mouths but they commonly enter by that which lies to the s e and come out at that which lies to the n w  from this island to the mountain of asia is twelve leagues the coast runs n n w and s s e and it is pretty windy hereabouts near this mount of asia on the east side is an anchoring place cavales this port is somewhat dangerous by reason of several sholes near it it lies in the latitude of    d 00 m south one league to the s e of this port is a very good port called the port of st nicolas from whence to the port of st john is three leagues its entry is at a bay and you may go through any part of it this port is very windy and is said to have no fresh water at it they make a small quantity of wines which they send by shipping to lima and panama  from the port of st john to acary is nine leagues the coast runs s s e and n n w it is a low coast by the waterside although the land is very high and mountainous in the country and here is good anchorground but ships seldom anchor in it because of the high winds and great sea which is commonly here  from acary to attiquipa is   leagues it is high land toward the seaside and here begin the high mountainous hills and deserts of atico at this port ships of the largest size lade with corn and other necessaries it lies in the latitude of    d south it blows not so much here as near the mount of asia  from this port to the mount of atico is fourteen leagues the coast runs s e and n w it is a bold shore and high land  from atico to ocana is   leagues at ocana is a river of fresh water but at some certain times it is dry near the river on the main land is some broken ground and on the seacoast are some rocks which are called the piscadores about them are a great many sorts of very good fish and the inhabitants of ocana come hither often to fish  from ocana to camana is six leagues the coast runs s s e it is a good coast and here the spaniards make abundance of very good wine  from camana to the port of chule is five leagues this is a good harbor for ships but there lies a rock a little to the s e of it which you must not come in less than a league of for there is a shole about half a league round it but keeping a league from the said rock there is a good entry  from hence to the port of quilca is eight leagues in the way is the island guara which is a pretty high but barren island a little to the southward of this island is a good port called the port of ariquipa it is a good port in it are five great and small rocks of a whitish color they lie in the latitude of    d  0 m south and in going in the entry is very narrow but within there is eighteen ariquipa which vulcan is said to be sixteen leagues within land and is the highest of all the hills hereabouts whether it burns now or no i know not but i suppose by its name it has formerly from this port of ariquipa to the port of ylo is twelve leagues the coast runs s s w and n n e and two leagues from ariquipa is the river of tambo in which space is a league of low land near the seaside and there is good clear ground from six to twelve fathom water  from the river tambo to yerba buena is two leagues and from thence to the port of ylo eight leagues this is a good port to lade and unlade a cargo in and near to it is a river of fresh water called the river of ylo this as most of the other rivers of peru runs with a quick current from the beginning of january till the latter end of june and then it decreases running slower and slower till the latter end of september after which it wholly fails and becomes dry the waters not beginning to run again till january this most of the rivers on the coast of peru are said to do as constantly as the year goes about near to this river indians in which they have store of corn and other provisions and several sorts of very good fruits the point of ylo is low land and runs out into the sea it is dangerous coming near it for off it lies an island and several rocks it is in the latitude of    d south to those that are off at sea the point looks like two or three islands and it bears with the mount of sama s w and n e distance eight leagues  this mount of sama is a high mount and under it are four pieces of broken ground of a whitish color near to it is a small river called the river of sama  from hence to the river of john dens is four leagues this river lies in the very bottom of the bay of arica and the banks of it are very well peopled with indians  from the river of john deus to the river of arica is two leagues on the banks of this river is situated the town of arica it is a large town inhabited by spaniards mullattoes mostese and indians this port of arica lies in the latitude of    d  0 m south longitude from london west    d  0 m and we found variation   d    m easterly it i a very good port and is the embarcad peru it is a place of very great trade and seldom or never without shipping it is a good place to anchor in and the best and common anchoring place is close under the mount of arica which is a great high mountain and defends ships that ride there from the southwinds the depth of the water is about eight fathom without the anchoring place is a small island called the isletta the land here is very high and mountainous and from hence for near a hundred leagues to the southward it is very much subject to calms within thirtyfive or forty leagues of the shore these calms are not usual on any other part of this coast that i know of when the sun is in the northern signs that is from march to september the vveather is commonly fair and clear but when the sun returns back into southern signs then the vveather for the most part is hazy and the horizon so thick as often to hinder an observation  from the mount of arica to chacola is a league and half here is a very good anchoring place and from hence to the broken land of victor is a league and half more from thence to camarones is six leagues and from thence to tucames fourteen leagues the coast  from the arica to this place north and south  from tucames to the island yaneque is twelve leagues from which place they carry clay to lay in the valleys of arica and sama and here live some few indian people who are continually digging this clayey ground for the use aforesaid for the spaniards reckon that it fattens the land very much  from hence to the bay of majalones is twenty leagues all high mountainous land and a great sea falling upon the shore so that there is scarce any landing from majalones to the bay of salado is eight leagues in neither of these bays is there any fresh water  from the bay of salado to the mount of moreno is fourteen leagues the coast runs north and south in this port of the mount of moreno is store of salt and here is very good fresh water to be had it is a good port and in it you are defended from all winds within the port the best riding is on the northside it is a very high mount and like to the mount of capricorn which on the top has a great rock  from the mount of moreno to the mount of st george is twelve leagues except at this mount of st george there is no anchoring hereabouts  chap vii a description of the coast of

imperial the island la moucha river of tolton valdivia port the occasion of its name chili abounds most in gold as peru does in silver  from hence the land is all very high and barren to copiapo which lies in the latitude of    d south and we found indians who make good wine and here is good meat corn and other necessaries the marks of the mount of copiapo are that it looks like the point of saint hellena and that about a league to the southward is an island in this port they load wine money and other goods for coquimbo  from the island which lies by the mount of copiapo to the bay of salado is five leagues in which bay is an anchoringplace and a river of fresh water from the bay of salado to totoral is ten leagues the best riding here is on the north side of the point which will be a defense from the southwinds at this place is good wood and water to be had  from totoral to the port of guasco is ten leagues all the way high mountainous land but a clear coast from rocks or sholes within the port is a small round island and at the bottom of the bay near this island is a river of fresh water right against the mouth of which is the common anchoringplace the country hereabouts is said to be pretty well inhabited by spaniards in this port you are defended from the south and south west  from hence to the port of coquimbo is ten leagues coquimbo is a good port and the common anchoringplace is right against a small round island on the south side of the port called the island of tortuga without this island near to the south west point of the port are two rocks but any ship may go between them and the main for there is very deep water to the northward of these rocks are the islands of paxores which are eight or nine in number there is deep water between them and amongst them are caught several sorts of very good fish with which they supply the city of coquimbo some of these islands are very high and rocky but the land upon the main is not altogether so high as it was from copiapo to this place a little on the north east side of this port is a noted great hill in fashion of a sugar loaf at the bottom of which is situated the city of coquimbo which is said to be a large and very rich city i driving a great trade with lima panama and most of the south sea coast  coquimbo to the herradura is three leagues and they bear from each other south south east and north north west this herradura is a small deep sandy bay but seldom made use of by shipping although in it is good fast anchorground but the reason is it lies too much open to south west and other southerly winds  from the herradura to the bay of tongoi is four leagues at the bottom of the bay is a river of fresh water and right against the rivers mouth is the common anchoring place where is good defense from all the southerly winds  from this bay of tongoi to the port of lymary is eight leagues the coast runs north north east and south south west the marks of this port are that ir has a great mount near it called the mount of lymary the sides of which either to the northward or southward appear full of high trees and in the middle of the mount is broken ground and to the south west of it are two breasts or bosoms  from lymary to choape is ten leagues this choape is a high hill it has neither port nor anchoringplace but the coast is full of rocks  from choape to the port of govanadore is thirteen leagues this port lies in the london west    d  0 m the land is of a great height three rows of hills one within the other the port of govanadore is a good and safe port it is defended from the southwinds which are the common tradewinds of this coast the anchoring place is right against the lowest part of the land in twelve fathom water at the end of the small piece of low land is a hill which has broken ground on the top of it and looks like the chair of paita on the n w side of this hill is a grove of great high trees and near the port is an island on the north side of which is a good anchoring place and secure riding for the island it self keeps off the southerly winds  from this port off govanadore to the port of laligna is five leagues near the point of this port are two sholes on which at high water there is not above ten foot water in this port ships lie at anchor in five fathom water and here ships load with wheat and other eatables for panama  from laligna to papuda is three leagues it is deep but very good anchor ground it has a high hill with broken ground on the top of it and near it is a spot of trees so that it is very like the port of govanadore  papuda to the rocks of clintera is five leagues these rocks lie visible above water and near the land the currents set strong to the northward ships often sail pretty near these rocks for it is all clear and deep seldom less than twelve fathom water  from these rocks of clintera to the port of clintera is two leagues in it is deep water and the port has only a defense from the south winds but to all westerly winds it lies open this port bears with valpariso n n e and s s w distance sive leagues and between it is all very high and mountainous land yet between the hills are many pleasant valleys which afford good corn and wine  near the point of concon is a little bay in which are four small rocks each of these rocks has a small shole quite round them and the anchoring place is close over to the south shore and in between the said rocks at the bottom of the bay is a small river called the river of concon upon the banks of which are situated several small indian towns and villages here are several tall and large trees which upon occasion will make very good masts for ships  a little to the southward of this point of concon is a large river called the river chily upon the banks of which are several towns and villages belonging to both spaniards and indians this river is said to run some hundreds of miles within land about half a league to the southward of the mouth of this river are two small high rocks they lie about a mile and a half from the shore they have each of them a small shole of sand round them and there is no sailing between them and the main because it is sholewater  from these rocks to the port of valparizo or st james of chili is three leagues here are four or five small rivers running into this bay which make the port of valparizo i do not know any where so many rivers so near each other upon all the coasts of peru or chili but upon the coast of mexico it is very common this port lies in the latitude of    d  0 m south it is a place of great trade and from hence they send yearly several ships laded with corn wine etc and store of gold for although peru is reckoned to abound in silver yet chili is most abundant in gold here is a pretty town of three hundred houses belonging to the spaniards all pretty well built with brick but in none of these parts of peru or chili are they so well built as they are in and about mexico the reason as i mexico they have a great many of their materials from old spain which here they cannot so well have this place is governed by a spanish governor as are all the seaports but in the country within land there are several cities towns and villages governed by indian governors yet with subordination to the spaniards this port is famous for the great trade it drives with lima and the other parts of peru as also for the rich prize taken in it by our english hero sir francis drake in which ship he took a vast quantity of gold besides several other valuable commodities he also took the town in which he found store of provisions the anchoringplace is at the bottom of the bay close under the southshore in seven eight and nine fathom water good fast ground rightagainst the mouth of the river buajes where is a very good defense from all the south or westerly winds by reason of a point of land called the point of st james of chili which shoots out to the northward and lies between the anchoringplace and the sea at this point is a shole of sand which as the point does stretches away to the northward so that it is dangerous coming near the said point for the shole runs out beyond it near half a league and at high water there is not above  from the point of valparizo to the bay of zenaque is one league and from thence to the bay of rio another in this bay is a little rock which is called bishops rock from this rock to the bay of salinas is four leagues in this bay is a good anchoring place and it has a good defense from the southerly winds it is low land by the seaside although in the country it is very high and mountainous here are several small bays in most of which is good riding in ten fathom water  from these bays to topa de calma is four leagues between them are the sholes of raphael and a river of the same name right against them these sholes come out a league into the sea and there is no going between them and the main land for the water is very shole at topa de calma is an anchoringplace but it lies open to the southerly winds and near it is an island on the northside of which is a small bay in which ships upon occasion sometimes come to an anchor and in the said bay is not less than twentyfive fathom water this place is much frequented with high winds  topa de calma to lora is fourteen leagues this lora has broken ground like to lymary and part of the coast in the way is low land by the seaside till you come to the river of maule which is distant from topa de calma seven leaves in this river is two fathom at low water in it are said to be many indian towns and villages in which they have plenty of provisions it is a very windy place and at the entry of the river are two rocks half a league to leeward of which is a small anchoringplace from this river of maule to lora as i said before is seven leagues near to the broken ground is an anchoring place which has a defense from the southerly winds  from lora to the point of vnmos is three leagues it is a bad point having abundance of foul ground lying off it on this point were cast away two great spanish ships and all their men drowned it is good to keep at a distance from it  from the point of vnmos to the river itata is seven leagues the river is extraordinarily well inhabited by spaniads and indians and on the south side near the rivers mouth is an anchoringplace the coast is deep from topa de calma to this place without any port or anchoring place excepting those i have named  itata to the point of sinfonda is four leagues this point runs out a good way and to the southward of it is a fine bay called the herradura at the bottom of which is a river and on each side the river is broken ground this herradura is in form like the letter c it has three rocks at the entry and within is defended from the north and south winds  from the herradura to the island quiquina is two leagues north east and south west this island is apiece and on the east side is a small bay in which is very good anchoring in five fathom water ships that come from the northward go between this island and the main on the north east side when they are bound to the port of the conception and it is a clear and good passage free from any rocks sands or sholes and it is deep water but ships that come from the southward go in between the south shore and the south west side of the island but they always keep nearest to the island by reason of a rock and shole which lie about a mile and a half off the main this rock and shole is called the grifo and is very dangerous for several good ships have been lost upon it and a little within this grifo is another dangerous shole called the mormao a little the conception here are several small rivers but none of note this city is near to the seaside it is a very pleasant place having a fine river running through it and three quarters of a mile from the city is another fine river called anderlen ships that ride in the port of conception must come to an anchor rightagainst the fort of don garcia that they may be ready to sail with a north wind this is a place of great trade affording both corn wine and oil of which they send great quantitie yearly to lima panama and other part of peru this port lies in the latitude o    d south on the south side of the port near the mainland are sholes a along to the s w point which point  a defense from the southerly winds  about a league to the southward  this point is another port called the po of st vincent and between these tw points is a small island with several roc about it and at the point of st vince are some very dangerous sholes whi stretch off near a league into the s but within the port it is all good cle ground with gradual soundings from nine to four fathom water it is a ve good and secure port and in it is a defe indians  from this port to the river biobio is two leagues this river runs very strong with a great current and has two rocks at the entry of it at this river begins the high land of guera this land is accounted by the spaniards to be the highest land of any yet known in the world far exceeding the pico of teneriff or santa martha or any land yet discovered near this river are the breasts of biobio which are two high hills naturally in the form of breasts  from this river to labipi is seven leagues in the harbor of labipi is secure riding and it has a defense from the north and south winds near this harbor is the island of santa maria in the latitude of    d  0 m south this is a low island about two leagues in length it is very well inhabited by indians on the n e side is a fine deep and secure bay in which is from twelve to four fathom good fast sandy ground the water growing shallow gradually as one goes nearer to the bottom of the bay  from the island of santa maria to the island canero is ten leagues and they bear from each other n w and s e canero in this port is the island canero it is a small island lying on the northside of the port just within its entrance and at the bottom of the bay is a small river of fresh water in this port are no rocks nor sholes nor any danger but all gradual soundings and it has a a good defense from the s and s w and other westerly winds which are the worst winds upon the coast  the winds here are variable all round the compass as it is upon all the coast of chili upon the coast of peru from the line to  0 degrees of southern latitude the common tradewind is southerly with fine weather and no rain but here upon this coast it is common to have hard gales of wind and very often great showers of rain  from the port of canero to the hill of tucapel is two leagues this is a high hill with a plain or table land on the top and a little to the southward of it is a river of the same name the land hereabouts is very well inhabited by indians at the mouth of this river on the south side is a small point called the point of tixba  imperial is eight leagues this is a large river running a great way up into the country and the banks of it are very well inhabited by indians  right against the mouth of the river is the island la moucha this island is about four or five leagues in length it is pretty high land and very well clothed with tall and flourishing trees of several sorts and on it are several small rivulets of fresh water it is very well inhabited by indians who are always at war with the europeans for they think all white men to be spaniards this was the southermost and the first land we saw upon our coming into the south seas about this island are several sholes and especially on the west side which stretch out a great way into the sea on the east side is a fine bay in which is very good safe anchoring it lies in the latitude of    d  0 m south and i made longitude from london to this place west    d 00 m and we found variation   d    m easterly it was at this place that sir francis drake and his boatscrew going ashore for water and asking the indians for agua which is the spanish name for water the indians by their language thinking them to be spaniards with whom they are always at mortal variance fell english and with their arrows wounded every one of them but by the good conduct of sir francis he and his company got to his boat and so saved themselves to the ship  a little to the south of this island on the main land is the river of tolton which is a large river and here the rivers are commonly full as on the coast of mexico not drying away at certain times as they do on the coast of peru this river is distant from the port of valdivia    leagues  valdivia or baldivia is a noted place it lies in the latitude of  0 d south it is very well fortified and hinders the approach of an enemy in this port are a great many islands on one of which is situated the town and fortifications of valdivia this place as we were told by the spaniards was so called from one valdivia a spaniard who was formerly governor o it this man was said to be so covetou of gold that he would not by his goodwill let any body have any but himself the poor indians he would punish so barbarously that they often died under it and his reason was because they did no bring him gold enough he employe some thousands of indians to seek it an taxed them so much per day which the poor indians being not able to get an o valdivia thou have a very great and greedy desire after our gold we have used all possible means to satisfy thee but could not now by good hap we have thought upon a way here is gold drink thy fill for here is enough to satisfy the most covetous and immediately they bound him and poured it down his throat with which he presently died and with his death gave name to this town and port of valdivia the indians have ever since been at war with the spaniards and hold them hard to it and the spaniards are desirous by all means possible to conquer these people that they might be masters of so rich a country for though peru does abound in silver yet this empire of chily is the most abundant in gold and mexico abounds both in gold and silver cochineel indico and cocoa they have also in mexico many mines of iron but the spaniards think it not worth their while to open them  a table of latitude longitude and the variation in most of the principal places as we coasted along the three empires of chili peru and mexico latitude

over a high hill which we could hardly climb by our selves but seeing there was no remedy we first cut down the bushes which were in our way to make us a clear path after which the hill being pretty steep on the landside toward the bottom wherein was the fresh water we with our axes and shovels cut out steps in the hill and our sailmaker having in the mean time made us a canvaspipe of about ninety fathom january   0   we all went ashore to the plantainwalk and having cut down a sufficient quantity of them we returned at night on board our vessel intending to sail next day this evening two of our men who had resolved to stay with captain dampier left him and came over to us so that now we were    in number viz thirtyfour english and one little negro boy whom we had taken from the spaniards  dampier were busy in refitting their ship as well as they could the carpenter stopped the shotholes which they had in their powderroom with tallow and charcoal not daring as he said to drive in a nail for fear of making it worse and the four great guns which usually stood between decks were put down into the hold there being sixteen besides which was more than they had men to manage for there remained with them no more than twentyeight men and boys and most of them landmen  on the  st of february   0   we left the gulf of amapalla and captain dampier in his ship the st george at anchor in it we steered out between the island of amapalla and the island mangera and many times had not above two fathom water we had a fine gale of wind at n e which soon carried us out of the mouth of the gulf so long as we had been in any of the harbors on this coast of mexico we had seldom been allowed any thing but flower excepting that we used to go ashore and found upon the rocks store of conchs oysters muscles snails etc of which we made many a good meal but now being in hopes of per day with two ounces of saltmeat every other day our vessel was a small bark with two masts of about seventy tuns which we had taken from the spaniards but whilst we lay here she was so eaten by the worms that she begun to grow very leaky and to add to our afflictions we had no carpenter neither if any of us should fall sick had we any doctor or any medicines to make use of and which was worst of all we had no boat to assist our selves if our vessel should fail us for the doctor carpenter and boat were left with captain dampier but trusting to gods providence who had already delivered us out of so many dangers we proceeded on our intended voyage for india  on the   d of febuary we had a calm most part of the day and night and this day we caught several fish called yellowtails see fig xxviii which came swimming about our vessel these fish were about four foot in length he had twenty fins on his back one middling one near the hinderpart of his head one large one near the middle of his back and eighteen small ones stretching from the said large one to viz one middling one underneath near the gills one large one near the middle of his belly which goes in with a dent and eleven small ones stretching from the said large one to his tail which is halfmoond he has a very large head a great eye and is extraordinary good food it is very fleshy having no bone but the backbone these fish when taken by us looked very white but the tips of their fins and tail were yellow for which reason we called them yellowtails they were very welcome to us for whilst they lasted which was three days we saved our own provisions feeding upon nothing else but this fish  on the   d of february the first part of the day it continued calm in which time five or six turtles coming near the vessel we caught two of them which still served to help us out about six in the evening we had the landwind at n e a fine fresh gale so we took our departure from the mount of st michaels a noted mount of which i have already given a description it lies in the gulf of amapalla in the latitude of    d north we reckoned longitude from london west    d  0 m and as i said before we found variation ladrone islands knowing if we kept in that latitude it was impossible to miss them we had fine fresh gales of vvind first at n e but as we run off the land we found it edge to the n e by e and thence to the e n e where it continued with us till our passing the ladrone islands we now made us studding sails out of our mainsail and maintopsail we got our studding sails up by day break every morning and at sunset hauld them down again for it commonly blew so fresh in the night that we were forced to settle our topsail and with the rising of the sun the vvind would something abate again atlantic or eastindian oceans  for the first twenty days after our fish and turtle was gone we fed upon nothing but our plantains of which we allowed our selves two for a meal and two such meals a day but after our plantains were gone we went to our half pound of flower a man per day and our two ounces of salt beef or pork every other day the meat had been so long in salt that when we boiled it it commonly shrunk one half so we finding a loss in boiling our meat concluded to eat it raw which we did all the voyage after so long as it lasted we now and then caught a dolphin and sometimes saw a great many seabirds as boobies noddies etc which would come and settle upon our vessel and happy was he that could catch one of them  in this run i think none of us took the pains to observe by the az th compass for the variation was so little that we never minded it  april   0  toward evening we saw the clouds gather about the horizon much more than usual this was a great sign or token of land for magon bearing west distant about ten leagues see fig xxix it was a high woody island and very plain and green on the top so we stood toward it and when we had brought it to bear north distant about a mile i took the draught of it which appeared as in the figure being in so near we laid our ship by and several fishing boats came to us and brought us some fish with some eggs yams potatoes etc these were very acceptable to us for now our salt beef and pork was just at an end and we had nothing to trust to but our half pound of flower a day for each man and that very full of vermin maggots and spiders the men in those fishingboats were a very tall and largelimbd people of a tawny complexion having long black hair reaching down to their middle they all go starknaked not so much as covering their privyparts in exchange of what we had of them we would have given them money but they looked on it and gave it us again making signs to us to give them tobacco in the room of it which we did and spaniards at the sight of which they all bowed their bodies and came on board this island of magon i make to lie in the latitude of    d 00 m north and we made longitude from the mount of st michaels w   0 d 0  m or  0   miles allowing between    and    miles to a degree of longitude in this parallel the boats which these fishermen came on board in were about forty foot in length and about seventeen or eighteen inches broad aloft but not above three inches broad below their head and stern were alike the bottom to the waters edge was one entire piece but hollow upon which for the side of the boat was a piece of thin plank about three foot broad and of the same length as the boat it self it had its lower edge sowed with rattans to the bottom of the boat they had two long poles put out of one side one was within ten foot of one end of the boat and the other within ten foot of the other end so that they lay distant from each other about twenty foot the poles were about thirty foot in length at the end of which was a long piece of plank of about twentyone foot of the same shape and about one fourth part of the bigness of the bottom of the boat this piece is laid across bermudos sail it is not above two inches broad at top and hauls out by a boom when they have a mind to go about it is only letting go the sheet of the sail and hauling it aft on the same side at the other end of the boat and then that which was the stern before is now become the head any end going foremost and no distinction in the built of either end but the same side still and always remains the weatherside most of these boats were painted red see the figure of the boat with its outleaker see fig xxx   we were now in consultation amongst our selves whether we should steer away for the north west amongst the philippine islands or to the south west for the coast of newguinea but after a debate of about two hours we concluded to haul away south west for the cape of new guinea which accordingly we did and the same day passed by the island of guam which lies south from the island magon about seven leagues so that i make this island to lie in the latitude of    d    m north we only passed by it at a distance wherefore i can give no particular description of it yet as we passed by i took a draught of it as it appeared to us south distance   leagues the land to us seemed of an indifferent height but it was quite plain and flat on the top this island belongs to the spaniards who have a small fortification on it see fig xxxi it is kept for the convenience of the manilaship which always touches here to refresh in her way to manila  from hence we kept our course south west and passed by the island of matan which lies about six leagues due north from the islan guam and at six this same evening being april the   th we took our departure from the island of magon it then bearing north east distant nine leagues we still had a fresh gale as usual at east by north and east north east and on the   th we saw the island of arracife bearing east by north distant  0 leagues it seemed to be a very high island whether it is inhabited or no i know not  from hence we steered away south south west till we came into the latitude of   d north hitherto we had fine fresh gales of wind at north east but now drawing near the line we sound the winds veer depiction of island of guam fig    thus shows the island of guam the body of it bearing th distance

ceram fig    part of the island ceram  a fresh water river  which we watered  a small woody isl   first anchoring  the best anchoring place   the island bonoa per day this we used to scald with hot water and so eat it for want of sufficient food we now found our selves to grow very weak but it was our good fortune to have store of water of which when we could not sleep for hunger we would drink a large draught this would satisfy us a little at the present so that we could sleep but as soon as we waked we always found our selves as hungry as before  on the  d of may sprung up a small gale of wind at west and we steered away south till being almost out of hopes because the wind began to die away again on the  th about ten in the evening we smelt a very fine and fragrant smell which gave us new hopes that we were near some land we looked over our draughts but they gave no description of any yet we were sure we could not be far off some land from whence that fragrant smell must proceed so we continued in our hopes till the next morning when accordingly  at the same time we caught two bonetoes see fig xxxii which were very welcome to us for they made a good meal for all our company and this was the first we had had for a long time this fish is commonly of about three foot in length and two foot about it has two middling fins on his back with eleven small ones stretching to his tail he has the like number opposite under his belly with two large ones one on each side near his gills he has a very sharp head with a small mouth a full eye and a halfmoond tail it is a very fleshy fish having no bone but his backbone and they make very good broth  all this night we stood off and on designing not to venture too near these unknown islands in the night not knowing may the  th we found our selves within a ships length of a great ledge of rocks which ran from   island to the other which we not seeing before and thinking to go between the two islands had like to have been upon them but through gods great mercy a small breeze of wind coming from the shore we got off and stood to the westermost island because we saw many sholes lying off the rest of them the rocks we had like to have been upon were near the northermost island which upon account of our miraculous escape we called the island of deceit it having to the eye discovered no such danger when we came near the westermost island which was the biggest of the three we stood in for the island and as we drew nearer about forty or fifty of their flying proes came off in which might be about four hundred and fifty men allowing ten to each proe and we could see multitudes of people upon the shore for as we past by any of these islands to go to the next the people also followed us their flying proes lay at a distance from us and viewed us till we beckoned and made signs for them to come to us then one of them which was in the midst advanced toward us and being pretty near lay indians might knock us on the head with stones whilst we were in the water we concluded there was no good to be done here wherefore examining our water and finding sufficient for eighteen days at a quart of water to each man per day we resolved to leave these islands and to trust to gods providence the island of disappointment because we made certain account of getting some water here but could not they were all three low flat even islands full of several sorts of trees all very green and flourishing and no doubt if we had had a boat we might have met with something which would have been beneficial to our selves and of advantage to our country as we might also at several other small islands which we afterward passed by the inhabitants of most of these islands were a very large strongbond people they had long black straight hair which reached down to their middle and they all go stark naked not so much as covering their privyparts i think i never saw such a parcel of large stoutlimbd fellows together in my life we here found a current setting pretty strongly to the northward as it did ever since we left the ladrone islands  from these islands we steered away south west having a fine fresh gale of wind at east the water here was very foul being full of grass and other trash may the  th we saw the main land of newguinea bearing south by west distant eighteen or nineteen leagues and now with a few old broken boards which we had in our vessel we went to work to build us a small boat which afterward proved very useful to us the land was very high and mountainous at a distance it looked very black but drawing nearer it looked more gray the  th we had dirty squally uncertain weather and the winds variable all round the compass we kept the coast of newguinea aboard and the land still continued to be of a good height very full of great high hills and small valleys which all seemed very barren see fig xxxiii it is all a rocky coast neither could we perceive any harbor bay or place to anchor in whether there be any inhabitants hereabouts i know not but we never savv any nor any sign of any either by sea in boats or upon the land by fires or smokes as is usual in all inhabited countries  the same day we came abreast of two small islands neither of which was above a league in length they were lovv gillolo see fig xxxiii bearing west distant eight leagues this was also high land but not so high as the coast of newguinea we kept on our course steering west south west intending to go between the main of newguinea and the island gillolo this being our passage for the eastindian sea  from the  th to the   th we had dirty rainyweather for the most part with uncertain gales of wind and in the night it being dark and we not keeping the coast of new guinea so close aboard as we should we missed the common passage and ran past it and in the morning betimes found our selves amongst a vast number of small islands when perceiving we had overshot the passage and the wind being at east we concluded to look out for a passage to the southward amongst these islands accordingly we stood to the southward but found a great many rocks and sholes which stretched from one island to another wherefore at night there being little wind and not daring to venture further amongst these unfrequented islands and sholes we resolved to lie by all night intending in the morning if the wind should prove westerly to return back again and per day on the   th we had fair weather with a fine fresh gale at n e so we proceeded to the westward and at the same time had a strong tide setting to the westward about eight this morning we shot in between two high headlands which were distant from each other near two miles upon this some of us went to the topmasthead to look if we had a clear passage through and we saw not any let or hindrance so we got through this place by two in the afternoon it was in length about seven leagues and about two miles broad in it we could find no anchorground till within a ships length of the shore and then we had thirty fathom water the land here was of an indifferent height and very woody at noon the tide setting back to the eastward and it being calm we drove by five in the evening half way back again johns streighs and i believe we were the first europeans that ever past it  ceram bearing south distant nine leagues we then steering e by n having the wind at s e by s the island ceram at a distance seemed to be high land and looked very black this day we finished our boat which we were building it was twelve foot long and four broad on the   th we had fair vveather with fresh gales off shore so that we were forced to stand off and on as the vvind would permit this day we savv a sloop to the eastward of us which we would very willingly have spoken to but they kept from us standing to the eastvvard along the coast of ceram so we still plied in for the shore and at noon savv the island bonoa the island bonoa lies in the latitude of about  d    m south and it is almost in the bonoa and on the   th of may the wind veering about to the e s e and east we got in we anchored near the n w end of the island in thirty fathom water about a league from the shore we durst not venture any nearer in because of the many sands and sholes which lie off here but we sent our little boat ashore with two men and an empty hogshead to be filled with water when they came ashore they went up and down seeking for water and after some search found a small pond here they filled the hogshead and at night returned on board they could not see any inhabitants although the island is very well inhabited but this north and n w side of the island is very barren being nothing but great rocky hills not affording any thing but some small bushes this probably might be the reason that we saw no inhabitants hereabouts so that same night a laudwind coming off and we finding it very inconvenient watering here because we were forced to lie so far off shore with our vessel and our boat not being able to bring off more than one hogshead at a time we weighed from this place intending to water upon the island ceram on the  0th we got into the bay of ceram see fig xxxiv the bay here was very woody all round the land pretty low the water pretty deep close to the shore which was sandy quite round the bay from w s w to the s e and thence to the n by vv the bay it self is a defense from those winds and from the vv by s to the w n w the island of bonoa is a defense the island bonoa is much higher land than this part of the island ceram on the south side it is very well clothed with several sorts of large trees and the valleys are very fruitful in rice also on this south side it is said to be very well inhabited we staid in this bay of ceram till the   d at noon and then having filled eight tuns of water and having a fine fresh gale at s e we weighed from ceram and steered out between ceram and bonoa but kept nearest the ceram shore between these islands we saw several proes and a sloop we lay by and sent our boat to the sloop intending if they had any victuals that they could spare to buy some of them but the sloop made the best of her way and would not stay for our boat so our boat returned on board again  at the same time a large indian proe came on board us in which was a freeman of amboyna to him we declared our great want of victuals having had nothing for a long time to eat but flower and water and so little of that as would hardly keep us alive he told us if we would go to the island of manipa which was then in sight he would be our pilot and carry us in where he did not doubt but we might have rice enough for our money to carry us to batavia accordingly we steered directly for the faid island of manipa and in our way passed by the island keylan which is a small but high island very well inhabited and clothed with several sorts of trees its chief product is rice and some few cloves and here lives a dutch corporal with six soldiers whose only business is to see all the clovetrees cut down and destroyed from hence we proceeded to manipa where we arrived at about twelve east india company that it was not usual for any ships except those belonging to the dutch east india company to anchor there and that if any did they were not to supply them with any thing we told him it was through want of victuals that we were forced to put in here and that if we could have subsisted we should not have touched at any place till our arrival at batavia wherefore we desired him to go ashore again and declare to the governor our wants he seeing us in a very weak condition promised he would and that he would bring us word again accordingly he went ashore and at four  the evening returned again and brought  word that we should have no provisis there but if we would go to amboy there we might be supplied so to  great discouragement we were forced  leave this unfriendly place intending  the wind would permit to go for ama  manipa is in length s e and n w about fifteen miles in breadth about eight and lies in the latitude of about   d    m south and westward of the island bonoa about  0 miles it is a pretty high island and very well inhabited by malayans as are all the molucca islands it is shole almost all round which sholes some of them stretch a league and a half off the shore wherefore unless a man be acquainted or has good draughts of the place it is dangerous coming near it the island is of a good height but not so high as the island keylan before mentioned on it are several very good springs of fresh water and on the s w side of the island the dutch have a small fort of six guns the island is governed by a dutch sergeant three corporals and a mastergunner and they have under them twenty dutch soldiers on it grow abundance of cloves and rice of which they send great quantities to amboyna the inhabitants are most of them fishermen they catch abundance of fish here not only enough for their own use but also to supply amboyna with  from this place we stood to the south westward having the wind at s s e and it blowing fresh we reefed our top sails but when we got clear of the island amboyna the s e monsoon being set in which wind was right against us and besides it blew so hard that we could scarcely carry any sail and we could not think of getting to batavia because we had not victuals to carry us thither and besides as the wind was we could not weather the sholes which lie to the e s e of the island of bouton so being almost in despair and the wind continuing we kept our course to the southward till we came over against the island bouro and then the wind veering to the s s w we stood away s e but finding a strong current setting to leeward so that we rather lost than got ground and seeing no likelihood of getting to amboyna we by a general consent shared all that was eatable on board our vessel and the whole of what each mans share amounted to was six pound and three quarters of flower with five pound of bran which how long it was to last we could not tell however every one designed to be as sparing of his part as possibly he could  amblow which is a small island not above three leagues in length it is of an indifferent height and lies in the latitude of   d 0  m south it is pretty well furnished with trees of several sorts but not inhabited neither do i know whether there be any fresh water upon it from hence we continued our course till twelve at night when a hard gale of wind coming down upon us before we could hand our sails by reason of our weakness it almost overset our vessel it split our mansail and maintopsail all to pieces broke our mainstay and two of our foreshrowds we were then standing away south west and had the wind at south south east intending if we could weather the sholes to put for batavia but as soon as the squall was over it fell calm and then we had so great a sea occasioned as i believe by the meeting of several currents that we thought our bark could not hold it out she labored so much and the sea took us so ahead astern and on both sides that we were always almost covered with water  amboyna on the   th the wind continuing we held the same course and on the   th betimes in the morning saw the island of amboyna bearing due north distant about six leagues so we stood away directly for the island and by noon came just off the harbor  chap ix the a and the whole crew and ship secured at amboyna a particular description of amboyna its situation soil inhabitants castle buildings its subjectness to great earthquakes its government of the malayan inhabitants in it the hill malayans always at war with the dutch malayan slaves the custom of dealing with debtors womenslaves the product of the

hinomoa banda the governor of amboyna chief over all the spiceislands moskitoes very troublesome at amboyna the trial of a certain malayan for murdering his slave the a and part of his company released and depart from amboyna  at our going into the harbor of amboyna we met with two ships coming out these two ships were laden with cloves and bound for batavia the dutch captain of one of them came on board of us and demanded from whence we came whither bound and desired we would give him a journal of our voyage promising to return it again upon our arrival at battavia we satisfied him to all his demands and our agent for the owners gave him a small account of our voyage dutch ships left us at night the landwind coming off we run in for the shore to anchor but could find no ground with a hundred fathom of line till we came within a ships length of the shore and then we had twenty fathom hard sand here we lay all night and the next morning being in our account tuesday may the   th but according to the dutch account wednesday we having lost about eighteen hours by our going to the westward and the dutch having got six hours by coming to the eastward which makes the difference of time to be    hours two dutch orambyes with  0 paddles each came on board of us they brought the fiscal secretary and several dutch gentlemen and about thirty soldiers who took possession of our bark they also went down and sealed up all our chests and the two orambyes went ahead to tow us in and by noon we got up as high as the town where they moored our vessel in the common anchoringplace here we continued till the   st not knowing how they designed to dispose of us in which time they would not afford us any victuals although we proffered them a crown for a pound of beef pork or bread in the evening we were all sent on shore where they had provided us two rooms spanish dollar which was five shillings and a penny value he would give us no more than five dutch skillings for which was to the value of about half a crown and for this halfcrown we could have no more victuals than we might have bought for five pence if we had had our liberty to go into the town so that instead of having five shillings for our spanish dollar we had indeed no more than five pence  and now being at a stop for a while at this island of amboyna a place often mentioned for the cruelties used toward the english here formerly and having had time and opportunity to enquire into the manners ways customs of the people strength of the island and product of it i shall give a small description of it as far as i observed my self or could learn of any of the inhabitants though secretly  amboyna is in length north east and south west twelve leagues see fig xxxv it is a high mountainous land the hills are somewhat barren but the valleys are very fruitful the soil is black and the surface of it saltpetreish the middle of the island lies in about   d  0 m south it is inhabited by malayans who are the original natives they are of a middle stature and tawny but the women are of a brighter tawny than the men and have long black hair which reaches down to the calves of their legs they have round faces small mouths noses and lips they wear a linen wastecoat which reaches no lower than the lower part of their breasts and about their middle they were a piece of cloth about four yards wide and a yard deep this they roll round them and it serves them instead of a pettycoat for none are allowed to wear pettycoats but the dutch women only neither are any of the malayan men allowed to wear a hat excepting only their king  although the malayans are the most numerous yet the dutch are possessed of all the seacoast and have here a strong castle built of stone and mounted with sixty guns besides several other small fortifications in other parts of the island near this castle is a small town of map of island of amboina fig xxxv dutch houses all well and strongly built of stone brick and timber but all very low none exceeding one story because of the many earthquakes to which this place is very subject so that should they be built higher it would endanger the falling of them as they often do notwithstanding they are so low whilst we were here we had a great earthquake which continued two days in which time it did a great deal of mischief for the ground burst open in many places and swallowed up several houses and whole families several of the people were dug out again but most of them dead and many had their legs or arms broke by the fall of houses the castlewalls were rent asunder in several places and we thought that it and all the houses would have fallen down the ground where we were swelled like a wave in the sea but near us we had no hurt done  the island is governed by a council which consists of five persons viz the governor the chief merchant or upper koopman the malayan king the captain of the fort and the fiscal who is in the nature of a judge upon the island are said to be about   0 dutch soldiers with about   0 or   0 dutch freemen and pettyofficers and near as many chinese who live here for the advantage of trade although they are not allowed to trade in spice that being a peculiar trade which the dutch company reserve to themselves so that i reckon they can make in all about five hundred and fifty fighting men dutch and chinese as for the malayans they would be of little service to them but rather be glad to be assistant to any body against them the malayan women here are said to be great whores of which they are nothing ashamed they are soon ripe and often marry by nine years of age and many of them are said to have children by ten or eleven all near the waterside are forced to be under the dutch government which is very absolute and tyrannick over them for any small fault they are severely handled and many think themselves well if they are not made slaves and to wear an iron upon their leg during life those i say which dwell near the seaside are all subject to the dutch government and are christians but those within the country which are called the hill malayans are mahometans they are always at war with the dutch and if they take one of them prisoner at any time they never give him any quarter but after they have kept him in prison five days without either malayans that are present then they cut off his head and embalm it with spice to keep and they who can show most of such heads are accounted the most honorable and value themselves much upon it the dead body is left exposed to the ravenous birds of prey to feed on the dutch to retaliate this usage when they take any of these malayans lade them with many irons and lay them in prison where they continue some time after which they cut off their noses and ears and then they are sent to prison again where they continue some further time after which they are brought out the second and last time and they rack them till they die  as for those under their own government if they are found guilty of thieving they often cut off their noses and ears and put a great iron chain upon their legs and so make them slaves during life there were near five hundred of these poor wretches who were in continual slavery whilst we were here and they always took care to keep them employed some in sawing of timber others in cutting of stone some in carrying of dutch and having once made her escape and being taken again she knowing how severely she should be used cut her own throat the day before her appointed punishment after which she was by the hair dragged out of the prison all round the town  such as are in debt and cannot satisfy their creditors the creditors turn over to the company who send them to work amongst their slaves they have nothing allowed them but rice and water as the other slaves only they have twopence a day given them toward the payment of their debts which avails but little so that it is very seldom if ever that any one gets out till he is carried out dead  but though the poor natives are thus severely handled yet the dutch themselves will wink at one another faults so that it is a great rarity for any one of them to be punished unless it be for murder otherwise a small matter of money will buy off a great fault  the women that are slaves to the freemen have all the liberty that may be from their masters and mistresses only they are obliged every night to bring them a certain acknowledgement which is commonly about sixpence a day and to find their own victuals cloths etc in default of which they are severely used they may whore and deal and all is well if the daily acknowledgment  the chief of what this island produces is cloves ginger pepper rattans cams and some few nutmegs  the clovetree is not very great of body but rather slender it is in length from twelve to thirty or forty foot the branches are small the leaves about five inches long and two broad and end tapering one of these leaves rubbed between the fingers will smell very strong of cloves but without rubbing they have no smell at all the cloves grow just at the tip of the branches ten twelve or fourteen in a cluster they are first white then green then of a dark coppercolour which is the time of their being ripe the manner of gathering them is to spread cloths or sheets round the bottom of the tree for a good distance then they shake the tree and all the cloves that are thoroughly ripe and fit to be gathered fall down the rest which are left upon the tree they let hang for about six or seven days then they shake as many more of them off as are ripe and will fall this they do three four or five times till they are all down the usual time of gathering of them is in october and february those which are ripe in october are called the winter clove february are called the summerclove these are accounted much better and stronger than the former because these have the best part of the summer to ripen in whereas the former have not above a months fair weather and all the rest is rainy and cloudy so that the rays of the sun cannot come to them it is the common received opinion that cloves nutmegs mace and cinnamon grow all upon one tree but it is a great mistake these trees commonly bear sixty seventy or eighty pound weight at a time and every six years they are sure to have a double crop there is a vast number of these trees upon this island which are very carefully looked after and a register kept of them in the companys book they are numbered once every year and beyond a certain number they will not let them increase but cut them down and destroy them for fear of lessenning the price all these trees belong to the dutch company or to their freemen but those that belong to the freemen the company sets them an allowance as to d a pound so that properly all the cloves upon the island are engrossed into the companies hands and if any freeman or other sells or conveys away to the value of ten pounds all that he has in the world is forfeited to the company and he to be made a slave during life the inhabitants used formerly to put cheats upon the dutch in the sale of their cloves for it was common with them to put their cloves in a large sheet which they hung up by its four corners under the cieling of their house and upon the floor right under the cloves they would set a large tub of fresh water which the cloves being very dry and of a hot nature would by degrees draw up and make a large addition to their weight without being easily perceived but now the dutch are grown too cunning for them for they always try them by giving them a small fillip with their forefinger on the head and then if the clove be thoroughly ripe and no deceit has been used the head will break all in pieces like a piece of thin brittle glass but if it has been wetted  there are some few nutmegs upon this island the trees of which are much like the peach but they grow mostly at the island banda from whence two or three shiploads are exported every year the fruit of this tree consists of four parts the first and outward rind is like that of a green walnut the second is dry and thin which we call mace the third is a tough thin shell like that of a chestnut and the fourth is the kernel included in the said shell which we call nutmeg  there are said to be upon this island some mines of gold one of the malayans showed me some of the ore which he said was taken out of them but this he said was a great crime and if the dutch should know it he should be severely punished for this is an extraordinary secret which as much as they can they keep from all europeans  although as i said before they can raise about five hundred and fifty fighting men upon this island yet once every year they are forced to spare a great many of their people which are sent away upon other businesses for commonly on the  0th of october each year eight or ten days sooner or later the governor dutch soldiers i reckon there may be in this whole fleet of dutch about   0 or   0 and about    0 malayans reckoning seventy malayans to each oramby one with another these seventyfive orambies are divided into three squadrons the first consisting of twenty orambies which squadron is always commanded by one of the council who carries a yellow flag the rear consists of twenty more and is commanded by the fiscall who commonly carries a red flag the rest are in the middle squadron and attend the governor who has twelve dutch soldiers a corporal and a sergeant for his bodyguard and carries a blew flag the governor carries with him the indian king and all their princes for fear they should rebel in his absence in this order they go and visit all these eastern islands but especially those that do or would produce cloves or nutmegs and at every island they go to they have an additional strength the time of their cruizing in this manner is commonly six weeks in which time they cut down burn and destroy all the clove and nutmeg trees they can find excepting such as europe at amboyna alone and even there also as i said before they will permit but a certain number least a plenty of them should lower the price upon all these islands the dutch company keeps soldiers three six nine or twelve according as they are in bigness whose only business it is to see the trees cut down or at least to take care they do not increase for they are very jealous least the english or french should serve them such a trick as they themselves formerly served the english at amboyna during the time of their thus cruizing they gather tribute from all the petty kings and princes of these islands and commonly at the end of about six weeks return again  of beasts here are several sorts as beeves hogs wild deer etc of fowls here are also several sorts as the crockadore the cassawaris the bird of paradise etc  the crockadore is a bird of various sizes some being as big as a hen and others no bigger than a pidgeon they are in all parts exactly of the shape of a parrot their feathers are all over white excepting only a bunch upon their head crockadore crockadore for which reason they go by that name  the cassawaris see fig xxxvi is about the bigness of a large virginia turkey his head is the same as a turkeys and he has a long stiff hairy beard upon his breast before like a turkey he has two great legs almost as thick as a mans wrist with five great claws upon each foot he has a high round back and instead of feathers only long hairs and the same upon the pinions of his wings it lays an egg so big that it will hold a pint the shell is pretty thick spotted with green and white and looks exactly like chinaware i never tasted the eggs but the bird it self is extraordinary good victuals as i have tried several times it tastes very like a turkey but much stronger  the birds of paradise are about the bigness of a pidgeon they are of various colors and are never found or seen alive neither is it known from whence depiction of cassawaris fig    a cassawaris depiction of sea porcupine fig    a sea porcupine february and march they resort to the places where they grow viz to banda and this place and eat off the outerrind of the nut after which they fall down dead drunk and an innumerable company of ants gather about them and feed upon them and kill them  of fish here are also several sorts but the most noted is the seaporcupine see fig xxxvii it is in length about three foot and two foot and a half round it has a very large eye with two fins on his back and one large one on each side near his gills it is very full of sharppointed quills which are hard stiff bones and from thence is called the seaporcupine  of fruits here are plantains bonanoes pineapples etc the pineapple grows upon a low shrub with prickly leaves they are so big that they will commonly weigh two pound and two pound and a half when it is ripe it is yellow and red without and full of little bunches within it is yellow and so juicy that when you bite it the juice will run down your chin and clothes and the liquor  here is also another sort of fruit called a mangoe it is about the bigness of our common cucumber the outside although ripe looks green and within it is very yellow it is a very delicious fruit when ripe and has a fine fragrant smell when they are green they cut them in two pieces which they pickle and send to most parts of the world they grow upon a tree about the bigness of our common apple tree  this island of amboyna is sandy all round but the water is so deep that there is no anchoring near it but at the ley which is at the west end of the island in forty fathom water close to the shore and in the common harbor this harbor runs up a great way into the island and almost divides it into two parts so that they are almost two islands being only joined by a small neck of land so narrow that the malayans often haul their canoas over at the entrance into the harbor on the east side there english has been called the castle victoria  about two miles further to the north east within the harbor is the place where formerly our english factory was settled and near it is said to be the hole into which all the english were thrown after they had been massacred by the dutch there were few of us now here but expected the same fate and some of the inhabitants were no way shy to tell us that the journal which was sent in the dutch ships that we met going out hence for batavia was our protection for they were sensible that upon those ships arrival at batavia it would be presently known that a part of captain dampiers company was arrived at amboyna and from thence it would spread all over india and so they knew if we fared otherwise than well we should be enquired after  a little to the eastward of this island are several other small islands the most noted and biggest of which are boangbessey and hinomoa they lie east from amboyna at a small distance they are of an indifferent height and not above a third amboyna they are both pretty well fortified and produce store of cloves but the chief place for nutmegs is the island of banda which also belongs to the dutch it lies in the latitude of  d  0m south and bears from amboyna e s e distance    leagues the island is said to be in form of a mans foot and leg and to be pretty well fortified and as it has the preeminence for nutmegs so amboyna has for cloves  the governor of amboyna is reckoned the chief and headgovernour of all these spiceislands even to ternate and tidore which are also spiceislands in possession of the dutch and lie about forty miles to the northward of the equator  whilst we were at this island of amboyna we were so much troubled with moskitoes which are a sort of gnats that every night we were forced to put our selves in a bag before we could go to sleep for otherwise these creatures would so bite us that there was no sleeping and wherever they bite they commonly raised a red blister almost as broad as a silverpenny this would itch very much and many could not forbear scratching themselves so as to cause inflammations which sometimes are the cause of the loss of a limb    here we remained from the   st of may to the   th of september   0  at which time there being three of the companies sloops ready to sail hence laden with cloves twenty five of our men were sent away with them for batavia and we were ten of us left behind who were as they said to go in another vessel which was almost ready to sail  it was very observable that all the time of our being here none of us fell sick or died for this was the s e or bad monsoon which begins in the latter end of april and lasts till the latter end of september most of which time we had hard storms of wind with much thunder lightning and rain and the weather so very cloudy that for six or seven days together we saw not the sun the greatest violence of this weather is in june july and august and then it abates and at the latter end of september quite breaks up and then begins the westerly malayan inhabitants who are more apt to die of them than the dutch but i suppose the reason is because they are not so well provided with doctors and medicines as the dutch neither are they so well looked after they admired at us seeing we were fed with such bad diet and but newly come from sea very weak that we could bear up under so many hardships and inconveniences and it used to be their common saying that nothing of hardships or sickly places would kill the english so long as they had any victuals to eat  the reason why i have given so little account of the winds and seasons of the year in this whole voyage is because these things are so well described in capt dampiers  d volume but he not having spoken much of these moluccoes or spiceislands i have therefore endeavored to give the more particular account of them  september a malayan man was brought in here at amboyna to the statehouse to be tried for his life he was accused by his own wife for murdering his slave the slave had been dead about six months and she had concealed it but happening to fall out with her husband she went before the fiscal in the heat of her anger and declared it so her husband was put in prison and the corpse of the dead slave dug up but it being consumed and rotten no marks of any violence could be perceived upon it and it was generally believed that the mans wife accused him wrongfully he was upon his trial when the earthquake happened at which time i observed that it is a common error to suppose that during an earthquake it is always calm for we had a fine fresh gale at s s w both days on which the earthquake happened this earthquake made all the court break up being in fear the house would fall on their heads so the man was committed to prison again and the next day being september the   th about    at noon the court being set again the man was again brought to his trial when in about a quarter of an hour when his wife was in her greatest violence against him the earth shook very much again and caused them all to break up chinasloop for batavia how they proceeded further with the man i know not but many thought it a great token of his innocence that the two several earthquakes happened the two several days just at the time of his trial the other five of our men which were left behind they promised should be sent after us in a short time but we never heard of them after  chap x departure from amboyna and arrival at the island of lancas the islands cabeses the island bouton

from the a in the gulf of nicoya departure from the cape for england penguin island and birds an earthquake felt at sea great difference of cold in  0 d of northern and  0 d of southern latitude and the reason of it the islands of faro return home  from amboyna we steered away s w by w till we came to the island lancas and in our way passed by the island amblow of which i have already spoken the island lancas is a short low island on which is store of wood it is not inhabited and all round it for a good distance is said to be shole water it lies in the latitude of   d    m south and i made meridian distance ftom amboyna     miles or   d    m west  from hence we steered w by n for a small time till we came up with the two islands cabeses where it falling calm we sent our boat ashore to the eastermost of them and cut down some hundreds of coconuts which we carried on board this was also a low island not inhabited but all round full of coconuttrees which are planted here on purpose for the use dutch ships and vessels as pass by here for batavia for it is a great rarity to see any european shipping here besides the dutch off this island we met our bark which had brought us from america to amboyna the dutch after they had taken her from us fitted her up put a mizenmast in and made a very good vessel of her this island lies in the latitude of   d    m south and nearly w by n from the island lancas distance about    miles it is shole two miles from the shore to the s w of this is the other island of cabeses which is a pretty high island and upon it the dutch always keep six soldiers and a corporal who two or three times a year go round the island to see that no cloves be planted and if there be they cut them down and burn them for fear least any other nation should take it from them which if they should i am apt to believe amboyna would be of little use to them cloves being the only product valuable upon it  from hence we passed by the southpart of the island bouton which lies in the latitude of   d    m south it is a pretty large island taking up above a degree and half in latitude  from hence we steered to the westward and passed between the island celebes and the island zalayer the southpart celebes is very high land it is very well inhabited and is a very large island taking up seven degrees in latitude at the southend of this island on the west side the dutch have a factory called macasser where they have a fort of about seventy guns manned with six or seven hundred dutch soldiers the chief product of the place is rice with which they supply all or most of their eastern islands here are also said to be several goldmines of which the dutch are not yet masters for the inhabitants are often at war with the dutch and pretty well defend those places  between the southend of the island celebes and the island zalayer are three small low islands and the best passage is between that which lies next to the island zalayer and a little small one which lies to the northward of that this is called the second passage from zalayer and is accounted the best for in the first passage from zalayer are many sholes but in this second it is deep water the third and fourth are also deep but if you go through with the seawind you will be so nigh the shore of celebes that you must be forced to anchor till the landwind comes wherefore the second is always accounted the best passage and most ships rather than go through the first  the island zalayer is of a moderate height it is inhabited by malayans and planted all round with coconuttrees the inhabitants are forced yearly to send store of oil and match to the dutch at macasser as a tribute  from hence we steered w by n having had the wind in the eastern quarter ever since we left amboyna till we had passed a dangerous shole called the brill and then we hauld up s w and in the night saw a small island just by us which finding we could not weather we tacked and stood the other way till daylight and then finding our selves to the southward of the said island we tackt and stood to the southwestward and soon after saw two other small low islands bearing from the north to the northwest we could see the ground very plain for about two miles and never had above six or under five fathom water though it looked as if there was not above two fathom we came over this shole about a league to the southward of the said two small islands and this is accounted the narrowest part of the shole for further to the southward it is five or six leagues dutch in most of their maps unless in such as they give to their own people have laid down the dangers to the southward which should have been laid down to the northward of the two islands and the safe sholes which we and they always go over they have laid down to the northward of the two islands whereas we and they also went over to the southward of them we had a draught on board belonging to the captain of the vessel which showed all this very exactly as we found it i compared it with several others which were on board and found a great deal of difference i asked the captain the reason of their difference and he told me that the hollanders knew all the sholes and dangerous places hereabouts very well but did not desire that any body else should know them so that if any foreigner should come into these parts amongst these sholes and sail by their dutch policy to keep all ships belonging to the english or french as far off these eastern islands as they can or at least if any do chance to come amongst them and happen into their hands as we did to take care to send them away from among them and to let them know as little of them as may be  on the   th of october we passed by the dutch factory called rambang and on the   st arrived in the harbor of batavia here we were sent ashore to the bombkey to the rest of our men who had been sent hither before and were not yet cleared and soon after the major of the castle was sent to us and desired we would send to the general by him an account of our losses and damages which we received by our being taken at amboyna and that we should be satisfied upon all accounts both as to our lost things loss of time and imprisonment accordingly we each of us drew up an account of our losses and sent it by the major to the general who returned us answer that very speedily we should have satisfaction and our freedom on the october we were all sent for to the fort and most of our ready money was returned to us again but for our goods loss of time and imprisonment we could have no satisfaction only the general told us he had given us all that the governor of amboyna had sent to him and that if there was any thing more he knew nothing of it and that we were now at our liberty to go where we pleased we desired that since our vessel was taken from us by the company of which he was the head he would be pleased to take care to find us some ship in which we might return home which he promised he would we were forced to be content and went and took lodgings in the town till we could meet with an opportunity of returning home  and now being at a stop here for a while i shall give some description of this north coast of java the island is in length east and west about ten degrees and from the east end of madura to this port of batavia you have the common land and sea winds in the easterly monsoon the landwinds are at south east sometimes more southerly and the seawinds at north east fine pleasant gales this easterly monsoon is accounted the good monsoon it being fine fair clear weather beginning in april and october but the westerly monsoon is called the bad monsoon being rainy and blustering weather with much thunder and lighting especially in december january and february this bad monsoon begins in november and ends in march or the beginning of april in it the landwinds are at west south west and south west and the seawinds at north west and west north west the anchorground all along the north side of java from the island madura to batavia is brave oazey ground and clear of rocks the principal places on this side of the island are batavia bantam japara samarang surabon taggall the quale and rambang all these places are settled by the dutch they afford rice with which they supply all their outfactories hereabouts as also very good plank to build shipping with the chief place of building is rambang where the freemen go to build their small vessels as sloops and brigantines also several ships of five six or seven hundred tuns lade with timber at rambang the quale japara etc and each ship when full takes a great raft of the largest of the timber in a tow to batavia some of these rafts are said to be thirty foot square and to draw twentytwo foot water there are commonly fix of these batavia where the shipcarpenters are usually kept at work nay they are said to be never out of employ they are about two hundred in number and the island is called unrest a very fit name for it for here is said to be no rest for an idle person the dutch careen all their ships here and it is very well fortified being all round a bed of guns  batavia is the chief place the dutch have in india receiving by shipping the product of india japan and china it is inhabited by several sorts of people as dutch portuguese chinese persians and negroes but the malayans are the natives the dutch are masters of the place and have a very fine large town in which are seven churches dutch portuguese malays and chinese with several very fine spacious houses built after the european manner the town is all walled and moted round and upon the walls are planted store of cannon in the middle of the town in a great square place is a very sine and handsome statehouse where all affairs are transacted holland who has the title of general of india and all other governors are subordinate to him the inhabitants here do not care how often they change their general for at the coming of a new one all prisoners are released excepting such as have committed murder he has twelve to assist him who have always the title of raids or lords of india these are such as have been formerly chief governors in several places in india as of ceylon amboyna malacca etc the town is divided by rivers over which almost in every street there are bridges laid and bombs to haul across which let no boats go in or out after sunset  at this place grows the tamarindtree whose leaves shut and open according to the rising and setting of the sun and much like this is another tree that buds in the night and as the sun rises blooms a flower almost like a lilly so that the tree will be full of these flowers by noon and when the sun is down within half an hour the flowers will be all fallen off and not one left upon the tree this i have seen daily  the chief product of the place is pepper of which the dutch yearly export  of fruits here are plantains bonanoes oranges lemons pomegranates mangastans and rumbostans  the mangastan is about the bigness of a goldenrunnet it is quite round and looks like a small pomegranate the outside rind is like that of a pomegranate only of a darker color but the inside of the rind is of a fine red within this rind is the fruit which is of a fine white and lies in cloves almost like garlic there are commonly four or five of these cloves in each and they are very soft and juicy within the cloves is a small black stone we commonly suck the fruit from the stone and the fruit is very delicious the stone we throw away being very bitter if chewed  the rumbostan is about the bigness of a walnut when the green peel is off it is also much of the shape of the walnut and has a pretty thick tough outerrind which is of a deep red and is full of little knobs of the same color within the rind is the fruit which is quite white and looks almost like a jelly and within the fruit is a large stone it is very delicate fruit and though a man eat never so much yet it never does him any harm provided he swallows the stones  but this place is so well known to most europeans that it needs no further description  on the second of december all of us which had a desire to return to england were ordered on board the dutch east india fleet and the next day the whole fleet consisting of about twelve sail weighed anchor and left batavia on the  th we arrived at bantam where we wooded watered and refreshed our selves and took in store of provisions as beeves hogs etc for our supply during our passage to the cape this is also a dutch factory and the chief trading is for pepper on the   th we weighed from bantam the westerly monsoon was set in pretty hard against us but however having a strong current setting to the windward we made shift to turn against the monsoon yet it commonly blowing very hard at night whilst we were in the streights of sunda we used to run in under the java shore and there anchor till the next morning all through these streights the coast is good and bold and though there be many sholes yet the soundings are good even in the most dangerous place which is between bantam and batavia but no man will venture to  on the   th we came up with a small high island called princes island it lies at the west end of this straight of sunda and from hence we took our departure for the cape of good hope we had nothing material happened to us in this our passage and we arrived at the cape on the  d of february   0   having been just two months in our passage and here we found four ships belonging to our east india company  the cape of good hope is the southermost part of africa situated four degrees and a half within the southern temperate zone near it is the table bay a very healthy place and producing all necessaries for the life of man the dutch are masters of this place and have here a fort of about fifty guns which they were now about moting round half a mile to the westward of the said fort they have belonging to them a pretty town consisting of about a hundred and fifty dutch houses and a small church situated under a very high mountain called the tableland the town and fort are under a governor and a fiscal who as i have said before is in the nature of a judge  hodmandods and are certainly the next to beasts of any people on the face of the earth both men and women are of a middle stature with small noses little mouths and eyes and an oval face they have a woolly head of hair like the guinea or angolanegroes both men and women cover themselves with only two raw sheeps hides just as they come from the sheeps back in the day they wear them like a mantle over their shoulders and in the night when they sleep one of them serves to lie under them instead of a bed the other to cover them and thus like beasts they lie men women and children the whole family together they smear or grease themselves very much which makes them stink abominably and the thicker they are with grease the more they are admired by one another the women to distinguish themselves from the men wear dried thongs of the sheeps skins rouled round their legs from the ankle to the knee which makes their legs seem as big as posts and they looked like a roll of tobacco they also wear a long cap made of the same which goes up tapering like a piramid but their clothing is the same as the mens viz two raw sheeps european whatsoever the men are not at all jealous and care not how many europeans lie with their wives yet they will beat their wives severely if they know them to lie with any of their own nation besides themselves they are a people that will eat any soul or nasty thing for if the dutch kill a beeve or a sheep they will beg the guts out of which they squeeze the dung and without washing or any cleaning at all cut them into small pieces and lay them upon the fire and as soon as they are hot through take them off and eat them  their children when they are young are something inclining to be white and were it not for their nasty way of greazing them they would make likely men and women for they are most of them very well featured the dutch did formerly what they could to bring them to the knowledge of the true god and to leave their nasty way of living  i was told a story by the person with whom i lodged here that some years since the dutch sent two of these hodmandod men to holland where they were very well clothed had a good maintenance allowed them and for the space of four years were sent up and down to see the several parts of holland and other countries adjacent the dutch thinking this would be a means of bringing them to a more civilized way of living but it proved ineffectual for the two hodmandods at their return as soon as they got ashore tore off all their clothes and returned to their old beastly way of living  africa their housholdgoods are seldom any thing more than two earthen pots one broken the other whole the broken pot serves them instead of a drying pan and the other to boil their victuals in  they are no way ingenious neither do they follow any trades the most of their delight is in looking after flocks of sheep and in this the dutch often employ them if one of them does half an hours work for a dutchman or any european he will demand a doublekey which is a piece of money that goes for twopence and if there be occasion to work him from morning till night he will demand no more  the land hereabouts is very mountainous and the mountains are most of them very barren producing only a few small shrubby bushes and within the country etc these wild beasts the dutch kill after this manner they make a pretty large circle upon the edge of which they fix five six seven or eight posts about eighteen or twenty foot from each other upon each of these posts is a musket made fast the muzles of which are all placed so as to point to the center of the circle the muskets are well loaded and from the trigger of each musket is a small line reaching to the center of the said circle and there fastened to a piece of raw flesh which when a wild beast seizes upon most or all of the muskets go off and seldom fail to kill him any one that kills a lion is paid by the public fiftytwo guilders which amounts to four pound six shillings and eight pence and for killing a tiger he has a reward of twentyfour guilders or forty shillings there was a scotchman whilst we were here who killed four lions three tigers and three wild elephants for which he had his reward according to the aforesaid proportion  this place produces several sorts of fruits both common and not common to us in europe as pomgranates watermelons chestnuts with some few plantains and bonanoes and store of very good grapes of which the dutch make a very  of beasts here are great store to wit lions tigers elephants etc which all run wild up and down the country but near the towns they are seldom seen here are also abundance of sheep very large and i think as good meat as ever i eat  of fowls here are also several sorts but the most noted as i think is the ostridge which is a very large fowl the bird it self is little valuable but for its feathers which are sent as rarities to several parts of the world their eggs are very good meat as i have experienced many times that these birds do feed upon iron stones or any thing that chances to be near them is fabulous but like a great many other fowls they peck up small stones which only serve to digest their proper food they are of several colors as black white etc  of the sea inhabitants the most noted is the seal or as the dutch call it the seahound they are the same as those before spoken of at the island juan fernandoes only the furr of these is not so fine  dutch have a small house and four guns mounted here they always keep a lookout and at the approach of any ship or ships hoist a flag and fire as many guns as they see ships to give notice to those at the town  during our stay here there arrived some more east india homeward bound ships both dutch and english also here we met with some of our men that had left us in the gulf of nicoya and went away with our chiefmate they gave us an account that in a week after they left us they went into the port of ria leon on the coast of mexico where they took two spanish ships at anchor one of which being very old and wormeaten they immediately sunk which being done they sent two of their prisoners ashore with a letter to the governor in which they demanded  0000 dollars for the ransom of the other prize the governor sent them word that the owners of the said ship were poor and that the town was also poor so that they could not give so much salinas and hauld their vessel ashore and cleaned and refitted her and from thence with all the haste they could they proceeded on their voyage for india and in fifty four days reached the philippine islands having kept all the way in the latitude of    d north amongst the philippine islands a canoa came off to them with a spanish priest in her him they detained and sent the canoa ashore for some fresh provisions as a ransom for the said priest which accordingly was sent to them and they released the priest from thence they went to the island pulo condore but sinding the english all cut off they went for mocoa in china where after they had given an account from whence they came goa to serve the portugueze some to benjar to the english and others to serve the mogull  on the   th of march we having refitted our ships and refreshed our men and taken in store of fresh provisions and there being a fresh gale of wind at s e we all weighed from the cape and went out between penguin island and the main land having the main on the starboardside and the island penguin on the larboard this is a pretty low sandy island in the middle of which upon the highest part of it they have a few guns mounted and near them a flagstaff on which at the approach of any ship they hoist a flag and fire a gun to give notice to the town this island takes its name from a vast number of birds called penguins which commonly resort near it these birds are about the bigness of a wild duck they do not fly but flutter having no wings but only stumps like young ducks and these stumps are instead of fins to them when they are in the water they have a sharp bill but feet like a duck and their flesh is but mean victuals  we were now twentyfour sail of us viz nine english and fifteen dutch and the gale continuing soon carried us into april english ships sailing very heavy fell a stern and lost our company they put into st hellena and as we hear since were taken out of the road by the french  on the   th we had twenty five hogs killed for the ships company and the commodore ordered a hog to a mess that is to every seven men to dispose of as we pleased besides our daily allowance so that we had more victuals than we could tell what to do with  on the   th a man being barbarously murdered on board the dutch vice admiral the murderer was brought on board our ship and tried for his life and the same day condemned to dye he owned he did the murder and desired the favor of the court that he might choose his death which was granted and he chose to be shot which the next day was accordingly done all the fleet lying by till his death and then we all made sail again  on the   th we saw the island of ascension but did not touch here for turtle although it was their laying time the reason was because we were so well provided with provisions at the cape that we had no occasion for more and english ships being willing to keep us company they also did not touch here  on the   th we had fine fair weather with a fresh gale at south east about eleven this morning happened a great earthquake at first it seemed as if the ship run along upon the ground so we heaved out a lead on each side with two hundred fathom of line but found no ground the whole fleet felt the shock at the same time so that for half a quarter of an hour there was nothing but making of signals and firing of guns we then reckoned the island of ascension to bear south east distant about forty leagues  hence we steered away to the north westward and on the   th of june saw four sail of french privateers they lay a while and viewed us but did not think fit to come amongst us  on the  0th we found our selves in the latitude of    d  0 m north which was the furthest to the northward that i ever was and here i could not but take notice of the difference of cold in this place and in  0 d of southern latitude for there we had continual showers of snow or hail and the weather very cold whereas here on the contrary we found the weather very fair and moderate america having it to the west of us likewise when we were to the northward we were always pretty near the main land of europe having it to the east of us now being near the land we always account the landwinds to be the coldest and the seawinds the warmest thus the north easterly wind is accounted the coldest wind we have in england holland etc but in the same latitude north near the coast of america the north west wind is commonly accounted the coldest and in the same height of south latitude on the coast of america the south west wind is the coldest as near the cape of good hopo the south east wind is the coldest now the westerly winds at such a height both in north and south latitude having generally the predominancy over the easterly very much alter the degrees of the heat or cold of the weather for which reason in the south part of america the westerly wind caused cold weather but to the northward the westerly wind caused warm weather and as the easterlywind being near the european shore is the coldest so being near the american shore in the same height of southern  on the  d of july in the evening we saw the islands of faro bearing east by north distant about eleven or twelve leagues we also sounded but had no ground at two hundred and ten fathom at twelve at night we had ground at eightyfive fathom and at three the next morning at seventy fathom on the  th of july at noon the opening of the two islands of faro bore south east distant about eight leagues we then steering north east and ground at eighty fathom small pieces of broken shells all last night we kept firing a gun once every half hour to give notice to the cruizers whom we expected to meet here  on the  th according to our expectations we met with our convoy which had been cruizing for us they consisted of eight dutch men of war four victualers and three of the companies privateers after mutual salutations we proceeded to the south eastward being all bound for amsterdam and on the   th of july we all arrived safely in the texel and on the   th got to amsterdam where we continued a while after which my self and the rest of our company went to see the several parts of holland as delf rotterdam the hague etc august   0  after many dangers both by sea and land we happily arrived in england being but eighteen out of
