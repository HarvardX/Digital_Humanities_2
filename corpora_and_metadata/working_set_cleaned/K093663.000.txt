an accurate and descriptive catalogue of the several paintings in the king of spains palace at madrid with some account of the pictures in the buenretiro  by richard cumberland author of the anecdotes of eminent painters in spain  london printed for c dilly in the poultry and j walter charing cross mdcclxxxvii  advertisement to the reader this catalogue was made at my request by the gentleman who has the superintendance of the royal collection in the palace at madrid and by his favor transmitted to me after my return out of spain but too late to be inserted in my anecdotes of spanish painters there can be no doubt therefore of its being accurate and i have accordingly so stated it in the title of this publication if the descriptive part had been executed by the same hand i might have safely recommended this performance even to professors of the art i must now address it to the lovers only and submit my weak attempt with all its errors to the candor of the public  catalogue of paintings in the new palace frescos   great staircase by d corrado giaciunto the composition of this brilliant ceiling represents the rising of the sun apollo surrounded by various allegorical figures and emblems gives life and motion to the elements spain as a matron habited in an imperial mantle with several attributes and insignia proper to her character the coloring drawing and design very masterly  the staircase itself is a very magnificent work projected and executed by the celebrated sabatini a neapolitan architect to his catholic majesty    great guardchamber by d juan bautista tiepolo vulcan forging the armor of aeneas at the request of venus mars in a triumphal character superintending and protecting the work various figures emblematic of the provinces religion valor victories and productions of spain    ballroom by corrado in the center of this ceiling religion is seated and the church triumphant enthroned amidst the clouds to which spain is offering gifts and incense in an attitude of adoration the nations subject to her empire are introduced with their respective emblems in the four corners are the elements in medallic compartments over one of the entrances there is a group of various figures with boys employed in placing crowns of palm upon the principal characters over another entrance hercules is described in the act of pulling down his pillars at the command of neptune who in his chariot passes the streights making his way through the barrier of ancient navigation this is a very brilliant design rich and glowing in color and execution and producing a very superb and striking effect    kings antichamber by tiepolo the monarchy of spain as a majestic matron in an imperial mantle with a lion at her side an attendant figure in the act of placing a crown on her head apollo with his lyre and the muses form a separate group castile in the character of a female with her proper attributes hercules breaking down his pillars for the purpose of laying open the barrier of africa sacrifices and oblations represented in four medallic compartments and addressed to the deities who appear in the principal composition    grand saloon by the same master the painter has here personified the various characters of the spanish monarchy the figures are emblematic of power religion wealth plenty victory etc etc the provinces of spain are disposed over the cornice with their proper attributes the medals in the angles are by the same master but the boys that support them and the naked rivergods as likewise the gilt compartments where the elements are represented are by the hand of robert mitchell this ceiling and all the embellishments are profusely rich and splendid  tiepolo was a student of the venetian school and died at madrid in the kings service on the   th of march    0    kings dining room by a r mengs the apotheosis of trajan the deified hero is seated on a throne of resplendent glory the virtues and attributes of a perfect monarch surround his throne a chaplet of laurel is supported in the air by five imaginary beings under which the artist has contrived to delineate the victories of this imperial spaniard the temple of immortality appears in view and the choir of muses are seen in the act of celebrating his glories other allegorical figures are interspersed in the composition with extraordinary judgment and contrivance    kings supperroom by the same the apotheosis of hercules he is conducted by mercury to jupiter who invests him with the crown of immortality as a reward for his labors and conquests a group of deities assist in the ceremony the distinguishing characteristics of the several deities male and female are marked with great taste and much classical precision the artist has given proof of his profound study and experience in the antique the coloring perspective and general disposition of these two ceilings are inimitable there is no crowd flutter or deficiency in the whole or part the several groups conspire and harmonize in the most perfect and beautiful manner the eye is not distracted by any predominance of detached parts but receives the whole magnificent composition as one complete picture at a glance  these frescos especially the apotheosis of trajan are as i conceive far superior to his paintings in oil and in this province of his art mengs appears a very capital master i have never seen any thing equal to them and so admirable they appeared to me upon repeated visits that i must believe there are few productions in art which can better gratify the curiosity of a traveller one thing is clear that mengss coloring in fresco is totally of another cast from what he practiced upon canvass    kings retiringroom by tiepolo juno in her car with her proper attributes etc    queens first antichamber by luis velasquez the four cardinal virtues with several allegorical accompaniments this painter must not be confounded with the famous diego velasquez   0 queens second antichamber by antonio velasquez the subject nearly corresponds with the above and the artist has treated it pretty much in the same manner both are respectable performances antonio was the brother of luis velasquez     queens dining room by francisco bayeu the conquest of grenada     presence chamber by ant velasquez christopher columbus in the act of offering the newdiscovered world to the catholic sovereigns the four compartments in the angles represent the provinces of mexico peru chili and the philippines     state bedchamber by mengs another beautiful composition of this master representing aurora going forth in her car drawn by horses all the emblems of morning are exquisitely conceived the breaking forth of light which is personified the accompaniment of the hours the group of night and her attendant emblems in the rear of the procession and all the correspondent embellishments in high relief are finely executed in these are represented the four seasons of the year and the elements     prince of asturiass chamber by tiepolo the conquest of vellocino     princes dining room by the same hercules in a car drawn by centaurs the muses and graces celebrate his victories     princes saloon by domingo tiepolo diana in the chase domingo was the brother of juan bautista tiepolo     princes dressing room by mariano maella the choice of hercules  maella was a disciple of mengs and is now in the service of the king as royal artist he has made several portraits of the royal family i have seen some good original compositions of this master and several copies from mengs and the elder painters of great merit and truth i am convinced he is a man of talents and candor and could refer to a striking instance of his honor and integrity i would recommend it to any artist or lover of art who shall visit madrid to introduce himself to the acquaintance of maella from whose courtesy i am persuaded he will receive all possible good offices and assistance     princess of asturiass antichamber by gonzalez the arts     princesss presence chamber by bayeu the fall of the giants   0 princesss cabinet by maella juno solicits aeolus for the winds     princesss drawing room by bayeu the deification of hercules the virtues and sciences attend     infant don gabriels dining room by the same religion and the concomitant virtues     infants drawing room by luis velasquez allegorical composition relative to the kingdom of spain     infants cabinet by domingo tiepolo a group of birds with great variety of composition and delicately executed  pictures kings antichamber titian two large pictures of sisyphus and prometheus in their torments the figures above human size they were painted by this master in spain and are figures of great force coloring and expression the manner of treating the prometheus much resembles that of a celebrated picture on the same subject at kimbolton castle as the noble owner has no determined tradition of its author i shall hazard a conjecture that it was painted by rubens upon the idea of this figure of titians after that artist had visited spain  titian four halflength pourtraits of women not in his brightest manner  titian four pourtraits of men seemingly of the same period one of which is a pourtrait of the great artist himself in his advanced age a grand and venerable piece  titian a pourtrait of a boy full length correct and beautiful nature  titian two fancy compositions companions the figures half length one two bacchants the other a venus admiring herself in a mirror which cupid holds up to her face with one of her hands she presses her bosom which is uncovered and the action is delicately expressed these pictures hang level with the eye on each side of a door fronting the great entrance the effect is remarkably striking the relief bold and the coloring nature itself but perhaps the execution has not that finished delicacy which many of his earlier compositions have the characters both of one and the other are certainly of a wanton cast the person halfuncovered halfconcealed with such a studied negligence of dress and so much playfulness of expression and attitude that the draperies seem introduced sor no other purpose but to attract the attention more strongly to the charms they do not serve to hide  titian venus presents a cup to a nymph two satyrs in the back ground with baskets of fruit this like the former is the venus lasciva the contrast of hues between the prominent figure and the satyrs in shades is managed with masterly address  all who are conversant in the works of this master will better conceive the striking effect of these three compositions than any description of mine can convey in whatever collection they hung they would certainly be very dangerous neighbors to most other colourists who came in contact with them  titian adam and eve in paradise the size of life a very capital picture upon a large canvass both figures of consummate beauty and of a sublime and chaste character their attitudes simple natural without any trace of the academy in their disposition the carnations are not florid and the whole hue of the piece rather duskier than is usual with this master the background presents a noble landscape the scenery finely charactered and in beautiful harmony  rubens a copy of the above on a cloth of the same size this copy hangs between the windows in an unfavourable light and opposite to the original it is a masterpiece of coloring and though it has missed the delicacy of the model i am inclined to think it has surpassed it in force and effect it is evident that rubens has put his whole strength to the work and as his efforts have been decidedly addressed to the coloring his figures have a broader nakedness if i may so express it than they have in the original whereas there is a purity in titians nakedness which is in character with the subject and fully corresponds with the most refined conceptions of human nature in it is primitive state of innocence and beauty when we contemplate titians adam and eve we are convinced they never wore clothes turn to the copy and the same persons appear to have laid theirs aside and exposed themselves to shame for the credit of the painter  tintoret two noble compositions from sacred history companions the one a judith with the head of holofernes the other a martyrdom of saint ursula and her companions the characters in both are of great grandeur finely conceived and executed with peculiar brilliancy and spirit  paul veronese two charming pictures and the subjects beautiful one a venus and a sleeping adonis the other cephalus and procris both natural size  juan labrador two flowerpieces of the best master spain ever produced in this style of painting these pieces are held in high esteem and though in company with works of a superior cast will attract the admiration of the beholder it has never been my chance to meet with any paintings of the like sort which i have thought comparable to these of labrador he died at madrid in   00 at a very advanced age see anecdotes vol i p      pedro orrente a nativity a capital composition this picture was removed from the chapel de los reyes nuevos belonging to the cathedral of toledo orrente was a familiar of the inquisition and died in      very old he was a disciple of bassan and greatly savoured and employed by the minister olivares he colored in the style of his master but in his choice of nature did not imitate his vulgarity of taste in correctness of drawing he has rarely been exceeded he was buried at toledo where he died and is deservedly to be numbered amongst the most eminent spaniards of his profession  see anecdotes vol i p      bassan nine pictures of this master viz adam naming the brute creation noah introducing them into the ark its companion both charming pictures two upon scripture subjects four of rural and domestic scenes one very beautiful of orpheus harping to the beasts   these pictures have been drawn from the great collection of bassans in the buen retiro but it does not appear to have been a very judicious selection for they have certainly left many there of a superior merit to these particularly some upon historical subjects in a great style and which are probably the most capital of their master any where to be met with  kings dining room velasquez five magnificent pourtraits by this greatest of all the spanish masters adorn this stately chamber it is altogether one of the most striking spectacles that can meet the eye few scenes are to be found that can better repay the curiosity of a traveller and a stranger to the works of this great painter the magnitude of these objects the force and vigor of their coloring the proud character they are displayed in the profuse splendour of the draperies and more than all the stately horses on which they are mounted dressed out with such redundancy of embellishment conspire to produce an astonishing effect of these pourtraits four are of royal personages viz  philip iii and iv and their respective queens  the last and best is the pourtrait of the conde duque de olivares minister of spain and patron of the artist there are etchings of all these pourtraits copies of which i brought over from spain  rubens philip the third on horseback a very noble pourtrait  vanlo philip the fifth on horseback and queen isabella on foot the inferiority of this artist is rendered very conspicuous by the contrast of the capital pictures abovementioned  rubens four compositions of this master hang over the doors viz a hercules resting from his labors the judgment of paris pluto in his car apollo in his course capital pieces   the sculptures in this and the antichamber above described are numerous and fine in the former there is a remarkable bust of seneca by bernini and in this several of roman emperors and empresses antique an infant hercules sleeping of exquisite workmanship etc etc  kings supperroom velasquez the famous familypiece of the infanta da margarita of austria afterward empress of germany with various other persons in different employments a large group the painter has introduced two dwarfs and what adds greatly to its value he is represented in person in the act of painting the infanta whose pourtrait appears upon the easel it is related of this picture that king philip with his own hand painted the order of santiago upon the drapery of velasquezs figure which order he was not till then possessed of when charles the second of spain showed this picture to luca jordano he exclaimed with rapture and surprise senor esta es la theologia de la pintura anecdotes vol ii p     a copy of this famous picture upon a small scale was taken for the late lord grantham when he was ambassador in spain and brought over by his lordship to england it is to be hoped his successors in that station will follow his example and obtain copies or drawings of other capital pictures in that kingdom  titian charles v in complete armor his lance in his hand his vizor up and himself mounted on a beautiful horse he is preparing to pass his troops over a river which is described in the scenery of the background of the size of life upon a very large canvass this picture sets all description at defiance at least all such description as i can attempt i cannot doubt its being the most capital pourtrait of the master and has been so esteemed by the best judges who have seen it there is reason to believe that titian rated it as such himself  in the countenance of the monarch we read his history or which perhaps is nearer to truth recollecting his history we acknowledge the agreement of character in every line and in the reflection of his features we find the painter has recorded the annals of his life never was more expression of a mind committed to canvass a pensive dignity prevails traced with marks of pain and bodily decay he is deep in thought his eyes gloomy and severe the lids heavy inflated and remarkably low over the eyeballs the underlip projecting and the mouth characteristic of revenge and resolution he is advancing to give battle to the unfortunate elector of saxony and the landgrave those opposers of his power and of his faith external objects have no share in his attention the whole man is engrossed by the deepest meditation his lance is poised parallel with the ground and ranges along the side of his horse with the point advanced beyond its breast the action of the animal harmonizes with the character of his rider slowly and composedly stepping forward the head low and submitted and the eye expressive of the most resigned obedience to his imperial master all is calm and still in the scene no flutter or disturbance in the objects the coloring drawing and perspective are the life itself the whole is such perfect nature that art seems extinguished by its own excellence  titian philip ii in armor his infant son raised in his arms whom he is devoting to fame which is represented as descending from the skies in the act of crowning the newborn prince with a wreath of palm on a scroll are these words  majora tibi  the artist has put his name to this picture in the following words  titianus vecellius eques caesaris fecit  vandyke the infant don ferdinand on horseback  castiglione gladiators very fine and spirited this picture is doubtfully ascribed to castiglione but my catalogue gives it to him without any remark  cavallero maximo gladiators its companion  these two pictures hang over the doors and have both great merit  titian venus and adonis and europa on the bull its companion  these also hang over the doors and are beautiful pictures every spectator must regret that they are not brought down nearer to the eye but these and many other instances occur of oversights in the hanging of this collection which i am informed was arranged by mengs and as it should seem with some partiality to his own performances  kings dressing room velasquez a group of spaniards carousing these rustic bacchanalians are evidently sketched from nature bacchus is introduced sitting on a cask putting a garland on the head of a peasant who kneels at his feet on his left hand is a group of five other rustics one of which holds a goblet of wine another a can and another has a leather bag slung across his shoulder their faces are grotesque and savage and strongly marked with the castilian cast of features on the right hand of bacchus are two figures attendant upon him one of these is naked and sits at his back leaning on one elbow and in the other hand holding a narrowbottomed drinking glass with wide lips the other is in strong shade in the foreground his face turned from the spectator in a crouching attitude embracing a large earthen amphora which stands on the ground both these figures are crowned with wreaths of vine and the god who has a mantle loosely thrown over his waist has his whole head covered with a large cluster of broad vine leaves in a grand and picturesque style his countenance is strongly charactered in the moorish or andalusian cast with a broad nose full lips wide mouth and black sparkling eyes the figures are of the size of life a very capital composition  velasquez a composition on the subject of mercury and argos its companion  velasquez the forge of vulcan the cyclops are at work and apollo is introduced who is disclosing to vulcan the intrigues of venus with mars the painter has here chosen a subject which enables him to display his art in its sullest extent and he has persormed it with consummate address the effect of light and shade from the reflection of the forge and the sparks which fly from their hammers produce a striking effect the athletic forms and dusky hues of the cyclops are artfully contrasted with the beautiful proportions and fine tints of apollos person the character of vulcan is finely conceived the story well told and the group disposed with great judgment  velasquez the celebrated picture of the tapestryworkers or women weaving tapestry a wonderful representation of nature in the best style of the master and of his clearest coloring  velasquez the famous aquador or waterbearer of seville one of his earliest productions see anecdotes vol ii p    velasquez two pourtraits of dwarfs sitting on the ground these dwarfs belonged to philip iv one has a large volume before him and is turning over the leaves by his side are pen and ink and a commonplace book a correct resemblance of deformed nature  velasquez a fulllength pourtrait of an old man with papers in his hand said to be the alcalde ronquillo  velasquez two fulllength pourtraits of dignified characters very fine  these complete the number of ten pictures by this master here brought together and though there may be superior pictures of velasquez in this palace in the escorial and particularly the dead christ on the cross in the monastery of san placido yet there can no where be seen such a collection of his works under one view and whatever lover of the art shall enter this room i am persuaded he will not depart from it without a very high respect for this illustrious spaniard  murillo two large and fine compositions on scriptural subjects viz the annunciation and the nativity   murillo two small ditto very delicately touched and finely colored viz the espousals of mary the mother of christ and an infant jesus sleeping   murillo a jesus with st john the baptist in his last and best manner an exquisite piece middle sized  murillo a holy family large size  murillo a virgin halflength with the infant jesus entire standing  lanfranc an assumption with a glory of angels small size very beautiful ponz in his directory calls this a guido  vandyke two pourtraits of ladies of the austrian house in the religious habit of the royal carmelitish convent one of them appears to be the infanta dona margarita both halflengths  titian three halflength pourtraits of noble persons  spagnolet saint john saint bartholomew mary magdalene and mary of egypt   exquisite samples of a master whose merit cannot be fully known but to those who have seen his works in his native country  luca jordano the flight into egypt  abraham sacrificing his son its companion  david teniers four landscapes with a great variety of figures excellent  there is also a picture by a master unknown in the flemish style a composition of great labor and minuteness after the manner of brughel representing a cabinet surnished with a variety of pictures statues flowers and articles of different sorts highly finished  mengs a nativity the figures of the size of life  this is his celebrated picture which the king has covered with a magnificent plate of glass it was painted at rome and sent from thence to madrid in the person of one of the shepherds the artist has introduced his own pourtrait the whole is labored with amazing care and study and very tenderly colored his miniatureeducation is conspicuous in this performance and the infant is remarkably diminutive and delicate the subject perhaps precludes originality and it does not seem to be attempted it is scarce necessary to add that this picture is a great courtfavourite all the works of mengs are generally extolled in spain and this the most i have observed however that the opinions of mankind at large with regard to his rank in the list of artists run much into opposite extremes and this is generally the fate which eminent men experience in the judgment of their contemporaries this does not seem to proceed from any want of present capacity to ascertain the degrees of merit in men before time has pronounced upon them with more authority but is rather owing to the good and evil passions of mankind to their likings and their antipathies to an affectation of singularity and a vanity to be thought a leader in taste and a discoverer of latent merit surprised by these motives into sudden applause we commit ourselves to it with a warmth which though it frequently cools we dare not disavow and thus become parties in the reputation we are pledged to support  mengs an incarnation its companion this also was painted in rome and transmitted from thence  kings closet teniers twentyfour pictures of this muchadmired master small in size but of admirable execution hang in this room and form of themselves a most valuable collection  two of these are satirical and ludicrous allegories on the subject of the arts  two others are much in the same style and represent the temptations of saint anthony  the rest are landscapes of various sorts with figures and cattle of these i shall not offer any description which scenes of this sort do not admit of like pictures upon historical subjects the eye of the artist will dwell upon them with delight if we may suppose for a moment that this whole magnificent collection was at sale perhaps these pictures of teniers would be amongst the very first that modern virtuosi would reach at  wouvermans an exquisite picce the landscape a most beautiful country with men and women dogs and horses and all the concomitants of a rural wake and merrymaking  segers a grand flowerpiece  brughel eight beautiful pictures three of these are flowerpieces the other five small fabulous compositions with nymphs adorned with garlands of flowers and various embellishments rich and luxuriantly colored the whole a most captivating collection of a favorite master  in this closet is a painted cabinet which would demand longer examination than i could devote to it it is by a flemish hand but the masters name has escaped me and my manuscript catalogue does not mention it it is esteemed a masterpiece in its kind  passageroom to the kings bedchamber alonzo cano a dead christ supported by an angel  this noble spaniard may be styled the michael angelo of spain for he was architect statuary and painter and excelled in each for his life which is curious see anecdotes vol ii p    etc  murillo head of an ecce homo  do of a madona both small pieces very fine  a single figure of the tutelar saint james to the knees excellent in his best and brightest manner  spagnolet saint francis de asis halflength  saint geronimo a companion  amongst all the works of this artist whether here or in the escorial i have not met one which did not engage my admiration and i was surprised to find him as great a master of grace and beauty as he is of effect  cavallero maximo a magdalene halflength  mengs a holy family large size  baroccio a last supper small and of exquisite delicacy  leonardo da vinci herodias with the head of john the baptist halflength small size very fine but its originality doubtful  luca jordano a madona halflength with the child sleeping saint john kissing his feet and saint joseph in the background an oval painted in the manner of raphael a charming piece a very curious sample of the imitative powers of this ingenious painter  joseph de arpino the martyrdom of saint ines a glory with saints and the blessed virgin in the clouds clement viii made this painter a knight of christ and louis xiii of france gave him the order of saint michael he died at rome in    0 aged eighty years  this chamber being only a passageroom between the dressing room and bedchamber is lighted only from the glass doors and very unfavourable to the excellent pictures it contains  kings bedchamber mengs the king has here strongly marked his predilection for mengs by admitting none but his paintings to hang in this chamber these consist of six compositions of the size of life and two small ones viz a descent from the cross both the marys and saint john are represented the air and expression of the head of saint john very capital but closely copied from the elder mary in a painting of vandykes on the same subject which was long in mengss hands and now in my possession in my opinion this composition is far the best of all his paintings in oil that are in this palace the eternal father enthroned amongst the angels in heaven this hangs over the picture abovementioned christ praying in the garden christ appearing to mary magdalen christ falling under the cross christ scourged these four hang over the doors   two small pictures one a saint

introduced another combat of gladiators both noble performances in the best style of the master  lanfranc died at rome in      aged    years  guido love and avarice personified in the characters of

rich and fine a largesized picture  what a noble subject had this been for our late incomparable woollet what a study for artists a picture formed to captivate all beholders  jordaens two allegorical paintings over the doors viz wantonness in the character of a fawn plenty described by sundry female figures bearing fruits and flowers very like rubens   titian philip the third of spain  a venetian

drawn himself sitting in his paintingroom where is a grand collection of statues pictures and designs which without doubt is a pourtrait in all particulars  of all the pictures of teniers i have ever

valuable collection  queens great sa titian a fulllength pourtrait of the emperor charles v on foot with a large mastiff painted at bologna before titian entered into his service and as he was on his way to rome to this pourtrait titian applied his utmost art and his success paved the way to the favor in which he was ever after held by the emperor  zelma a spanish artist of great merit has engraved this pourtrait very finely it is bound up with the new publication of sepulvedas works in which is contained the history of charles v written in pure latin with other matters historical and miscellaneous of a very curious nature this work is comprised in four quarto volumes and was published whilst i was in spain  titian philip the second of spain a capital pourtrait  pourtrait of a man

fine landscape in which he has introduced a priest in the act of carrying the viaticum to a dying person the priest is mounted on a horse which is led by a count of augsberg  this is one of the many capital pictures of this master to be found in spain which have conspired to impress me with the highest veneration for his talents perhaps i have already tired the reader with too many attempts at describing objects which interested my feelings upon the contemplation of them and therefore although few occasions can offer which might better warrant the endeavor i shall venture upon nothing more than to recommend it to the traveller who shall visit this collection if he condescends to take this directory in his hand to stop at this picture and if he bestows his attention upon it i am persuaded he will not withhold his admiration  velasquez four capital pourtraits fulllength viz margaret of austria philip the second philip the third of spain an african commander supposed to be the

allegories of the senses and elements  jordaens a pomona the scenery very beautiful  princes dining room velasquez vulcan at his forge  the prince of spain mounted on a beautiful spanish jennet in full speed the spirit which the painter has thrown into this pourtrait and the truth with which it is drawn and colored render it a most admirable piece of art i have an etching from this pourtrait  velasquez a grand and celebrated piece of history upon a very large canvas representing the famous general pescara receiving the keys of a flemish citadel from the governor of the place the groupe of generals soldiers citizens horses etc and the striking effect of the town and landscape in the background all in the most harmonious perspective have established the fame of this noble picture in the opinion of judges as one of the first if not the very first production of the master mengs says decidedly that it is the chefdoeuvre of velasquez and has pronounced it to be faultless except in the circumstance of the soldiers lances which he criticizes as being too long surely this is a very trivial remark to fall from the pen of so great authority and trivial as it is there is great reason to doubt if it is founded in truth after all if the painter has enlarged upon the actual height of pescaras lances for the purpose of effect who would expect that any eminent critic after pronouncing the composition faultless in every noble part would seriously state this remark as a single exception let us therefore admit with mengs that velasquez has taken a wrong measure of pescaras lances but at the same time let us take his word for the perfection of the picture in every other respect if any lover of the art who resorts to this collection should at the same time discover that there is one foot in the famous pasmo de sicilia more than can be accounted for i hope for his sake it will not abate the rapture he would else receive in the contemplation of such unrivalled compositions  velasquez philip the second of spain  philip the third both fulllength pourtraits by the same great master and both very fine  two fulllength characters of aesop one and the other of maenippus of the strongest expression and in a great style of these two i have etchings  two halflength pourtraits one of which is a very interesting and curious picture of the unfortunate antonio perez it hangs near the pourtrait of philip the second  a view of the palace of the pardo in which he has introduced the persons of philip iv and the princess margaret of austria this compleats a list of ten paintings by velasquez in this chamber few apartments can be more royally furnished  pedro mazo a perspective view of the city of saragossa with the course of the river ebro and a group of figures a fine and

flemish still life fish and sundry viands  princes dressing room raphael the celebrated picture called pasmo de sicilia purchased by philip the fourth of the monks of palermo and by him termed la joya in preference to all others an annualrent of one thousand scudi was the price at which the king purchased it of the monks of our lady dello spasimo and hence it got the name of pasmo de sicilia vasari and the celebrated canon of valencia don vicente victoria and in late times mengs have all written largely in testimony of its unrivalled excellence and there seems a general concurrence amongst the judges of the art to set it down as the masterpiece of raphael in my second volume of the anecdotes of spanish painters i have collected several circumstances relating to this famous picture and attempted a description of it which if the reader is disposed to refer to will be found in vol ii from page     to     inclusive  rubens the adoration of the magi  this picture like the last supper of titian in the refectory of the escorial is the standard work of its master it was begun in flanders enlarged retouched and finished during his embassy in spain nothing that his art genius and industry could effect is omitted in grandeur of design display of coloring dignity of character in composition drawing perspective harmony it is a model of excellence rubens in putting his last hand to it has inserted his own pourtrait amongst the groupe of the magi the noblest signature that could be set upon his canvass  the figures are the size of life  rubens a holy family a groupe of female saints and boys in various employments the scenery and embellishments of this rich and noble composition are admirable  vasari five historical pieces taken from the story of saint cayetan companions  murillo a large holy family the mother and savior to the knees  spagnolet a celebrated picture representing the martyrdom of saint bartholomew a masterpiece of anatomical art and terrible expression  a saint benito and a saint geronimo both penitential characters finely designed and of the tenderest expression a striking contrast to the saint bartholomew  a mary magdalen a touching and most delicate design conceived and executed with all the grace of the italian student and all the nature of the spanish master  the genius of spagnolet like his fortune seems always to be engaged on subjects either of terror or of pity he never draws but with a tragic pencil and so truly that he gives the nature itself upon his canvass in melancholy grace and penitential beauty he is equal to guercino in anatomical science and muscular correctness he ranks with leonardo de vinci and in the sublime and terrible approaches to michael angelo the examples of his art which he has left in spain if they were generally known would i am persuaded warrant what i now venture to say and for his life and misfortunes which are very interesting i beg leave to refer once more to the anecdotes vol i page

weeping over the body a large piece  raphael a madona of small size embracing the child  corregio christ praying in the garden  a small picture but of inexpressible beauty and magical effect of coloring it has been particularly celebrated by mengs in his remarks the figure of christ receives its light from a glory the scene is by night a reflected light from the savior strikes on the angel who is attending for his consolation the manner in which this emanation is reflected and diffused through the piece to the extremities of the background and the exquisite gradations observed in its distribution are in the highest degree characteristic of the master mengs remarks that christ and the ministering angel are the only figures which meet the eye upon a first view a closer examination brings forward many other objects and much beautiful scenery this is truly observed for the troop that come to seize our savior the apostles standing aloof under the shade of trees the foliage of the grove the herbage of the garden a crown of thorns a cross fixed in the earth and several other emblematic objects suitable to the action come by degrees into view and start up like visions created by the fancy of the spectator rather than by the pencil of the artist  corregio a madona and child with saint joseph at a distance  mengs observes that this may be called a sketch as it plainly appears that the attitude and action of the mother and child have undergone several alterations in point of disposition by a peculiar management of the middle imperceptible tints in this small yet inestimable painting there is produced a very wonderful effect of size and grandeur from figures which do not measure two inches mengs pronounces that corregio possessed this art of treating lights and shades in the first degree velasquez in the second to corregio and rembrandt next to velasquez he adds that the child in this sketch is a model of consummate excellence not only from the incomparable management of the clearobscure but also from the coloring character drawing and divine grace of the outline he speaks with rapture and remarks that corregio in this most difficult branch of his art was never equalled by any but the great michael angelo and raphael urbin  corregio a head of saint john of a sweet character and beautifully treated  leonardo de vinci a madona and child small size  a holy

painted with great expression and effect in the best manner of the master  this painter was a native of spain out of which he never traveled a disciple of francisco ricci and royal artist in the court of philip iv his pictures are highly esteemed in spain and i have met some admirers of them who do not scruple to prefer him to murillo spagnolet and even to velasquez his masterpiece is the great picture in the sacristy of the escorial upon which he expended seven years labor of this and many other anecdotes of his history i have given an account vol ii page   0 etc  paul veronese jesus disputing with the doctors in the temple this i conceive to be a picture of great beauty majesty and effect the composition is full and finely disposed the characters sublime and majestic marked with striking discrimination and contrast the architecture is superb the coloring clear and of a most captivating brilliancy the character of christ is divinely conceived and of matchless beauty the picture is of large size and a most capital performance of the master  the receiving room rembrandt cleopatra receives the cup of melted pearl from the hands of a female slave an inestimable picture in his finest style large size  spagnolet a combat of gladiators this picture is esteemed one of the very best of the master it is a study for an academy the attitudes of the combatants the spirit of their characters and the great truth and correctness of drawing cannot be too much admired the subject was well chosen to display the science of the painter in the muscles and proportions of the human figure naked and in the strongest exertion of manly vigor  murillo a judith with the head of holofernes a female servant with a light halflength this is managed with great skill and effect it is a study from nature admirably executed  titian two most capital compositions celebrated through europe and justly recorded by mengs as the most consummate models of beauty one represents a group of boys and cupids the other of bacchanals companions the figures in each are of the third part of the natural size in the foreground of the group of bacchanals there is a young female reveller sleeping of which mengs speaks in raptures of admiration and concludes his remarks on this picture by observing that all the harmonious accompaniments of sky variegated ground with deep and tender shades of the trees form such an assemblage of beautiful objects in nature perfectly imitated that he does not think the world possesses a better picture in this style the boys and cupids in the other piece are grouped with wonderful variety of attitudes they are engaged in puerile sports under a grove of apple trees the fruit of which they have scattered on the ground and are playing with it in the most gay and natural manner it is equally excellent with its companion these pictures were formerly in the ludovici palace at rome and were a present to the king of spain sandrart reports of this group of cupids that it served for a study to domeniquino poussin and flameneco albano has taken part of it into a composition of his painting and there are copies of both these companions by rubens in the palace of these mengs says that they are like an elegant author translated into dutch where the sentiments of the original may be guessed at but all the grace is vanished anecdotes vol i p  0 what

the name of this painter was pedro nunez a disciple of mathias preti commonly called el cavellero calabres he died at seville in   00  flemish a beautiful group of fruits and flowers painter unknown  mazo philip iv with his queen and dames of honor mazo was a disciple of the famous velasquez  i have now gone through the catalogue of this noble collection and as i have reason to think it is the only correct and entire account yet published i hope it will be acceptable to the curious reader mengss remarks only go to a few pictures and the account of them in the viage de espana by don antonio ponz is very far from perfect though it is a work otherwise replete with interesting information and as a general directory to travelers in spain no book can be better contrived  if the lovers of the art are curious to analyze this account and separate the respective works of the several great masters they will find it to be a vast collection which the spanish monarchs charles v philip ii iii and iv amassed within the periods of their reigns and if we add to this the great collection in the escorial that of the buenretiro the many fine pictures which were burnt in the pardo and some of the most capital which have been discarded in the present reign the amount will appear prodigious and i apprehend is not to be equalled by any other single collection in europe  of titian velasquez rubens murillo and spagnolet i find above one hundred and forty pictures in this single catalogue fortythree of which are by the hand of titian i must take the liberty notwithstanding to suggest that this collection would still allow of many draughts to be made and if these vacancies were filled up from the buenretiro only not to mention the escorial it would be much more perfect some of luca jordanos pictures might well be spared corrados sketches the pourtraits of vanlo and ynza and some of mengss inferior performances would be well exchanged for a select number of bassans from the old palace for a capital lucretia by guido which hangs there in obscurity and many others that might be named  it is also to be regretted that velasquezs famous picture of jacob receiving the bloody coat of his son joseph and a very fine guercino on the subject of susanna and the elders both which now hang in a wretched hole in the escorial not appropriated to any sacred uses should not be removed from thence and added to the royal collection  advantageous changes might also be made in the arrangement of the pictures for in the quarter belonging to the prince and princess many capital pictures of raphael corregio leonardo de vinci julio romano andrea sacchi andrea del sarto and others are very unfavourably hung the chamber in which the principal pieces are being a mean obscure room filled with lumber and not in the suite of great apartments the masters are classed in general without much scientific attention to their styles of coloring so that the florid pictures oftentimes browbeat the more tender and the cold labored regularity of mengs ill contrasts the warm and glowing canvasses of titian rubens and velasquez but if this remark holds good against the sorting of the pictures in this palace how much more to be lamented is the condition of the capital pictures in the escorial where the inimitable perla of raphael the holy family of andrea del sarto and the famous tintorett of christ washing his disciples feet hang aloft in dust and darkness over the presses that contain the relics in the sacristy and are almost totally out of sight this must be painful to every lover of the art but to the english traveller more than any who will naturally cast a look of pity and affection toward these interesting objects once in the possession of an elegant and unhappy monarch who left them as monuments of his taste to be alienated from his crown and nation by an unfeeling crew of fanatics as barbarous as they were bloody  it is to be regretted that so few engravings have been taken from the capital pictures in spain i procured all that were to be had and the collection is very small two more may be soon expected by the hand of zelma an eminent artist viz of the pasmo de sicilia and the perla the nra senora del pez has been engraved by bartolozzi it were greatly to be wished that proper encouragement should be given to our young artists of talents to take drawings of some of these pictures above described in which i am confident they would meet every possible favor and protection from the royal owner of the collection several pictures might be pointed out in this catalogue and elsewhere which would be admirable subjects and raise the credit of our artists already so high in estimation at the same time that i venture to recommend this undertaking i am not without some grounds to hope that it is in contemplation  i should here take notice that in the above catalogue no account is taken of the pictures in the apartments of the infants don gabriel don antonio and don luis in the former there are six sacred histories by luca jordano from passages in the life of the virgin mary also an absalom and a small sketch by the same hand two sketches by corrado a saint joseph with the young jesus about ten years of age by spagnolet a saint sebastian and a magdalen by the same charles v haranguing his army by titian orpheus harping to the beasts by rubens and a vulcan by the same master with a large flemish painting of still life finely colored and capital in its style  in the quarter of don antonio there are several by luca jordano on sacred as well as fabulous story a pourtrait of a youth in armor by vandyke another of carreno after velasquez and a composition after rubens on the subject of moses and pharaohs daughter  in the apartments late appropriated to don luis we find the copies which rubens made of titians famous pictures of the cupids and bacchanals above described and which mengs so tauntingly compared to a dutch translation there are several others of the same master particularly a saint george slaying the dragon of the size of life colored with surprising brilliancy but in a gaudy style and flattering amongst the works of rubens there is an archimedes a mercury hercules killing the hydra apollo and pan and two pourtraits of ladies of the house of medici with some sketches two pourtraits by vandyke one very capital of the infant don ferdinand there is a woman with several boys in the manner of leonardo de vinci a scriptural piece by paul veronese a christ of the size of life with the cross by guido a pourtrait of a woman by titian of a man by vandyke and some beautiful flowerpieces by brughel  having mentioned some pictures cast out of the royal collection which i saw in the custody of an artist belonging to the king it may be proper to observe that they consist of five capital titians the first of which is his inestimable venus once the property of king charles i of england described in the anecdotes  vol i p    the greatest model of beauty and perfection in the world   a venus and cupid with a person in the background playing on an organ the venus recumbent on a couch   a venus of the same size attitude etc with the addition of a little dog which she is caressing   a venus in the action of holding back adonis in her embrace who is setting out for the chase with his dogs etc   a danae naked receiving the golden shower there is also a halflength pourtrait of titian by his own hand besides these there is a venus by paul veronese and an adonis and cupid by annibal caracci an atalanta and hippomenes in the race by guido of consummate beauty the figures are of very tall life the outline as glittering as corregio the limbs divinely graceful and the air of the heads unspeakably elegant and expressive the attitudes perhaps have more of the academy than might be wished the coloring warmer than his usual hue of rubens there are several and such as would dignify the first collections in europe viz the rape of the sabines the baths of diana a bacchanalian triumph wherein several bacchants are plucking fruits and the figure of bacchus himself in a capital style a perseus and andromeda which is a wonderful picture a group of juno minerva and venus paris carrying away helen capital and the judgment of paris with the rival goddesses a matchless piece of coloring all of the size of life and the very best of the master there are also two beautiful pictures by albano one of them the judgment of paris the other a venus coming out of the bath and a lot and his daughters by andrea del sarto i need not observe what an accession these inestimable pictures might be to the collection in the palace  the royal chapel of the palace is a very beautiful piece of architecture supported by vast columns of biscayan black and white marble each of one entire block and in the sacristy and chaplains room there are several fine pictures by spagnolet murillo luca jordano corrado cambiaso alonzo cano and other spanish masters besides which there is a descent from the cross by albert durer and a conversationpiece of saint anthony and saint paul the hermit by andrea sacchi  old palace of the buenretiro in the chamber called de los reynos there are twelve large battlepieces by spanish masters and the labors of hercules boldly executed by francisco zurbaran  in the antichamber to the queens apartment there are two large pictures by luca jordano some by rico a neapolitan and the representation of an auto de fe by francisco rizi a roman triumph by borgiani and a fine pourtrait of henry ii of france ascribed to titian also pourtraits of ferdinand and isabella  in the chamber of castrillo a tantalus and an ixion both by spagnolet colossal and of striking expression a view of saint peters in rome saint marks place in venice and the vatican with the pope and cardinals in procession  in a passageroom leading from this chamber there are some noble pictures of snyders john tillen and peter de vos in the huntingpieces of de vos there are several persons introduced with wonderful spirit and expression a capital composition by rubens of hercules slaying the hydra the queen mother of charles ii of spain two fulllengths of charles v by juan pantoia de la cruz two of philip iv of different ages and one of a buffoon in the style of velasquez several sacred histories finely executed by bassan and some by estevan marc  in a large room adjoining are two grand historical compositions by pedro de cortona in both which he has introduced pope urban viii with his cardinals and views of the vatican two small compositions on the subject of diana by titian painted in his latter age a mercury and argos by jordaens and several excellent bassans and some landscapes by marc  in the courtroom many pictures by luca jordano a large bacchanalian piece by cornelius de vos a large fruitpiece of unparalleled execution and variety representing the golden age by adrian van utrecht with nine figures of the school of rubens also another admirable piece of fruits birds etc to which van utrecht has set his name and the date of the year      orpheus redeeming eurydice from hell by rubens a capital landscape signed with the name of jordaens in which he has represented vertumnus and pomona naked figures  in a small room next to this some copies by luca jordano and a superb picture by rubens representing the fall of the giants a saturn devouring a child by the same a fine composition by nicholas poussin with an amphitheatre and many figures amongst which are four elephants and several other pictures which i forbear to enumerate  in one of the private chapels there is a fine altarpiece by vasari with the holy family at fulllength admirably executed other pictures by luca jordano and the spanish masters  in the passage to this chapel hangs an original drawing by raphael of his famous battlepiece of constantine and maxentius now in the vatican an exquisite parmegiano of the espousals of christ with saint catherine the centurion at the feet of our savior a fine picture by paul veronese a grand head of saint jerome by guido the four evangelists by rubens and sketches of the famous pictures he made for the convent of loeches by commission from olivarez some heads of martyrs by spagnolet several pictures by corrado and a very fine composition by marc all these valuable pieces are buried in a dark lobby and every spectator who has a feeling for merit in obscurity will regard them with a mixture of admiration and regret  in the apartments of the infants we again meet with several very fine scriptural histories by bassan in a style superior to any thing i have elsewhere seen of that master some landscapes by claud lorrain several large compositions by sneyder and a variety of pictures of the spanish school  in the passage to this apartment many curious pieces will be found amongst them a saint jes by paul veronese very fine a beautiful vertumnus and pomona by rubens a halflength of a woman with a basket on her arm by spagnolet a saint francis by the same some excellent pourtraits by leonardo de vinci and other old masters a boy and an old woman a candlelight very capital by rembrandt pilate washing his hands by guercino a noble picture and a sacrifice to pomona exquisitely finished by jacobo jordaeno  in a room adjoining there is a great collection of sneyders bassan golze bosco dominichino francisco perez luca jordano and others  a lucretia by guido full length of the size of life in the act of selfdestruction a matchless picture that would dignify the first collection in europe  in this deserted palace are to be seen the celebrated frescos of luca jordano supposed to be the very best of the master the climate at least has been favorable to them for they are in fresh and perfect preservation  in the queens chamber are some incomparable performances of gaspar poussin a firework in the spanish square at rome finely painted by sebastian conca an herodias by caravagio a hercules by caesar tracarzane and many others worth attention  there is a grand sketch of tinioretts famous last supper in the quarter of the late infant don luis some fine spagnolets and two very curious histories of adam and eve the size of life signed as follows albertus durerus almanus faciebat post virginis partum   0   the theater though now in disuse is extremely fine and so contrived as to admit of the whole back scene to be occasionally drawn off and laid open to the garden the paintings are by amiconi  from this imperfect account of the paintings in this deserted palace it will readily be acknowledged that it still contains a very respectable collection and that a superb gallery might be furnished by draughts of the capital pictures still remaining in it  in the little suburban palace called the caso del campo are some curious caprichios of the noted jacobo calot representing the temptations of st anthony and an allegorical invention of geronimo bosch which in wildness of idea exceeds every thing that ever fell from the pencil of an artist the design is the creation of man and the state to which his nature may be reduced by vice the painter having described the human passions by a vast multitude of symbolical figures of birds beasts and monstrous compounds the conceits of this moral and satirical humourist are infinite a man of curiosity may amuse a leisure hour in the examination of them but i am persuaded the reader will readily excuse me from attempting to describe them  the churches and convents of madrid are possessed of very many fine paintings and it is in them the works of the spanish masters will be found in the greatest number and perfection several of them however contain very capital productions of the best italian painters and in particular the convent of san pasqual on the prado to which cabrera great admiral of castile bequeathed his whole valuable collection there is a large altarpiece by guercino superlatively fine and several capital paintings on the altars and in the sacristy by jacobo palma leonardo de vinci titian andrea schiavone paul veronese guercino vandyke bassan luca jordano and spagnolet a lover of the art must not omit to visit the convent of san placido if it were only for the purpose of contemplating that wonderful picture of the dead christ on the cross painted by velasquez in the year      though he will find further gratification for his curiosity in the same convent which possesses two of the very best pictures which claudio coello ever composed  as these churches and convents are very numerous the research would be much too intricate and laborious without a clue but this will be so readily had in the viage de espana before mentioned that a traveller has only to provide himself with those volumes and he will there find an excellent guide for his curiosity  finis
