is that there may be nothing so turkish so christian so amorous so tender so infuriate as that which i am now putting into verse for the pleasure of the public    the names of montmorenci saladire jesus mahomet will be in it there will be mention of the seine and jordan of paris and jerusalem we shall love we shall baptize we shall kill and i will send you the outline as soon as it is done the piece was a great success despite j b rousseaus adverse criticism it was played at berlin and geneva and at rome on the hundredth anniversary of voltaires death   an epistle dedicatory to mr falkener an english merchant since ambassador at constantinople with the tragedy of zaïre you my dear friend are an englishman and i am a native of france but lovers of the fine arts are fellowcitizens men of taste and virtue have pretty nearly the same principles in every country and form one general commonweal it is no longer therefore matter of astonishment to see a french tragedy dedicated to an englishman or an italian any more than it would have been in the days of antiquity for a citizen of ephesus or of athens to address his performance to a grecian of some other city i lay this tragedy before you therefore as my countryman in literature and my most intimate friend i shall at the same time have the pleasure of informing my brother frenchmen here in what light traders are looked upon among you what regard the english have for a profession so essential to the welfare of their kingdom and the honor which they have to represent their country in parliament in the rank of legislators though trade is despised by our petitsmaitres who you know as well as myself both in england and france are the most contemptible species of being that crawl upon the face of the earth my further inducement to correspond with an englishman rather than any other man on subjects of literature arises from your happy freedom of   thought which never fails to inspire me with bolder ideas and also with more nervous expression  whoever converses with me has for the time at least my heart at his disposal if his sentiments are lively and animated he inflames me if he is strong and nervous he raises and supports me the courtier who is all dissimulation makes me insensibly as affected and constrained in my behavior as himself but a bold and fearless spirit gives me sentiment and courage i catch fire from him just as young painters brought up under lemoine or argilière catch the freedom of their masters pencils and compose with their spirit thus virgil admired homer followed his steps and without being a plagiarist became his rival you need not be apprehensive of my sending you with this piece a long apology and vindication of it i might indeed have told you why i did not make zaïre more determined to embrace christianity before she knew her father why she keeps the secret from her lover but those who have any judgment or any justice will see my reasons without my pointing them out and as for those critics that are predetermined not to believe me it would be lost labor to give them any reasons at all all i can boast of is that the piece is tolerably simple a perfection in my opinion that is not to be despised   this happy simplicity was one of the distinguishing beauties of learned antiquity it is a pity you englishmen dont introduce this novelty on your stage which is so filled with horror gibbets and murders put more truth into your dramatic performances and more noble images addison has endeavored to do it he was the poet of the wife but he was too stiff and in his boasted cato the two girls are really very insipid characters imitate from the great addison only what is good polish a little the rude manners of your mild muse write for all times and all ages for fame and for posterity and transfuse into your works the simplicity of your manners but i would not have your english poets imagine that i mean to give them zaire as a model i preach simplicity to them and easy numbers but i would not be thought to set up for the saint of my own sermon if zaire has met with success i owe it not so much to the merit of the performance as to the tenderness of the love scenes which i was wise enough to execute as well as i possibly could in this i flattered the taste of my audience and he is generally sure to succeed who talks more to the passions of men than to their reason if we are ever so good christians we must have a little love besides and i am satisfied the great corneille was much in the right of it not to confine himself in his polyeucte merely to the breaking of the statues of jupiter by the new converts for such is the depravity of human kind that perhaps the pious soul of polyeucte would have but little impression on the audience and even the christian verses he declaims would have been received with contempt if it had not been for his wifes passion for her favorite heathen who was   certainly more worthy of her love than the good devotee her husband almost the same accident happened to zaire my friends who frequent the theatre assured me that if she had been only converted she would not have been half so interesting but she was in love with the most perfect religion in the world and that has made her fortune i could not however expect to escape censure many an inexorable critic has carped at and slashed me and many a remorseless jester has pretended that i only filched an improbable romance which i had not the sense to improve that i have lamed and spoiled the subject that the catastrophe is unnatural they even prognosticated the dreadful hiss with which a disgusted public salutes a miserable poet but i despised their censures and risked my play upon the stage the public was more favorable than they expected or i deserved instead of hisses it received shouts tears flowed from almost every eye but i am not puffed up with my success i assure you i am no stranger to all its faults i know very well it is absolutely indisputable that before we can make a perfect work we must sell ourselves to the devil which was what i did not choose to do i do not flatter myself that the english will do zaire the same honor they have done to brutus a translation of which has been played at london  they tell us here that you have neither devotion enough to be affected by old lusignan nor tenderness to feel for zaire you love a conspiracy better than an intrigue upon your stage they say the word   country is sure of getting a clap and so is love upon ours but to say the truth you have as much love in your tragedies as we have if you have not the reputation of being tender it is not that your stage heroes are not in love but that they seldom express their passion naturally our lovers talk like lovers yours like poets but if the french are your superiors in gallantry there are many things which in return we may borrow of you to the english theatre i am indebted for the liberty which i have taken of bringing the names of our kings and ancient families upon the stage a novelty of this kind may perhaps be the means of introducing amongst us a species of tragedy hitherto unknown and which we seem to want some happy geniuses will i have no doubt rise up who will bring to perfection that idea of which zaire is but a slight sketch as long as literature meets with protection in france we shall always have writers enough nature every day forms men of talents and abilities we have nothing to do but to encourage and employ them but if those which distinguish themselves are not supported by some honorable recompense and by the still more pleasing charm of admiration all the fine arts must soon perish even though so many edifices have been raised to shelter and protect them the noble plantation of louis xiv would die away for want of culture the public might still have taste but there would be no eminent masters the sculptor in his academy would see a number of indifferent pupils about him but never have the ambition to imitate girardon and pujet the painter would rest satisfied with excelling his contemporaries but would never think of rivalling poussin may the successor of louis  0 xiv always follow the example of that great monarch who inspired every artist with emulation encouraged at the same time a racine and a vanrobais he carried our commerce and our glory to the farthest part of the globe and extended his bounty to foreigners of all nations who were astonished at the fame and rewards which our court bestowed upon them wherever merit appeared it found a patron in louis xiv   whereer that bounteous star its influence shed   fair merit raised her longdeclining head   his royal hand spread honors wealth and fame   then viviani then cassini came   newton refused a gift from frances throne   or newton too thou knowest had been our own   these are the deeds that raise our gallias fame   these louis will immortalize thy name   and truly make thee what thou wert designed   the universal monarch of mankind you have no foundations equal to the munificent donations of our kings but then your people supplies the want of them you do not stand in need of royal favor to honor and reward superior talents of every kind steel and vanbrugh were comedy writers and at the same time members of parliament the primacy given to dr tillotson newton honored with an important trust prior made an ambassador and addison a minister of state are but the common and ordinary consequences of the regard which you pay to merit and to great men you heap riches on them while they live and erect monuments and statues to them after their death even your celebrated actresses have places in your churches near the great poets your oldfield and her predecessor bracegirdle in consideration of their having been so agreeable to the public when in their prime their course finished    were by the consent of your whole nation honored with a pompous funeral and their remains carried under a velvet pall and lodged in your church with the greatest magnificence their spirits no doubt are still proud of it and boast of the honor in the shades below while the divine molière who was far more worthy of it could scarcely obtain leave to sleep in a churchyard and the amiable lecouvreur whose eyes i closed could not even so much as obtain two waxtapers and a coffin m de laubiniere out of charity carried away her corpse by night in a hackneycoach to the banks of the river do you not even now see the god of love breaking his arrows in a rage and melopomene in tears banishing herself from that ungrateful place which lecouvreur had so long adorned but everything in these our days conspires to reduce france to that state of barbarism from which louis xiv and cardinal richelieu had delivered her that a curse on that policy knows not the value of the fine arts the world is peopled with nations as powerful as our own how happens it then that we look on them with so little esteem for the same reason perhaps that we despise the company of a rich man whose mind is tasteless and uncultivated do not imagine that this empire of wit this glory of being the universal model for mankind is a trifling distinction it is the infallible mark of the grandeur of a kingdom under the greatest princes the arts have always flourished and their decay is often succeeded by that of the state itself history will supply us with ample proofs of it but this would lead me too far out of my subject i shall finish this letter which is already too long with a little performance which naturally demands a place    at the head of this tragedy an epistle in verse to the actress who played the part of zaire i owe her at least this compliment for the manner in which she acquitted herself on that occasion for the prophet of mecca never had greek nor arabian in his seraglio so beautiful or so genteel her black eyes so finely arched and full of tenderness with her excellent voice mien and carriage defended my performance against every auditor that had a mind to be troublesome but when the reader catches me in his closet all my honor i fear will be lost adieu my dear friend continue to cultivate philosophy and the belleslettres without forgetting to send your ships to the levant i have the honor to remain c voltaire m de voltaire mr falkener a second letter to mr falkener then ambassador to constantinople from the second edition of the tragedy of zaire my dear friend for your new dignity of ambassador only makes our friendship more respectable and shall not prevent my making use of a title even more sacred than that of minister the name of friend is much above that of your excellency i now dedicate to the ambassador of a great king and a free nation what i had before addressed to a plain citizen and an english merchant those who know how much commerce is respected in your country must know that a tradesman is there sometimes a legislator a good officer and a public minister    some ridiculous people who had fallen in with the fashion of paying respect to nothing but nobility thought proper to laugh at the novelty of a dedication to a man who had nothing but merit to recommend him who took the liberty on a stage sacred to calumny and bad taste to insult the author of that dedication and to reproach the gentleman to whom it was addressed for being a merchant  but we must not sir impute to our whole nation an affront so gross and illiberal that people ever so uncivilized would have been ashamed to commit the magistrates of our police who are constantly employed in rectifying abuses of this kind were to the last degree surprised at it but the contempt and ignominy with which the public have branded the acknowledged author of this indignity are i hope a fresh proof of french politeness those virtues which form the character of a whole people are often contradicted and as it were called in question by the vices of an individual there were some voluptuaries we know even at lacedæmon there have been low and foolish fellows in england men without taste or good breeding at athens and so there are in paris you will i hope forget them sir as they are forgotten by the world and receive this second mark of my respect they are due to you still more than they were before as this tragedy has made its appearance at london it has been translated and acted with so much success and the author of it    spoken of with so much regard and politeness that i ought to return my public thanks to the whole nation i do not know how to acquit my obligations to you by any other means than acquainting my countrymen here with the particulars of the translation and representation of zaire on the english stage mr hill a man of letters and one who seems to understand the theatre better than any english author did me the honor to translate this piece with the design of introducing something new on your stage both with regard to the manner of writing tragedies and of repeating them i shall speak by and by of the representation the art of declaiming was for a long time among you entirely unnatural most of your tragic actors expressed themselves more like poets seized with rapturous enthusiasm than like men inspired by a real passion several of your comedians were even more intolerable they roared out their verses with an impetuous fury that was no more like the natural tone than convulsions and distortions are to an easy and noble carriage this air of riot and tumult seemed entirely foreign to your nation which is naturally sober and grave even to such a degree as frequently to appear cold and unanimated in the eye of a stranger your preachers never indulge themselves in a declamatory tone and you would laugh at a pleader at the bar who should work himself up into a passion the players were the only outrageous set of people in the kingdom our actors and actresses also particularly the latter were guilty of this for many years m lecouvreur was the first who broke them of it thus an italian writer a man of great sense and parts speaks of her      la legiadra couvreur sola non trotta   per quella strade dove i suoi compagni   van di galoppo tutti quanti in frotta   se auvien chella pianga o che si lagni   sensa quelli urli spaventosi loro   ti muove si che in pianger laccompagni the same change which lecouvreur affected on our stage mrs cibber brought about on yours in the part of zaire how astonishing it is that in every art it should be so long before we arrive at the simple and the natural a novelty that must appear still more extraordinary to a frenchman is that a gentleman of your country a man of rank and fortune should condescend to play the part of osman it was an interesting circumstance to see the two principal characters represented one by a person of condition and the other by a young actress not above eighteen years of age who had never repeated a line before in her life this instance of a gentlemans exercising his talents for declamation is not singular among you it is perhaps more surprising that we should wonder at it we ought certainly to reflect that everything in this world depends upon custom and opinion the court of france have danced on the stage with the actors of the opera and we thought there was nothing strange in it but that the fashion of this kind of entertainment should be discontinued why should it be more extraordinary for people to write than to dance in public is there any difference between these two arts except that the one is as much above the other as the perfections of the mind are superior to those of the body i have said it before and i say so still none of the polite arts are contemptible and to be ashamed of talents of any kind is of all things the most shameful    i come now to the translation of zaïre and the change which has been made among you with regard to the drama you had a strange custom which even mr addison the chastest of your writers adopted so often does custom get the better of sense and reason i mean the ridiculous custom of finishing every act by verses in a different taste from the rest of the piece which verse usually consisted of a simile phædra as she leaves the stage compares herself to a bitch cato to a rock and cleopatra to children that cry themselves asleep the translator of zaïre was the first who dared to maintain the rights of nature against a custom so directly opposite to her he proscribed this custom well knowing that passion should always speak its own language and that the poet should disappear to make room for the hero upon this principle he has translated plainly and without any unnecessary ornaments all the simple verses of the piece which must have been entirely spoiled by an endeavor to render them beautiful such as   on ne peut désirer ce quon ne connoît pas   jeusse été prés du gange esclave des faux dieux   chrétienne dans paris musulmane en ces lie ux   mais orosmane maime  jai tout oublié   non la reconnoissance est un foible retour   un tribut offensant trop peu fait pour lamour   je me croirois haï dêtre aimé foiblement   je veux avec excès vous aimer  vous plaire   lart nest pas fait pour toi tu nen a pas besoin   lart le plus innocent tient de la perfidie    all the verses that are in this fine taste of simplicity are rendered word for word into english they might very easily have been adorned but the translator judged in a different manner from several of my countrymen he liked the verses and retained therefore all the simplicity of them the style indeed ought always to be agreeable to the subject alzira brutus and zaïre for example required three different kinds of versification if berenice complained of titus and ariadne of theseus in the style of cinna neither berenice nor ariadne would please or affect us we can never talk well of love if we search after any other ornaments but truth and simplicity this is not the place to examine whether it be right or wrong to put so much love into our dramatic performances i will even allow it to be a fault but it is a fault which will always be universal nor do i know what name to give that fault which is the delight of all mankind of one thing i am satisfied that the french have succeeded better in it than all other nations ancient and modern put together love appears on our stage with more decorum more delicacy and truth than we meet with on any other and the reason is because of all nations the french are best acquainted with society the perpetual commerce and intercourse of the two sexes carried on with so much vivacity and good breeding has introduced among us a politeness unknown to all the world but ourselves society principally depends on the fair sex all those nations who are so unhappy as to confine their women are unsociable the austerity of your manners your political quarrels and religious wars that rendered you savage and barbarous deprived    you even down to the age of charles ii of the pleasures of society even in the bosom of liberty the poets therefore neither of your country nor of any other knew anything of the manner in which love ought to be treated good comedy was utterly unknown amongst us till the days of molière as was the art of expressing our sentiments with delicacy till those of racine because society had not attained to any degree of perfection before that time a poet cannot paint in his closet manners which he has never seen and would sooner write a hundred odes and epistles than one scene where nature must speak your dryden who was in other respects a great genius put into the mouth of his heroes in love either highflown strains of rhetorical flourish or something indecent two things equally opposite to tenderness if mr racine makes titus say   depuis cinq ans entiers chaque jour je la vois   et croi toujours la voir pour la première fois your dryden makes antony say   —how i loved   witness ye days and nights and all ye hours   that danced away with down upon your feet   as all your business were to count my love   one day passed by and nothing saw but love   another came and still twas only love   the suns were wearied out with looking on   and i untired with loving— it is very difficult to conceive that antony should ever really talk thus to cleopatra in the same play cleopatra speaks thus to antony   come to me come my soldier to my arms   youve been too long away from my embraces   but when i have you fast and all my own   with broken murmurs and with amorous sighs   ill say you were unkind and punish you   and mark you red with many an eager kiss    it is not improbable that cleopatra might frequently talk thus but indecencies of this kind are not to be represented before a respectable audience some of your countrymen may perhaps say this is pure nature but we may tell them in answer that if it be so it is that nature which ought carefully to be concealed it shows but little knowledge of human nature to imagine that we can please the more by presenting these licentious images on the contrary it is shutting up the avenues to true pleasure where everything is at once discovered we are disgusted there remains no more to look for or desire and in our pursuit of pleasure we meet with languor and satiety this is the reason why those who are truly qualified for society taste pleasures far more exquisite than grosser appetites can have any idea of the spectators in this case are like lovers who are satiated by too quick possession those ideas which when brought too close would make us blush should be seen as it were through a cloud it is this veil to which to a right mind they are indebted for all their charms there is no pleasure without decorum  the french are certainly better acquainted with this than any other nation upon earth not because they are without genius and spirit as the unequal and impetuous dryden has ridiculously asserted but because ever since the regency of anne of austria they have been the most sociable and the most polished people in the universe and this politeness is not an arbitrary thing like what they  0 call civility but a law of nature which they have happily cultivated far beyond any other nation the translation of zaire has almost throughout his whole piece strictly observed those decencies of the stage which are common to us both but there are at the same time some places where he has entirely adhered to ancient customs for instance when in the english piece osman comes to tell zaire that he can no longer love her she answers him by rolling upon the ground the sultan is not moved at seeing her in this ridiculous posture of despair and yet the moment after is astonished at zaires weeping and cries out zaire thou weepest he should have said to her before zaire thou rollest upon the ground insomuch that those three words zaire thou weepest which have so fine an effect on our stage have none on yours because they were displaced those familiar and simple expressions derive all their power from the manner in which they are introduced my lord you change countenance is nothing of itself but when these words are pronounced by mithridates we shudder at them to say nothing but what we ought to say and that in the manner in which it ought to be said is a point of perfection which the french have come nigher to than the writers myself excepted of other countries on this subject we have i think a right to dictate to them you can teach us perhaps greater and more useful things we ought to acknowledge it the french who have written against sir isaac newtons discoveries with regard to light and colors are ashamed of it those who oppose his system of gravitation will soon be still more so you ought to submit to our rules of the stage as    we submit to your philosophy we have made as good experiments on the human heart as you have in physics the art of pleasing seems to be the art of frenchmen the art of thinking is all your own happy are those sir who like you can unite them i am sir c voltaire       act i scene i zaïre fatima fatima   i little thought to see the lovely zaïre   in all the pride of youth and beauty thus   calm and resigned submitting to her fate   what sweet delusive hope hath pierced the cloud   of grief that hung upon thee and revived   thy drooping heart this peace of mind hath given   new lustre to thy charms no longer now   thy eyes are bathed in tears no longer seek   those blissful climes where brave nerestan promised   to guide our steps thou talkest not as of late   we heard thee of those seats of happiness   where women reign by willing slaves adored   the queens the idols of a polished people   though free yet chaste and wise though unrestrained   for social converse fit and not to fear   indebted for their virtue sighest thou zaïre   no more for this gay land of liberty   seest thou within these solitary walls   aught that is lovely is the name of slave   so grateful now that to the banks of seine   thou wouldst prefer the gloomy solyma zaïre   we cannot wish for joys we never knew        twas heavens supreme degree to fix us here   custom hath made restraint familiar to me   i look not now beyond the narrow bounds   of this seraglio every hour it grows   more pleasing to me and the world beside   is lost to zaïre to the noble osman   i yield myself to live beneath his power   to honor and obey my royal master   is my souls utmost hope and its ambition   all else is but a dream fatima   hast thou forgot   the kind nerestan he whose generous friendship   promised so oft to free us from the yoke   of bondage how did we admire his virtues   his matchless valor and intrepid zeal   the glory he acquired beneath the walls   of damas where so many christians fell   by osmans mighty hand the conqueror then   thou mayest remember pitied his brave foe   and on his word permitted him to leave   the banks of jordan we expect him still   to pay the ransom of our liberty   and set us free must all our hopes be vain zaïre   perhaps his promise might exceed his power   two years are past and yet hes not returned   alas my fatima a captive stranger   to gain his liberty might promise more   than he could eer perform he talked thou knowest   of bringing ransom for ten christian slaves   would break their fetters or resume his own        i was too credulous and much admired   his forward zeal but i shall think no more on it fatima   if yet he should be faithful and return   to keep his plighted faith then wouldst thou not— zaïre   it is not as it was my fatima   the time is past fatima   what sayest thou zaïre   ill not hide   the secret from my friend perhaps the sultan   may yet conceal it but thy zaïres heart   with safety may repose on fatima   know then some three months since when thou wert absent   removed with other slaves from jordans banks   kind heaven to put a period to our woes   raised up a powerful friend—the mighty osman— fatima   well what of osman zaïre   he the sultans self   the christians haughty conqueror is the slave   of zaïre yes he loves me fatima   nay blush not for i understand thee well   think not i mean to stain my spotless honor   or stoop to be the mistress of a tyrant   that i will ever hazard the quick change   of transitory passion no my friend        i am not so far lost to modesty   and native pride as to forget myself   rather than fall so low i would embrace   the milder fate of slavery and death   but i shall more astonish thee for know   i have subdued his haughty soul to love   most pure and most refined amidst the crowd   of rival beauties that contend for osman   i i alone have fixed his wandering heart   and hymen soon in spite of all their deep   and dark intrigues shall make the sultan mine fatima   it is a conquest worthy of thy charms   and of thy virtues i am much surprised   but more delighted may thy happiness   be perfect i shall rank myself with joy   amongst thy subjects zaïre   be my equal still   and share my fortune royalty with thee   divided will make zaïre doubly happy fatima   pleased with thy choice long may indulgent heaven   smile on thy nuptial bed may never grief   intrude to poison the sweet cup of grandeur   by us called happiness alas how little   doth it deserve the name but tell me zaïre   art thou at ease and feelest thou naught within   to check thy joys hast thou forgot that once   thou wert a christian zaïre   ha what sayest thou why   wouldst thou recall my sorrows fatima        alas i know not who or what i am   not even who gave me birth fatima   nerestan oft   hath said thou wert the daughter of a christian   the cross which in thy infant years adorned thee   confirms it still that sacred pledge remains   perhaps but to remind thee of the faith   which thou hast quitted zaïre   ive no other proof   shall that alone persuade me to embrace   a faith detested by the man i love   our thoughts our manners our religion all   are formed by custom and the powerful bent   of early years born on the banks of ganges   zaïre had worshipped pagan deities   at paris i had been a christian here   i am a happy mussulman we know   but what we learn the instructing parents hand   graves in our feeble hearts those characters   which time retouches and examples fix   so deeply in the mind that naught but god   can eer efface but thou wert hither brought   a captive at an age when reason joined   to sage experience had informed thy soul   and wellconfirmed its faith for me a slave   even from my cradle to the saracens   too late the christian light broke in upon me   yet far from wishing ill to laws so pure   spite of myself i own to thee that cross   wheneer i looked upon it filled my soul   with reverential awe and oft in secret   have i invoked its holy aid ere osman        possessed my heart thine is a noble faith   i honor much those charitable laws   which old nerestan many a time hath told me   would wipe off every tear and make mankind   one sweet united family of love   a christian must be happy fatima   wherefore then   wouldst thou become their most inveterate foe   and wed their proud oppressor zaïre   wouldst thou have me   refuse so fair a present as the heart   of osman no i will confess my weakness   but for the sultan zaïre had long since   embraced thy faith and been like thee a christian   but osman loves me and tis all forgotten   my every thought my every hope is fixed   on him alone and my enraptured soul   can dwell on naught but osman o my friend   think on his lovely form and graceful mind   his noble deeds his glory and renown   the crown he offers is not worth my care   the poor return of gratitude would ill   repay his passion love would spurn the gift   tis not to osmans throne but osmans self   that i aspire perhaps i am to blame   but trust me fatima if heaven had doomed him   to zaïres fate if he were now like me   a wretched slave and i on syrias throne   or love deceives me much or i should stoop   with joy and raise him up to me and empire    fatima   but hark they come this way perhaps tis osman zaïre   it is it must be he my fluttering heart   speaks his arrival for these two long days   he hath been absent but propitious love   restores him to my wishes scene ii osman zaïre fatima osman   virtuous zaïre   ere hymen join our hands permit me here   to pour forth all my honest heart before you   i follow not our eastern monarchs laws   nor act by their example well i know   how wide a field is left by mahomet   for luxury to range in that at pleasure   i might command a crowd of kneeling slaves   receive their incense and return their love   from the seraglios peaceful seats deal forth   my laws and in the arms of indolence   govern my kingdom but that well i know   how sloth deludes us tempting are her charms   but fatal is their end a hundred kings   have i beheld her tributary slaves   our prophets most unworthy successors   caliphs that trembled midst the splendid pomp   of visionary power and only held   the name of kings who might have lived the lords   of all mankind the conquerors of the world    0   had they but been like their great ancestors   the masters of themselves then solyma   and syria fell beneath the valiant bouillon   but heaven to chastise the impious foe   upraised the arm of mighty saladin   my father conquered jordan and to him   unequal to the weight of empire next   succeeded osman the disputed lord   of a weak kingdom whilst the haughty christians   thirsting for blood thick from the western coast   pour in upon me whilst the voice of war   and the shrill trumpet heard on every side   call us to arms shall osman waste his hours   in the loose dalliance of a soft seraglio   no zaïre love and glory bear me witness   to thee alone i swear eternal truth   to take thee for my mistress and my wife   to live thy friend thy lover and thy husband   zaïre alone shall with the toils of war   divide my heart think not i mean to trust   thy honor to our savage asian guards   those shameless pandars to the lawless pleasures   of their imperious masters i esteem   as well as love thee and to zaïres self   its fittest guard commit my zaïres virtue   thou knowest my heart on thee alone thou seest   osman has placed his hopes of happiness   i need not add how wretched it would make   my future life shouldst thou repay my fondness   with the poor cold return of gratitude   i love thee zaïre yes with rapture love thee   and hope to find in thee an equal claim   i own whateer the heart of osman seeks   it seeks with ardor i should think you hated   did you not love me with excess of passion        such is my nature if it suits with thine   i am thy husband but on this condition   and only this if marriage did not make   thee happy i were most supremely wretched zaïre   wretched my lord o if thy happiness   depends on zaïres truth and zaïres love   never was mortal half so blest as osman   yes the fond lover and the tender wife   all thou canst wish for shalt thou find in zaire   for thou hast raised her far above her sex   above her hopes o what excess of bliss   to hold my life my happiness from thee   such envied bounties from the man i love   to be the work of thy creating hand   but if among the crowd of rival hearts   thy partial favor has selected zaïres   o if thy choice— scene iii osman zaïre fatima orasmin orasmin

comes he not orasmin   my lord he waits without   i did not think a christian might approach   your royal presence in this sacred place osman   in every place access is free to osman   i hate our eastern policy that hides   its tyrants from the public eye to screen   oppression give him entrance scene iv osman zaïre fatima orasmin nerestan nerestan   generous sultan   whose virtues even thy christian foes admire   i come as bound in honor to discharge   my vows and bring with me the promised ransom   of beauteous zaïre the fair selima   and ten more christian prisoners i have done   my duty to the captives do thou thine   and set them free i have bestowed on them   my little all and naught remains for me   but noble poverty nerestan still   must be thy slave i have preserved my honor   unblemished and fulfilled my sacred word osman   christian thy virtue merits my best praise   but think not osman eer will be surpassed        in generosity receive thy freedom   take back thy treasures take my bounty with them   i promised thee ten christian slaves ill give thee   a hundred more demand them when thou wilt   let them depart and teach their countrymen   that even in syrias plains some virtues dwell   thence let them judge if they or osman best   deserve to reign in solyma but know   old lusignan must still remain a captive   it were not safe to give him liberty   sprung from the royal blood of france he claims   a right to govern here and that alone   condemns him to perpetual slavery   to groan in chains and never more behold   the light of day i pity him and yet   it must be so cruel necessity   compels me to this rigor and for zaïre   she must remain with me not all thy gold   can purchase her not the whole race of christians   with all their kings shall ever force her from me   you may depart fatima   what do i hear nerestan   my lord   she is a christian born i have your word   your honor and her own that she should go   when i returned poor lusignan could he   offend thee wherefore wouldst thou— osman   christian hence   it is my will therefore no more thy pride   offends me go and ere tomorrows sun   shines on this palace leave my kingdom    fatima   heaven   assist us now osman   go zaïre and assume   thy empire oer my palace there command   as my sultana i will hence and give   my orders for our nuptials scene v osman orasmin osman   didst thou mark   orasmin that presumptuous slave he sighed   and fixed his eyes upon her orasmin   o my lord   beware of jealousy osman   ha jealous sayest thou   thinkest thou the pride of osman will descend   so low to love as if i hated her   suspicion but provokes the crime it fears   zaire is truth itself and o orasmin   i love her to idolatry if eer   i could be jealous—if my foolish heart—   but i will think no more on it let my soul   dwell on the sweet idea of her charms   haste my orasmin and get all things ready   for the dear happy moment that unites   thy sovereign to the object of his wishes        one hour i will devote to public cares   the rest shall all be given to love and zaïre end of the first act act ii scene i nerestan chatillon chatillon   joy to our great deliverer the brave   the generous nerestan sent by heaven   to save thy fellow christians o come forth   appear amongst us and receive the tribute   due to thy virtues let the happy few   whom thou has blest with freedom clasp thy knees   and kiss thy gracious hand they crowd to see   their benefactor do not hide thyself   from their desiring eyes but let us all   united— nerestan   o chatillon talk not thus   of my deservings i have done no more   than was my duty circumstanced like me   like me thou wouldst have acted chatillon   every christian   should sacrifice himself to his religion   to leave our own and think on others good   is our first happiness how blest art thou   by gracious heaven appointed to perform   this noble duty but for us the sport   of cruel fortune slaves in solyma   by osmans father left in chains and long        forgotten here for life we had remained   in sad captivity nor eer beheld   our native land had not thy generous aid   stepped in to save us nerestan   twas the hand of heaven   i was but its unworthy instrument   its providence hath softened the fierce soul   of youthful osman but a bitter draught   is poured into my cup of joy his mercy   is cruel and oppressive god who sees   my heart will bear me witness that i meant   to serve his cause and act for him alone   for heaven i had reserved a youthful beauty   whom fierce nouraddin had enslaved what time   the proud contemners of our holy faith   surprised great lusignan myself longtime   a captive with her i at length regained   short liberty on promise of return   and now had fondly hoped delusive dream   to bring back zaïre to that happy court   where louis and the virtues reign already   the queen propitious to my friendly zeal   forth from the throne stretched her protecting hand   but now alas the wishedfor moment near   that should have freed her from captivity   she must not go what did i say she will not   zaïre herself forsakes the christian faith   for osman for the sultan who it seems   adores her—but well think no more of zaïre   another cruel care demands our grief   another base refusal o chatillon   the wretched christians hope is now no more    chatillon   accept my all my liberty my life   if it can save them tis at thy disposal nerestan   alas old lusignan is still a slave   the last of his great race a race of heroes   descended from the valiant bouillon he   whom fame has made immortal still must groan   in chains for osman never will restore him chatillon   then all thy goodness all thy cares are vain   what soldier who eer held his honor dear   would wish for freedom whilst his chief remains   in slavery thou nerestan couldst not know   the gallant lusignan as i have known him   for thou wert born so gracious heaven ordained   long after those sad times of woe and slaughter   when i beheld our city fall a prey   to these barbarians o if thou hadst seen   the temple sacked the holy tomb profaned   fathers and children husbands daughters wives   in flames expiring at the altars feet   our good old sovereign bent beneath the weight   of years and murdered oer his bleeding sons   then lusignan the last of his high race   revived our drooping courage terrible   he stood amidst the carnage of the field   his right hand grasped a falchion wet with blood   and with the left he pointed to the cross   then cried aloud now countrymen be faithful   the power divine that favored us this day   protected him in that tremendous hour        beneath its friendly wing and smoothed his path   to safety and repose cæsarea then   received our poor remains where lusignan   was by the general voice proclaimed our king   o my nerestan the almighty power   to humble haughty man withholds from him   fair virtues prize till lifes short race is run   we fought longtime for heaven but fought in vain   the sacred city smoking in its ruins   still lay when by a treacherous greek betrayed   in our asylum we beheld the flame   that raged in hapless sion reach to us   and over cæsareas walls with fury spread   there bound in ignominious chains i saw   great lusignan superior to misfortune   and only weeping for his countrys fate   eer since that fatal hour the good old man   the christians father he deserves that name   in a dark dungeon lies by all neglected   by all forgotten such is the hard fate   for us he suffers and whilst he is wretched   tell me nerestan how can we be happy nerestan   unless we were barbarians o i loathe   the destiny that keeps us from each other   thou hast recalled the times and sorrows past   i shudder at the sad remembrance of them   cæsarea buried in her smoking ruins   thy prison and great lusignan in bondage   were the first objects that my eyes beheld   i know thy woes with them my life began   midst shrieking infants ravished from the breasts   of trembling mothers was nerestan borne   to this seraglio with my fellowcaptive        the lovely zaïre who forgive my sighs   for this barbarian now hath left her god chatillon   it is the glory of these mussulmans   thus to seduce the minds of captive christians   blest be the hand of heaven that saved thy youth   from their delusions but my lord this zaïre   though she renounced the christian faith may serve   the christian cause her interest with the sultan   who loves her may be useful by what arm   god sends us help it matters not for justice   with wisdom oft conspires to draw advantage   alike from our misfortunes and our crimes   the beauteous zaïres influence may subdue   the stubborn heart of osman and persuade him   to give us back a hero whom himself   must needs admire and whom he cannot fear nerestan   but thinkest thou lusignan would condescend   to take his liberty on terms like these   or if he would how can i get from zaïre   a moments audience osman will not grant it   will this seraglios gates for ever barred   open to me nay grant i gain admission   what can i hope from an apostate woman   nerestans presence would reproach her falsehood   and she must read her shame upon my brow   tis most ungrateful to the generous mind   to sue for aid of those whom we despise   if they refuse it sorely hurts our pride   and if they grant we blush to accept it of them  0 chatillon   yet think on lusignan and strive to serve him nerestan   i must but how to get at this false woman—   were interrupted ha who comes tis zaïre scene ii zaïre chatillon nerestan zaïre   to nerestan   be not alarmed by osmans leave i come   to thank the brave nerestan do not look   so sternly on me nor with bitter words   reproach my weakness i have wished yet feared   to meet thee why i know not but my heart   still flutters at thy presence from our birth   we have been subject to one common fate   one prison held us in our infant years   together have we felt the galling yoke   of slavery still by tender friendship made   lighter to both at length thy kinder fate   led thee to france and i was left to mourn   thy absence whether it arose from pity   from nobleness of soul or partial fondness   i know now but thy generous ardor fought   and gained a ransom for the hapless zaïre   but heaven hath counteracted thy kind purpose   and i am doomed for ever to remain   in solyma long time a slave unknown   and undistinguished zaïre lived till osman   lookd down upon me but tho fortune smiles   propitious now and offers all her charms        of pomp and grandeur yet i cannot leave   without regret my fellowcaptive oft   shall i reflect on thee and on thy goodness   and cherish the remembrance of thy virtues   like thee i will endeavor to relieve   the wretched ever will protect the christians   and be a mother to them for thy sake   they will be always dear to zaïre nerestan   you   protect the christian you who have forsaken them   you who have trampled on the sacred ashes   of lusignans great ancestors zaïre   o no   i hold their virtues in most dear remembrance   and

oer this tender weakness   this sweet embarrassment it makes me love thee   with double ardor zaïre   o osman   those sighs my zaïre   endear thee more to osman tis the mark   of modest virtue thus to shrink from love   but haste my charmer and repay my fondness   my constancy— zaïre   o fatima support me   my lord— osman   well what o heaven zaire   that heavens my witness   all zaires hopes of happiness were placed   on thee my soul desired to call thee mine        not that i sought the splendor of a throne   thoughts distant far and nobler filled my breast   i could have wish to thee and to thy virtues   united to have lived in solitude   with thee despised the pomp of asias pride   and spurned her crowns and sceptres at my feet   but o my lord these christians— osman   what have they   to do with osman or with osmans love zaïre   old lusignan oppressed with age and sorrow   now touches his last moments osman   be it so   what is that christian slave to thee or why   feelest thou for him thou art not of his faith   but from thy infant years hast followed mine   and worshipped osmans god shall zaïre weep   because an old man pays the debt of nature   at such a time as this shall zaïre mourn   should she not rather centre all her cares   in osman now and think of naught but love zaïre   if ever i was dear to thee— osman   if ever   o god zaïre   defer my lord a little while   our nuptials let me—    osman   ha what sayest thou heaven   can zaïre speak thus zaïre   o i cannot bear   his anger osman   zaïre zaïre   o forgive my lord   these sighs alas i have forgot myself   forgot my duty all i owe to thee   i cannot bear that look—permit me sir   but for a moment to retire to hide   my tears my grief my love and my despair   she goes out scene vii osman orasmin osman   amazement dumb and motionless i stand   with horror did i hear aright orasmin   was it to me that zaïre spoke to osman   does she avoid me fly from me o heaven   what have i seen and whence this wondrous change   shes gone shes lost i know not who i am   or what or where orasmin   you are yourself the cause        of your complaint and but accuse a heart   where you and you alone in triumph reign osman   but why those sighs those tears that sudden flight   whence that deep sorrow in her downcast eyes   so plainly written o if that wily frenchman—   horrible thought how dreadfully the light   breaks in upon me tis impossible   a vile barbarian o it cannot be   orasmin thinkest thou that the heart of osman   will eer descend to fear a christian slave   but tell me thou perhaps couldst mark her features   and understand the language of her eye   am i betrayed nay do not hide thy thoughts   but let me know my misery ha thou tremblest   it is enough orasmin   i would not rive thy heart   with fond suspicions i beheld her weep   but nothing more saw naught that could alarm— osman   was i reserved to bear an injury   like this had zaïre meant to play me false   she would have done it with more art would neer   have openly avowed her treacherous purpose   o no she must be innocent but tell me   this frenchman—he thou sayest too sighed and wept   and what of that he might not sigh for her   it was not love perhaps that made him weep   or if it was why should i fear a slave   one who tomorrow parts from her forever    orasmin   against our laws my lord you gave him leave   to see her twice he came osman   the traitor yes   i know he did but if again he dares   to visit her ill tear the slave to pieces   and mix his lifeblood with the faithless zaires   pardon my friend the transports of a heart   so deeply pierced it is by nature warm   and has been wounded in the tenderest part   i know my rage orasmin and my weakness   know tis beneath me to be thus disturbed   but zaïre—o i cannot will not think it   her heart could neer be guilty of such baseness   it was not made for falsehood nor shall osman   stoop to complaint or mean submission no   it were unworthy of a king to wait   for explanations of this strange conduct   i will resume that empire oer my heart   which i had lost forget the very name   of zaïre yes henceforth let my seraglio   be shut forever fear and terror reign   within my palace let despotic power   rule unreluctant oer a race of slaves   osman henceforth shall be an eastern king   and reign like them perhaps we may forget   our rank a while and cast an eye of favor   upon our vassals but to stand in awe   of a proud mistress is most shameful no   to western climes we leave such fond submission   the dangerous sex ambitious to enslave        our easy hearts and bend them to their will   in europe rule but here they must obey end of the third act act iv scene i zaïre fatima fatima   how i admire and how i pity thee   the christian god inspires thee let not then   thy soul despair for he shall give thee strength   to break the powerful chains of mighty love zaïre   when shall i make the glorious sacrifice fatima   thou suest to heaven for pardon but mayest claim   its justice god will guard thy innocence   and shield thy virtue zaïre   zaïre never wanted   his kind protection more fatima   the god thou servest   will be a father to thee he shall guide   thy wandering steps speak to thy doubting heart   and take thee to his bosom though the priest   dare not attend thee here— zaïre   alas my friend   how have i pierced the soul of generous osman   and driven him to despair a dreadful task        but tis thy will o god and i obey   zaïre had been too happy fatima   wilt thou then   hazard the victory after all thy toil zaïre   unhappy victory and inhuman virtue   alas thou knowest not fatima how dear   they cost me all my hopes of happiness   were fixed on love and osman take my heart   accept my guilty tears subdue my passion   eternal god and make me all thy own   but o my friend even now the lovely image   of my dear generous osman steps between   my god and me that form is still before me   forever in my sight ye race of kings   from whom i sprang my father mother country   and thou my god since you have taken him from me   finish a life that is not worth my care   without him let me die a blameless victim   let osman close the eyes of her he loved   but he has left me left the wretched zaïre   inquires not thinks not of me o i faint   my fatima i never can survive it fatima   remember thou art the daughter of a king   the favorite of heaven the chosen of god   and will not he protect thee zaïre   will he not   protect my osman too a god of mercy        can never hate can never persecute   a heart so just so brave so good as osmans   what could he more had he been born a christian   o that this holy minister would come   this blest interpreter of heavens high will   to ease my wounded heart and give me comfort   still i have hope that kind benignant god   whose darling attribute is clemency   will not forbid our union will forgive   the struggles of a heart so torn as mine   perhaps by raising zaïre to the throne   of syria he might serve the christian cause   great saladin thou knowest whose potent arm   robbed us of jordans empire who like osman   was famed for mercy from a christian sprung fatima   alas thou seest not that to calm thy soul   mistaken as thou art— zaïre   i see it all   see that my father country friends condemn me   see that i follow lusignan yet love   adore my osman see that still my life   is linked with his o i could wish to see him   to throw me at his feet and tell him all fatima   that would destroy thy brother and endanger   the christians who have no support but thee   thou wouldst betray that god who calls thee back   from errors paths and bids thee follow him zaïre   o didst thou know the noble heart of osman    fatima   he is protector of the mussulman   therefore the more he loves thee doubtless zaïre   less willing must he be to have thee worship   a god his faith has taught him to abhor   the priest thou knowest will visit thee in secret   and thou hast promised— zaïre   i will wait for him   ive promised to preserve the secret still   from osman cruel silence but to make   my woes complete i am no longer loved scene ii osman zaïre osman   there was a time when thy deluding charms   inflamed my soul a willing captive then   i gloried in my chains i hoped indeed   vain hope a sovereign sighing at thy feet   might claim some kind return and thought myself   beloved by zaïre but i am undeceived   yet think not madam i will ever stoop   to mean complaints or with the whining race   of vulgar lovers vindicate my wrongs   by loud reproaches no i am above   dissimulation and am come to tell you   i mean to treat it with that just contempt   which it deserves think not by female arts   or subtle arguments to color oer   thy conduct i disclaim thee know thee not    0   and for i would not make thee blush desire   the hated cause may be a secret still   i would not wish to know it all is past   another may be found to fill the throne   which you despise another may have eyes   perhaps for osmans merit and a heart   for osmans love i know twill cost me dear   to part from zaïre but i am resolved   for i had rather lose thee rather die   with anguish and despair than make thee mine   if but a sigh escaped thee for another   and not for osman fare thee well these eyes   must neer behold thee more zaïre   it is thy will   o god to reign unrivalled in my heart   and thou hast robbed me now of all—my lord   since you no longer love me— osman   tis too true   honor commands it i adored thee once   but i must leave thee must renounce thee twas   thy own request—beneath another law—   zaïre thou weepest zaïre   o think not i beseech you   think not my lord i shall regret the pomp   and splendor of a throne it is decreed   that i must lose thee such is my hard fate   but punish me forever angry heaven   if there be aught on earth i shall regret   but osmans heart    osman   zaïre thou lovest me zaïre   love him   o god osman   amazement zaïre said she loved me   why then thou cruel maid why tear the heart   of faithful osman thus in my despair   alas i thought i could command myself   to love or hate but tis impossible   zaïre can never be forgotten no   osman could never harbor such a thought   to place another on his throne forgive   my rage my madness twas affected all   all false i could not leave i could not hate thee   it was the only scorn thy tender heart   ever experienced o i love thee still   and ever must but wherefore thus delay   my happiness speak was it fond caprice   or was it fear or artifice but art   was never made for thee thou needest it not   even where it is most innocent it looks   like falsehood and perfidiousness o zaïre   let it not break the holy tie that binds us   i ever have abhorred it osmans heart   is full of naught but truth zaïre   despair and horror   o thou art dear to me indeed thou art   believe me osman and the tender love   i feel for thee makes me supremely wretched    osman   explain thyself o heaven and can it be   but thou wert born to make me wretched zaïre   why   must i not speak osman   what dreadful secret zaïre   dost thou keep from me have the christian slaves   conspired against me speak am i betrayed zaïre   who would betray so good so kind a master   no generous osman thou hast naught to fear   zaïre alone is wretched but her griefs   are to herself osman   great god is zaïre wretched zaïre   permit me on my knees my lord to ask   one favor of thee osman   were it osmans life   thou mightest command it speak and it is thine zaïre   o would to heaven we could have been united   but o my lord permit me this one day   to be alone leave me to meditate   on my misfortunes and to hide my griefs   from thee tomorrow all shall be revealed osman   o heaven what woes dost thou inflict upon me   canst thou—    zaïre   if love still pleads for zaïre grant her   this one request do not refuse me osman   well   it must be so i have no will but thine   remember that i sacrifice to thee   the dearest happiest moments of my life zaïre   o talk not thus my lord it wounds my heart   too deeply osman   you will leave me zaïre zaïre   yes   i must farewell scene iii osman orasmin osman   so soon to seek retirement   it is an insult oer my easy heart   the more i think orasmin on her conduct   the more am i perplexed i cannot find   the hidden cause of this mysterious sorrow   by osmans partial fondness raised to empire   even in the bosom of that happiness   her soul desired thus loving and beloved   yet are her eyes forever bathed in tears   i hate her fond caprice her discontent        and causeless grief—yet was not i to blame   did i not slight her did i not offend   my zaïre wherefore then should i complain   i must atone for my injurious transports   by double kindness by indulging her   in every wish it is enough that osman   is loved by zaïre her untainted soul   is void of art hers is the tender age   of innocence and truth when simple nature   guides every thought and dictates every word   i will rely on her sincerity   i know she loves me in her eyes i read   the tender tale whilst her impatient soul   flew to her lovely lips and told me all   can there on earth be hearts so base as eer   to boast a passion which they never feel scene iv osman orasmin melidor melidor   my lord the guards have stopped a letter sent   to zaïre osman   give it me who sent it to her melidor   one of those christian slaves whom you released   who as he strove to enter the seraglio   was seized and put in chains osman   ha what do i read   leave me—i tremble—    scene v osman orasmin orasmin   this may clear up all   and set your heart at ease osman   ha let me read   again this letter must determine all   and fix my fate—dear zaïre nows the time   to meet us near the mosque thou wilt perceive   a secret passage unsuspected thence   thou mayest escape and easily deceive   thy keepers we must hazard all thou knowest   my zeal i wait impatient for thee haste   i cannot live if thou shouldst prove unfaithful   what sayest thou my orasmin orasmin   i my lord   im shocked astonished at her osman   now thou seest   how i am treated orasmin   o detested treason   you must resent an injury like this   you who so lately but on slight suspicion   so deeply felt the wound a deed so black   i hope my lord will cure you of your love osman   haste my orasmin fly this instant show her        that letter—let her tremble and then plunge   the dagger in her faithless breast—no stay   not yet—that christian first—let him be brought   before her—stay—i can determine nothing   my rage oerpowers me o i faint support me   orasmin orasmin   tis indeed a cruel stroke osman   tis all unfolded now this dreadful secret   that sat so heavy on her guilty heart   beneath the specious veil of modest fear   she left me for a while i let her go   she wept at parting wept but to betray me   o zaïre zaïre orasmin   everything conspires   to make her doubly guilty o my lord   fall not a victim to her arts recall   thy wonted courage and deep sense of wrong osman   this is the gallant boasted brave nerestan   the christians hero that proud son of honor   so famed for his sublimity of virtue   admired nay envied by the jealous osman   who could not bear a rival in a slave   and now he stoops to this vile treachery   this base imposture o but zaïre—she   is far more guilty o a thousand times   more vile more impious—a poor christian slave   i might have left her in her mean estate   and not debased her well she knows what osman   has done for her ungrateful wretch    orasmin   my lord   if midst the horrors of thy troubled soul   i might be heard—forgive me—but if— osman   yes   ill see and talk to her—go fetch her hither   fly bring her slave orasmin   in this distracted state   what can you say to her osman   i know not what   but i must see her orasmin   to complain to threaten   to make her weep to let your easy heart   again be softened by her tears to seek   in spite of all your wrongs some poor pretence   to justify her conduct trust me sir   twere better to conceal this paper from her   or send it to her by some hand unknown   thus spite of all her arts thou mayest discover   her inmost thoughts and unsuspected trace   the secret windings of her treacherous heart osman   dost thou indeed believe that zaïres false   but i will tempt my fate and try her virtue   ill try how far a bold and shameless woman   can urge her falsehood    orasmin   o my lord i fear   a heart like thine— osman   be not alarmed alas   osman like zaïre never can dissemble   but i am master of myself and know   how to restrain my anger yes orasmin   since she descends so low—here—take this letter   this fatal scroll choose out a trusty slave   and send it to her—go—i will avoid her   let her not dare approach—just heaven tis she scene vi osman zaïre orasmin zaïre   i have obeyed your orders and attend you   but own they much surprised me whence my lord   this sudden message what important business— osman   business of moment madam of much more   than you perhaps imagine ive reflected   on our condition zaïre we have made   each other wretched and tis fit we come   to explanations for our mutual interest   perhaps my care my tenderness my bounty   the confidence my soul reposed on zaïre   my pride forgot my sceptre at thy feet   all my officious services demanded   some kind return from zaïre nay perhaps        forever courted and forever pressed   by a fond lover thy reluctant heart   might yield mistaking gratitude for love   let us be free and open to each other   answer with truth to my sincerity   if loves supreme unconquerable power   pleads for another if thy doubtful heart   uncertain wavers twixt his claim and mine   avow it frankly and i here forgive thee   but pause not let me know my rival quick   now whilst im here whilst i am speaking to thee   a moment more will be too late for pardon zaïre   is this a language fit for me to hear   or you to speak my lord ive not deserved it   but know this injured heart which heaven hath tried   with sore affliction could defy thy power   did it not feel its foolish weakness still   for osman were it not for my fond love   that fatal passion which i ought no more   to cherish never should i thus descend   to justify my conduct whether heaven   that still hath persecuted wretched zaïre   decrees that we shall pass our lives together   i know not but whatever be my lot   by honors sacred laws that in my heart   are deeply graved i swear were zaïre left   to her own choice she would reject the vows   of powerful monarchs kneeling at her feet   all would be hateful to her after osman   but i will tell thee more will open all   my foolish heart will own it sighed for thee   long ere thy passion justified my own    0   never did zaïre own another master   nor ever will here bear me witness heaven   if i offended if i have deserved   eternal wrath if zaïre has been guilty   if she has been ungrateful twas for thee osman   good heaven she talks of tenderness and love   though i have proof before me of her falsehood   o black ingratitude o perjured zaïre zaïre   what says my lord you seem disordered osman   no   i am not for thou lovest me zaïre   that fierce tone   and wild demeanor suit not with thy words   thou talkest of love yet fillest my heart with terror osman   thou lovest me zaïre   canst thou doubt it yet thy eyes   are red with anger what indignant looks   they cast upon me furies in thy aspect   thou dost not doubt me osman   no i doubt no longer   you may retire be

hast thou dispatched that slave   that i may know the worst of zaïres guilt   and osmans shame orasmin   i have obeyed your orders   now i may hope you will no longer sigh   for zaïre and her treacherous charms henceforth   you must behold her with indifference   unless you should at last repent your justice   and love resume his empire oer your heart osman   orasmin i adore her more than ever orasmin   indeed my lord o heaven osman   methinks i see   a dawn of hope before me this young christian   this hated rival bold presumptuous vain   full of his countrys levity perhaps   but thinks that zaïre listened to his vows   one look from her might easily deceive him        he thinks himself beloved and he alone   may be to blame they may not both be guilty   she never saw that letter i have been   too ready to believe myself undone   orasmin mark me—at the dead of night   when darkness lends her sable veil to hide   the crimes of mortals soon as this nerestan   comes to the palace instant let the guard   seize him and bound in fetters bring him to me   leave zaïre free thou knowest my heart thou knowest   to what excess i love thou knowest how fierce   my anger is how

desire to speak with wretched zaïre   at such a time when all is horror round me   if it should be my brother but the gates   are shut on every side yet heavens high hand   to strengthen my weak faith by secret paths   might lead him to me but what unknown slave— slave   this letter madam trusted to my hands   will speak my errand zaïre   give it me   she reads fatima   aside whilst zaïre reads the

title   to gratify his insolent ambition   when lo amidst this scene of adulation   came antony and bustled through the crowd   that stood twixt him and cæsar in his hand   a crown and sceptre when o shameful act   disgraceful to a roman whilst we stood   in silent admiration unabashed   he placed the crown on cæsars head then knelt   and cried out cæsar live and reign oer us   and oer the world

welcomed with smiles returning liberty   illfounded hopes and momentary joy   antony seemed astonished cæsar still   blushed and dissembled and the more he strove   to hide his grief the more was he applauded   by moderation he would veil his crimes   affects to scorn the crown and spurn it from him   but spite of all his efforts to conceal it         was galled within to hear the people praise

thou knowest i could command it with a word   and thou hast merited no better fate   it is the pride of thy ungrateful heart   still to offend me and i find thee here   amongst those romans whose dark perfidy   i most suspect with those who proudly dared   to blame my conduct and defy my power brutus   they talked like romans gave thee noble counsel   hadst thou been wise thou wouldst have followed it cæsar   yet ill be calm and bear thy insolence   will stoop beneath myself and talk to thee   what layest thou to my charge brutus   a ravaged world   the blood of nations and thy plundered country   thy power thy specious virtues that gild oer   thy crimes thy fatal clemency that makes   thy chains so easy a destructive charm   to soothe thy captives and deceive mankind cæsar   reproach like this had suited pompey well   he whose dissembled virtues have betrayed thee   that haughty citizen more fatal far   would not admit even cæsar as his equal   thinkest thou if he had conquered his proud soul   had left secure the liberty of rome   he would have ruled you with a rod of iron   what then had brutus done     brutus   he would have slain him cæsar   is that the fate which cæsar must expect   from thee thou answerest not o brutus brutus   thou livest but for my ruin brutus   if thou thinkest so   prevent my fury what withholds thee cæsar   giving him the letter from servilia

lived too long cæsar   o speak   i see thy heart is laboring with remorse   and anguish o hide nothing from me still   thou art silent does the sacred name of son   offend thee brutus art thou fearful of it   fearest thou to love me to partake my fortunes   is cæsars blood so hateful to thee oh   this sceptre of the world this power supreme   for thee alone that cæsar whom thou hatest   desired

hatred or from tenderness   what secret weight hangs heavy on thy soul brutus   cæsar— cæsar   well what brutus   i cannot speak to him cæsar   thou seemest as if thou durst not call me father     brutus   o if thou art my father grant me this   this only boon cæsar   ask it to give it thee   will make me happy brutus   kill me then this moment   or wish no more to be a king cæsar   away   barbarian hence unworthy of my love   unworthy of thy race thou art no more   my son go henceforth i disclaim thee   my heart shall take example from thy own   and stifle natures voice shall learn of

justice   my easy heart is weary of forgiveness   ill act like sulla now like him be cruel   and make you tremble at my vengeance go   find out your vile seditious friends they all   insulted me and all shall suffer for it   they know what cæsar can do and shall find   what cæsar dare if i am barbarous   remember thou alone hast made me so brutus   i must not leave him to his cruel purpose   but save if possible my friends and cæsar end of the second act     act iii scene i cassius cimber decimus cinna casca with the rest of the conspirators cassius   at length the hour is come when rome again   shall breathe again shall flourish unoppressed   by tyrants soon the mistress of the world   to freedom and to fame shall be restored   yours is the honor decimus and casca   cimber and probus but one hour and cæsar   shall be no more what cato pompey all   the power of asia never could perform   we my brave friends alone shall execute   we will avenge our country on this day   thus may we speak to all mankind henceforth   respect the state of rome for she is free cimber   behold thy friends all ready to obey thee   to live or die with thee to serve the senate   to take the tyrants life or lose their own decimus   but where is brutus cæsars deadliest foe   he who assembled he who made us swear   who first shall plunge the dagger in his breast   why comes he not the soninlaw of cato   should not have tarried thus he may be stopped   cæsar perhaps may know—but see he comes   gods what dejection in his aspect     scene ii to them brutus cassius   brutus   what sinks thee thus what new misfortune say   doth cæsar know it all is rome betrayed brutus   he knows not our design upon his life   but trusts to you decimus   what then hath troubled thee brutus   a dreadful secret that will make you tremble cassius   cæsars approaching death perhaps our own   brutus we all can die but shall not tremble brutus   i will unveil it and astonish thee   cæsar thou knowest is brutus foe ive sworn   to kill him fixed the time the place the moment   of his destruction tis but what i owe   to rome to you and your posterity   nay to the happiness of all mankind   and the first blow must come from brutus hand   all is prepared and now let me inform thee   that brutus is—his son   cimber   the son of cæsar     cassius   his son decimus   o rome brutus   yes cæsar and servilia   married in private brutus was the fruit   of their unhappy nuptials cimber   art thou then   a tyrants son cassius   it cannot must not be   thou art too much a roman brutus   tis too true   ye see my friends the horror of my fate   but i am yours for sacred is my word   which of you all hath strength of mind sufficient   with more than stoic courage far above   the common race of men to tell me how   brutus should act i yield me to your sentence   all silent all with downcast eyes thou cassius   wilt not thou speak no friendly hand stretched out   to save me from this horrid precipice   cassius thou tremblest thy astonished soul— cassius   i tremble at the counsel i must give brutus   yet speak     cassius   were brutus one amongst the crowd   of vulgar citizens i should have said   go be a brother tyrant serve thy father   destroy that country which thou shouldst support   rome shall hereafter be revenged on both   but i am talking to the noble brutus   the scourge of tyrants whose unconquered heart   hath not a drop of cæsars blood within it   thou knewest the traitor catiline whose rage   was well nigh fatal to us all brutus   i did cassius   if on the day when that abhorred monster   levelled the blow at liberty and rome   if when the senate had condemned the traitor   he had acknowledged brutus for his son   how wouldst thou then have acted brutus   canst thou ask me   thinkest thou my heart thus in a moment changed   could balance twixt a traitor and my country cassius   brutus that word alone points out thy duty   it is the senates will and romes in safety   but say hast thou indeed those secret checks   which vulgar minds mistake for natures voice   and shall a word from cæsar thus extinguish   thy love for rome thy duty and thy faith   or true or false the secret that he told thee   is he less guilty art thou less a roman   art thou not brutus though the son of cæsar         is not thy hand thy heart thy honor pledged   to us and to thy country if thou art   the tyrants son rome is thy mother still   we are thy brothers born as brutus was   within these sacred walls the adopted son   of cato bred by scipio and by pompey   the friend of cassius what wouldst thou desire   these are thy noblest titles and another   would but disgrace them what if cæsar smit   with lawless passion for the fair servilia   seduced her to his arms and gave thee birth   bury thy mothers follies in oblivion   twas cato formed thy noble soul to virtue   and cato is thy father therefore loose   the shameful tie that binds thee to another   firm to thy oaths and to thy cause remain   and own no parents but the worlds avengers brutus   my noble friends to you i next appeal cimber   by cassius judge of us by us of cassius   could we think otherwise of all romes sons   we were most guilty but why ask of us   what thy own breast can best inform thee brutus   alone can tell what brutus ought to do brutus   now then my friends ill lay my heart before you   with all its horrors o tis deeply wounded   and tears have flowed even from a stoics eye   after the dreadful oath which i have made   to serve my country and to kill my father   i weep to see myself the son of cæsar   admire his virtues and condemn his crimes         lament the hero and abhor the tyrant   pity and horror rend my troubled soul   i wish that fate you have prepared for him   would fall on brutus but ill tell you more   know i esteem him and midst all his crimes   his nobleness of heart has won me to him   if rome could eer submit to regal power   he is the only tyrant we should spare   be not alarmed that name alone secures me   rome and the senate have my faith the welfare   of all mankind declares against a king   yes i embrace the virtuous task with horror   and tremble at it but i will be faithful   i go to talk with cæsar and perhaps   to change and soften him perhaps to save   rome and himself o may the gods bestow   persuasive utterance on my lips and power   to move his soul but if in vain i plead   the cause of liberty if cæsar still   is deaf to my entreaties strike destroy him   ill not betray my country for my father   the world astonished may approve or blame   my cruel firmness and this deed hereafter   be called a deed of horror or of glory   my soul is not ambitious of applause   or fearful of reproach a roman still   and independent to the voice of duty   and that alone i listen for the rest   tis equal all away be slaves no longer cassius   the welfare of the state depends on thee   and on thy sacred word we shall rely   as if great cato and the gods of rome   had promised to defend us   0 scene iii brutus   alone   cæsar comes   even now to meet me tis the appointed hour   and this the place even in the capitol   where he must die let me not hate him gods   o stop this arm uplifted to destroy him   inspire his noble heart with love of rome   and if he is my father make him just   he comes i have not power to speak or move   great spirit of cato now support my virtue scene iv cæsar brutus cæsar   brutus were met what wouldst thou hast thou yet   a human heart art thou the son of cæsar brutus   i am if cæsar be the son of rome cæsar   was it for this thou proud republican   we met together comest thou to insult me   not all my bounties showered upon thy head   glory and empire and a subject world   waiting to pay thee homage naught can move   thy stubborn heart what thinkest thou of a crown     brutus   i think on it with horror cæsar   prejudice   and passion blind thee i excuse thy weakness   but canst thou hate me brutus   no i love thee cæsar   thy noble deeds long since inclined my heart   to reverence thee before thou hadst disclosed   the secret of my birth i wept to see thee   at once the glory and the scourge of rome   would cæsar be a roman citizen   i should adore him and would sacrifice   my life and fortune to defend his cause   but cæsar as a king i must abhor cæsar   what dost thou hate me for brutus   thy tyranny   o listen to the counsel to the prayers   the tears of rome the senate and thy son   wouldst thou desire to be the first of men   wouldst thou enjoy a right superior far   to all that war and conquest can bestow   wouldst thou be more than king nay more than cæsar— cæsar   whats to be done brutus   thou seest the world enslaved   bound to thy chariot break their chains in sunder   renounce the diadem and be a roman     cæsar   what hast thou bade me do brutus   what sulla did   before thee he had waded in our blood   he made rome free and all was soon forgotten   deep as his hands were dipped in deadly slaughter   he left the throne and washed his crimes away   thou hadst not sullas cruelty and rage   adopt his virtues then thy heart we know   can pardon therefore can thy heart do more   tis rome thou must forgive then shalt thou reign   as cæsar should then brutus is thy son   still do i plead in vain cæsar   rome wants a master   as one day thou perhaps mayest dearly prove   brutus our laws should with our manners change   that liberty thou dotest on is no more   than the fools right to hurt himself and rome   that spread destruction round the world now seems   to work her own the great colossus falls   and in her ruin buries half mankind   to me she stretches forth her feeble arm   to aid her in her perils since the days   of sulla all our virtues lost the laws   rome and the state are naught but empty names   alas thou talkest in these corrupted times   as if the decii and æmilii lived   cato deceived thee and thy fatal virtue   will but destroy thy country and thyself   submit thy reason to the conqueror   of cato and of pompey to a father   who loves thee brutus who laments thy errors         give me thy heart and be indeed my son   take other steps and force not nature thus   against thyself not answer me my brutus   but turn thy eyes away brutus   im not myself   strike me ye gods o cæsar— cæsar   thou are moved   i see thou art my son thy softened soul— brutus   thy lifes in danger knowest thou that my father   knowest thou theres not a roman then but wishes   in secret to destroy thee let thy own   thy countrys safety plead my cause by me   thy genius speaks it throws me at thy feet   and presses for thy welfare in the name   of all those gods thou hast so late forgotten   of all thy virtues in the name of rome   shall i yet add the tender name of son   a son who trembles for thee who prefers   to cæsar rome alone o hear and save me cæsar   leave me my brutus leave me brutus   be persuaded cæsar   the world may change but cæsar never will brutus   this is thy answer then     cæsar   i am resolved   rome must obey when cæsar hath determined brutus   then fare thee well cæsar   ha wherefore stay my son   thou weepest can brutus weep is it because   thou hast a king dost thou lament for rome brutus   i weep for thee and thee alone farewell   exit brutus cæsar   heroic virtue how i envy brutus   would i could love like

and the senate fix   their wavering minds but if i might be heard   if cæsar would give ear to one who loves him   a fellowsoldier and a friend to augurs   to dreadful omens to the gods themselves

mortal by the immortal gods   our days are numbered we must yield to fate   cæsar has nought to fear dolabella   cæsar has foes   and this new yoke may gall them what if these   conspire against thee

ye are fond of glory all i know   ye are and will applaud me for the deed romans   perish his memory cæsar was a tyrant     cassius   preserve these generous sentiments ye sons   of happy rome ye masters of the world   antony means i know to tamper with you   but youll remember he was cæsars slave   bred up beneath him from his infant years   and in corruptions school has learned from him   the tyrants art he comes to vindicate   his master and to justify his crimes   contemns you all and thinks he can deceive you   he has a right to speak and must be heard   such is the law of rome and to the laws   i shall submit but in the people still   is lodged the power supreme to judge of cæsar   of antony and me ye now once more   possess those rights which had been wrested from you   which cæsar took and cassius hath restored   he will confirm them but i go my friends   to meet great brutus at the capitol   to those deserted walls once more to bring   long absent justice and our exiled gods   to calm the rage of faction and repair   the ruins of our liberty for you   i ask you but to know your happiness   and to enjoy it let no artifice   deceive you but beware of antony romans   if

i did indeed   i loved him romans would have given my life   to save my friends and who amongst you all   would not have died for cæsar had you known   like me his virtues to the laws he fell   a noble sacrifice i come not here   to gild his memory with a flattering tale   the world was witness to his deeds the world   proclaims his glory i but ask your pity   and beg you to forgive the tears of friendship first roman   cassius you might have shed them for your country   for rome in slavery cæsar was a hero   but cæsar was a tyrant too   0 second roman   a tyrant   could have no virtues cassius was our friend   and so was brutus antony   i have naught to urge   against his murderers they meant no doubt   to serve the state whilst generous cæsar poured   his bounties on their heads they shed his blood   but had he not been guilty rome would neer   have acted thus he must have been to blame   and yet did cæsar ever make you groan   beneath his power did he oppress his country   did he reserve the fruit of all his conquests   but for himself or did you share the spoil   were not the treasures of the conquered world   laid at your feet and lavished all on you   when he beheld his weeping countrymen   from his triumphal car he would descend   to soothe their griefs and wipe their tears away   what cæsar fought for rome in peace enjoys   rich by his bounty by his virtues great   he paid the service and forgot the wrongs   which he received immortal gods you knew   his heart was ever ready to forgive romans   cæsar was always merciful antony   alas   could his great soul have ever stooped to vengeance   he yet had lived and we had still been happy   not one of all his murderers but shared   his bounties twice had he preserved the life         of cassius—brutus—horrible to think   o heaven my friends i shudder at the crime   the base assassin brutus was—his son romans   his son ye gods antony   i see it shocks your souls   i see the tears that trickle down your cheeks   yes brutus is his son but you my friends   you were his children his adopted sons   o had ye seen his will romans   what is it tell us antony   rome is his heir his treasures are your own   and you will soon enjoy them o he wished   to serve his romans even beyond the grave   twas you alone he loved for you had gone   to sacrifice his fortune and his life   in asias plains o romans oft he cried   you are my sovereigns i am the worlds master   and you are mine could brutus have done more   or cassius romans   we detest them first roman   cæsar was   the father of his country antony   but hes gone   your father is no more the pride the glory   of human nature the delight of rome         cut off by vile assassins shall he go   unhonored undistinguished to the tomb   shall we not raise the funeral pile to one   so dear the father and the friend of rome   behold they bring him here   the farther part of the stage opens and discovers the lictors carrying the body of cæsar covered with a bloody robe antony descends from the rostrum and kneels down near the body romans   o dreadful sight antony   behold the poor remains of cæsar once   the first of men that god whom you adored   whom even his murderers loved your best support   in peace your guardian and in war your glory   who made whole nations tremble and the world   bow down before him is this he ye romans   this bleeding corse is this the mighty cæsar   mark but his wounds here cimber pierced him there   the perjured cassius and there decimus   there with unnatural hand the cruel brutus   deep plunged the fatal poniard cæsar looked   towards his murderer with an eye of love   and mild forgiveness as he sunk in death   he called him by the tender name of son   my child he cried— first roman   the monster o that heaven   had taken him hence before this fatal deed   the people crowd round the body   the blood still flows b      antony   o it cries out for vengeance   from you demands it hearken to the voice   awake ye romans hence and follow me   against these vile assassins the best tribute   that we can pay to cæsars memory   is to extirpate these usurpers haste   and with the torch that lights his funeral pile   set fire to every traitors house and plunge   your daggers in their breasts away my friends   let us avenge him let us offer up   these bloody victims to the gods of rome romans   we follow thee and swear by cæsars blood   to be revenged away antony   to dolabella   we must not let   their anger cool the multitude we know   is ever wavering fickle and inconstant   well urge them to a war and then perhaps   who best avenges cæsar may succeed him end of the third and last act c the prodigal     dramatis personæ old euphemon young euphemon

to hear it and i love to speak it i love now and then to reprove my soninlaw to rate him for     his coxcombial pedantic airs to be sure you acted like a wise father to turn your elder son out of doors that gamester that wild rakehelly profligate to make room for this prudent younger brother to place all your hopes on this promising youth and buy a presidentship for him o twas a wise act no doubt but the moment he became mr president by my troth he was stuffed up with vanity and impertinence he goes like clockwork walks and talks in time and says he has a great deal more wit than i have who you know brother have a great deal more than you he is— euphemon nay nay what a strange humor this is must you always be— rondon well well no matter what does it signify all these faults are

sighs and your groans what do you want your elder hopeful to come back that prodigal spendthrift to spoil all our pleasure at once and drop in like a troublefeast on the day of marriage euphemon no no rondon would you have him come and swear the house down euphemon no rondon beat you and run away with my daughter with my dear lise my lise who— euphemon long may that charming maid be preserved from such wicked fellows     rondon do you want him to come again to plunder his father do you want to give him your estate euphemon no no his brother shall have it all rondon ay or my daughter will have none of him euphemon today he shall have lise and all my fortune his brother will have nothing of me but the anger of a father whom he hath grievously injured he has deserved my hatred an unnatural boy rondon indeed you bore with him too long the other at least has acted with discretion but as for him he was a profligate my god what a libertine do you not remember ha ha that was a droll trick enough when he robbed you of your clothes horses linen and movables to equip his little jourdain who left him the very next morning many a time have i laughed at that i own euphemon o what pleasure can you find in repeating my misfortunes rondon and then his staking twenty rouleaux upon an ace o dear o dear euphemon have done with this     rondon dont you remember when he was to have been betrothed to my little lise in the face of the church where he had hid himself and upon whose account too—the debauched rogue euphemon spare me the remembrance good rondon of these unhappy circumstances that only set his conduct in the worst light am i not already unfortunate enough i left my own house the place of my nativity on purpose to remove as far as possible from my thoughts the memory of a misfortune which whenever it recurs distracts me your business led you to this place we have entered into a connection with and friendship for each other let me entreat you rondon make the proper use of it you are always repeating truths of some kind or other but let me tell you truth is not always agreeable rondon well well it is agreed i say no more i ask pardon but surely the devil was in you when you knew his violent temper to make a soldier of him euphemon again rondon forgive me but really you ought— euphemon i know it i know i ought to forget everything but my younger son and his marriage but tell me sincerely rondon think you he has been able to gain your daughters heart   0 rondon o no doubt of it my girl is a girl of honor and will be obedient to her father if i tell her she must fall in love her little docile heart which i can turn and wind just as i please falls in love immediately without any arguing about the matter i know how to manage her i warrant you euphemon i have notwithstanding some doubts about her obedience in this affair and am greatly mistaken if she answers your expectation my elder son had a place in her affections i know how strong the first impressions of love are upon a tender heart they are not worn out in a day indeed my friend they are not rondon nonsense nonsense euphemon say what you please that wild fellow knew how to be agreeable rondon not he indeed he was nobody a poor creature no no never you fear that after his behavior to you i bade my daughter never to think of him any more therefore set your heart at rest when i say no who shall dare to say yes but you shall see here she comes     scene ii euphemon rondon lise martha rondon come hither my dear this day my dear is a grand holiday for you i am sure for this day i intend to give you a husband now tell me my little lise be he old or young handsome or ugly grave or gay rich or poor shall you not have the strongest desire to please him have you not already an inclination for him are you not in love with him lise no sir rondon how gipsy— euphemon o ho my liege why your power is a little on the decline what is become of your despotic authority rondon ha how is this what after all i said to you have you no passion for your future husband no inclination no— lise none in the least sir rondon dont you know your duty obliges you to give him your whole heart     lise no sir i tell you no i know sir how far a heart obedient to the dictates of virtue is obliged by the solemn tie of marriage i know sir it is a wifes duty to make herself as amiable as possible and to endeavor to deserve a husbands tenderness to make amends by goodness for what she wants in beauty abroad to be discreet and prudent at home affable and agreeable but as for love it is quite another thing it will not endure slavery inclination can never be forced therefore never attempt it to my husband i shall yield up everything—but my heart and that he must deserve before he can possess it depend upon it that the heart will never be taught to love by the command of a father no nor be argued into it by reason nor frightened into it by a lawyer euphemon in my opinion the girl talks sensibly and i approve the justice of her argument my son i hope will endeavor to make himself worthy of a heart so noble and so generous rondon hold your tongue you old doting flatterer you corrupter of youth without your encouragement the girl would never have thought of prating to me in this ridiculous manner to lise hark ye miss i have provided you a husband perhaps he may have a little of the coxcomb and take upon him rather too much but it is my business to correct my soninlaw and yours to take him such as he is to love one another as well as you can and obey me in everything thats all you have to do and     now brother let us go sign and seal with my scrivener who will give us a hundred words where four would be sufficient come let us away and rattle the old brawler then will i come back and scold my son and your daughter and yourself euphemon mighty well sir come along scene iii lise martha martha my god what an odd mixture it is how strangely the old gentleman jumbles his ideas together lise i am his daughter still and his odd humors after all dont alter the goodness of his heart under this violence of passion and air of resentment he has still the soul of a father nay sometimes even in the midst of his freaks and while he is scolding me he will take my advice to be sure when he finds fault with the husband he has provided for me and tells me of the hazard i run in such a marriage he is but too much in the right but when at the same time he lays his commands on me to love him then indeed he is most miserably wrong martha how is it possible you should ever love this monsieur fierenfat id sooner marry an old soldier that swears gets drunk beats his wife and yet loves     her than a coxcomb of the long robe fond of nobody but himself who with a grave tone and pedantic air talks to his wife as if he was examining her in a court of justice a peacock that is always looking at his own tail who bridles under his band and admires himself a wretch who has even more covetousness than pride and makes love to you as he counts out his money lise thou hast painted him to the life but what can i do i must submit to this marriage we are not the disposers of our own fate my parents my fortune my age all conspire to force me into the bonds of wedlock this fierenfat in spite of my dislike of him is the only man here who can be my husband he is the son of my fathers friend and i cant possibly shake him off alas how few hearts are bestowed according to their own inclinations i must yield time and patience perhaps may conquer my disgust of him i may reconcile myself to the yoke and come at last to pass over his faults as i do my own martha mighty well resolved indeed my beautiful and discreet mistress but your heart i am afraid is not quite so open—o if i dared—but you have forbidden my ever mentioning— lise whom martha euphemon—who spite of all his vices i know had once an interest in your heart who loved you     lise o never never mention no more a name which i detest martha going off well well i say no more about him lise pulling her back it is true his youth did for a little time betray me into a tenderness for him but was he formed to make a virtuous woman happy martha going a dangerous fool indeed madam lise pulling her back he met with too many corrupters to lead him astray unhappy youth he took his round of pleasures but knew little i believe of love martha and yet there was a time when you seemed to think you had caught him in the toils lise if he had really loved it might have reformed him for believe me a real passion without disguise is the best curb on vice and he who feels it either is a worthy man or soon will be so but euphemon despised his mistress left love and tenderness for folly and debauchery those worthless villains who pretended to be his friends and drew him into the snare after having exhausted all his mothers fortune robbed his unhappy father and laid it upon     him to complete his misery those vile seducers took him away from his fathers protection and snatched him from me hid him forever from these eyes which bathed in tears still lament his vices and his charms i think no more about him martha his brother it seems succeeds to his fortunes and is to marry you mores the pity i say tother had a fine face fair hair a good leg danced well sang well in short was born for love lise what are you talking of martha even in the midst of all his freaks and follies all his strange conduct one might see a fund of honor in his heart lise there was he seemed formed for virtue martha dont think madam i mean to flatter him but to do him justice he was not mean nor servile no railer no sharper no liar lise no but— martha away here comes his brother lise nay we must stay now it is too late to get off     scene iv lise martha fierenfat the president fierenfat to be sure madam this augmentation of fortune must make the match more agreeable increase of riches is increase of happiness and as i may say the very soul of housekeeping fortune honor and dignity will not be wanting to the wife of m fierenfat at cognac madam you will have the precedency of the first ladies of the beaumonde let me tell you madam no little satisfaction you will hear them whispering as you go along there she goes madame la presidente really madam when i reflect upon my rank my riches the privilege of my high office and all the good qualities i possess altogether with my right of eldership which will be made over to me i assure you madam i pay you no small compliment martha now for my part i am of another opinion always to be talking of your quality your rank and your riches is extremely ridiculous a midas and narcissus at once blown up with your pride and contracted with avarice always looking at yourself and your money a petitmaitre with a band on the most unnatural of all human creatures a young coxcomb may pass off but a young miser is—a monster fierenfat i believe sweetheart it is not you whom i am to marry today but this lady therefore you will     please madam to trouble your head no more about us silence will become you best turning to lise you madam i hope who in an hour or two are to be my wife will i hope favor me so far as before night to dismiss this blustering bodyguard of yours who makes use of a chambermaids privilege to give rein to her impertinence but i would have her know i am not a president for nothing and may perhaps lock her up for her own good martha to lise speak to him madam and defend me if he locks me up he may lock you up too for aught i know lise aside i augur ill from all this martha speak to him then and dont mutter lise what can i say to him martha abuse him lise no ill reason with him martha that will never do take my word for it tothers the better way     scene v rondon fierenfat lise rondon upon my word a pleasant affair this fierenfat whats the matter rondon you shall hear as i was tramping to your old gentleman with the parchments i met him at the foot of this rock talking with a traveller who had just alighted from a coach lise a young traveller rondon no a toothless old fellow leaning on a crutch i observed them rubbing their gray beards against each other for some time shrugging up their humpbacks and sighing most piteously then they turned up the whites of their eyes and fell to snivelling together at last euphemon with a crabbed face told me he had met with a great calamity that at least he must have time to weep before he could sign the articles and at that time could not talk to anybody fierenfat o i must go myself and comfort him you know i can manage him as i please besides the affair is really my own concern but as soon as he sees me with the contract in my hand he will sign immediately   0 time is precious and my new right of eldership a matter of importance lise there is no hurry sir you need not be so impatient rondon but i say he shall be in a hurry all this is your doing madam lise how sir mine rondon yes yours madam all the crosses and disappointments that make families unhappy come from undutiful daughters lise what have i done sir to disoblige you rondon what have you done turned everything topsyturvy put us all in confusion but ill let these two wiseacres lay their heads together a little and then marry you off in spite of their teeth in spite of yourself too if you provoke me end of the first act act ii scene i lise martha martha i see this matrimony frightens you a little this noise and bustle of preparation has something terrible in it     lise to say the truth so it has and the more i think on the weight of this yoke the more this heart of mine trembles at it marriage in my opinion is the greatest good or the greatest evil there is no such thing as a medium in it where hearts are united where harmony of sentiment taste and humor strengthen the bonds of nature where love forms the tie and honor gives a sanction to it it is surely the happiest state which mortals can enjoy what pleasure must it be to own your passion publicly to bear the name of the dear beloved object of your wishes your house your servants your livery everything carrying with it some pleasing remembrance of the man you love and then to see your children those dear pledges of mutual affection that form as it were another union o such a marriage is a heaven upon earth but to make a vile contract to sell our name our fortune and our liberty and submit them to the will of an arbitrary tyrant and be only his first slave an upper servant in his family to be eternally jarring or running away from one another the day without joy and the night without love to be always afraid of doing what we should not do to give way to our own bad inclinations or to be continually opposing them to be under the necessity either of deceiving an imperious husband or dragging out life in a languid state of troublesome duty and obedience to mutter and fret and pine away with grief and discontent o such a marriage is the hell of this world martha the young ladies of this age have certainly they say some little demon some familiar to inspire     them why what a deal of knowledge this girl has picked up in so short a time the most expert artful widow in paris that ever comforted herself with the thought of having buried three husbands could not have talked more learnedly on this head than my young mistress here but we must have a little éclaircissement with regard to this marriage which it seems is so mighty disgusting you dont approve of monsieur le president pray how should you like his brother come unriddle the mystery to me has not the elder brother supplanted the younger come whom do you love or whom do you hate tell me the truth at once and speak honestly lise i know nothing about it i cannot dare not tell you the cause of my dislike why would you search for a melancholy truth at the bottom of a heart already but too deeply afflicted we can never see ourselves in the water whilst the tempest is howling around us no first let the storm be hushed the wind calm and the surface smooth martha comparisons madam will never pass for argument it is easy enough sometimes to see the bottom of a heart its clear enough and if the passions are now and then a little tempestuous a young lady of understanding can generally guess from what corner the wind blows that has raised the storm she knows well enough— lise i tell you i know nothing and i am resolved to shut my eyes and see nothing i would not wish to     know whether i am still weak enough to retain a passion for a wretch whom i ought to abhor nor would i increase my disgust for one man by regretting the charms of another no let the false euphemon live happy and content if he can be so but let him not be disinherited never will i be so cruel and inhuman as to make myself his sister on purpose to ruin and destroy him now you know my heart search into it no further unless you mean to tear it in pieces scene ii lise martha a servant servant madam the baroness of croupillac waits below lise her visit astonishes me servant she is just arrived from angoulême and comes to pay her respects to you lise upon what occasion martha o upon your marriage no doubt lise the very subject i would wish to avoid am i in a condition to listen to a heap of ridiculous compliments     a register of commonplace cant and hypocrisy that tires one to death where common sense is murdered by the perpetual exercise of talking without saying anything what a task i have to go through scene iii lise mme de croupillac martha martha here her ladyship comes lise ay i see her but too well martha they say she wants vastly to be married is apt to be a little quarrelsome and almost in her dotage lise some chairs here madam you will pardon me if— mme de croupillac o madam lise madam mme de croupillac i madam must likewise beg— lise pray be seated mme de croupillac sitting down upon my word madam i am quite confounded     and wish from the bottom of my soul it was in my power to— lise madam mme de croupillac yes madam i heartily wish i could steal your charms it makes me weep to see you so handsome lise pray madam be comforted mme de croupillac no madam thats impossible i see my dear you may have as many husbands as you please i had one too at least i thought so only one and thats a melancholy consideration and trouble enough i had to get him too and you are going to rob me of him there is a time madam—o dear how soon that time comes about—when if a lover deserts us we lose our all and one is quite left alone and let me tell you madam it is very cruel to take away all from one who has little or nothing left lise you must excuse me madam but i am really astonished both at your visit and your conversation what accident pray has afflicted you so whom have you lost or whom have i robbed you of mme de croupillac my dear child there are a great many wrinkled old fools who fancy that by the help of paint and a few false teeth they can stop the course of time and pleasure and fix wandering love but to my sorrow i am a little wiser i see too plainly that everything is running away and i cant bear it     lise i am sorry for it madam if it be so but i cant possibly make you young again mme de croupillac i know it but i have still some hopes perhaps to restore my false one to me might in some measure give me fresh youth and beauty lise what false one do you mean mme de croupillac my ungrateful cruel husband whom i have run after so long and little worthy he is of all my care the president madam lise the president mme de croupillac yes madam when croupillac was in her bloom she would not have talked to presidents their persons their manners their everything was my aversion but as we grow old we are not quite so difficult lise and so madam— mme de croupillac and so madam in short you have reduced me to a state of misery and despair lise i madam how by what means mme de croupillac ill tell you i lived you must know at angoulême and as a widow had the free disposal of my     person there at that very time was fierenfat a student a presidents apprentice you understand me he ogled me for a long time and took it into his head to be most villainously in love with me villainously i say most horrid and abominable for what did he make love to my money i got some people to write to the old gentleman who interested themselves too far in the affair and talked to him in my name he returned in answer that he would—consider it so you see the thing was settled lise o yes mme de croupillac for my part i had no objection his elder brother was at that time so i was informed engaged to you lise aside cruel remembrance mme de croupillac he was a foolish fellow my dear but had then the honor to be in your good graces lise sighing ah me mme de croupillac this silly fellow my dear as i was telling you being quite out at elbows kicked out of doors by his father and wandering about the wide world dead perhaps by this time you seem concerned my college hero my president knowing extremely well that your fortune was upon the whole much better than mine has thought fit to laugh at my disappointment     and go in quest of your superior—portion but do you think madam to run in this manner from brother to brother and engross a whole family to yourself i do here most solemnly enter my protest against it i forbid the banns ill venture my whole estate my dowry and everything in short the cause shall be so managed that you his father my children all of us shall be dead before ever it is put an end to lise i assure you madam with the utmost sincerity i am very sorry that my marriage should make you miserable i am sure however you have no reason to be angry with me but i find we may make others jealous without being happy ourselves look no longer madam i beseech you with an eye of envy upon my condition he is a husband i shall not quarrel with you for mme de croupillac not quarrel for him lise no ill give him up to you with all my heart mme de croupillac you have no taste then for his person you dont love him lise i see very few charms in matrimony and none at all in a lawsuit and so madam—     scene iv mme de croupillac lise rondon rondon so so daughter heres fine work protests declarations and lawsuits enough to make ones hair stand on end ouns shall rondon be talked to thus but ill ferret them out the impertinent rascals mme de croupillac must i suffer more indignities hear me m rondon rondon what would you have madam mme de croupillac your soninlaw sir is a false villain a coxcomb of a new species a gallant and a miser a widowhunter a fellow that loves nothing but money rondon hes in the right of it mme de croupillac in my own house has he a thousand times vowed eternal constancy to me rondon promises of that kind madam are very seldom kept mme de croupillac and then to leave me so basely   0 rondon i believe i should have done the same mme de croupillac but i shall talk to his father in a proper manner rondon id rather you would talk to him than to me mme de croupillac tis a wicked thing so it is and the whole sex will take my part and cry out shame upon him rondon they cant cry louder than yourself mme de croupillac ill make the world know how they should treat a baroness rondon ill tell you how laugh at her mme de croupillac a husband look ye i must have and i will take him or his old father or you rondon me mme de croupillac yes you rondon i defy you mme de croupillac well try it ill go to law with you rondon ridiculous     scene v rondon fierenfat lise rondon to lise pray madam whats the reason you receive such visitors in my house you are always bringing me into some scrape or other to fierenfat and you sir mr king of pedants what nonsensical demon inspired you with the thought of courting a baroness only to laugh at and abuse her a pretty scheme indeed with that flat face of yours to give yourself the airs of a flighty young coxcomb with that grave sorrowful countenance to play the gallant it might have become the rake your brother but for you—fie fie fierenfat my dear fatherinlaw dont be misled i never was desirous of this match i only promised her conditionally and always reserved to myself the right of taking a richer wife if i could get one the disinheriting my elder brother and coming into immediate possession of his fortune have given me pretensions to your daughter come come money makes the best matches rondon so it does my boy there youre in the right lise now that right i take to be quite wrong     rondon pshaw pshaw money does everything thats certain let us therefore settle the affair immediately sixty good sacks full of french crowns will set everything right in spite of all the croupillacs in the universe how this euphemon makes me wait im out of all patience but let us sign before he comes lise no sir there i enter my caveat i will only submit on certain conditions rondon conditions impertinence you pretend to say— lise i say sir what i think can we ever taste can we enjoy that guilty happiness which springs from anothers misery and you sir to fierenfat can you in your prosperity forget that you have a brother fierenfat a brother i never saw him in my life he was gone from home when i was at college hard at my cujatius and bartole ive heard indeed of his pranks since and if he ever comes back again we know what we have to do never fear that we shall send him off to the galleys lise a brotherly and a christian resolution in the meantime youll confiscate his estate that i suppose is your intention but i tell you sir i detest and abhor the project     rondon heigh heigh very fine but come my dear the contract is drawn and the lawyer has taken care of all that fierenfat our forefathers have determined concerning this matter consult the written law let me see in cujatius chapter the fifth sixth and seventh we read thus every debauched libertine that leaves his fathers house or pillages the same shall ipso facto be dispossessed of everything and disinherited as a bastard lise i know nothing about laws or precedents nor have ever read cujatius but will venture to pronounce that they are a set of vile unfeeling wretches foes to common sense and without humanity who say a brother should let a brother perish nature and honor have their rights to plead that are more powerful than cujatius and all your laws rondon come come lets have none of your codes and your honor and your nonsense but do as id have you whats all this fuss about an elder brother there should be money lise there should be virtue sir let him be punished but leave him at least something to subsist on the poor remains of an elder brothers right in a word sir i must tell you my hand shall never be purchased at the price of his ruin blot out therefore that article in the contract which i abhor and which     would be a disgrace to us all if lucrative views induced you to draw it up thus it is a shame and a dishonor to us and therefore i desire it may be expunged fierenfat how very little women know of business rondon what you want to correct two attorneysatlaw and make a contract void o lud o lud lise why not rondon youll never make a good housewife youll let everything go to rack and ruin lise at present sir i cannot boast my knowledge of the world or of economy but i will maintain it the love of money destroys more families than it supports and if ever i have a house of my own the foundation of it shall be laid on—justice rondon she is lightheaded but let us humor her a little come give him a little portion and the business will be over fierenfat ay ay well—i give to my brother—ay i give him—come along— rondon not a single farthing     scene vi euphemon rondon lise fierenfat rondon o here comes the old gentleman well i have brought my daughter to reason we want nothing now but your hand to the contract come come lets have no more delays cheer up put on your jovial countenance your wedding looks man for in nine months time ill lay my life two thumping boys—come come let us laugh and sing and cast away care sign my boy sign euphemon i cant sir fierenfat you cant rondon ay heres another now fierenfat for what reason pray rondon what is all this madness are all the world turned fools everybody says no why how is this whats the meaning of it euphemon to sign the contract at a time like this would be flying in the face of nature     rondon what is my lady croupillac at the bottom of all this euphemon no shes a fool and wants to break off the match for her own sake tis not from her ridiculous noise that my uneasiness arises i assure you rondon whence comes it then did that fellow out of the coach put it into your head are we indebted to him for all this euphemon what he told me must at least retard our happy marriage which we were so eager upon lise what did he tell you sir fierenfat ay sir what news did he bring euphemon news that shocked me at bordeaux this man saw my son naked friendless and in prison dying with hunger shame and sickness leading him to the grave sickness and misfortunes had blasted the flower of his youth and an obstinate fever that had poisoned his blood seemed to threaten that his last hour was not far off when he saw him he was then just expiring alas perhaps by this time he is no more rondon then his pensions paid     lise dead rondon dont be frightened child what is it to you fierenfat ha the blood hath forsaken her cheeks she looks pale as death rondon the jade has a little too much sensibility about her thats the truth of it but as hes dead i forgive thee fierenfat but after all sir do you mean— euphemon dont be afraid you shall have her it is my desire you should but to choose a day of mourning for a weddingday would be highly unbecoming how would my griefs interrupt your mirth how would your chaplets fade when wetted with a fathers tears no my son you must put off your happiness and give me one day to indulge my sorrow joy so illtimed as this would be an affront to decency lise no doubt it would for my part i had much rather share with you in your affliction than think of marriage fierenfat nay but my dear father— rondon why youre an old fool what put off a wedding that has been the lord knows how long upon     the anvil for an ungrateful young dog who has been a hundred times disinherited a p—x on you and your whole family euphemon at such a time a father must still be a father his errors his vices and his crimes always made me unhappy and it hurts me still more to think that he is dead without ever repenting of them rondon well well well make that matter easy ha boy let us give him some grandsons to make him amends come come sign and lets have a dance what nonsense this is euphemon but sir— rondon but—ouns this makes me mad to be sorry for the luckiest accident that could happen ridiculous sorrow is good for nothing at the best but to whimper and whine because you have got rid of a burden intolerable absurdity this eldest son this scourge of yours to my knowledge two or three times had like to have broken your heart sooner or later he would have brought you to the grave therefore prithee man take my advice and make yourself easy the loss of such a son is the greatest gain euphemon true my friend but it is a gain that costs me more than you think alas i lament that he died and i lament that ever he was born     rondon to fierenfat away follow the old gentleman and be as expeditious as you can the dead you see has got hold of the living so take the contract ill not be haggled with any longer take his hand and make him sign for you madam to lise we shall expect you tonight everything will go well i warrant you lise im in the utmost despair end of the second act act iii scene i euphemon the son jasmin jasmin i have served you sir now two years without knowing who or what you are you were then my master permit me now to call you my friend you are now like myself thrown upon the wide world and poverty has put us on a level you are no longer the man of pleasure the gallant and gay euphemon treated and caressed by the men surrounded and courted by the women every stiver you had is gone to the devil and you have nothing now to do but to forget you were ever worth a shilling for surely the most insupportable of all evils is the remembrance of happiness which we no longer enjoy for my part i was always plain jasmin and therefore the less to be pitied born as i was to suffer i suffer contentedly to be in want of everything is   0 only natural to me your old hat there for instance and coarse ragged waistcoat was my usual garb and you have great reason to be sorry that you had not always been as poor as myself euphemon how shame and ignominy attend upon misfortune how melancholy a consideration is it to reflect that a servant shall have it in his power to humble me and whats worse i feel that hes in the right too he endeavors to comfort me after his manner he keeps me company and his heart rough and unpolished as it is is sensible tender and humane born my equal—for as a fellowcreature so he was—he tried to support me under my affliction and follows my unhappy fortune while every friend i had abandons me jasmin friends did you say sir pray my good master who are they how are those people made whom they call friends euphemon you have seen them jasmin coming into my house whenever they pleased troubling me forever with their importunate visits a crowd of parasites who lived upon my bounty complimented my fine taste my elegance my delicacy borrowed my money then praised me before my face and stunned me with their ridiculous flattery jasmin ay poor devil you did not hear them laughing at you as they went away and making a joke of your foolish generosity     euphemon i believe it for in the beginning of my misfortunes when i was arrested at bordeaux not one of those on whom i had lavished my all ever came near me or offered me his purse and when i got out sick and friendless i applied to one of them in this poor ragged condition and almost famished for a little charitable assistance to lengthen out my wretched life he turned away his unrelenting eye pretended even to know nothing of me and turned me out like a common beggar jasmin not one to comfort or support you euphemon not one jasmin such wretches friends indeed euphemon men are made of iron jasmin and women too euphemon alas from them i expected more tenderness but met with even a thousand times greater inhumanity one of them in particular i well remember who openly avowed her passion for me and seemed to take a pride in obliging me and yet in the very lodgings which she had furnished at my expense and with the money i had squandered upon her did she procure every day new gallants and treat them with my wine while i was perishing with hunger in the street in short jasmin if it had not been for     the old man who picked me up by chance at bordeaux and who he said knew me when i was a child death had by this time put an end to my misfortunes but knowest thou jasmin whereabout we are jasmin near cognac if i am not mistaken where they tell me my old master rondon lives euphemon rondon the father of—whom did you say jasmin rondon a blunt odd fellow i had the honor of belonging to his kitchen once but being always of a roving disposition chose to travel and after that was an errand boy a lackey a clerk a footsoldier and a deserter at length in bordeaux you took me into your service rondon perhaps may recollect me who knows but in our adversity— euphemon how long is it since you left him jasmin about fifteen years he was a character half pleasant and half surly but at the bottom a good honest fellow he had a child i remember an only daughter a perfect jewel blue eyes short nose fresh

like it you seem surprised why are your eyes turned up in this manner as if you were going to be exorcised what is the meaning of those deep sighs that will not let you speak euphemon o jasmin i can no longer contain myself tenderness pain remorse all press upon me jasmin what has my lady there said anything to you what has she told you     euphemon she told me nothing jasmin whats the matter then euphemon my heart will no longer suffer me to conceal it from you in short that euphemon— jasmin well what of him euphemon o he is—my father jasmin your father sir euphemon yes jasmin i am that elder son that criminal that unfortunate who has ruined his unhappy family o how my heart fluttered at the sight of him and offered up its humble prayers o with what joy could i have fallen down at his feet jasmin thou euphemons son forgive me sir forgive my rude familiarity euphemon o jasmin thinkest thou a heart oppressed as mine is can be offended jasmin you are the son of a man whom all the world admires a man of a million to say the truth the reputation     of his son shows to no great advantage when placed near his fathers euphemon tis that which gives me most uneasiness but tell me what did my father say jasmin i told him sir we were two unfortunate youths very poor but well educated and would be glad to serve him he lamented our fate and consented to take us this evening he will introduce you to his son the president who it seems is to marry lise that fortunate brother to whom my old master rondon is to be fatherinlaw euphemon and now jasmin i will unfold my heart to you hear the history of my misfortunes and think how wretched i must be to draw upon myself by a variety of follies the just indignation of a beloved parent to be hated despised disinherited to feel all the horrors of beggary and want to see my fortune given to my younger brother and forced after all in my state of ignominy to serve the very man who has robbed me of everything this is my fate a fate i have but too well deserved but would you believe it jasmin in the midst of all my calamities dead as i am to pleasures and dead to every hope hated by the world despised by all and expecting nothing i yet dare to be—jealous jasmin jealous of whom euphemon of my brother of lise     jasmin so you are in love with your sister well thats a stroke worthy of you the only sin you had never yet committed euphemon you are to know jasmin—for i believe you had then left rondon—that we were no sooner out of our infancy than our parents promised us to each other our hearts readily obeyed and were united the conformity of our ages our taste our manners our situation everything conspired to strengthen the tie like two young trees we grew up together and were to have joined our branches time that heightened her charms improved her tenderness and love made her every day more lovely the world at that blest time might have envied me but i was young foolish and blind linked in with a set of wretches who seduced my innocence intoxicated with folly and extravagance i made a merit of despising her passion for me nay even affronted her o i reflect on it with horror the crowd of vices that rushed in upon me carried me away from my father and my friends what was my fate after this i need not inform you everything is gone and heaven which tore me from her has left me nothing but a heart to punish me jasmin if so it be and you really love her still notwithstanding all your distress mme de croupillacs advice was good to insinuate yourself if possible into rondons family your purse is empty and love perhaps may find means to fill it again     euphemon could i ever dare to look upon her to come in her sight after what i have done and in this miserable condition no i must avoid a father and a mistress i have abused the goodness of them both and know not—but it is too late to repent—which should hate me most scene vi young euphemon fierenfat jasmin jasmin o here comes our wise president euphemon is it he i never saw his face before my brother and my rival fierenfat come come this does not go amiss i have pressed and rated the old gentleman in such a manner that i believe we

please fierenfat the ambition of the coxcomb but come follow me be diligent sober prudent careful clever and respectful what ho la fleur la brie you rascals where are you all follow me he goes out

wisdom to be happy in love you must be bold resume your wonted courage euphemon o i have lost it all mme de croupillac how so man whats the matter euphemon i had courage enough when i was not in love but at present— jasmin there may be other reasons why he should be rather bashful this fierenfat you must know is our lord and master and has taken us both into his service mme de croupillac so much the better a lucky circumstance to be a domestic in your mistress family let me tell you is a singular happiness make your advantage of it jasmin yonders something pretty and coming this way too to take the air i suppose she seems to come out of rondons house  0  mme de croupillac tis she come my dear lover make haste nows your time pluck up your courage and speak to her what sighing and trembling and pretend to love her too o fie fie euphemon o if you knew the situation of my heart you would not wonder at my trembling and confusion jasmin seeing lise at a distance sweet creature how beautiful she looks euphemon tis she o heaven i die with love with remorse with jealousy and despair mme de croupillac adieu i will endeavor to return the obligation euphemon all i ask of you is if

in vain do i go in and out backwards and forwards endeavoring if possible to hide myself from myself in vain do i seek for solitude and examine my own heart alas the more i look into it the more am i convinced that happiness was never made for me if i do at any time enjoy a momentary comfort it is from that old ridiculous creature croupillac and the thought of her preventing this detested match but then all my apprehensions return when fierenfat and my father urge it upon me with repeated importunities they have gained over the good euphemon martha in troth the old man is too goodnatured and fierenfat governs him most tyrannically lise i pardon him hes fond of an only child his elder poor man gave him a great deal of uneasiness and now he relies entirely upon the other martha but after all madam notwithstanding everything that has been reported it is not clear that the other is yet dead lise alas if dead i must lament if living i must hate him cruel alternatives  0  martha the news of his danger however seemed to have a powerful effect upon you lise one might be sorry for his misfortunes without loving him you know martha but one may as well be dead as not be loved and so you are really to be married to his brother lise my dear child i am distracted at the thought of it you have long known my indifference for fierenfat it is now changed to horror and detestation marriage with him is a potion most dreadfully bitter which in my present desperate case i must swallow much against my will i assure you though my hand at the same time rejects it with horror and indignation jasmin pulling martha by the sleeve harkee fair lady will you give me leave to whisper a word or two in your ear martha to jasmin most willingly sir lise aside o cruel fate why didst thou prolong a life which an ungrateful guilty lover has made so truly miserable  0  martha to lise one of the presidents servants madam but just now hired to him he says he should be glad to speak to you lise let him wait martha to jasmin friend my lady desires you would wait a little lise always teasing me thus even when he is absent i can have no peace for him o dear how weary am i of this marriage already jasmin to martha my dear girl procure us this favor if you can martha coming back madam he says he must speak with you lise so i see i must go martha there is a person it seems who is very desirous of seeing you he must speak to you he says or die lise i find i must go in and hide myself  0  scene iii lise martha young euphemon leaning on jasmin euphemon i can neither walk nor speak my sight too fails me jasmin give me your hand well cross her as she comes euphemon o i feel a deadly coldness at my heart to lise will you permit— lise without looking at him what would you sir euphemon throwing himself on his knees what would i that death which i deserve lise what do i see o heaven martha amazing euphemon good god how changed euphemon changed indeed yes lise you are avenged of me well may you wonder for i am changed in everything no longer do you behold in me that madman that false wretch so feared and detested  0  here he who betrayed the cause of nature and of love young and thoughtless as i was i fell a prey to every passion and adopted every vice from my loose companions but o the worst of all my crimes which never can be blotted out never atoned for was my offending you but here i swear by thee and by that virtue which though i have forsaken i yet adore i have found my error vice though i admitted it was a stranger to this heart which is now no longer stained with those guilty blemishes that obscured its native lustre that pure that sacred passion which is still reserved for you hath refined it that tender passion and that alone brought me hither not to break off your new engagements or oppose your happiness that would ill become a poor abandoned wretch like me but since the misfortunes which i so well deserved have brought me even in the prime of life to the brink of the grave i could not help seeking you to be a witness of my last moments and happy thrice happy shall i be if he who was once destined to be your husband at length shall die and not be hated by you lise i am scarce myself can it be euphemon can it be you o heaven in what a condition too and what a time is this wretch as thou art what cruel injuries hast thou done to both of us euphemon i know it at sight of thee every folly i have been guilty of appears doubly inexcusable they were dreadful and you know they were that is some punishment but not so much as i deserve  0  lise and is it true unhappy man that thou hast at last repented of thy follies that your rebellious heart is at length subdued and misfortune hath pointed out to you the road of virtue euphemon alas what will it avail that my eyes are opened when it is too late in vain is that heart subdued in vain is my return to virtue since i have lost in you its best its only valuable reward lise yet answer me euphemon may i believe you have indeed gained this glorious victory consult your own breast and do not again deceive me can you yet be prudent and virtuous euphemon i am so for still my heart adores you lise and dost thou still love euphemon euphemon do i love by that i live that alone has supported me i have borne everything even infamy itself and a thousand times i would have put an end to my wretched life but that still i loved it because it belonged to you yes to you i owe my present sentiments my being and that new life which now dawns upon me to you i owe the return of my reason with love like mine would to heaven i may be able to preserve it o do not hide from me that charming face look at me see how changed i am see the cruel effect of care and sorrow the roses  0  of youth are withered by remorse and misery there was a time when euphemon would not thus have affrighted you do but look on me tis all i ask lise if i see the thinking the reformed the constant euphemon it is enough in my eyes he is but too amiable euphemon what says my lise gracious heaven she weeps lise to martha o support me my senses fail can i ever be the wife of euphemons brother turning to euphemon but tell me have you yet seen your father euphemon o i blush to appear before that good old man whom i have so dishonored hated as i am and banished from his presence i love and reverence but dare not look upon him lise what then is your design euphemon if heaven should graciously prolong my days if you must be my brothers happy lot i propose to change my name and profession serve as a soldier and seek for death in the field of honor perhaps success in arms may acquire me some glory and even you may hereafter shed a tear over the unhappy euphemon my honor at least will never  0  suffer by the employment rose and fabert set out as i shall do lise tis a noble resolution and the heart that was capable of making it must be above guilt and meanness sentiments like these affect me much more even than the tears you shed at my feet no euphemon if i am left at liberty to dispose of myself and can possibly avoid a hateful match proposed for me if it is in my power to determine your fate you shall not go so far to change your condition euphemon o heaven and does thy generous heart melt at my misfortunes lise they affect me most deeply but your repentance hath secured me euphemon and will those dear eyes that looked on me so long with indignation will they soften into love and tenderness o thou hast revived a flame in the breast of euphemon which his follies had almost extinguished fond as my brother is of riches though my father has given him all that inheritance which nature had designed for me he still must envy my happiness i am dear to you he alone and not euphemon is disinherited o i shall die with joy martha deuce on him here he comes lise be upon your guard euphemon keep in those struggling sighs and dissemble   0 euphemon why should i if you love me lise consider my relations consider your own father your brother saw us together saw you at my feet and all that we can now do is not to let him know who you are martha i cant help laughing to think what a passion his gravity will be in scene iv lise martha jasmin fierenfat at the farther end of the stage young euphemon turning his back to him fierenfat either some devil has impaired these eyes of mine or if i see clear i most certainly beheld—o yes—it is so—its all over with me coming forward towards euphemon o it is you sir is it traitor rascal forger euphemon enraged i i could— jasmin placing himself between

think of it fierenfat an affair of virtue o yes and kissing her hand too call you that virtue rascal slave euphemon o jasmin if i dared— fierenfat no this is a gallant indeed with a witness had he been a gentleman but a servant a beggar—if i was to sue him in a court of justice it would be only so much money flung away lise to euphemon be calm if you have any regard for me i beg you will

well fierenfat to lise you madam seem to be deaf to all this faithless woman with that air of innocence too to play me such a trick your inconstancy is a little premature on our very weddingday and just before we are married tis a wonderful mark of your chastity lise dont be in a passion sir nor lightly condemn innocence on bare appearances only fierenfat innocence indeed lise yes sir when you know my sentiments you will esteem me for them fierenfat you go an excellent way to gain esteem euphemon this is too much lise to euphemon what madness for heavens sake be calm restrain— euphemon no i will never suffer him to cast reproach on you     fierenfat do you know madam that you lose your jointure your estate your portion everything as soon as— euphemon in a passion and putting his hand on his sword do you know sir how to hold your tongue lise o forbear euphemon come come mr president lay aside your assuming airs be a little less fierce and haughty a little less of the judge if you please this lady has not yet the honor to be your wife nor is she even your mistress sir what right have you then to complain your claim is void you should have known how to please before you had a

fierenfat strangle her then by all means for the thing is fairly proved rondon something no doubt is wrong by my finding her here in that condition she hung down her head and could scarce speak to me

thousand fears about it i tremble for him and for my own   0 honor in love alone i have placed my hopes that will assist me— martha for my part im in a sad quandary about it and wish everything may not go wrong consider madam we have against us two old fathers and a president besides scolds and prudes innumerable if you knew what haughty airs they give themselves what a supercilious sneer and severe tone their proud virtue puts on upon this occasion with what insolent acrimony they have persecuted your innocence believe me madam their clamors with their affected zeal and most religious fury would raise your laughter perhaps even make you tremble jasmin i have travelled madam and seen noise and bustle enough but never before was i witness to such a hubbub the whole house is turned topsyturvy they are all knaves fools or madmen whispering lies against you and adding one untruth to another telling the story a hundred different ways the poor fiddles are sent back without receiving a farthing or a drop of drink six tables prepared for the wedding feast full of the finest delicacies overset in the confusion the people run backwards and forwards the footmen drink and laugh rondon swears and fierenfat is employed in writing the case out lise and what does the worthy father of euphemon do amidst all this bustle martha o madam in his dejected aspect we may read the sorrow of afflicted virtue he lifts up his eyes to     heaven and cannot bring himself to believe that you have stained the honor of your spotless youth with so black a crime he defends you to your friends by

regard to an object whose early years gave the fairest promise of all that is amiable who every day advanced in beauty merit and accomplishments if after all his easy and deluded youth gave way to inclination and sacrificed duty friendship everything to unbridled licentiousness— euphemon well madam lise if fatal experience should teach him what false happiness he had so long pursued should teach him that the vain objects of his search sprang but from error and were followed by remorse if at length ashamed of his follies his reason instructed by misfortune should again light up his virtues and give him a new heart if restored to his natural form he should become faithful just and honest would you sir could you then shut up that heart which once was open to receive him     euphemon what am i to conclude from this picture or what has it to do with our affair and the injury i have received from your conduct the wretch who was seen at your feet is a young man utterly unknown to everybody here the widow says indeed she remembers him six months at angouleme another tells me he is a hardy profligate with a head full of dark intrigues and every kind of debauchery a character which doubles my astonishment i shudder with horror at it lise o sir when i have told you all you will be much more astonished for heavens sake hear me then i know you have a noble and a generous heart that never was formed for cruelty let me then ask you was not your son euphemon once most dear to you euphemon he was i own to you he was and therefore it is that his ingratitude calls for a severer vengeance i have wept his misfortunes and his death but nature in the midst of all my anguish left my reason but the more sensible of my injuries and more resolved to punish them lise and could you punish him forever could you still be so unhappy so miserable as to hate him could you throw from you a repenting child an altered son whose change would bring back to you the image of yourself could you repulse this son were he now in tears at your feet     euphemon alas you have forgotten you should not thus open a wound that bleeds too fresh and inflict new torments on me my son

and repentance euphemon you see too well how deeply i am affected my son alive lise if he yet lives he lives to love and honor you euphemon to love and honor me impossible how can i ever know it from whom must i learn that lise from his own heart euphemon but do you think—     lise with regard to everything i have said concerning him you may depend on my veracity euphemon come you have kept me in

my friend turning to rondon must return thanks to heaven whose goodness hath done all for the best and henceforth   of youth misguided let us learn whateer   their follies threaten never to despair end of the fifth and last act         preface to mariamne i have printed this piece not without fear and trembling the number of performances which have met with applause on the stage and contempt in the closet give me but too much reason to apprehend the same fate with regard to my own two or three agreeable incidents together with the art and management of the actors might conciliate an audience in the representation but a very different degree of merit is necessary to make it shine in the full glare of publication little will avail the regular conduct of it and even perhaps as little the interesting nature of the subject every work that is written in verse though it may be unexceptionable in all other respects must of necessity disgust if every line is not full of strength and harmony if there is not an elegance running through the whole if the piece has not in short that inexpressible charm which nothing but true genius can bestow upon it that point of perfection which knowledge alone can never attain to and concerning which we have argued so poorly and to so little purpose since the death of m despréaux it is a great mistake to imagine that the versification of a dramatic performance is either the easiest or the least considerable part of it racine who of all men upon earth after virgil best knew the art of verse did not think it so he employed two whole years in writing his phædra pradon boasts of having composed his in less than three months as the transient success of a tragedy depends with     regard to the representation not on the style but on the incidents and the actors the two seemed at first to meet with an equal degree of applause but the publication soon determined the real and intrinsic merit of each of them pradon according to the usual practice of bad authors came out with an insolent preface accusing all those who had attacked his piece as unfair and partial critics a trouble which he might as well have spared himself for his tragedy puffed as it was by himself and his party soon sank into that contempt which it deserves and if it were not for the phædra of racine the world would not know at this day that pradon had ever written one but whence then arises the vast difference between these two performances the plot is nearly the same in both phædra dies theseus is absent in the two first acts he is supposed to be in the shades below with pirithous hippolytus his son wants to leave trezene and to fly from aricia with whom he is in love he declares his passion to aricia and listens to phædras with horror he dies the same kind of death and his governor relates the manner of it add to this also that the principal personages in both pieces as they are in the same circumstances say almost the same things but this is the very place which distinguishes the great man from the bad poet when racine and pradon have the same sentiments they differ most from each other for proof of this let us take the declaration of hippolytus to aricia racine makes him talk thus   i who so long defined the tyrants power   smiled at his chains and made a mock of love   myself on shore i saw weak mortals wrecked   and thought i safely might behold the storm         at distance rage which i could never feel   and must i sink beneath the common lot   i must this haughty soul at length is conquered   and hangs on thee for six long months despair   and shame have rent my soul whereer i go   the wound still rankles with myself long time   in vain i struggled reasoned wept in vain   when absent seek thee and when present shun   thy image haunts me in the sylvan shade   the daylights splendor and the evenings gloom   all bring the loved aricia to my eyes   all all unite to make this rebel thine   o i have lost myself the bow unbent   and useless arrows lay neglected by me   thy lessons neptune are no more remembered   the woods reecho to my sighs alone   responsive and my idle coursers now   forget the voice of their hippolytus now observe how this hippolytus expresses himself in pradon   long time too long alas with lips profane   laughing at love did i adore diana   a solitary savage long i lived   and chased the bears and lions in the forest   but now more pressing cares employ my time   for since i saw thee i have left off hunting   though once i took delight in it but now   i never go there but to think of you it is impossible to read and compare these two pieces without admiring one and laughing at the other and yet there is the same ground of thoughts and sentiments in both when we are to make the passions speak all men have pretty nearly the same ideas but the manner of expressing them distinguishes the man of wit from him who has none the man of genius from him who has nothing but     wit and the real poet from him who would be a poet if he could to arrive at racines perfection in writing a man must possess his genius and withal must polish and correct his works as he did how diffident then should i be born as i am with such indifferent talents and oppressed by continual disorders who have neither the gift of a fine imagination nor time to correct laboriously the faults of my performances i am sensible of and lament the imperfections of this piece as well with regard to the conduct as the diction of it i should have mended them a little if i could have put off this edition for a little longer but still i should have left a great many behind in every art there is a certain point beyond which we can never advance we are shut up within the limits of our talents we see perfection lying beyond us and only make impotent endeavors to attain to it i shall not make a formal and regular critique on this piece the reader will probably save me that trouble but it may be necessary to say something concerning a general objection to the choice of my subject as it is the nature of frenchmen to lay hold with rapidity on the ridicule of things in themselves the most serious it has been said that the subject of mariamne is nothing but an old amorous brutal husband whose wife being out of humor with him refuses him the return of conjugal duty to which it has been added that a family quarrel could never make a good tragedy i would only beg these critics to join with me in a few reflections on this strange kind of prejudice the plots of tragedies are genarally founded either on the interests of a whole nation or the private interests of the sovereign of the first kind are the iphigenia in aulis where all greece     met in full assembly demands the blood of the son of agamemnon the horatii where the three combatants are to decide the fate of rome and œdipus where the safety and prosperity of thebes depend on the discovery of the murderer of laius of the latter kind are britannicus phædra mithridates etc in these all the interest is confined to the hero of the piece and his family all turns upon such passions as the vulgar feel equally with princes the plot may be as proper for comedy as for tragedy for take away the names only and mithridates is no more than an old fellow in love with a young girl his two sons are in love with her at the same time and he makes use of a very low artifice to discover which of his sons the lady is fond of phædra is a stepmother who egged on by her confidante makes love to her soninlaw who is unfortunately preengaged nero is an impetuous young man who falls precipitately in love and immediately wants to be separated from his wife and hides himself behind the tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress these are all subjects which molière might treat as well as racine nay the whole plot of the miser is exactly the same as that of mithridates harpagon and the king of pontus are two old fellows in love each of them has a son for his rival both of them make use of the same artifice to discover the intrigue carried on between the son and the mistress and both pieces end in the marriage of the young men molière and racine met with equal success one made the world laugh amused and entertained them the other moved terrified and made us weep molière exposed the folly of an old miser in love racine painted the weakness of a great man and so   0 contrived as at the same time even to make that weakness respectable were we to order watteau and lebrun each of them to paint us a wedding one would give us the representation of a group of peasants in an arbor full of vulgar joy and jollity placed round a rustic table where drunkenness riot debauchery and immoderate laughter reigned without control the other would paint the marriage of peleus and thetis the feast of the gods with all their solemn and majestic celebration of it thus both of them would reach the highest degree of perfection in their art by means entirely different we may fairly apply every one of these examples to mariamne—the bad temper of a woman the love of an old husband the malicious tricks of a sisterinlaw are subjects in themselves inconsiderable and seem rather adapted to comedy but at the same time a king whom all the world has honored with the name of great passionately enamored with the finest woman in the universe the rage and fury of a monarch so famous for his virtues and his crimes his past cruelty and his present remorse that perpetual and rapid transition from love to hatred and from hatred to love the ambition of his sister the intrigues of his ministers the distressful situation of a princess whose virtue and beauty have been so often celebrated and talked of to this day who had seen her father and brother doomed to death by her husband and to complete her misfortunes saw herself beloved by the murderer of her family what a field is here what an opening for any genius but mine can we say this is a subject unfit for tragedy here we may indeed aver that according as things turn out they change their names     preface to orestes  a letter to her most serene highness the duchess of maine madam— you have seen that noble age which is at once the model and the reproach of the present and will be so of future generations and have yourself made a part of its glory by your taste and by your example those illustrious times when your ancestors the condés crowned with laurels cultivated the polite arts when a bossuet immortalized heroes and instructed kings when a fénelon the second of mankind in eloquence and the first in the art of making virtue amiable taught justice and humanity in the most charming manner when racine and boileau presided over the belleslettres lulli over music and lebrun over painting all these arts madam met together in your palace there i first had the happiness a circumstance which i shall never forget of hearing though i was then but a child that excellent scholar whose profound learning never obscured the brightness of his genius cultivating the fine understanding of the duke of bourgogne the duke of maine and yourself that happy labor in which he was so powerfully assisted by nature sometimes he would take up a sophocles or euripides before you and translate offhand one of their tragedies the admiration and enthusiasm that possessed his soul on reading those     noble performances inspired him with expressions that answered the manly and harmonious energy of the greek as nearly as it was possible to reach it in the prose of a language just emerging from barbarism and which polished as it now is by so many fine authors is still very deficient in point of force copiousness and precision it is impossible to convey through any modern language all the power of greek expressions they describe with one stroke what costs us a whole sentence a single word was sufficient for them to express a mountain covered with trees bending beneath the weight of their leaves or a god throwing his darts to a vast distance or the tops of rocks struck with repeated thunderbolts that language had not only the advantage of filling the imagination with a word but every word we know had its peculiar melody which charmed the ear while it displayed the finest pictures to the mind and for this reason all our translations from the greek poets are weak dry and poor it is imitating palaces of porphyry with bricks and pebbles m de malezieu notwithstanding by the efforts of a sudden enthusiasm and a vehement forcible manner of reciting seemed to make up for the poverty of our language and infuse into his declamation the very soul and spirit of the great athenians permit me madam to give you his thoughts with regard to this inventive ingenious and sensible people a people from whom the romans their conquerors learned everything and who a long time after the fall of both their empires had yet the power to raise modern europe from ignorance and barbarism he knew more of athens than many of our travellers in these days do of rome after they have seen it over and over that vast number of statues by     the greatest masters those pillars which adorned the public marketplaces those monuments of taste and grandeur that superb and immense theatre built in the finest situation between the town and the citadel where the works of sophocles and euripides were heard by pericles and socrates and the youth of athens attended not standing up or in perpetual riot and confusion as they do with us in a word everything which the athenians had done in every art and every branch of knowledge was ever present to the mind of m de malezieu he was far from falling in with the opinions of those ridiculously rigid critics and false politicians who blame the athenians for having been too sumptuous in their public entertainments and do not know that this very magnificence greatly enriched athens by attracting crowds of foreigners who came from all parts to admire and to receive lessons from them on eloquence and virtue this extensive and almost universal genius was engaged by you madam to translate the iphigenia in tauris of euripides a task which he executed with equal elegance strength and fidelity it was represented at an entertainment which he had the honor to present your highness an entertainment worthy of him who gave and of her who received it you i remember madam played the part of iphigenia for i was present at the representation and as at that time i had no acquaintance with the french stage it never entered into my head that gallantry could ever have been mingled with so tragical a subject i gave myself up to the manners and customs of greece perhaps the more easily because i was then acquainted with no other i admired the antique in all its noble simplicity it was this which first suggested to me the idea of writing     my tragedy of œdipe without ever having read corneilles i began as an essay of my abilities by translating that famous scene from sophocles of the double confidence of jocaste and œdipus i read it to some of my friends who frequented the theatre and to two or three actors they assured me it would never succeed on the french stage and advised me to read corneille who had carefully avoided that part of the plot and all agreed that if i did not follow his example by putting in a love intrigue the players would never undertake it i then read the œdipe of corneille which though it was not ranked with cinna and polyeucte had notwithstanding met with some applause i must confess their opinions ran directly counter to mine from the beginning of this affair to the end but i was forced to submit to example and the evil power of fashion in the midst of all the terror of this masterpiece of antiquity i brought in not absolutely a love intrigue but the remembrance of an extinguished passion  which appeared to the last degree absurd but i will not repeat here what i have already said on this subject your highness may remember that i had the honor of reading my œdipe to you the scene from sophocles was not condemned at that tribunal for you the cardinal de polignac m de malezieu and your whole court unanimously condemned me and with great reason for having so much as mentioned the word love in a work which sophocles finished so completely and so successfully without that unhappy foreign ornament and yet the very fault which     you blamed me for was the only thing that recommended my performance to the stage the players were with the greatest difficulty prevailed on to perform my œdipe which they imagined could never succeed the public however were entirely of your opinion every part of it that was written in the taste of sophocles was generally applauded and the love scenes condemned by the most judicious critics to say the truth madam while parricide and incest are destroying a family and a plague laying the whole country waste is it a season for love and gallantry there cannot perhaps be two more striking proofs of theatrical absurdity and the power of habit than corneille on one side making theseus cry out   quelque ravage affreux quétale ici la peste   labsence aux vrais amans est encor plus funeste  and on the other myself sixty years after him making old jocaste talk of her old love and all this only in compliance with a taste the most false and ridiculous that ever corrupted literature that a phædra whose character is perhaps the most truly theatrical that ever was exhibited and almost the only person whom antiquity has represented in love should express all the power and fury of that fatal passion that a roxana confined within the walls of an idle seraglio should abandon herself to love and jealousy that ariadne should complain to heaven and earth of cruelty and inconstancy that orosmanes should destroy a mistress     whom he adored all this is truly tragic love either raging or criminal or unhappy or attended with remorse draws such tears from us as we need not blush to shed but there is no medium love should either command as a tyrant or not appear at all he can never act an under part but that nero should hide himself behind the tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress and his rival that old mithridates should make use of a comedy trick to discover the secret of a young woman beloved by his two sons that maximus even in cinna a piece of so much real merit should act the part of a villain and discover so important a conspiracy only because he was weak enough to be in love with a woman whose passion for cinna he must have known and allege by way of reason that love excuses all—for the true lover knows no friends that old sertorius should fall in love with a strange spanish lady called viriate and be assassinated by his rival perpenna all this we will be bold enough to assert is little mean and puerile such ridiculous stuff would degrade us infinitely below the athenians if our great masters had not made amends for these faults which are merely national by those sublime beauties which are entirely the product of their own genius it is indeed astonishing to me that the great tragic poets of athens should dwell so much on those subjects where nature displays everything that is great and affecting an electra an iphigenia a mérope and alcmæon and that our illustrious moderns neglecting all these should treat of scarcely anything but love which is generally much more proper for comedy than tragedy sometimes indeed they have endeavored to enrich and adorn it by politics but that love which is not violent is always     cold and all political intrigues that do not rise to the height and fury of ambition are still more cold and insipid political reasonings and debates are very agreeable in polybius or machiavelli gallantry is very fit for tales or comedies but nothing like this is suitable to the grandeur and pathos of true tragedy a taste for gallantry in our tragedies was carried to such a ridiculous excess that a great princess whose high rank and fine understanding might in some measure excuse her believing that all the world would be of her opinion imagined that the parting of titus and berenice was an excellent subject for a tragedy she therefore put it into the hands of two of our best writers  neither of them had ever produced a performance wherein love had not played the principal or at least the second part but one of them had never touched the heart except in those scenes of the cid which he had taken from the spanish the other always tender and elegant endowed with every species of eloquence and above all master of that enchanting art which draws forth the most delicate sentiments from the least and most unpromising incidents one therefore made of titus and berenice as contemptible a piece as ever appeared on the stage the other found out the secret of interesting the spectator for five acts without any other foundation but these words i love you and i leave you it was indeed nothing more than a pastoral between an emperor a king and a queen and a pastoral withal infinitely less tragical than the     interesting scenes of pastor fido the success of this however persuaded the public and the poets that love and love alone was the soul of tragedy it was not till long after when he was further advanced in life that this great poet found out that he was capable of something superior to this when he was sorry he had enervated the drama by so many declarations of love and sentiments of jealousy and coquetry much worthier as i have already ventured to assert of menander than of sophocles and euripides then he wrote his masterpiece athalie but though he was undeceived himself the public was not they could not bring themselves to conceive that a woman a child and a priest could make an interesting tragedy a work that approached nearer to perfection than any which ever came from the hand of man remained for a long time in contempt and its illustrious author had to his last hour the mortification of seeing the age he lived in though greatly improved still so corrupted with bad taste as never to do justice to his noblest performance it is certain if this great man had lived and cultivated those talents which alone made his fortune and his fame and which therefore he should not have deserted he would have restored to the theatre its ancient purity and no more have degraded the great subjects of antiquity with love intrigue he had begun an iphigenia and there was not a word of gallantry in his whole plan he would never have made agamemnon orestes electra telephus or ajax in love but having unhappily quitted the stage before he had reformed it all those who followed him imitated and even added to his faults without copying any of his beauties the morality of quinaults operas was brought into almost every tragic scene sometimes it is an alcibiades who assures     us that in those tender moments he has always proved by experience that a mortal may taste of perfect happiness sometimes it is an amestris who tells us that the daughter of a great king burns with a secret flame without shame and without fear in another agnonis follows the steps of the fair crisis in every place the constant adorer of her divine charms the fierce arminius the defender of germany protests to us that he comes to read his fate in the eyes of ismenia and goes to the camp of varus to see if the fair eyes of his ismenia will show him their wonted tenderness in amasis which is only mérope crowded with a heap of romantic episodes the heroine who three days before at a country house had just got sight of a young stranger and fallen in love with him cries out with a great deal of regard to decency and decorum this is the same stranger alas he hath not concealed himself so much as he ought for my repose for the few moments when he chanced to strike my eyes i saw him and blushed my soul was deeply moved at him in athenais a prince of persia disguises himself in order to make his mistress a visit at the court of a roman emperor we fancy in short that we are reading the romances of mademoiselle scudéri who described the citizens of paris under the names of the heroes of antiquity to confirm and establish this horrid taste among us which renders us so ridiculous in the eyes of all sensible foreigners it unfortunately happened that m de longepierre a warm admirer of antiquity but not sufficiently acquainted with our stage and who besides was careless in his versification gave us his electra we must confess it was written in the taste of the ancients no cold illplaced intrigue   0 disfigured this subject full of terror the piece was simple and without any episode this procured for it and with great reason the patronage of so many persons of the first consideration who flattered themselves that this valuable simplicity which constituted the principal merit of the great geniuses of athens would be well received at paris where it had been so long neglected you madam with the late princess of conti were at the head of those sanguine friends but unhappily the faults of the french piece were so numerous in comparison with the beauties which he had borrowed from the greek that you yourself acknowledged at the representation that it was a statue of praxiteles disfigured by a modern artist you had resolution enough to give up a thing which was not in reality worthy of being supported well knowing that favor and protection thrown away on bad performances are as prejudicial to the advancement of wit and good sense as the unjust censure of real merit but the downfall of electra was a terrible stroke to the partisans of antiquity the critics availed themselves of the faults of the copy the better to decry the merit of the original and to complete the corruption of our taste we persuaded ourselves it was impossible to support without love and romance those subjects which the greeks had never debased by such episodes it was pretended that we might admire the greek tragedians in the reading but that it was impossible to imitate them without being condemned by our own age and nation strange contradiction for surely if the reading really pleased us how could the representation displease we should not i acknowledge endeavor to imitate what is weak and defective in the ancients it is most probable that their faults were very well known     to their contemporaries i am satisfied madam that the wits of athens condemned as well as you some of those repetitions and some declamations with which sophocles has loaded his electra they must have observed that he had not dived deep enough into the human heart i will moreover fairly confess that there are beauties peculiar not only to the greek language but to the climate to manners and times which it would be ridiculous to transplant hither i have not copied exactly therefore the electra of sophocles much more i knew would be necessary but i have taken as well as i could all the spirit and substance of it the feast celebrated by ægisthus and clytemnestra which they called the feast of agamemnon the arrival of orestes and pylades the urn which was supposed to contain the ashes of orestes the ring of agamemnon the character of electra and that of iphisa which is exactly the chrysothemis of sophocles and above all the remorse of clytemnestra these i have copied from the greek tragedy when the messenger who relates the fictitious story of the death of orestes says to clytemnestra i see madam you are deeply affected at his death she replies i am a mother and must therefore be unhappy a mother though injured cannot hate her own offspring she even endeavors to justify herself to electra with regard to the murder of agamemnon and laments her daughter euripides has carried clytemnestras repentance still further this madam was what gained the applause of the most judicious and sensible people upon earth and was approved by all good judges in our own nation no character in reality can be more natural than that of a woman criminal with regard to her husband yet softened by her children a woman whose proud     and fiery disposition is still open to pity and compassion who resumes the fierceness of her character on receiving too severe reproaches and at last sinks into submission and tears the seeds of this character were in sophocles and euripides and i have only unfolded them nothing but ignorance and its natural attendant presumption can assert that the ancients have nothing worthy of our imitation there is scarcely one real and essential beauty and perfection for the foundation of which at least we are not indebted to them i have taken particular care not to depart from that simplicity so strongly recommended by the greeks and so difficult to attain the true mark of genius and invention and the very essence of all theatrical merit a foreign character brought into œdipus or electra who should play a principal part and draw aside the attention of the audience would be a monster in the eyes of all those who have any knowledge of the ancients or of that nature which they have so finely painted art and genius consist in finding everything within the subject and never going out of it in search of additional ornaments but how are we to imitate that truly tragic pomp and magnificence which we find in the verses of sophocles that natural elegance and purity of diction without which the piece howsoever well conducted in other respects must after all be but a poor performance i have at least given my countrymen some idea of a tragedy without love without confidants and without episodes the few partisans of good taste acknowledge themselves obliged to me for it though the rest of the world withhold their approbation for a time but will come in at last when the rage of party is over the injustice of persecution at an end     and the clouds of ignorance dissipated you madam must preserve among us those glittering sparks of light which the ancients have transmitted to us we owe everything to them not an art was born among us everything was transplanted but the earth that bears these foreign fruits is worn out and our ancient barbarism by the help of false taste would break out again in spite of all our culture and improvement and the disciples of athens and rome become goths and vandals corrupted with the manners of the sybarites without the kind favor and protection of persons of your rank when nature has given them either genius or the love of genius they encourage this nation which is better able to imitate than to invent and which always looks up toward the great for those instructions and examples of which it perpetually stands in need all that i wish for madam is that some genius may be found to finish what i have but just sketched out to free the stage from that effeminacy and affectation into which it is now sunk to render it respectable to the gravest characters worthy of the few great masterpieces which we already have among us worthy in short the approbation of a mind like yours and all those who may hereafter endeavor to resemble you         preface to catiline this advertisement is prefixed in the first edition this tragedy differs in many respects from that which appeared at paris under the same title in      when it was transcribed from the representation by some vile copyists who most shamefully disfigured it the parts then omitted were filled up by other hands and over a hundred verses interpolated not written by the author of catiline from this imperfect copy was published a surreptitious edition full of errors from beginning to end which was followed by another in holland still more faulty the present edition was carefully inspected by the author himself who even altered several whole scenes in it it is certainly a most flagrant abuse which calls every day for redress that the works of authors should be printed in spite of themselves a bookseller is in a hurry to publish a bad edition of a work that falls into his hands and this very bookseller will afterward complain most bitterly when the author whom he has injured gives us the performance as it really is such is the miserable condition of modern literature preface two motives induced me to make choice of a subject for tragedy which seemed on the first view of it but ill adapted to the manners and customs of the french theatre i was willing to endeavor once more by a tragedy without any declarations of love     in it to put an end to the reproaches so often thrown out against us in the learned world of filling our stage with nothing but gallantry and intrigue and at the same time to make our young men who frequent the theatre better acquainted with cicero the amazing grandeur of rome in past times still commands the attention of all mankind and modern italy derives part of her glory from the discoveries she is every day making of the ruins of the ancient the house where cicero lived is shown to us with some degree of veneration his name is echoed by every tongue and his writings are in every hand those who are unable to inform us who presided at the courts of justice within these fifty years in their own country can tell you when cicero was at the head of rome the more light we have into the last period of the roman commonwealth the more do we admire this great man though it must be confessed that most of our too lately civilized nations have entertained very false and imperfect ideas concerning him his works indeed made a part of our education but we remained still ignorant of his true merit the author was superficially studied the consul almost utterly unknown the lights which we have since acquired let us into his real character and set him far above all those who ever were employed in the affairs of government or were distinguished by their eloquence cicero might perhaps have been anything and everything that he chose to be he gained a victory in the town of issus where alexander had conquered the persians it is very probable that if he had applied himself entirely to the art of war a profession which requires a good understanding and extraordinary industry he would have shone among the most illustrious commanders of his age     but as cæsar would have been but the second of orators cicero would have been but the second of generals he preferred to all other glory that of being the father of rome the mistress of the world and how extraordinary must have been the merit of a private gentleman of arpinum who could make his way through such a number of great men and attain without intrigue the most exalted place in the whole universe in spite of the envy and malice of so many patricians who at that time bore sway in rome what we have still more reason to be astonished at is that amidst a thousand cares and disquietudes and during a whole tempestuous life burdened as he was both by public and private affairs this wonderful man could yet find leisure to acquaint himself with all the various sects of religion in greece and shine forth one of the greatest philosophers as well as orators of his age are there many ministers magistrates or lawyers now in europe of any eminence who are able i will not say to explain the discoveries of newton or the ideas of leibnitz in the same manner as cicero illustrated the principles of zeno plato and epicurus but even to solve any difficult problem in philosophy cicero a circumstance which very few are acquainted with was withal one of the best poets of the age he lived in when poetry was yet in its infant state he even rivalled lucretius can anything be more beautiful than these verses yet remaining of his poem on marius which make us still regret the loss of that excellent performance   hic jovis altisoni subito pinnata satelles   arboris e trunco serpentis saucia morsu   ipsa feris subigit transfigens unguibus anguem         semianimum et varia graviter cervice micantem   quem se intorquentem lanians rostroque cruentans   jam satiata animos jam duros ulta dolores   abjicet efflantem et laceratum affligit in undas   seque obitu a solis nitidos convertit ad ortus i am thoroughly persuaded that our language is incapable of expressing the harmonious energy of greek and latin verses i will however venture to give a slight sketch from this little picture painted by the great man whom i have characterized in my rome preserved and whose catiline i have imitated in some parts of the tragedy   thus wounded by an earthborn serpent flies   the bird of jove and in his talons bears   his struggling foe the dying reptile wreaths   his tortured scales that glitter in the sun   till the fierce eagle drops his bleeding prey   soars to the skies and seeks his native heaven those who have the least spark of taste will perceive even in this imperfect copy the force of the original whence comes it then that cicero should pass for a bad poet simply because juvenal has thought fit to say so and imputed to him that ridiculous verse   o fortunatam natam me consule roman so ridiculous that the french poet who was desirous of pointing out the absurdity of it in a translation could not succeed in it   o rome fortunée sous mon consulat née does not express half the nonsense of the latin is it possible the author of those fine verses i just now quoted could ever write anything so ridiculous there are follies which a man of sense and genius     can never be guilty of but the real truth is that prejudice which will never allow two species of excellency to one man denied ciceros ability to make verses because he himself thought fit to renounce it some low buffoon who envied the reputation of this great man wrote that foolish verse and attributed it to the orator the philosopher the father of rome juvenal in the succeeding age adopted this popular error and handed it down to posterity in his satirical declamations i believe many a reputation both good and bad is established in the same manner these two verses for instance are imputed to malebranche   il fait en ce beau jour le plus beau tems du monde   pour aller a cheval sur la terre et sur londe to which it is added that he made them purposely to show that a philosopher could be a poet whenever he had a mind to what man with common sense could ever be persuaded that malebranche was capable of writing anything so absurd yet let a retailer of anecdotes or a literary compiler transmit this idle tale to posterity and in process of time it will gain credit and though malebranche was one of the greatest of men it will be said one day or other that this great man turned fool when he got out of his sphere cicero has been reproached for too much sensibility and too much dejection in adversity he imparts his wellgrounded complaints to his wife and friends and his frankness is imputed to cowardice but let who will blame him for pouring into the bosom of friendship that grief which he concealed from his persecutors i love him the more for it the virtuous soul alone is capable of feeling cicero fond as he was of glory had no ambition of appearing   0 to be what he was not we have seen men in our own times dying with grief at the loss of very trifling emoluments after a ridiculous pretence of not regretting them at all what is there then so mean or cowardly in acknowledging to a wife or friend that a man was unhappy at being banished from his country which he had served or at being persecuted by a set of ungrateful and perfidious villains surely we ought to shut our hearts against the tyrants who oppress us and open them to those we love cicero was free and ingenuous throughout his whole conduct he spoke of his afflictions without shame and of his thirst after true glory without disguise this character is natural at the same time that it is great shall we prefer to this the policy of cæsar who tells us in his commentaries that he offered peace to pompey and yet in his private letters vows that he never had any such intention cæsar was a great man but cicero was an honest man but his having been a good poet and philosopher an excellent governor or an able general his having had a feeling and a good heart are not points that concern our present purpose he saved rome in spite of the senate onehalf of which at least opposed him from motives of the most inveterate envy and malice even those whose oracle whose deliverer and avenger he was were among his worst foes he laid the foundation of his own ruin by the most signal service that man ever performed for his country to represent this is the principal design of the tragedy it is not so much the ferocious spirit of catiline as the generous and noble soul of cicero which i have there endeavored to describe it has always been asserted and the opinion gains     ground among us that cicero is one of those characters which should never be brought upon the stage the english who hazard everything without knowing what they hazard have given us a tragedy on the conspiracy of catiline wherein ben jonson has made no scruple of translating seven or eight pages of tullys oration he has even translated them into prose not imagining it possible to make cicero speak in verse the consuls prose to say the truth mingled with the verse of the other characters forms a contrast worthy of the barbarous age of ben jonson but to treat a subject so grave and withal so totally void of those passions which generally captivate the heart we must have to do with a serious and cultivated people worthy in some measure of having the manners of ancient rome exhibited before them i acknowledge at the same time that this subject is not well adapted to our stage we have much more taste decorum and knowledge of the theatre than the english but our manners for the most part are not so strong we are only pleased with the struggle of those passions which we ourselves experience those among us who are best acquainted with the works of cicero and the roman republic are not frequenters of a play house they do not in this respect follow the example of tully himself who we know was constantly there it is astonishing that they should pretend to more gravity than he they have only less taste for the fine arts or they are withheld by a ridiculous prejudice what progress soever those arts may have made in france those gentlemen of distinguished genius and abilities who have cultivated them among us have not yet imparted true taste to the whole nation we are not born so happy as the     greeks and romans but frequent the theatre more out of idleness than from any real regard to literature this tragedy seems rather to be made for the closet than the stage it met with applause indeed and even more than zaïre but it is not of such a species as to support itself on the stage like zaïre still it is written with more strength the single scene between cæsar and catiline was executed with more difficulty than half those pieces which are filled with nothing but love but to these the heart returns with pleasure whilst our admiration of the ancient romans is quickly exhausted in our times nobody enters into conspiracies but everybody is in love the representation of catiline requires withal a large company of actors and a magnificent apparatus the learned will not here meet with a faithful narrative of catilines conspiracy a tragedy they very well know is not a history but they will see a true picture of the manners of those times all that cicero catiline cato and cæsar do in this piece is not true but their genius and character are faithfully represented if we do not there discover the eloquence of cicero we shall at least find displayed all that courage and virtue which he showed in the hour of danger in catiline is described that contrast of fierceness and dissimulation which formed his real character cæsar is represented as growing into power factious and brave that cæsar who was born at once to be the glory and the scourge of rome i have not brought on the stage the deputies of the allobroges who were not the ambassadors of gaul but agents of a petty province of italy subject to the romans who only appeared in the low character of informers and were therefore not proper     persons to appear in company with cicero cæsar and cato if this performance should appear tolerably well written and to give us some idea of ancient rome it is all that the author pretends to and all the reward which he expects from it         preface to mérope jesuit tournemine dec         brumoy a letter from the jesuit tournemine to father brumoy on the tragedy of mérope rev father— the mérope which you desired to be returned last night i have sent you this morning at eight oclock i have taken time to read it with attention whatever success the fluctuating taste of paris may think proper to bestow on it i am satisfied that posterity will applaud it as one of our best performances and indeed as the model of true tragedy aristotle the legislator of the stage has allotted to mérope the first rank among the fine subjects for tragedy it is treated by euripides we know and in such a manner as we learn from aristotle that whenever his cresphontes was exhibited at athens that ingenious people who were accustomed to the finest dramatic performances were struck ravished and transported in the most extraordinary manner if the taste of paris should not correspond with that of athens we know which is to blame the cresphontes of euripides is lost m voltaire has restored it to us you my dear sir who have given us an euripides in french exactly as he appeared to admiring greece have acknowledged in the mérope of our illustrious friend the natural the simple and the pathetic of euripides m voltaire has preserved the simplicity of the subject has not only disencumbered it from superfluous episodes but from many unnecessary scenes also the danger of ægisthus alone fills the stage the interest increases     from scene to scene till we come to the catastrophe the surprise of which is managed and prepared with the greatest art we expect it indeed from the grandson of alcides everything passes upon the stage as it did in mycenæ the theatrical strokes are not forced and unnatural nor such as by their great degree of the marvellous shock all probability they arise entirely from the subject it is the historical event represented to us in the most lively manner it is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by that scene where narbas arrives at the very instant when mérope is going to sacrifice her son on a supposition that she is about to avenge him or by that scene where she has no other means of saving him from inevitable death than by revealing him to the tyrant the fifth act equals if not surpasses any of those few excellent last acts which our stage has to boast of everything passes without notwithstanding which the author has so artfully and judiciously contrived as to bring all the action before us the narration by ismenia is not one of those studied artificial pieces which are foreign to the subject where the poets wit is made to shine out of its place such as throw an air of coldness and insipidity over the whole fable this is nothing but action throughout the trouble and agitation visible in ismenia are expressive of the tumult she describes i say nothing of the versification which is more clear and beautiful than any i remember to have seen even in voltaire who is certainly an excellent poet all those in short who feel an honest indignation at the corruption and depravity of our present taste all who have at heart the reformation of our stage who wish that by a careful imitation of the greeks whom in many perfections of the drama we have surpassed we might     endeavor to obtain the true end and design of it by making the theatre what it might be made the school of virtue all those who think thus rationally and seriously must be pleased to see so great and celebrated a poet as voltaire employing his fine talents in such a tragedy as this without love in it he has not imprudently hazarded the success of so noble a design but in the place of love has substituted sentiments of virtue which are not less forcible as much prejudiced as we are in favor of tragedies founded on love intrigues it is nevertheless true—and we have often observed it—that those tragedies which have met with the greatest success were not indebted to their love scenes for it on the other hand all our good critics allow that romantic gallantry has disgraced and degraded our stage and some of our best writers also the great corneille was sensible of this he submitted not without reluctance to the reigning taste of the age not venturing to banish love entirely he went at least so far as to banish successful love he would not permit it to appear weak or mean but raised it even to heroism choosing rather to go beyond nature than to sink it into a too tender and contagious passion thus reverend father have i sent you that judgment of which your illustrious friend seemed desirous i wrote it in haste which is a proof of my regard but the paternal friendship which i have had for him even from his infancy has not so far prevailed as to blind me in his favor you will let him see what i have written i have the honor to be my dear friend my dear son the glory of your father as i ever must be sincerely yours dec         tournemine         preface to the prodigal it is pretty extraordinary that this comedy should never yet have made its appearance in print as it is now almost two years since it was first played and ran about thirty nights as the author of it was not known it has hitherto been attributed to several persons of the first character but it was indisputably written by m de voltaire though the style of the henriade and alzire are so extremely different from the style of this that we cannot easily conceive them to be the product of the same pen in his name we have here presented it to the public as the first comedy ever written in verses  consisting of five feet a novelty which may perhaps induce other authors to make use of this measure it will at least be productive of variety on the french   0 stage and whoever gives us new pleasures has always a right to a favorable reception if comedy should be an exact representation of manners this piece has sufficient merit to recommend it we see in the prodigal a mixture of the serious and pleasant the comic and the affecting thus the life of man itself is always checkered and sometimes even a single incident will produce all these contrasts nothing more common than a family wherein the father grumbles the daughter who is in love whimpers the son laughs at them both and the relatives take different parts as it happens to suit their inclinations we often make a joke of that in one room which we cry at in the next nay the same person has often laughed and cried at the same thing within a quarter of an hour a certain lady of fashion being one day at the bedside of her daughter who lay dangerously ill with all the family about her burst into a flood of tears and cried out o my god my god restore me my dear daughter and take all my other children a gentleman who had married one of her daughters came up to her immediately and taking her by the sleeve pray madam says he do you include your sonsinlaw the arch dryness with which he spoke those words had such an effect on the afflicted lady that she burst into a loud laugh and went out the company followed her and laughed too and the sick person as soon as she heard the cause of their mirth laughed more heartily than all the rest we dont mean to infer from this that every comedy should have some scenes of humor and drollery and others serious and affecting there are a great many good pieces where there is nothing but gayety others entirely serious others where they are mixed     and others where the tender and pathetic are carried so far as to produce tears neither of these different species should be excluded from the stage and if i was to be asked which is the best of them i should say that which was best executed it would perhaps be agreeable to the present taste for reasoning and not unsuitable to this occasion to examine here what kind of pleasantry that is which makes us laugh in a comedy the cause of laughter is one of those things easier felt than expressed the admirable molière regnard who is sometimes almost as admirable as molière and the authors of several excellent shorter pieces have contented themselves with raising this pleasing sensation without explaining to us the reasons of it or telling their secret i have observed with regard to the stage that violent peals of universal laughter seldom rise but from some mistake mercury taken for sofia menechmes for his brother crispin making his own will under the name of old master géronte valère talking to harpagon of the beauty of his daughter whilst harpagon imagines he is talking of the beauty of his strong box pourceaugnac when they feel his pulse and want to make him pass for a madam in a word mistakes of this kind are generally the only things that excite laughter harlequin seldom raises a smile except when he makes some blunder and this accounts for the propriety of the name of balourd usually given to him there are a great many other species of the comic and pleasantries that cause a different sort of entertainment but i never saw what we call laughing from the bottom of ones soul either on the stage or in company except in cases nearly resembling those which i just now mentioned     there are several ridiculous characters which please without causing that immoderate laughter of joy trissotin and vadius for example are of this kind the gamester and the grumbler likewise give us inexpressible pleasure but never cause any bursts of laughter there are besides other characters of ridicule that have in them a mixture of vice which we love to see well painted though they only give us a serious pleasure a bad man will never make us laugh because laughter always arises from a gayety of disposition absolutely incompatible with contempt and indignation it is true indeed we laugh at tartuffe but not at his hypocrisy it is at the mistake of the good old gentleman who takes him for a saint the hypocrisy once discovered we laugh no longer but feel very different impressions one might easily trace the spring of every other sentiment and show the cause of gayety curiosity interest emotion and tears it would be a proper employment for some of our dramatic authors to lay open these secret springs as they are the persons who put them in motion but they are too busy in moving the passions to find time for an examination into them they know that one sentiment is worth a hundred definitions and i am too much of their opinion to prefix a treatise of philosophy to a dramatic performance i shall content myself with only insisting a little on the necessity we are under of having something new if we had never brought anything into the tragic scene but the roman grandeur it would have grown at least very disgustful and if our heroes had breathed nothing but love and tenderness we should by this time have been heartily sick of them       o imitatores servum pecus the works which we have seen since the times of corneille molière racine quinault lulli and lebrun all seem to me to have something new and original which has saved them from contempt and oblivion once more therefore i repeat it every species is good but that which tires us we should never therefore say such a piece of music did not succeed such a picture was not agreeable such a play was damned because it was of a new kind but such or such a thing failed because it was really good for nothing         preface to nanine this trifle was exhibited in the summer of      at paris among a number of entertainments which each year constantly produces in that city in the still more numerous crowd of pamphlets with which the town is overrun there appeared at this time one extremely well worthy of notice an ingenious and learned dissertation by a member of the academy of rochelle on a question which seems for some years past to have divided the literary world namely whether we should write serious comedies the author declares vehemently against this new species of the drama to which i am afraid the little comedy of nanine belongs he condemns and with reason everything that carries with it the air of a city tragedy in reality what can be more ridiculous than a tragic plot carried on by low and vulgar characters it is demeaning the buskin and confounding tragedy and comedy by a kind of bastard species a monster that could only owe its birth to an incapacity of succeeding either in one or the other this judicious writer blames above all those romantic forced intrigues which are to draw tears from the spectators and which we call by way of ridicule the crying comedy but into what species of comedy should such intrigues be admitted would they not be looked upon as essential and unpardonable faults in any performance whatsoever he concludes by observing that if in a comedy pity may sometimes go so far as to melt into tears they should be shed by love alone     he cannot certainly mean by this the passion of love as it is represented in our best tragedies furious barbarous destructive attended with guilt and remorse but love gentle and tender which alone is fit for comedy this reflection naturally produces another which i shall submit to the judgment of the learned that among us tragedy has begun by appropriating to itself the language of comedy we may observe that love in many of those performances where terror and pity should be the chief springs is treated as it should be treated in comedy gallantry declarations of love coquetry archness and familiarity are all to be met with among the heroes and heroines of greece and rome with which our tragedies abound so that in effect the natural and tender love in our comedies is not stolen from the tragic muse it is not thalia who has committed a theft upon melpomene but on the other hand melpomene who for a long time has worn the buskins of thalia if we cast our eyes on the first tragedies that had such amazing success in the time of cardinal richelieu the sophonisba of mairet mariamne tyrannic love and alcyone we shall remark that love in every one of them talks in a style quite familiar and sometimes extremely low no less ridiculous than the pompous tone and emphasis of their heroism this is perhaps the reason why at that time we had not one tolerable comedy because the tragic scene had stole away all its rights and privileges it is even probable that this determined molière seldom to bestow upon his lovers any strong lively and interesting passion for one another tragedy he perceived had anticipated him in this particular     from the time when the sophonisba of mairet appeared which was our first regular tragedy we began to consider the declarations of love from our heroes and the artful and coquettish replies of our heroines together with strong pictures of love and gallantry as things essentially necessary to the tragic scene there are writings of those times still extant which quote the following verses spoken by massinissa after the battle of cirta not without great eulogiums on their extraordinary merit   by mutual flames i find my flame approved   and love the more the more i am beloved   sighs grow by sighs and wishes wishes form   as waves by waves are lashed into a storm   when two fond hearts indulgent hymen chains   alike should be their pleasures and their pains the custom of talking thus about love corrupted even some of our best writers even those whose manly and sublime geniuses were made to restore tragedy to its ancient splendor could not escape the contagion in some of our finest pieces we meet with an unhappy face that subdued the courage of a roman knight  the lover says to his mistress adieu thou too virtuous and too charming object  to which the heroine replies adieu thou too unhappy and too perfect lover  cleopatra tells us that a princess who loves her reputation if she owns her love is sure to be beloved  and that cæsar sighs and in a plaintive tone acknowledges     himself her captive even in the field of victory  adding that she alone must be cruel and make cæsar unhappy her confidante replies i would venture to swear that your charms boast a power which they will never make use of  in all those pieces of the same author which were written after his death of pompey we are sorry to find the passion of love always treated in this familiar manner but without taking the unnecessary trouble of producing more examples of these glaring absurdities let us only consider some of the best verses which the author of cinna has brought on the stage as maxims of gallantry there are certain secret ties and sympathetic feelings by whose soft affinity souls are linked together attached to and struck by each other by i know not what charm which it is impossible to account for would one ever conceive that these sentiments which are certainly highly comic come out of the mouth of a princess of parthia who goes to her lover to ask her mothers life in such a dreadful crisis who would talk of the sympathetic feelings by whose soft affinity souls are linked together would sophocles ever have produced such madrigals do not all these amorous sentiments belong to comedy only that great writer who has carried the harmony of verse to such a point of perfection he who made love speak a language at once so noble and so     pathetic has notwithstanding brought into his tragedies several scenes which boileau thought much more proper for the elevated style of terences comedies than suitable to the dignity of the great rival of euripides who is even sometimes superior to him one might quote more than a hundred verses in this taste not but that this familiar simplicity has its beauties and may serve by way of preparation for the pathetic but if these strokes of simplicity belong even to the tragic muse with still more reason do they suit high comedy this is the exact point where tragedy descends and comedy raises itself where the two arts meet as it were and touch each other here their several limits are confounded and if orestes and hermione are permitted to say o do not wish for the fate of pyrrhus i should hate you too much—you would love me still more o that you would look on me in another manner you wish to love me and yet i cannot please you you would love me madam by wishing me to hate—for in short he hates you his heart is otherwise engaged he has no longer— who told you my lord that he despises me do you think the sight of me inspires contempt if these heroes i say express themselves in this familiar manner with how much greater reason should we admire the misanthrope speaking thus with vehemence to his mistress rather blush you for so you ought i have too sure testimony of your falsehood—it was not in vain that my love was alarmed but think not i will tamely bear the injury without being revenged—tis a treason a perfidy which cannot be too severely punished yes i will give a loose to my resentment i am no longer master of myself passion entirely possesses   0 me mortally wounded as i am by you my senses are no longer under the government of reason certainly if all the misanthrope was in this taste it would no longer be a comedy and if orestes and hermione talked throughout in the manner they do in the lines above quoted it would be no tragedy but after these two very different species met thus together they fall back each into their proper sphere one resumes the pleasant style and the other the sublime comedy therefore i repeat once more may be impassioned may be in transport or in tears provided at the same time that it makes the good and virtuous smile but if it was entirely destitute of the vis comica if from beginning to end it had nothing in it but the serious and melancholy it would then be a species of writing very faulty and very disagreeable it must be acknowledged that there is no small difficulty in making the spectators pass insensibly from tears to laughter and yet this transition hard as it is to manage in a comedy is not the less natural we have already remarked in another place that nothing is more common than accidents that afflict the mind some certain circumstances of which may notwithstanding excite at least a momentary mirth and gayety thus unhappily for us is human nature framed homer represents even his gods laughing at vulcans awkwardness while they are deciding the fate of the whole universe hector smiles at the fears of his son astyanax while andromache is shedding tears we often see that even amid the horror of battles conflagrations and all the disasters that mortals are subject to a good thing luckily hit off will raise a laugh even in the bosom of terror and pity in the battle of spires a regiment was     forbidden to give quarter a german officer begged his life of one of ours who answered him thus sir ask anything in the world else but as to your life i cant possibly grant it this dry and whimsical answer passed from one to another and everybody laughed in the midst of slaughter and destruction why therefore should not laughter follow the most serious and affecting scenes in a comedy dont we sympathize with alcmenes distress and yet laugh with sofia how ridiculous it is to dispute against experience if those who still contest this matter love rhyme better than reason let them take the following verses   oer this strange world still reigns the tyrant love   and all by turns his powerful influence prove   sometimes a mighty empire he oerthrows   now soars in lofty verse now creeps in prose   sometimes in tragic garb his passion mourns   sometimes the humbler

 preface to socrates the original footnote shows that voltaire wrote this as mr fatima for some unknown reason or as a mere whim it has been said by one author and repeated by another that the simple representation of a merely virtuous man without passion or intrigue cannot possibly meet with applause on the stage which i look upon as an injurious reflection on human nature and the falsehood of it is sufficiently proved by this performance written by the late mr thomson the famous mr addison was a long time in doubt as to whether he should make socrates or cato the subject of his tragedy he thought cato a virtuous man and as such a proper object of imitation but that socrates was much superior to him the virtue of the latter he observed had more softness and humanity in it and was withal more resigned to the will of god than that of the former the grecian he used to say did not like the roman imagine that he was at liberty to destroy himself or to quit the post which god had allotted to him addison in short considered cato as the victim of liberty     and socrates as the martyr of wisdom sir richard steele however persuaded him that cato was a subject better adapted to the theatre than the other and at the same time likely to prove more agreeable to the nation while it was in a political ferment to say the truth the death of socrates would perhaps have made very little impression in a country where no man is ever persecuted on account of his religion where a general toleration has so prodigiously enriched and peopled the community as it has also in holland my native country sir richard steele says expressly in his tatler that the subject of a dramatic piece should always be the reigning vice or foible of the nation where it is represented the success which addison met with in his cato encouraged him to sketch out the death of socrates in three acts the place of secretary of state which he had some time after prevented his finishing this work he gave the manuscript to his pupil mr thomson who was afraid to hazard on the stage a subject so extremely grave and at the same time void of all those fashionable embellishments which had then taken possession of the english theatre he began therefore with some other tragedies sophonisba coriolanus  tancred etc and finished with the death of socrates which he wrote in prose scene by scene and showed to his illustrious friends mr doddington and mr lyttleton persons deservedly ranked among the first geniuses in england these two gentlemen whom he always consulted advised him to follow the example of shakespeare to introduce the whole body of the people into his tragedy to print xantippe the     wife of socrates just as she really was a peevish crossgrained city madam scolding her husband and yet fond of him to bring the areopagus on the stage and in a word to make the whole piece a simple representation of human life one of those pictures that exhibit a view of every state and condition this is an undertaking attended with some difficulty and though the sublime continued throughout is a species of writing infinitely superior to it this mixture of the pathetic and familiar has its degree of merit one may compare them to the iliad and the odyssey mr lyttleton would not suffer the piece to be played because the character of melitus too closely resembled that of sergeant catbrée to whom he was related besides that the whole was rather a sketch than a finished performance he made me a present of this drama when he last came to holland i translated it immediately into dutch my mother tongue i did not however think proper to bring it on the stage at amsterdam though thank god among all our pedants we have not one there so hateful or so impertinent as sergeant catbrée the great number of actors which this play requires deterred me from any thoughts of exhibiting it i translated it afterward into french and shall let this translation pass till i have an opportunity of publishing the original amsterdam      since this the death of socrates has been represented at london but that was not the play written by mr thomson n b there have been some people ridiculous enough to endeavor to refute the palpable truths advanced in this preface pretending that mr fatima could not have written it in      because he died in      if it was really so what a foolish reason the fact is he died in              note on mahomet by the first editor the literary world will perhaps think themselves obliged to me for publishing the tragedy of mahomet which had been barbarously mangled in two surreptitious editions i can venture to assure the reader that it was written in      and a copy of it then sent by the author to the prince royal now king of prussia who at that time cultivated the belleslettres with astonishing success and continues to make them his principal amusement i was at lille in      where m de voltaire came to pass a few days there was then the best company of actors in the town that had even been in provence who presented this piece to the satisfaction of a very numerous audience the governor and the intendant were several times present at the performance a tragedy written in so new a taste and on so delicate a subject treated with such judgment and discretion induced many prelates to have it acted in a private house by the same persons their opinion confirmed that of the public the author was at the same time so happy as to get his manuscript presented to one of the first men in the church and indeed in all europe  who supported the weight of public affairs with firmness and judged concerning works of genius with true taste at an age when few men have and still fewer preserve their wit and delicacy he decided that the piece was written     with all proper decorum and circumspection and that it was impossible to handle with more prudence so dangerous a subject but that with regard to the poetry there were many things in it that wanted correction these the author to my knowledge afterward retouched with the greatest care this was also the opinion of another eminent personage of equal rank and of equal abilities at length this excellent performance which had been licenced according to form in many other places was exhibited at paris on august        a whole box was filled with the principal magistrates of the city the ministers were also present and all were of the same opinion as the excellent judges above mentioned there were however some persons at the first representation who disapproved of it whether it was that in the hurry of the action they did not sufficiently attend to the gradual process of it or that they were little versed in stage matters  they seemed shocked at mahomets ordering a man to commit murder and making use of his religion to stir up an innocent youth the instrument of his crimes to an assassination these gentlemen struck with the horror of the action did not sufficiently consider that this murder is represented in the tragedy as the most atrocious of all crimes and that indeed it was morally impossible it should be otherwise the truth was they saw indeed but one side the usual method which men take to deceive themselves and as they considered that side     only it was no wonder they should take offence which a little more attention would easily have removed but in the first heat of their zeal they cried out that it was a dangerous performance and fit only to produce ravaillacs and jacques cléments a most extraordinary piece of criticism which these gentlemen no doubt are by this time heartily ashamed of this would in effect be to affirm that hermione teaches us to assassinate kings electra to kill our mothers cleopatra and medea to slay our own children that harpagon makes misers the gamester gamesters and tartuffe hypocrites the censure of mahomet would carry with it even more injustice than this because the iniquity of that false prophet is represented in a light more odious and detestable than any of the vices or follies satirized in those performances the tragedy was written directly in opposition to the ravaillacs and jacques cléments insomuch that as a person of excellent judgment lately observed if mahomet had been written in the time of henry iii and henry iv it might have saved both their lives would one think it possible that the author of la henriade would ever have met with such a reproach he who has so often in that poem and in other parts of his works lifted up his voice not only against such crimes but against all those pernicious maxims which are the causes of them the more i read that writers works the more have i always found the love of public good their distinguishing characteristic every part of them inspires horror and detestation of rebellion persecution and fanaticism is there a good and worthy citizen who would not adopt all the maxims of la henriade does not that poem inspire us with the love of virtue mahomet appears to me to be written in the same   0 spirit and this i am persuaded the authors greatest enemies will frankly acknowledge he soon perceived that a formidable party was raised against him some of the most violent among them got the ear of a few great men who not having seen the piece themselves believed everything that these gentlemen thought proper to report concerning it the celebrated molière the glory of france was once in nearly the same condition when his tartuffe was first exhibited he had immediate recourse to louis the great who knew and loved him the authority of that monarch soon put an end to the sinister and malevolent misrepresentations of tartuffe but times are changed that protection which is given to arts in their infant state cannot be expected to continue after those arts have been cultivated for a length of time besides one man may not have interest to obtain that which another has procured with ease hence some instruments must be set to work some discussions made some new examinations passed through before anything can be done in his favor the author therefore thought it most advisable to withdraw his piece after the third representation in hopes that time would get the better of prejudice which must inevitably happen among a people so sensible and judicious as our own  it was stated in the public papers that the tragedy of mahomet had been stopped by order of the government which was an absolute falsehood no such order was ever given     and the first men in the kingdom who had seen this tragedy unanimously concurred in their admiration of it some persons having hastily transcribed a few scenes from the actors parts two or three imperfect editions crept into the world it is easy to see how much they differ from the true work which i have here given prefixed to this tragedy are several interesting pieces one of the most curious among them in my opinion is a letter written by the author to his majesty the king of prussia on his return through holland after a visit to him in papers of this kind which were not originally designed for the public one sees the real sentiments of men i flatter myself they will afford the same pleasure to every true philosopher which they gave me in the perusal         preface to julius cæsar signor algarotti signor franchini a letter from signor algarotti to signor franchini envoy at florence on the tragedy of julius cæsar by m de voltaire sir i have deferred sending you the julius cæsar which you desired till now that i might have the pleasure of communicating to you the tragedy on that subject as written by m de voltaire the edition of it printed at paris some months ago is extremely faulty one may easily perceive in it the hand of some of those gentlemen whom petronius calls doctores umbratici it is even so shamefully defective as to give us verses that have not the proper number of syllables this piece notwithstanding has been as severely criticized as if m de voltaire himself had published it would it not be cruelly unjust to impute to titian the bad coloring of one of his pictures that had been daubed over by a modern painter i have been fortunate enough to procure a manuscript fit to be sent to you you will see the picture exactly as it came out of the hand of the master i will even venture to accompany it with the remarks which you desired of me not to know that there is a french language and a french theatre cannot show a greater degree of ignorance than not to know to what perfection corneille and racine carried the drama it seemed indeed as if after these great men nothing remained to be wished for and that all which could be     done was to endeavor to imitate them could one expect anything in painting after the galatæa of raphael and yet the famous head of michelangelo in the little farnese gave us an idea of a species more fierce and terrible to which this art might be raised in the fine arts we do not perceive the void till after it is filled up most of the tragedies of the great masters i just now mentioned whether the scene lies at rome athens or constantinople contain nothing more than a marriage concerted or broken off we can expect nothing better in this species of tragedy wherein love makes peace or war with a smile i cannot help thinking that the drama is capable of something infinitely superior to this julius cæsar is to be a proof of it the author of the tender zaïre breathes nothing here but sentiments of ambition liberty and revenge tragedy should be an imitation of great men it is that which distinguishes it from comedy but if the actions which it represents are likewise great the distinction is still better marked out and by these means we may arrive at a nobler species do we not admire mark antony more at philippi than at actium i am apprehensive notwithstanding that reasonings of this kind will meet with the strongest opposition we must have very little acquaintance with human nature not to know that prejudice generally gets the better of reason and above all those prejudices that are authorized by a sex that imposes laws upon us which we always submit to with pleasure love has been too long in possession of the french theatre to suffer any other passions to supplant it which inclines me to think that julius cæsar will meet with the fate of themistocles alcibiades and     many other great men of athens that of being admired by all mankind while ostracism banished them from their own country in some places m de voltaire has imitated shakespeare an english poet who united in the same piece the most childish absurdities and the finest strokes of the true sublime he has made the same use of him as virgil did of ennius and taken from him the last two scenes which are doubtless the finest models of eloquence which the stage ever produced   quum flueret lutulentus erat quod tollere velles what is it but the remains of barbarism in europe to endeavor to make those bounds which power and policy have prescribed to separate states and kingdoms the limits also of science and the fine arts whose progress might be so widely extended by that commerce and mutual light which they would throw on each other a reflection which may be more serviceable to the french nation than any other as it is exactly in the case of an author from whom the public expect more in proportion to what they have already received from him france is so highly polished and cultivated that we have a right to demand of her not only that she should approve but that she should adopt and enrich herself with everything that is excellent among her neighbors   tros rutulusve fuat nullo discrimine habeto there is one objection to this tragedy which i should not have mentioned to you but that i heard it made by many that it has but three acts this say the critics is against all the rules of the stage     which require that there should be exactly five it is certainly one of the first rules of the drama that the representation should not take up more time than the real action they have therefore very rationally limited that time to three hours because a longer would weary the attention and at the same time would prevent our uniting in the same point of view the different circumstances of the action upon this principle we have divided the play into five acts for the convenience of the spectators and of the author also who has leisure to bring about during these intervals any incident necessary to the plot or catastrophe the whole of the objection then is no more than that the presentation of julius cæsar lasts but two hours instead of three and if that is no fault neither can the division of its acts be esteemed as one because the same rule which requires that an action of three hours should be divided into five acts will require also that an action of two hours should be divided into three only there is no reason why because the utmost extent of the play is limited to three hours we should not make it less nor can i see why a tragedy where the three unities are observed which is interesting and excites terror and compassion which in short does everything in two hours that others do in three should not be equally good a statue wherein the fine proportions and other rules of the art are observed is not a less fine statue because it is smaller than another made by the same rules nobody i believe thinks the venus de medici less perfect in its kind than the gladiator because it is but four feet high and the gladiator six m de voltaire perhaps gave his cæsar less extent than is usually allowed to dramatic performances only to sound the opinion and taste of the public     by an essay if we may give that name to so finished a piece it would have made a kind of revolution in the french theatre and had been perhaps too bold a venture to talk of liberty and politics for three hours together to a nation that had been so long accustomed to see mithridates fighting and whining when he was just on the point of marching to the capitol we are surely obliged to m de voltaire for his conduct and should by no means condemn him for not bringing love or women into his play born as they are to inspire soft and tender sentiments they would have played an absurd and ridiculous part between brutus and cassius atroces animæ they make indeed such conspicuous figures elsewhere that they have no reason to complain of being excluded from cæsar i shall pass over the many detached beauties to be met with in this piece the strength of its numbers and the variety of images and sentiments scattered throughout what might we not expect from the author of brutus and la henriade the scene of the conspiracy is one of the finest we have ever seen on any stage it has called into action that which we never met with before but in dull narration   segnius irritant animos demissa per aures   quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus et quae   ipse sibi tradit spectator even the death of cæsar passes almost in sight of the spectators and thus prevents a recital of it which howsoever beautiful must have been comparatively cold and languid events of this kind together with every circumstance attending them being already known to all the world i cannot sufficiently admire this tragedy when i     consider what a variety of incidents there are in it how great the characters are and how finely supported what a noble contrast between brutus and cæsar what makes this subject most difficult to handle is the great art required to describe on the one hand brutus with a savage ferocious virtue and even bordering on ingratitude but at the same time engaged in a righteous cause at least to all appearances and conformable to the times he lived in and on the other hand cæsar full of clemency and the most amiable virtues heaping favors on his enemies and yet endeavoring to destroy the liberty of his country we are strongly interested for both of them during the whole action of the piece though it should seem as if the passions must hurt and destroy each other reciprocally in the end like two several weights equal and opposed to each other and consequently could produce no effect but that of sending the spectators back disgusted and without any emotion some such reflections most probably induced a brother poet  to declare that he looked upon this subject as the rock of dramatic authors and that he would gladly propose it to any of his rivals but m de voltaire not content with these difficulties seems desirous of creating more by making brutus the son of cæsar which however is founded on history he has even by these means found an opportunity of introducing some charming scenes and throwing into his piece a new interest which is united to the action and brings on the catastrophe the harangue of antony produces a     fine effect and is in my opinion a model of seducing eloquence upon the whole we may with truth assert that m de voltaire in this tragedy has opened a new path and at the same time trod in it with the highest success i  ii voltaire the lisbon earthquake and other poems vol x—part ii iii vi vii viii   authors preface to the lisbon earthquake if the question concerning physical evil ever deserves the attention of men it is in those melancholy events which put us in mind of the weakness of our nature such as plagues which carry off a fourth of the inhabitants of the known world the earthquake which swallowed up four hundred thousand of the chinese in      that of lima and callao and in the last place that of portugal and the kingdom of fez the maxim whatever is is right appears somewhat extraordinary to those who have been eyewitnesses of such calamities all things are doubtless arranged and set in order by providence but it has long been too evident that its superintending power has not disposed them in such a manner as to promote our temporal happiness when the celebrated pope published his essay on man and expounded in immortal verse the systems of leibnitz lord shaftesbury and lord bolingbroke his system was attacked by a multitude of divines of a variety of different communions they were shocked at the novelty of the propositions whatever is is right and that man always enjoys that measure of happiness which is suited to his being there are few writings that may not be condemned if considered in one light or approved of if considered in another it would be much more reasonable to attend only to the beauties and improving parts of a work than to endeavor to put an odious construction on it but it is one of the imperfections of our nature to put a bad interpretation on whatever has a dubious sense and to run down whatever has been successful in a word it was the opinion of many that the axiom whatever is is right was subversive of all our received ideas if it be true said they that whatever is is right it follows that human nature is not degenerated if the general order requires that everything should be as it is human nature has not been corrupted and consequently could have had no occasion for a redeemer if this world such as it is be the best of systems possible we have no room to hope for a happy future state if the various evils   by which man is overwhelmed end in general good all civilized nations have been wrong in endeavoring to trace out the origin of moral and physical evil if a man devoured by wild beasts causes the wellbeing of those beasts and contributes to promote the orders of the universe if the misfortunes of individuals are only the consequence of this general and necessary order we are nothing more than wheels which serve to keep the great machine in motion we are not more precious in the eyes of god than the animals by whom we are devoured these are the inferences which were drawn from mr popes poem and these very conclusions increased the sale and success of the work but it should have been seen from another point of view readers should have considered the reverence for the deity the resignation to his supreme will the useful morality and the spirit of toleration which breathe through this excellent poem this the public has done and the work being translated by men equal to the task has completely triumphed over critics though it turned on matters of so delicate a nature it is the nature of over violent censurers to give importance to the opinions which they attack a book is railed at on account of its success and a thousand errors are imputed to it what is the consequence of this men disgusted with these invectives take for truths the very errors which these critics think they have discovered cavillers raise phantoms on purpose to combat them and indignant readers embrace these very phantoms critics have declared that pope and leibnitz maintain the doctrine of fatality the partisans of leibnitz and pope have said on the other hand that if leibnitz and pope have taught the doctrine of fatality they were in the right and all this invincible fatality we should believe pope had advanced that whatever is is right in a sense that might very well be admitted and his followers maintain the same proposition in a sense that may very well be contested the author of the poem the lisbon earthquake does not write against the illustrious pope whom he always loved and admired he agrees with him in almost every particular but compassionating the misery of man he declares against the abuse of the new maxim whatever is is right he maintains that ancient and sad truth acknowledged by all men that there is evil upon earth he acknowledges that the words whatever is is right if understood in a positive sense and without any hopes of a happy future state only insult us in our present misery if when lisbon moquinxa tetuan and other cities were swallowed up with a great number of their inhabitants in   the month of november      philosophers had cried out to the wretches who with difficulty escaped from the ruins all this is productive of general good the heirs of those who have perished will increase their fortune masons will earn money by rebuilding the houses beasts will feed on the carcasses buried under the ruins it is the necessary effect of necessary causes your particular misfortune is nothing it contributes to universal good such a harangue would doubtless have been as cruel as the earthquake was fatal and all that the author of the poem upon the destruction of lisbon has said amounts only to this he acknowledges with all mankind that there is evil as well as good on the earth he owns that no philosopher has ever been able to explain the nature of moral and physical evil he asserts that bayle the greatest master of the art of reasoning that ever wrote has only taught to doubt and that he combats himself he owns that mans understanding is as weak as his life is miserable he lays a concise abstract of the several different systems before his readers he says that revelation alone can untie the great knot which philosophers have only rendered more puzzling and that nothing but the hope of our existence being continued in a future state can console us under our present misfortunes that the goodness of providence is the only asylum in which man can take refuge in the darkness of reason and in the calamities to which his weak and frail nature is exposed p s—readers should always distinguish between the objections which an author proposes to himself and his answers to those objections and should not mistake what he refutes for what he adopts   the lisbon earthquake an inquiry into the maxim whatever is is right   oh wretched man earthfated to be cursed   abyss of plagues and

mans sole bliss below    preface to the poem on the law of nature it is generally known that this poem was not intended for the public it long remained a secret between a great king and the author about three months ago a few copies were handed about in paris and soon after several impressions of it were published as incorrect as those of other works by the same hand it would be no more than justice to be more indulgent to a work forced out of the obscurity to which the author had condemned it than to a work offered by the writer himself to the inspection of the public it would also be agreeable to equity not to pass the same judgment on a poem composed by a layman as on a theological thesis these two poems are the fruits of a transplanted tree some of these fruits may perhaps not be to the taste of certain persons they come from a foreign climate but none of them are poisoned and many of them may prove highly salutary this work should be considered as a letter in which the author freely discloses his sentiments most books resemble those formal and general conversations in which people seldom utter their thoughts the author in this poem declares his real opinions to a philosophical prince whom he then  0 had the honor of living with he has been informed that persons of the best understanding have been pleased with this sketch they were of opinion that the poem on the law of nature was intended only to prepare the world for truths more sublime this consideration alone would have determined the author to render his work more complete and correct if his infirmities had permitted it he was at last obliged to content himself with correcting the faults which the first edition swarm with the praises bestowed in this work upon a prince by no means solicitous about praise should not surprise anybody they came from the heart they are very different from that incense which selfinterestedness lavishes upon power the man of letters might not perhaps have deserved the praises or the favors poured upon him by the monarch but the monarch was every way deserving of the encomiums bestowed upon him in this poem by the man of letters the change which has since happened in a connection which does so much honor to learning has by no means altered the sentiments which gave occasion to these praises in fine since a work never intended for publication has been snatched out of secrecy and obscurity it will last among a few sages as a monument of a philosophical correspondence which should not have ended and if it shows human weakness throughout it at the same time makes it appear that true philosophy always surmounts that weakness to conclude this weak essay was first occasioned by a little pamphlet which appeared at that time it    was entitled a treatise on the sovereign good and it should have been called a treatise on the sovereign evil the author of it maintained that there is no such thing as virtue or vice and that remorse of conscience is a weakness owing to the prejudice of education which a man should endeavor to subdue the author of the following poem maintains that remorse of conscience is as natural to us as any passion of the human soul if the violence of passion hurries man into a fault when come to himself he is sensible of that fault the wild girl who was found near châlons owned that in her passion she gave her companion a blow of the consequence of which the poor wretch died in her arms as soon as she saw her blood she repented she wept she stopped the blood and dressed the wound with herbs those who maintain that this relenting of humanity is only a branch of selflove do that principle a great deal of honor let men call reason and conscience by what names they will they exist and are the foundation of the law of nature    the law of nature   thou by whose works deeds reign with wonders fraught   the brave and wise their duty shall be taught   who with unaltered brow alike look down

this is the only principle herein discussed the author speaks only of the law of nature and not of religion and its awful mysteries   whether a selfexistent being laid   the worlds foundations out of nothing made        if forming matter oer it he presides   and having shaped the mass directs and guides   whether the soul that bright ethereal spark   of heavenly fire too oft obscure and dark

with the italian music which he had no knowledge of but from some indifferent airs which were never heard at rome and which are very badly sung in france by some girls belonging to the opera he then caused a long french recitative set to music by an italian who did not understand our language to be performed it was to no purpose to remonstrate to him that as this sort of music is nothing more than noted declamation it is of consequence subjected to the genius of the language and that nothing can be as ridiculous as french scenes sung in the italian taste except italian ones sung in the french taste   nature ingenious fertile wise   earth with gifts various beautifies   she speaks to all in language fit   they differ both in tongue and wit   their tone their voices suit each note   is by the hand of nature wrote   and every difference must appear   to a refined judicious ear   music to charm in france the tone   of france must imitate alone        lulli could to our taste descend   not strive to alter but amend no sooner were these judicious remarks made but the pretended connoisseur shaking his head cried come come you shall soon see something new we could not refuse to enter and immediately after the concert began   the rivals then of lullys fame   their taste and skill in art the same   french verse most dissonantly played   with the italian musics aid   a lady with distorted eyes   acted a thousand ecstasies   a coxcomb of his dress quite vain   quavered and thrilled a frantic strain   and beat time false which made them soon   all equally play out of tune we left the place as rapidly as we could and we did not arrive at the temple of taste until after we had met with many adventures of this kind   on basis firm in ancient days   greece did this famous temple raise   the building with revolving years   increased to menace heaven appears   the world upon its altars laid   incense and adoration paid   to own the power rome long delayed   at length to taste she homage paid   the turk a more inveterate foe   in dust the edifice laid low   the ruins by the goths neglected   were all in italy collected        soon the first francis nobly bold   raised a new temple like the old   but his posterity despised   an architecture once so prized   next richelieu made it all his care   the abandoned temple to repair   lewis adorned the sacred shrine   colbert invited all the nine   each art in which the wise excel   beneath the temples roof to dwell   by this the first shrine was surpassed   but much i doubt it will not last   here might i in descriptive verse   the beauties of the shrine rehearse   but let us not to show our skill in   description simply write for filling   let us prolixity avoid   by which felibiens readers cloyed   whilst he each trifle to explain   launches into rhetoric strain   this noble buildings not disgraced   with heaps of rubbish round it placed   for thus our sires but little skilled   their gothic structures used to build   the shrine from all the faults we see   in versailles chapelle famed is free   that gewgaw which strikes vulgar eyes   but which all men of taste despise it is much easier to give a negative than a positive idea of this temple to avoid so difficult an attempt i shall only add   the structures of a simple taste   each ornament is justly placed        the wholes arranged with so much care   art seems to copy nature there   the beauteous structure fills the sight   not with surprise but with delight the temple was surrounded with a crowd of virtuosos artists and connoisseurs of various kinds who endeavored to enter but did not succeed   for criticism severe and just   still stood before that shrine august   repelling all the efforts rude   of goths who would in crowds intrude how many men of quality how many persons in high vogue with the public who dictate so imperiously to little clubs are refused admittance into that temple   there the cabals of wit no more   have the same power they had before   when they could make an audience praise   pradons and scudéris wretched lays   and think their writings did excel   those of racine and great corneille the obscure enemies of allshining merit those insects of society which are taken notice of only because they bite were repelled with equal rudeness these would have envied the great condé the glory he acquired at rocroi and villars the reputation he gained at denain as much as they envied corneille for having written polyeucte they would have assassinated lebrun for having painted the family of    darius and they in fact forced lemoine to lay violent hands upon himself for having painted the admirable salon of hercules they always hold in their hands a bowl of aconite like that which men of the same character caused socrates to drink   pride mixing with envy in odious embrace   gave birth to this cursed and detestable race   suspicion selfinterest malignant detraction   and of devotees a most dangerous faction   these often in secret confederacy combine   and to the cabal ope the gates of the shrine   there a midas eyes they impose on with ease   knaves yield them support and fools glut them with praise   true merit indignant a sad silence keeps   time alone wipes his tears whilst in secret he weeps these persecuting wretches fled as soon as they saw my two guides their precipitate flight was followed by something of a more diverting nature this was a crowd of writers of every rank age and condition who scratched at the door and begged of criticism to permit them to enter one brought with him a mathematical romance another a speech made before the academy one has just composed a metaphysical comedy another held in his hand a poetical miscellany long since printed with a long approbation and a privilege another presented a mandate wrote in an affected and overrefined style and was surprised to find that all present laughed instead of asking his blessing i am the reverend father said one make room for my lord said another  0   a prating sir with voice acute   cried im the judge of each dispute   i argue contradict and prate   what others like im sure to hate   then criticism appearing cried   your merit is by none denied   but since tastes godhead you reject   do not to enter here expect bardou then cried out the worlds in an error and will always continue so theres no god of taste and ill prove it thus then he laid down a proposition divided and subdivided it but nobody listened and a greater multitude than ever crowded to the gate   amidst the various coxcombs chased   by judgment from the shrine of taste   la motte houdart amongst the rest   approached and words like these addressed   receive my œdipus in prose   roughly tis true i verse compose   i must with boileau hold converse   and rail against all sorts of verse criticism knew him by his gentle deportment and the roughness of the two last lines and she left him awhile between perrault and chapelain who had laid a fifty years siege to the temple and constantly exclaimed against virgil at that very moment there arrived another versifier supported by two little satires and crowned with laurels and thistles i come hither to laugh to sport and to play and make merry said he till the dawn of the day    whats this i hear said criticism tis i answered the rhymer i am just come from germany to visit you and i have chosen the spring of the year to travel in spring the season in which the young zephyrs dissolve the bark of the floods and to fluid resolve the more he spoke in this style the less was criticism disposed to open the door to him what said he am i then taken for   a frog who from his narrow throat   still utters in discordant note   boekekex roax roax heavens cried criticism what horrible jargon is this she could not immediately guess who the person was that expressed himself in this manner she was told it was rousseau and that the muses had altered his voice as a punishment for his misdeeds she could not believe it and refused to open the door he blushed and cried out   a rigor so extreme abate   i come to seek marot my mate   like him ill luck i had awhile   but phœbus now does on me smile   im rousseau and to you well known   heres verses against the famed bignon†   o thou who always didst inspire   my bosom with thy sacred fire   kind criticism a welcome give   to one who elsewhere cannot live    criticism upon hearing these words opened the door and spoke thus   rousseau my temper better know   im just and neer with gall oerflow   unlike that fury whose fell rage   suggested thy malicious page   who poured her poison in your heart   and armed you with the deadly dart   the calumnies you strove to spread   drew themis vengeance on your head   your muse was into banishment   for certain wicked couplets sent   and for a wretched illwrit case   which added to your dire disgrace   but phœbus quickly did pursue   your malice with the vengeance due   your soul of genius he deprived   genius which you from him derived   of harmony he robbed your lays   which by that only merit praise   yet you the scribbling itch retain   whilst phœbus disavows each strain criticism after having given this advice adjudged that rousseau should take place of la motte as a versifier but that la motte should have the precedence whenever genius or understanding were the subjects of dispute these two men so different from each other had    not walked four steps when the one turned pale with rage and the other leaped with joy at the sight of a man who had been a long time in the temple sometimes in one place and sometimes in another   this was the learned fontenelle   who could in all the arts excel   and on each branch of science threw   a light that pleased because twas new   he from a planet came posthaste   back to the sacred shrine of taste   reasoned with mairan with quinault   trifled away an hour or so   and managed with an equal skill   the lyre the compass and the quill what cried rousseau shall i see that man here that man against whom i have written so many epigrams what shall taste suffer in her temple the author of the chevalier dhers letters of an autumnal passion of moonlight of a brook in love with a meadow of the tragedy of aspar of endymion etc no answered criticism tis not the author of those works that you see before you tis the author of the plurality of worlds who composed thetus and peleus an opera that excites your envy and the history of the academy of sciences which you are not capable of understanding rousseau was going to write an epigram and fontenelle looked upon him with that philosophical compassion which every man of an enlightened mind must have for a mere rhymer and then went and    seated himself with great composure between lucretius and leibnitz i asked how leibnitz came to be there i was told that it was because he had written tolerably good latin verses though he was versed in both metaphysics and geometry and that criticism admitted him into her temple to soften by such an example the austerity of his scientific brethren criticism then turned to the author of the plurality of worlds and said i shall not reproach you with some of your juvenile performances as these zealous cynics have done but i am criticism you are now in the presence of the god of taste and i must thus address you in the name of that god the public and myself for we all three agree in the main   your sportful and instructive muse   of art should not be so profuse   her charms are not quite so faint   as to require the aid of paint as for lucretius he blushed as soon as ever he saw the cardinal his adversary but no sooner did he hear him speak than he conceived a friendship for him he ran to him and accosted him in very fine latin verses which i translate into indifferent french ones      misled by epicurus lore   i thought i nature could explore   and as a god the man admired   who with presumptuous fury fired   dared impious war with heaven to wage   the gods dethroning in his rage   i thought the soul a transient fire   dissolved the moment we expire   i now no more with truth contend   the soul shall never have an end   but of existence always sure   shall like your deathless verse endure the cardinal answered this compliment in the language of lucretius all the latin poets present from his air and style judged him to be an ancient roman but the french poets are highly displeased at authors composing verses in a language which is no longer spoken and they affirm that since lucretius born at rome wrote a latin poem upon the philosophy of epicurus his adversary born at paris should have written against him in french to conclude after several such amusing delays we at last arrived at the temple of the god of taste   i saw the god whom i in vain   implore for aid in every strain   that god who never was defined   whose essence escapes the searching mind   to whom just service few can pay   though they with such devotion pray   who animates la fontaines strain   and vodius searches for in vain   the graces he consults whose ease   with native beauty joined can please        graces which other nations own   are best to the french writers known   which others oft to copy tried   which by strict rules are never tied   which reigned at court in times of yore   with which love crowns the gallic shore   around the god the tender band   of graces still obsequious stand   they to adorn the god attend   he pleases by the charms they lend   they crown him with a wreath divine   where phœbus self took care to twine   laurels which once famed maro crowned   for epic poetry renowned   myrtle and ivy leaves which graced   horace supreme in wit and taste   the roses which in times of yore   the lyric bard anacreon wore   his front the mirror of his mind   showed wisdom by true taste refined   wit sparkled in his eyes his air   was such as might his soul declare   to prove his beauty is divine   silvia his face resembles thine   i thus conceal your real name   lest envious beauties should declaim   against you should it once be known   your charms are greater than their own   rollin not far with action grave   to youth his learned lessons gave   and though in his professors chair   was listened to a thing most rare        meantime in an apartment by   which girardon and puget vie   with statues to adorn where taste   as well as just expressions traced   poussin upon stretched canvas showed   what genius in his bosom glowed   le brun with elevated mind   and genius nobly bold designed   le sueur in his art complete   between both painters took his seat   none murmured to behold him there   all owned him worthy of the chair   the god who with a critic eye   could every pencils stroke espy   grieved whilst he much admired their art   they could not to their works impart   those vivid colors whose bright glow   on natures self new charms bestow   a crowd of loves before him played   and to his touch new force conveyed   and raised each beauty to its height   by adding rubens colors bright i was surprised that i did not meet at the sanctuary several persons who sixty or eighty years ago passed for the greatest favorites of the god of taste the pavillons the benserades the pellissons the segraises the st évremonds the balzacs the voitures were no longer in possession of the first places they possessed them heretofore said one of my guides they made a figure before the bright period of the learned world but they have at length given place to men of real genius at present they are    but little considered and in fact most of them had only the wit peculiar to their age and not that species of wit which reaches posterity   the graces of their feeble lays   are tarnished and they lose their praise   none them as geniuses admit   but all agree to praise their wit segrais attempted one day to enter the sanctuary at the same time repeating the following verse of boileau   que segrais dans léglogue en charme les forêts   let segrais charm the woods with rural lays but criticism having unhappily for him read a few pages of his æneid in french verse dismissed him a little roughly and in his place admitted madame de la fayette who published the delightful romance of zada and the princess of cleves under the name of segrais pellisson is not easily excused for having in his history of the french academy gravely related so many puerilities and cited as strokes of wit things which by no means deserve that name the soft but weak pavillon humbly pays his court to madame deshoulières who is placed far above him the unequal st èvremond does not presume to speak of poetry balzac with his longwinded hyperbolical phrases tires the patience of benserade and voiture who answer him by antitheses and quibbles which they are presently after ashamed of themselves i went in quest of the famous count de bussy madame de sévigné who is beloved by all who dwell in the temple told me that her dear cousin a man of    great wit but a little too vain could never succeed so far as to make the god of taste entertain the same favorable opinion of mons roger de rabutin which the count de bussy had of him   bussy for pride and selflove famed   is by the god severely blamed   because too much a slave to fame   himself he often made his theme   his son with every talent graced   is always well received by taste   he flatters none of none speaks ill   his conversation pleases still   he shows that wit and eloquence   to which his father makes pretence   chaulieu who gay and void of care   rising from table sang an air   addressed the godhead as a friend   with freedom which could not offend   his lively and luxuriant vein   roves unconfined nor hears the rein   his muse disdaining all control   with native beauties charms the soul   la farre with softness tempering fire   tuned to a lower note his lyre   and poured forth in his mistress praise   his incorrect but sprightly lays   which might from ease and pleasure spring   though phœbus had not taught to sing   there hamilton whose darts neer fail   to wound at all mankind did rail   there st aulaire who for old age   surpassed anacreon the sage    0   could all loves joys and cares rehearse   in softer and more pleasing verse   cytherian chaplets graced his head   with hoary honors overspread the god had a great affection for these gentlemen especially for those who piqued themselves upon nothing he hinted to chaulieu that he should look upon himself as the first of careless and negligent poets not as the first of good poets they conversed with some of the most amiable men of their age their conversations were equally free from the affectation of the hotel de rambouillet and from the confusion which reigns amongst our young fellows   from here with equal shame are chased   the affected and pedantic taste   the stiff and syllogistic air   the rage which strives to overbear   there gracefully we see unite   learning profound with humor light   and with precision close we find   the follies of the human mind   genius takes various forms there   it jests and knows a jest to bear   for fear of tiring there the wise   put on even pleasantrys disguise chapelle was there that genius more debauched than delicate more natural than polite an easy versifier incorrect in his style and licentious in his thoughts he constantly answered the god of taste in the same rhymes tis said that god once answered him thus      chapelle henceforward less admire   reiterated rhymes they tire   those strings of syllables displayed   by richelet ill a poet aid   that authors dictionary gleaning   in double rhymes youll have no meaning in this agreeable company i met the president de maisons a man of a very different character not at all used to utter words without a meaning a man as solid as agreeable and equally a lover of all the arts   dear maisons is it thee i then embrace   cried i while trickling tears bedewed my face   thou who wast snatched from me by cruel death   who in my arms when young resigned thy breath   deaf to my prayer inexorable fate   was bent two dearest friends to separate   ah since its rigor either death required   thou shouldst have lived and i should have expired   since my sad eyes first opened on the sphere   twas heavens decree i should be wretched here   thy path of life by heaven was strewed with flowers   and heartfelt joy winged all thy golden hours   with pleasures and with honors compassed round   in arts your wisdom full contentment found   weakness is not of worth like thine the source   oer such a mind opinion neer had force   mans born to err the potters forming hand   soft earth is far less able to withstand   than can the mind resist the potent sway   of prejudice which mortals still obey        to such vile slavery you refused to bend   your time you gave to study and a friend   and in your nature were at once combined   a tender heart and philosophic mind among these wits we met some jesuits a jansenist would say upon this that the jesuits intrude everywhere but the god of taste receives their enemies too and it is diverting to see in this temple bourdaloue conversing with pascal upon the great art of uniting eloquence and close reasoning father bouhours stands behind them setting down in his pocketbook all the improprieties and inelegances of language which escape them the cardinal could not help addressing father bouhours thus   the care each little fault to spy   that pedants diligence lay by   let us in eloquence respect   each careless phrase and bold defect   were i to choose i should prefer   wild genius and like great men err   rather than be the wight who dwells   on syllables who scans and spells this reprimand was expressed in terms much more polite than those which i have made use of but we poets are sometimes guilty of deviations from good breeding for the sake of a rhyme when i visited this temple my attention was not entirely engaged by the wits   harmonious verse and prose refined   to you alone im not confined   i scorn a taste thats fixed on parts   and now invoke all pleasing arts        music and painting arts divine   with architectures great design   graving and dancing all unite   my soul to ravish with delight   from all art pleasure must arise   none then are slighted by the wise i saw the muses by turns place upon the altar of the god books designs and plans of various kinds the plan of that beautiful front of the louvre for which we are not indebted to bernin who with great expense and to no purpose was brought into france it being the work of perrault and louis la vau great artists whose merit is too little known is to be seen upon that altar there also is the plan of st deniss gate the beauty of which most parisians are as insensible of as they are ignorant of the name of francis blondel the architect to whom they owe this monument that admirable fountain so little taken notice of which is adorned with the precious sculptures of john gougeon but which is in every respect inferior to the admirable fountain of bouchardon at the same time that it seems to upbraid the rude taste of all the others the porch of st gervais church a masterpiece of architecture to which a church a proper situation and admirers are wanting and which should immortalize the name of desbrosses still more than the palace of luxembourg likewise was built by him all these monuments neglected by the vulgar ever barbarous and by people of the world ever inattentive often attract the observation of the deity the library of this enchanted    palace was next shown us it was not very big it will be readily believed that we did not find in it   a heap of manuscripts most rare   which greedy bookworms seldom spare   nor on those shelves are ever found   those writings which so much abound   writings by no man ever read   the lumber of an authors head   in person here the tuneful nine   their proper place to books assign   to books where genius may be traced   combined with elegance of taste most of the books there have passed through the hands of the muses and been by them corrected the work of rabelais is to be seen there reduced to less than half a quarter of its bulk marot whose only merit is his style and who in the same taste sings the psalms of david and the wonders of alix has but eight or ten leaves left the pages of voiture and sarrasin together do not exceed sixty in number the whole genius of bayle is to be found in a single volume by his own acknowledgment for that judicious philosopher that enlightened judge of authors and sects often declared that he would never have written more than one volume in folio if he had not been employed by booksellers we were at last admitted into the innermost part of the sanctuary there the mysteries of the god were unveiled there i saw what may serve as an example to posterity a small number of truly great    men were employed in correcting those faulty passages of their works which would have been beauties in those of inferior geniuses the amiable author of telemachus retrenched the repetitions and useless details of his moral romance and blotted out the title of epic poem which the indiscreet zeal of some of his admirers had given it for he frankly owns that there is no such thing as a poem in prose the eloquent bossuet was ready to strike out some familiar expressions which had escaped his vast impetuous and free genius and which in some measure disgrace the sublimity of his funeral orations and it is worthy of remark that he by no means vouches for the truth of all he has said concerning the pretended wisdom of the ancient egyptians   corneille the great and the sublime   who pleased not by the charms of rhyme   but waked the soul by strokes of art   which filled with wonder every heart   who with a pencil ever true   both cinna and augustus drew   cornelia pompey brave and great   who fell by too severe a fate   into the flames pulcheria threw   agesilaus surena too   and sacrificed with no remorse   the fruits of genius without force   productions of declining age   and quite unworthy of the stage        racine

freely tell   of works which in their kind excel   wed gladly be informed by you   about your tales and fables too la fontaine who retained the simplicity of his character and who in the temple of taste joined acuteness and penetration to that happy instinct which inspired him during his life blotted out some of his fables he abridged almost all his tales and tore the greater part of a collection of posthumous works printed by those editors who live by the folly of the dead   there boileau reigned who taught his age   by reason roused to satires rage   who framed with care poetic laws   and followed them with just applause        severely now his works he views   one quibbling poem shames his muse   the verses now he cant endure   written on the taking of namure   he blots them out with hasty hand   and cries your genius understand boileau at the express command of the god of taste was reconciled to quinault who may be considered as a poet formed by the graces as boileau was by reason   but boileau satirist severe   whilst he embraced could scarce forbear   the lyric poet to revile   yet quinault pardoned with a smile ill never be reconciled to you said boileau except you acknowledge that there are many insipid lines in those agreeable operas thats very possible answered quinault but you must at the same time acknowledge that you were never capable of writing atys or armida   your poems labored and exact   may general esteem attract   my operas composed with ease   may surely be allowed to please after saluting boileau and tenderly embracing quinault i saw the inimitable molière and i made bold to accost him in these terms   terence the sage and the polite   could well translate but could not write   his elegance is cold and faint   he could not roman manners paint        you the great painter of our nation   have drawn each character and station   our cits with maggots in their brain   our marquises as pert as vain   our formal gentry of the law   all by your art their likeness saw   and you would have reformed each fault   if sense and virtue could be taught ah said he why was i ever under a necessity of writing for the people why was i not always master of my time i should have invented much more happy intrigues i should have seldom descended to low comedy twas thus these masters in their several arts showed their superiority by owning those errors to which human nature is subject and from which the greatest geniuses are not exempt i then found that the god of taste is very hard to be pleased but that he is never pleased by halves i perceived that the works which he criticises the most are those which he likes best   the god takes every authors part   of pleasing if he has the art   no anger he in censuring shows   with transport in applauding glows   the muse displayed her charms divine   and brought her heroes to his shrine   the power benign can scarce forbear   seeing their faults to drop a tear   that wretch should be to woe consigned   whos not to tenderness inclined        by such our nature is disgraced   he flies the sacred shrine of taste when my company was going to retire the god addressed them in terms to this effect for i am not permitted to use his own words   farewell my much loved friends farewell   since you in poetry excel   let not to paris dire disgrace   my rival there possess my place   false taste i know from your keen eyes   in terror and confusion flies   if ever you should meet that foe   youll him by this description know   his tawdry dress is void of

  such favors as those who confer forget   and who receive declare without regret   this history of the virtues of mankind   within a narrow compass is confined   in gothic characters all these are

hypocrites bring in their claim   all that theyre faithful to her laws maintain   and even her enemies her rights profane   in regions subject to the popes command   thus we see beads oft in an

with a tenderness like hers replete   amongst true friends might justly claim a seat   then quickly came allured by such a prize   the french who novelty still idolize   a multitude before the temple came   and first two courtly friends preferred their claim   by interest joined they walked still hand in hand   and of their union friendship thought the band   posthaste a courier came and made

impartiality is unexceptionable when i have read the work through i shall send you a few remarks on it amongst the rest on the german names which you have a little disfigured this might render the work somewhat obscure as some of them are so disguised that we are puzzled to guess at them i wish every work capable of conveying instruction was to come from your pen we should then be sure of being improved by the books we read i sometimes am vexed at the puerilities the trivial remarks and the dry style of certain books these things readers are often obliged to digest you spare your readers

would serve the dame   being thus injured straight she went   to tell the king her discontent   a knight has robbed me sire she said   and ravished too but never paid   wisely the king replied tis clear   a rape is what has brought you here   before queen bertha plead your cause   in these points well she kens the laws   shell hear attentive what you say   and judgment pass without delay   marton with reverence bowed the head   and to the queen her way she sped   the queen was quite humane and mild   looked on each subject as a child   but she was still severely bent   to punish the incontinent    0    of prudes her council she assembled   the knight uncapped before them trembled   with downcast eyes neer dared to stir   he then had neither boot nor spur   the court by no chicane delayed   but ample full confession made   that taking by charonne his way   he was by satan led astray   that he repented of his crime   would neer offend a second time   but that the first might prove the last   sentence of death was on him passed   robert had so much youthful grace   so fine his person fair his face   that bertha and assessors all   awarding sentence tears let fall   pangs

free   since by the laws established there   who tells what pleases all the fair   has to his pardon a just claim   acquitted by each virtuous dame   but then he must the thing explain   completely or his hopes are vain   what thus had been in council started   quickly to robert was imparted   the good queen bertha bent to save him   eight days to think upon it gave him    0    he swore in eight days hed appear   and strive to make the matter clear   then for this favor unexpected   thanked bertha and went out dejected   then thus the matter he debated   thus he his difficulty stated   how

sporting near the fair   played in the ringlets of their hair   on the green turf they lightly danced   their feet scarce on its surface glanced    0    robert draws nigh in hopes to find   ease from perplexity of mind   just then all vanished from his sight   scarcely had day given place to night   a toothless hag then met his eyes   sooty in hue and short of size   bent double and with age oppressed   she leaned upon a stick for rest   her nose prodigious long and thin   extended till it met her chin   her eyes with rheum were galled and red   a few white hairs her pate oerspread   a scrap of tapestry was her gown   it oer her wrinkled thigh hung down   at such an odd and uncouth sight   a sort of terror seized our knight   the beldame with familiar tone   accosts him thus i see my son   by your dejected thoughtful air   your heart feels some corroding care   relate to me your secret grief   to talk of woes gives some relief   although your case be eer so bad   some consolation may be had   ive long beheld this earthly stage   and wisdom must increase with age   the most unhappy oft have sped   to bliss by my directions led   alas replied the knight in vain   ive sought instruction to obtain   the fatal hour is drawing nigh   i must upon a gibbet die    0    unless i can the queen tell right   what tis gives women most delight   courage my son the dame replied    tis god has to me been your guide   tis for your good then straight to court   boldly proceed and make report   lets go together ill unfold   the secret which must there be told   but swear that

robert who scrupled not to swear   from laughter could not well forbear   be serious cried the ancient dame   to laugh shows want of grace and shame   then moving onward hand in hand   before queen bertha now they stand   the council met without delay   robert asked what he had to say   cried ladies now your secrets out   what you love most admits no doubt   what at all seasons can content ye   is not of lovers to have plenty   but woman of whateer degree   whateer her qualities may be   desires to bear both night and day   oer all about her sovereign sway   woman would always fain command   if i lie hang me out of hand    0    whilst thus harangued our doughty spark   all present said he hit the mark   the queens hand robert kissed when cleared   then straight a haggard form appeared   the hag of whom we spoke before   with rags and dirt all covered oer   crying out justice forward pressed   and in these terms the queen addressed   oh lovely queen thy sexs pride   who always justly doth decide   to whom fair equity is known   whilst mercy dwells beside thy throne   by me this knight your secret knew   the life i saved to me is due   he swore nor should the oath prove vain   that i should what i wished obtain   upon your justice i rely   and hope you wont my right deny   says robert i deny it not   i never a good turn forgot   but bate my armor all i had   was baggage twenty crowns and pad   a monk when marton i caressed   with pure religious zeal possessed   as lawful prize seized on the whole   for twere a sin to say he stole   though honest since im broke outright   i cant this friendly turn requite   the queen replied what you have lost   shall be repaid to friars cost   all parties shall be satisfied   in three your fortune well divide    0    for her lost eggs and chastity   the twenty crowns shall martons be   the steed i to this dame consign   the armor robert shall be thine   most generously youve decreed   said madam but i want no steed   tis roberts person i desire   his grace and valor i admire   i oer his amorous heart would reign   thats all the prize i wish to gain   robert with me must pass his life   this day must take me for a wife   her purpose being thus declared   robert stood motionless and stared   then oer her rags and figure strange   his rolling eyes began to range   with horror struck he back retreated   crossing himself these words repeated   why should this ridicule and shame   with foul dishonor blast my name   with the deils dam id rather wed   than to that beldame go to bed   the hag must doubtless be run mad   or else she dotes and thats as bad   the hag then tenderly replied   my person queen he cant abide   hes like the whole ungrateful crew   of males but soon ill bring him too   i feel loves flame so brightly burn   he needs must love me in his turn   the heart does all i cant but say   my charms begin to fade away     0   but ill more tender prove and kind   tis best to cultivate the mind   we find een solomon declare   the wise by far exceed the fair   im poor is that so hard a case   sure poverty is no disgrace   cant one enjoy content of mind   except on ivory bed reclined   madam in all this regal pride   when you lie by our monarchs side   do you enjoy more kindly rest   does love sincerer warm your breast   youve read of old philemons flame   for baucis though an ancient dame   those jealousies by old age bred   dwell not beneath the rustic shed   vice flies where luxury is unknown   we equal kings serve god alone   your countrys glory we support   we furnish soldiers for the court   in rendering populous the state   the poor by much outdo the great   if heaven should to my chaste desire   refuse the offspring i require   loves flowers without its fruits can please   upon loves tree those flowers ill seize   while thus the ancient dame descanted   all the court ladies were enchanted   robert was to her arms consigned   disgust was vain for oaths must bind   the dame insisted on her right   of riding with her much loved knight         to her thatched hut where wedlocks bands   were to unite their hearts and hands   robert his steed begins to stride   with sorrow takes his future bride   with horror seized and red with shame   he often strove to throw the dame   or drown her but was by the law   of chivalry still kept in awe   the lady with her knight delighted   to him her races deeds recited   how the great clovis royal sword   the bosoms of three monarchs gored   who were his friends yet could obtain   pardon and heavens high favor gain   from heaven she saw the famed dove bring   to remi that illustrious king   the flask and oil so highly prized   which he was smeared with when baptized   with all her narratives she blended   thoughts and reflections well intended   sallies of wit remarks refined   which without calling off the mind   attention in who heard excited   and both instructed and delighted   still does our knight with eager ears   devour the stories that he hears   charmed when he heard his wife but when   he saw the unhappiest of men   at length the illmatched couple came   to the thatched cabin of the dame   preparing things with eager haste   the table for her spouse she placed         such fare might suit with saturns age   tis now but talked of by the sage   three sticks support two rotten boards   such table that poor hut affords   at this our couple sat at meat   each oddly placed on narrow seat   the husband sadly hung his head   the bride a thousand gay things said   wit she combined with graceful ease   uttered bons mots which pique and please   so natural that to those who hear   said by themselves they must appear   so pleased was robert that a smile   escaped him and he thought a while   his wife less ugly than before   but she would fain the supper oer   have her spouse go with her to bed   he raves he wishes to be dead   he yields though not with a good grace   since without remedy his case   foul clothes our knight but little matters   quite gnawed by rats and torn to tatters   on pieces of old wood extended   and frequently with packthread mended   all this the knight could have digested   but hymens rites he quite detested   of these indeed he much complained   good heaven cried he ist so ordained   at rome tis said grace from on high   can both the power and will supply   but grace does for the present fail   and i for my part am but frail         my wife can by her wit impart   delight she has a feeling heart   but when with sense theres conflict dire   can heart or head true joy inspire   our knight benumbed like ice this said   threw himself flat upon his bed   and to conceal his anguish tries   to feign asleep sleep from him flies   the beldame pinching robert cried   do you then slumber by your bride   dear but ungrateful spouse you see   i am subdued now yield to me   the timid voice of struggling shame   is stifled by my amorous flame   reign oer my sense without control   since you reign powerful oer my soul   i die just heaven say to what end   with virtue must our love contend   im quite dissolved in loves bright flame   pleasure thrills through my vital frame   must i alas without thee die   tis to thy conscience i apply   our knight was complaisant and kind   religion candor graced his mind   he took compassion on the dame   madam said he i wish my flame   like yours might strong and brightly shine   the power to effect it is not mine   you can effect it said his wife   a great heart at your stage of life   by fortitude by art and care   performs with ease achievements rare         think how the ladies will approve   at court this miracle of love   perhaps i your disgust excite   wrinkles are shocking to your sight   heroes magnanimous despise   such trifles only shut your eyes   our knight of glory fond would fain   this conquest of himself obtain   obedience then became his choice   listening alone to honors voice   finding in vigorous youth alone   what could for beautys want atone   and loves supply he shuts his eyes   and to perform his duty tries   enough enough then said the bride   i ask no more im satisfied   my influence oer your heart i know   that influence to me you owe   acknowledge then as matters stand   the wife will still at home command   robert all that i ask of thee   is to be always ruled by me   my love enjoins an easy task   now view me well tis all i ask   then robert looks and sees in clusters   a hundred flambeaux placed on lustres   in a proud palace which he saw   before a cabin thatched with straw   there underneath rich curtains graced   with fringe of pearls in highest taste         a beauty bright appeared to view   such as apelles never drew   een vanloos colors would prove faint   that heaven of charms divine to paint   no phidias nor no pigall eer   could carve a busto of the fair   her form like lovely venus showed   whose golden tresses graceful flowed   whose melting eyes appeared to languish   whilst soothing marss amorous anguish   myself she said this palace all   this wealth your own dear robert call   you did not ugliness despise   you therefore merit beautys prize   but now methinks my readers claim   to know what was this fair ones name   whose heart our knight had won why then   twas fairy urgelle gentlemen   who warriors in her time caressed   and knights assisted when distressed   happy the age thrice blessed mankind   when tales like these belief could find   of spirits hovering in the air   of demons who make men their care   in castle close by roasting fire   the daughter mother husband sire   the neighborhood and all the race   attended with a wondering face   whilst by the almoner were told   deeds done by sorcerers of old         we of the marvellous are rifled   by reasons weight the graces stifled   have to the insipid men consigned   the soul by reasoning is confined   still hunting after truth we go   from error too some good may flow     the education of a prince   since the bright god of day in the course of his race   in aquarius resides with a sorrowful face   since tempests so loudly on our high mountains blow   and our meadows are all covered over with snow   by the fire ill a new story tell in new style   amusements the time that hangs heavy beguile   i am old i must own it and will therefore descend   to the pleasures of children since near my lifes end   a prince erst reigned at beneventum tis said   quite mad with his power and in luxury bred   to knowledge a stranger and not illeducated   by his neighbors despised by his own subjects hated   this small state to govern two archknaves combined   they exerted themselves their young master to blind   in this project they were by his confessor aided   they by turns succeeded he by all was persuaded   that his talents his virtues and his great reputation   could insure perfect bliss to the mightiest nation   that when once their duke had to manhood attained   he was dreaded and loved and in all mens hearts reigned         that his arms could both france and italia confound   that with wealth his exchequer would ever abound   that solomon neer had so much wealth of old   though the torrent of kedron oer golden sands rolled   alamon—for by that name this prince we must call—   still was dupe to gross flatteries for he swallowed them all   with pastimes delighted court buffoons he caressed   and when he had dined thought his people were blessed   one valiant old general at court still remained   ernon greatly esteemed when the dukes father reigned   who not being bribed spoke his mind uncontrolled   and undaunted the governments ruin foretold   to jealousy roused those who bore supreme sway   soon found means to remove ernon out of the way   unknown to the prince he to exile was sent   but there at a farm the old man lived content   there with friends he lived happy resigned to his fate   and he wept for his master as well as the state   whilst with sloth and with pleasure the young duke content   on the down of soft ease both his days and nights spent   the murmurs by which oft his subjects expressed   discontent would however sometimes break his rest   but that distant din which he hardly could hear   grows weak in its course and scarce beats on his ear         whilst with woe overloaded men groaned through the realm   alamon led a languishing life at the helm   then was tyrannys triumph but the heavens took his part   and to work reformation with love touched his heart   young amida he saw he both saw her and heard   his heart felt emotion and to live he appeared   he was handsome and might with assurance address her   but the mystery soon was smoked by his confessor   in his penitents breast straight he scruples excited   superstition and ignorance are easily frighted   and the two wicked rulers who feared lest the lover   might one day their sinister proceedings discover   were for making amida like ernon depart   her all to pack up she prepared with sad heart   the weak alamon all this insolence bore   his reluctance was vain from his charmer he tore   he doubted and wavered for just in that season   his soul was but faintly illumined by reason   when amida was going there were heard loud alarms   the cry was alls lost let us die and to arms   on allah st germain christ and mahomet loud   they called and on every side fled a crowd   a warrior turbaned who led on a band   of mussulmans holding their falchions in hand   over heaps of the dead or expiring who lay   all reeking in gore with his sword cut a way   with sword and with fire to the palace he flew   the women he seized on their husbands he slew     0   from cuma this general marched to beneventum   but the rulers neer dreamed he would thus circumvent them   desolation and ruin up to romes walls he spread   and st paul and st peter were both seized with dread   my dear readers this chief was abdallah the proud   who by god to chastise his own church was allowed   when the palace he entered in chains all were cast   prince monks lackeys ministers and chiefs were made fast   as calves tied in couples upon sledges are laid   and to the next market sad victims conveyed   thus appeared the young duke and each worthy assessor   all laid by the heels with the father confessor   who crossed himself often and with fervency prayed   and preached resolution though sorely dismayed   the victors then shared when the vanquished were tied   the booty the emirs in three parts divide   of men and of horses and saints they dispose   and first from their captives they strip off their clothes   in all ages have tailors disguised human nature   so that man to man always was a most unknown creature   dress changes mens figures and their characters too   to judge of man rightly we should naked him view         the mussulman chief had the duke at that time   as already was said he was in his youths prime   since he seemed to be strong muleteer he was made   and soon he was highly improved by that trade   his nerves which by sloth and by ease weak were grown   inured to hard labor acquired a new tone   his sloth by adversity taught he subdued   and valor in him sprung from mean servitude   valor when without power makes the state of man worse   his impotence then is the heavier curse   abdallah to pleasure began to resign   his soul and in spite of his prophet drank wine   the court and townladies all prone to adore him   were by the black eunuch each night brought before him   by beauties attended he prepares for repose   and shes happy to whom he the handkerchief throws   whilst the chief led a life of unceasing delight   whilst joy winged each hour and love triumphed at night   in the stable much hardship and woe the prince bore   those his comrades were now who were subjects before   his mules all his care and attention required   he combed them each day till his hands were quite tired   his woe to complete and to make him quite rave   he beheld fair amida led by the black slave         to share in her turn the fell conquerors bed   fired with rage at the sight to the eunuch he said   to make me quite wretched there but wanted this stroke   wonder seized on the slave at the words which he spoke   in a language quite different fair amida replied   with affection and sorrow her young lover she eyed   her eloquent looks her full meaning express   they meant bear your woes live my wrongs to redress   your present mean station i do not despise   your sufferings give you new worth in my eyes   alamon took the meaning which her looks thus expressed   and heartcheering hope was revived in his breast   amida with beauty transcendently bright   so dazzled the chief of the mussulmans sight   that transported with passion by allah he swore   he enjoyment had known but neer knew love before   the fair one resisted to increase his desires   resistance served only to fan the chiefs fires   a womans head still with invention is fraught   said she sir your conquest i well may be thought   youre unconquered in love as in warlike alarms   all fall at your feet or rush into your arms   but the honor you mean me defer for three days   and grant to console me for such sad delays   two things which as proofs of your love i require   ill grant said the pirate whateer you desire         then make three beneventers said she undergo   a couple of hundred sound lashes or so   this discipline for their transgressions is due   this sirs the first favor i hope for from you   the second sir is that you two mules would spare me   which may on a litter from time to time bear me   and to drive them a muleteer of my own choosing   your requests said abdallah there is no refusing   twas done soon as said and the hypocrite vile   with both courtiers who joined their lords youth to beguile   received each their full quota which pleased all of the nation   who had often complained of maladministration   and the duke was the happiest mortal alive   since permitted his mistress in litter to drive   alls not over said amida you must conquer and reign   nows the time or to die or your crown to regain   youre not wanting in courage ernons faithful and i   am resolved to serve you and my country or die   then make no delay but to ernon repair   to ask pardon for all he has suffered take care   to serve you what remains of his life hell expose   return in three days and then fall on your foes   theres no time to be lost for abdallah is bent   to accomplish in three days his lustful intent   in love and in war time is precious you know   alamon with alacrity answered i go         ernon whom amida had informed of all   loved his prince though ungrateful and lamented his fall   his generous brave friends all stood ready at hand   and of soldiers he headed a most resolute band   ernon tenderly wept when his prince he had found   they armed in secret marched in silence profound   amida addressed them and her words could impart   the love of true glory to each abject slaves heart   alamon could both conduct and courage unite   and a hero became when he first went to fight   the turk plunged in luxury who nothing mistrusted   surprised by the vanquished in his turn was worsted   alamon to the palace had in triumph advanced   at the time when the turk by soft pleasure entranced   not having yet heard the dire turn of his fate   was with hopes of enjoying fair amida elate   his right he asserted and took the turks place   then straight there appeared with a confident face   the priest in whose air there appeared much resignment   and the two knavish courtiers just broke from confinement   boasting that they did all though their boasts were quite vain   the influence they once had they hoped to maintain   to prove cruel and spiteful cowards but seldom have failed   the monk was for having abdallah empaled         the prince then replied with a resolute tone   vile wretch such a punishment should be your own   by a shameful repose you to ruin had brought me   this turk and my mistress true courage have taught me   by your precepts misguided false zeal i adored   but misfortunes and love have my virtues restored   at peace brave abdallah and in freedom depart   tis you have reformed both my mind and my heart   then in freedom depart no more trouble this state   and if ever it should be so ordered by fate   that oer your dominions three knaves should bear sway   send directly for me ill your favor repay     the education of a daughter   winter still lasts my friends and my greatest delight   is by telling long stories to amuse you at night   let us talk of dame gertrude i neer yet knew a prude   with charms more attractive or more various endued   though thirtysix years had passed over her head   the graces and loves were not yet from her fled   though grave in behavior she was neer seen to frown   her eyes had much lustre yet she ever looked down   her breast white as snow was with gauze covered oer   through which curious eyes could its beauties explore   a few touches of art and a little red lead   gave a delicate glow to her natural red   her person neglecting more brightly she shone   her dress struck the eye by its neatness alone   on her toilet a bible was always displayed   and near massillon was a pot of paint laid   the devotions for lent she still read oer and oer   but what made zeal in her respected the more   was that she in woman excused each rash action   for gertrude the devout was no friend of detraction         this dame had one daughter alone seventeen   was her age a more bright beauty never was seen   of this lovely creature isabel was the name   more fair than her mother but her beauty the same   they appeared like minerva and like venus the fair   to breed up her daughter was gertrudes chief care   like a flower newly blown she her child kept a stranger   to this wicked worlds contagion and danger   cards public diversions and gay conversation   to each innocent soul direful baits of temptation   the true snares of satan which the saints ever fly   were pleasures which gertrudes house neer durst come nigh   gertrude had a chapel whereto to repair   when minded to heaven to put up a prayer   there her leisure she oft passed in good meditations   and her soul breathed to heaven in ejaculations   resplendent with richest of furniture shone   this retreat to the eye of the public unknown   a pair of stairs where the profane neer durst tread   to the garden and from it into the street led   you all know that in summer the suns scorching ray   makes night oft more agreeable far than the day   by the moons silver light then the heavens are oerspread   and girls take no pleasure to slumber in bed   isabel whilst with pleasing pain throbbed her soft breast   as girls at seventeen cant be always at rest         passed the night under shelter of some cooling shade   yet scarce ever thought for what use it was made   unmoved she saw nature and never admired   but rose went and came just as caprice inspired   no object impression could make on her mind   she knew not how to think yet to think was inclined   at the chapel she chanced to hear one day some stir   that moment she felt curiositys spur   no suspicion she had which could justly raise fear   yet trembling and with hesitation drew near   one foot putting forward on the stairs she ascended   one hand she held back and the other extended   with eye fixed outstretched neck and heart throbbing fast   herself she exerted to hear all that passed   the first thing she hears is the voice of soft anguish   words half interrupted sighs of lovers that languish   my mothers oppressed by some pain or some care   cried she in her troubles i should have my share   approaching she heard these soft words dear andrew   for the bliss of my life im indebted to you   isabella this hearing took heart and she cried   my mother is well i should be satisfied   at length isabella retires to her bed   but for sighing cant sleep strange things run in her head   bliss andrew bestows but how by what art   tis sure a rare talent happiness to impart         thus she argued the case by herself all the night   and impatiently wished the return of the light   isabel the next morning showed some inquietude   her concern was quickly perceived by gertrude   to isabel silence proved a task too severe   to ask prying questions she could not forbear   whos this andrew said she madam whos said to know   the way upon woman true bliss to bestow   gertrude started as justly it might be supposed   that all was discovered yet herself she composed   then with perfect assurance to her daughter replied   oer every family a saint should preside   ive made choice of st andrew to him im devoted   by him is my temporal welfare promoted   i invoke him in secret his assistance implore   he often appears to me whilst i adore   there does not one saint in all paradise dwell   who in holiness can my st andrew excel   a wellshaped young man whom we denis shall name   soon of fair isabella enamored became   from isabel denis most kind treatment found   and their loves with enjoyment were frequently crowned   gertrude to every stir in her turn giving ear   chanced the anthems sung by isabella to hear   and the prayers which she made whilst she denis caressed   in ecstasy straining him to her soft breast   surprising our lovers gertrude was enraged   her passion the daughter by this answer assuaged     0   dear mother excuse me for patron i claim   st denis as your saint st andrew you name   gertrude then grown wiser greater happiness knew   retaining her lover she to saints bade adieu   she dropped the vain project of deceiving mankind   theyre not to be cheated for envys not blind   with piercing eye envy will see through your mask   to conjecture is easy to feign a hard task   to live free is a blessing but all pleasures are faint   to the wretch who lives under perpetual constraint   the fair isabel lived no longer retired   in charms she increased by the town was admired   those pleasures which gertrude had excluded before   she agreed as companions of love to restore   there the most polite people in joy passed their days   naught is found in good company undeserving of praise     the three manners   how formed were the athenians true joy to impart   how their genius delights and enlivens my heart   how under their fictions ingenious i trace   truths likeness and soon grow in love with her face   but of all their inventions that which strikes me the most   is the stage of athenians the pride and the boast   whereon heroes renowned and the chiefs of old times   could act over again both their good deeds and crimes   you see how all nations in this present age   adopt their example and would rival their stage   no folio instruction like the drama conveys   perish perish the wretches who would censure all plays   when that vile abject race first existed below   a heart nature on them forgot to bestow   at the greeks solemn games twas the custom to crown   men of eminent virtue and chiefs of renown   before the people justice was done to their merit   thus oft ive seen villars and maurice whose spirit   and conduct from courtiers met with censure severe   when they went to the opera receive laurels there         thus when richelieu victorious returned from mahon   which he bravely had taken as cursed envy must own   wherever he passed he received loud applause   not greater clairon from the crowded pit draws   before buskins were known in old æschylus time   ere melpomene trod the stage with steps sublime   to young lovers was granted a muchenvied prize   whoever inspired by his mistress bright eyes   in the year had done most and most tenderness shown   that man was before all the greeks crowned alone   the cause of her passion was by each fair one pleaded   her lovers claim she by her eloquence aided   having first made an oath to abstain from all art   nor like orators aim at misleading the heart   without exaggeration their cause to support   a hard task to women as to lawyers at court   still extant remains one of these fine debates   which took rise from the leisure of greeces free states   eudames being archon if my memory is right   three beauties appearing filled all greece with delight   ægle apamis and teone were their names   the wits of all greece ran in crowds to the games   though great talkers they then kept a silence profound   attentively listening as the stage they went round         in a golden cloud venus with young cupid descended   to all that the disputants uttered attended   first began youthful ægle who had graces and art   which charming eye and ear found a way to the heart   hermotimes my muchloved my muchhonored sire   throughout his whole life felt true genius fire   he attached himself always to those gifts of the mind   those elegant arts which have polished mankind   to science devoted from all honors he fled   and life unambitious with his family led   his daughter he would to no husband consign   but to one who like him felt the influence divine   who best knew to sing to the lyre and to paint   the few charms nature gave me which indeed are but faint   young lygdamon loved me natural genius alone   by art unassisted in him brightly shone   discreet and ingenuous both refined and polite   he neer spoke as a scholar but always spoke right   he no talents possessed yet could judge of each art   every grace his mind formed and soft love filled his heart   he knew to love only in that art he excelled   my heart soon to learn it from him was compelled   when my sire would have acted a tyrannical part   and have torn me from him who possessed my sad heart         and would with some painter have caused me to wed   some genius to music and poetry bred   how incessant the tears trickled from my sad eyes   despotic power oer us parents would exercise   since we owe life to them oer our lives they have power   like gods so for death i prepared in sad hour   confused and despairing wretched lygdamon fled   and sought some asylum where to shelter his head   my sire meant in six months to dispose of my hand   that delay was expected by the whole amorous band   no room had they then their sad talents to show   i was grown a mere picture of sorrow and woe   the moments swift flying increased my alarms   my loved lygdamon had retired from my arms   when my lovers should meet i expected my doom   to escape them i wished to sink into my tomb   twenty rivals productions were exposed to mens eyes   to a thousand debates their productions gave rise   i who had not seen any for none could decide   my father impatient would have made me the bride   of the proud harpagus whose works greatly were prized   to him i was going to be sacrificed   a slave then who seemed to arrive in posthaste   the work of a stranger full in their view placed   all present then fixed on the canvas their eyes   twas my picture so like that it caused much surprise         in the picture i seemed both to breathe and to speak   and sigh as my heart were just going to break   in my air in my eyes perfect love was expressed   art appeared not twas nature represented at best   on the canvas appeared by art wondrous and new   the soul and the body at once to the view   there deep shade was united with lights mildest gleams   as at morning we see the sun dart his bright beams   athwart our vast forests circled round with thick shades   and gild fruits and harvests green meadows and glades   to find fault was only harpagus desire   the rest all stood silent and were forced to admire   whos this cried out harpagus lost in amaze   that painting to such high perfection could raise   to whom at last shall i my daughter consign   lygdamon then appearing said shall she be mine   tis love thats the painter love alone on my breast   has this lively image of my ægle impressed   twas loves power on the canvas directed my hand   what art is not subject to that gods high command   tis his power alone that can all arts inspire   then to voice soft and tender attuning his lyre   of tones and notes various he made music so fine   all thought themselves seated at a concert divine   like apelles he painted and like orpheus he sung   with rage and with fury was harpagus stung   fire flashed from his eyes and his anger suppressed   his visage inflamed and boiled fierce in his breast         then seizing with frenzy a javelin he flew   in lygdamons blood his fell hands to imbrue   my lover to slay the barbarian intended   and over two lives dire destruction impended   lygdamon who perceived him was no way dismayed   but with the same hand that so skilfully played   which the hearts and the minds of his hearers had charmed   he raised his foe whom he had fought and disarmed   then sure to loves prize he may justly lay claim   permit me to grant the reward of his flame   thus spoke the fair ægle love applauds her discourse   and the theatre rang the greeks clapped with such force   to hear this applause drew a blush from the dame   and her passion for lygdamon fiercer became   then rose teone nor her speech nor her air   were formed by art or seemed studied with care   the greeks when she rose for a time seemed more gay   her adventure with smiles she began to display   in verse of less length and a different measure   which runs with great ease and is heard with much pleasure   twas in such the gay hamilton still chose to write   such nature has often been known to indite

chose him as my own for life   my heart was not his captive made   by outward charms which quickly fade   like paris he can strike the eye   in strength with famed achilles vie   one evening as i with my aunt   took on the ægean sea a jaunt   near one of those delightful isles   on which kind heaven forever smiles   a lydian vessel great of size   seized on our sloop as lawful prize   long had the corsair then grown gray   cruised near those isles in quest of prey   girls in the bloom of youth he sought   these to his governor he brought   he wanted one about my age   saw something in me to engage   he let my ancient aunt go free   and as men sparrows catch seized me   with haste then to his master goes   of his new booty to dispose   my good aunt then with clamorous cries   and bosom swollen with sorrow flies         to the pyreum there to tell   whomeer she met of what befell   how her teone was the prey   of a corsair that roved the sea   of one who dealt in female ware   and meant to sell me at some fair   think you was agaton content   with tears that happened to lament   on canvas with a brush to trace   the various features of my face   to tune his lyre his voice to

by in robes arrayed   and those who to a master bend   have seldom servants to attend   at night the amorous satrap came   to my bedside talked of his flame   his lust to gratify he thought   but one fine girl was to him brought   on seeing two with great surprise   i cant too many have he cries   your lovely friend i much admire   companys all that i desire   though two ill find means to content you   let no cursed jealousy torment you   when thus he had his mind expressed   he both his mistresses caressed   his word preparing to make good   to do as he had said he would   for agaton i was afraid   but my brave greek quite undismayed   upon the lustful satrap flew   seized on his hair his poniard drew   discovered that he was a man   and boldly thus to speak began   your doors this

sun to which we rarely pay a visit till he has run onehalf of his course we were informed a while ago that he looked bloody the whole morning that afterward without the air being any way obscured he by insensible  00 degrees was deprived both of his magnitude and his light this information we did not receive till five oclock in the evening we thereupon looked out at the window and we took the sun for the moon on account of his paleness we have no doubt you have seen the same phenomenon at paris on this occasion sir we address you as our master you know how to make those things pleasing which

they feel in their hearts   you remember my friend how my muse in weak lays   whilst yet i was young made some efforts for praise   you saw calumny vile all her snakes on her crest   the spring of my genius with malice infest   in a horrible dungeon unjustly confined   amidst my misfortunes with spirit resigned   from evil i learned to gather some good   and the strokes of adversity bravely withstood   with a constancy which i could never presage   from the levity common in so tender an age   why have i not since been as resolute found   at slighter attacks i have oft given ground   how often with tears love has made my eyes flow   false rogue as you are without doubt you must know   you who with an address which must needs be admired   the possession of what i love most have acquired         who seized on my mistress and was not content   to get her with ease and her lovers consent   but i loved you false friend notwithstanding your fault   i forgot and forgave as a good christian ought   ah why do i dwell on ideas long past   love once was my bliss but that bliss could not last   now a cruel disease undermines my whole frame   and it shortly perhaps will extinguish lifes flame   the fates have i doubt almost spun out my thread   and to all sense of pleasure my organs are dead   i feel with surprise that im void of desire   and my heart glows no longer with loves vivid fire   a chaos of thought quite perplexes my head   my present states bad and the future i dread   to increase my affliction my memorys employed   on ideas of bliss that cant now be enjoyed   but what still is worse i perceive it apace   that my mental endowments begin to decrease   the particle subtile of heavenly fire   before my corporeal frame does expire   and can this then be the emanation so bright   which flows from the great source of all mental light   which lives when our bodies are laid in the earth   with the organs of sense every mind has its birth   with them it grows up and with them feels decrease   and shall its existence like theirs at length cease   i know not but i have good hope it will brave   death the ruins of time and the jaws of the grave   and that an

you but as we are told that he bequeathed it entirely to you i was obliged to have recourse to magic of which you have frequently made mention   then searching all the castle round   soon as the darkest tower i found     0   i called upon gay chapelles sprite   from realms where reigns eternal night   to the infernal gods i made   no offering when i called the shade   like knaves who erst in

nature only could impart   which neer were faulty found by art   he said by love and wine alone   to me the power of verse was known   to witty chaulieu for a time   i taught the happy art to rhyme

and still less that you could believe what they say when they return from god knows where the epicurean philosophers to whose sect you say i belong have thank heaven enabled me to doubt of the reality of chapelles apparition and equally to distrust the insinuations of his shade of your politeness and of my own selflove which you have with great address endeavored to interest upon this occasion among many other good reasons which should induce you to distrust this apparition you have in yourself an essential one which should determine you to give it no sort of credit as it did me   do not believe a lying shade   who bids you learn the poets trade   from me so much below you   such progress you have in it made   that only phœbus heavenly aid   can now new light bestow you this is all i can say in answer to the prettiest letter that ever was written a letter whose flattery i should not listen to and whose brilliancy of imagination deters me from attempting to answer it in form as the answer would in all likelihood be unworthy of a pupil of chapelle to whom you might very possibly     show it as you have so great an intimacy with him forty years after his death but though i distrust my head i am always sure of my heart and in proof of the esteem and affection i have for you of which you ask me a token that cannot be called in question i shall with the sincerity which i

passages marked thus   are in the original written in a familiar kind of verse consisting of eight syllables which m voltaire is in most of his letters fond of intermingling with his prose the reader will easily perceive that however agreeable those rhymes might be to a french ear both the subject and style in the greater part of them are of such a nature as not to admit of poetical translation into english   voltaire was mistaken in this particular as no translation of his brutus was ever exhibited on the english stage   mr falkner and some other gentlemen of character were affronted at the theatre italienne at paris by some injurious reflections thrown out upon them in a contemptible farce exhibited there which was hissed by the audience   there is no expression in the english language which fully comprehends the meaning of the french word bienséance which notwithstanding unfortunately for a translator being a favorite phrase recurs in almost every page as does also the word naivete for which we have no terms in all respects corresponding to it   voltaire here alludes to the part of philoctetes in his oedipe   the literal translation of which is whatever dreadful havoc the plague may make here absence to those who truly love is much more dreadful there is a great deal of such nonsense in drydens and some other of our tragedies but it would not go down in the present age   the french expression is deux maîtres de la scene i e two masters of the scene corneille and racine the latter of whom voltaire takes every occasion of preferring to the former though he frequently censures both with great freedom and generally with equal justice   it is astonishing that it should ever enter into the head of a dramatic writer to put his comedies into rhyme but it is still more astonishing that the sensible and ingenious voltaire should adopt a custom so ridiculous confining his verses to five feet has certainly nothing but the novelty to recommend it they are even perhaps more faulty than if they had fifteen by the quicker return of the same sounds to our ear what pleasure a french author or a french audience might take in them we cannot pretend to determine but they are certainly very perplexing to a translator who finds it extremely difficult to reduce poetic language and highflown metaphors to easy and familiar dialogue without departing too much from the original the english reader will frequently i am afraid meet with a stiffness of style in this comedy which with all the pains i have taken it was impossible to avoid add to this that the names of fierenfat lise martha etc sound but uncouthly to us and to change them was a liberty which i thought a translator had no right to take         un malheureux visage   qui dun chevalier romain captiva

et dun style plaintif   dans son champ de victoire il se dit son captif     joserois bien jurer que vos charmans appas   se vantent dun pouvoir dont ils nuseront pas i have here given the original of these few short quotations that the reader may see the full force both of the absurdity and of m voltaires ridicule of it   what reasons m voltaire might have for not acknowledging himself the author of socrates on its first publication we cannot determine those amongst our readers however who have any acquaintance with the english stage will easily perceive that the whole story in the preface about addison thomson and lord lyttleton is nothing but pure fiction designed to conceal the real author of this motley performance   m voltaire either forgot or did not know that coriolanus was mr thomsons last tragedy and was played after his death for the benefit of his relatives   cardinal fleury   the true state of the case was that abbé desfontaines and some others as malicious as himself decried the tragedy of mahomet as a wicked and scandalous performance the affair made so much noise that the prime minister cardinal fleury who had long before read and approved of it was obliged to advise the author to withdraw it   what the editor foresaw in      did actually come to pass in      when this tragedy was presented with universal applause cabal and persecution gave way to the voice of the public and perhaps the more readily as many by this time began to feel some remorse at having forced a man to quit his country who had labored so successfully for the honor of it   m martelli who wrote several tragedies in italian he made use of a new species of rhymes in the manner of alexandrines a novelty which was by no means favorable to his performances  the great earthquake occurred on november        the ruin was instantaneous between  0000 and  0000 lives were lost in the shock and in the fire  the universal chain is not as some have thought a regular gradation which connects all beings there is in all probability an immense distance between man and beast as well as between man and substances of a superior nature there is likewise an infinity between god and all created beings whatever there are none of these insensible gradations in the globes which move round our sun in their several periods whether we consider their mass their distances or their satellites if we may believe pope man is not capable of discovering the reason why the satellites of jove are less than jove himself he is herein mistaken such an error as this may well be overlooked in so fine a genius every smatterer in mathematics could have told lord bolingbroke and mr pope that if the satellites of jove had equalled him in magnitude they could not have moved round him but no mathematician is able to discover the regular gradation in the bodies of the solar system it is not true that the world could not exist if a single atom was taken from it this was justly observed by mr crousaz a learned geometrician in a tract which he wrote against pope he seems to have been right in this point though he was fully refuted by mr warburton and mr silhouette the concatenation of events was admitted and defended with the utmost ingenuity by the celebrated philosopher leibnitz it is worth explaining all bodies and all events depend upon other bodies and other events that cannot be denied but all bodies are not essential to the support of the universe and the preservation of its order neither are all events necessary in the general series of events a drop of water a grain of sand more or less can cause no revolution in the general system nature is not confined to any determinate quantity or any determinate form no planet moves in a curve completely regular there is nothing in nature of a figure exactly mathematical no fixed quantity is required for any operation nature is never very strict or rigid in her method of proceeding it is therefore absurd to advance that the removal of an atom from the earth might be the cause of its destruction this holds in like manner with regard to events the cause of every event is contained in some precedent event this no philosopher has ever called in question if cæsars mother had never gone through the cæsarian operation cæsar had never subverted the commonwealth he could never have adopted octavius and octavius could never have chosen tiberius for his successor in the empire the marriage of maximilian with the heiress of burgundy and the low countries gave rise to a war which lasted two hundred years but cæsars spitting on the right or left side or the duchess of burgundys dressing her head in this manner or in that could have altered nothing in the general plan of providence it follows therefore that there are some events which have consequences and others which have none their chain resembles a genealogical tree some branches of which disappear at the first generation whilst the race is continued by others there are many events which pass away without ever generating others thus in every machine there are some effects indispensably necessary towards producing motion and others which are productive of nothing at all the wheels of a coach make it go but whether they raise more or less dust the journey is finished alike such is the general order of the world that the links of the chain would not be in the least discomposed by a small increase or diminution of the quantity of matter or by an inconsiderable deviation from regularity the chain is not in an absolute plenum it has been demonstrated that the celestial bodies perform their revolutions in an unresisting medium every space is not filled it follows then that there is not a progression of bodies from an atom to the most remote fixed star there may of consequence be immense intervals between beings imbued with sensation as well as between those that are not we cannot then be certain that man must be placed in one of these links joined to another by an uninterrupted connection that all things are linked together means only that all things are regularly disposed of in their proper order god is the cause and the regulator of that order homers jupiter was the slave of destiny but according to more rational philosophy god is the master of destiny see clarkes treatise upon the existence of god  sub deo justo nemo miser nisi mereatur—st augustine the meaning of this ipse dixit of the saint is no one is miserable under the government of a just god without deserving to be so  it is selfevident that man cannot acquire this knowledge without assistance the human mind derives all its knowledge from experience no experience can give us an insight into what preceded our existence into what is to follow it nor into what supports it at present in what manner have we received life what is the spring upon which it depends how is our brain capable of ideas and memory in what manner do our limbs obey every motion of the will of all this we are entirely ignorant is our globe the only one that is inhabited was it created after other globes or at the same instant does every particular species of plants proceed from a first plant is every species of animals produced by two first animals the most profound philosophers are no more able to solve these questions than the most ignorant of men all these questions may be reduced to the vulgar proverb was the hen before the egg or the egg before the hen the proverb is rather low but it confounds the utmost penetration of human wisdom which is utterly at a loss with regard to the first principles of things without supernatural assistance  as god is an infinite being his nature must of consequence be unknown to all men as this is a philosophical work it was judged necessary to cite the opinions of philosophers all the ancients without exception looked on matter as eternal this is almost the only point on which they agreed  confucius should not be confounded with these he confined himself to natural religion and discovered everything that could be discovered without the light of revelation  when this poem was written the author could not foresee that flames were to destroy a great part of that unhappy city in which fagots were too often kindled  we are not by the word church in this place to understand the catholic church nothing is here alluded to but the abominable fanaticism of some ecclesiastics detested by the church in all ages  jean baptist rousseau in exile became embittered against voltaire who had said of the formers ode to posterity that it was not likely to reach its destination he circulated several unflattering criticisms on voltaires recent productions including zaïre the tragedy which placed

leibnitz was born at leipsic on the   d of june      and died at hanover on the   th of november      he was the greatest ornament to learning that germany ever produced he was a more universal genius than newton though perhaps not so great a mathematician to a profound knowledge in every branch of natural philosophy he added a refined taste for polite learning he even wrote french poetry he owed his fortune entirely to his reputation he enjoyed considerable pensions from the emperor of germany the emperor of russia the king of england and many other sovereigns  she was buried on a bank of the
