the life of the lady jane gray with some remarks on the play in a letter to a friend by william rufus chetwood  dublin printed for g risk bookseller at the london in damesstreet over against the horseguard where new plays and novels are to be sold and the tragedy of jane gray       the life of the lady jane gray etc sir you desired me to send you the life of the lady jane gray i do assure you my friend and hope to be believed that i spent a whole day in the search and to as little purpose as he that carried a lighted torch at noonday to look for an honest man but however you shall not altogether lose your longing for you may if you please read this following account collected out of the best and most exactest historians  this incomparable lady was eldest daughter to henry lord gray duke of suffolk she was born in the year      she was endowed with all the graces both of mind and body she gave in her earliest infancy many proofs of her growing piety and her veneration for holy writ for once being diverting herself with her companions one had an occasion to have something that was above her reach and taking a large bible to tread on to get it the young lady seeing her would not suffer her and expressed her resentment she was so taken with it that she broke off their sport and retired to her closet more than ordinary melancholy  she was a lady indeed that seemed cut out by heaven for greatness as she was a beautiful and a graceful person so she was endowed with all those virtues that are esteemed by heaven and all good men as is expressed in the tragedy of her by the poet  candor with goodness fortitude with sweetness strict piety and love of truth with learning more than the schools of athens ever knew or her own plato taught  when she came to years of more solid understanding dr elmer afterward bishop of london was her tutor and from him she learned latin and greek to a perfection and would discourse in those language upon any subject and would give her sentiments to admiration nay she delighted in such conferences for when others of her sex and age were taking their diversion abroad she employed her time in reading the lady elizabeths tutor roger ascham coming once to wait on her at her fathers house in the country was surpised to find her alone reading of platos works in greek while the rest of the family were diverting themselves with hunting in her fathers park and other rural diversions he asked her how she could lose the share of such diversion she answered those were but faint shadows of what she enjoyed in contemplation there  pointing to platos phoedon that lay before her and added she i esteem it one of the greatest blessings of my life that i have had severe parents and a milder master which have made me delight with those companions which were not like mankind for when i find my self weary i can lay by their company without commiting a soliecism against good manners  the young king was ever fond of her company and as their ages were much the same so was their fancies and desires as the poet has it  from their first early days of infant life a gentle band of friendship grew betwixt em as brother and as sister bred together beneath one common parents care they lived in every innocent delight they shared they sung and danced and sat and walked together she left the shining courts to share his toil to turn with him the grave historians page and taste the rapture of the poets song she was well read in sacred as well as profane history and had attained to a large knowledge in divinity and at the age when others were but tasting the notions of philosophy she had capacity enough to make a full feast and with all these advantages of birth and parts she was so humble so meek and pious that all people both admired and loved her she had a mind wonderfully raised above the world and the pleasures of it she called vanities  lord guilford son to the aspiring duke of northumberland by his fathers politic means was married to her on the third of june      and as well as i can make out in the twentieth year of her age she expressed all the sorrow imaginable at the kings death and in his sickness gave him most constant attendance which is finely expressed in the poets lines by northumberland on the occasion  all desolate and drowned in flowing tears by edwards bed the pious princes sits fast from her lifted eyes the pearly drops fall trickling over her cheek while strong devotion and fervent zeal pour forth her laboring soul and every sigh is winged with prayers so potent as strive with heaven to save her dying lord when her father the duke of northumberland with the rest of the privy council came to attend and hail her queen she expressed a great deal of reluctance and was rather forced to take it out of an obedience to her parents than any desire of her own she said the crown by right of inheritance was to descend to the sisters of the late king and that she was unwilling to burden her conscience to enrich herself with the spoils of others at last for the safety of the people and the maintaining and preserving the reformation she was won upon to accept the crown the author of the tragedy of lady jane has expressed her unwillingness in this manner  take me crown me invest me with this royal wretchedness let me not know one happy minute more let all my sleepless nights be spent in care my days be vexed with tumults and alarms if only i can save you if my fate has marked me out to be the public victim i take the lot with joy  yes i will die for that eternal truth my faith is fixed on and that dear native land which gave me birth all that i ask is though my fortune frown and bury me beneath this fatal crown let this one good be added to my doom to save this land from tyranny and rome she was neither lifted up when she wore the crown nor cast down when her palace became her prison but carried herself in an even temper of mind in those great inequalities of fortune that so suddenly exalted and depressed her all the passion she expressed was that her father mother and husband were involved in her ill fortune when she had notice that her sentence of death was past she did not express the least concern but bore it with a constancy of mind beyond thought the queen sent dr fecknam three days before to prepare her for death he had a long conversation with her and answered to all his questions with that calmness of mind and clearness of reason that it was a wonder to hear how so young a person of her sex could look on death so nigh her with so little concern she sent a letter to her father to mitigate his sorrow for her unhappy end she rejoiced at aproaching death and thought the nigher it appeared it looked less dreadful she expressed a great deal of tenderness when she saw her husband led out first to execution he had desired to take leave of her before he died but she declined it since she said it would rather be an addition to her grief and she hoped to meet shortly and be united in a much happier state she saw her husbands headless trunk carried by her without any outward concern or womans wailings and consold herself in knowing she should soon follow him when she was brought to the scaffold which for fear of the people was built within the tower she confessed she had sinned in taking the crown when it was proffered her but she took it to a good end she declared she die d a true christian in the reformed faith but hoped to be saved only through the merits and sufferings of her blessed lord and and savior jesus christ then having desired the peoples prayers she repeated the   st psam when after some private devotion she undressed herself put her hankerchief herself upon her eyes then laying her head upon the fatal block she resigned her breath to him who gave it her  thus fell this great this good and pious lady which seemed by virtue to be formed for greatness which may be as an example to the world of the mutability of fortune and i think our poet has been very exact in his characters in following the truth of history nothing can describe the haughty ambitious northumberland better than himself in the following lines where he seems to have laid the scheme of his designs even before the kings death  she must be here and lodged in guilfords arms ere edward dies or all we have done is marred ha pembroke that is a bar that thwarts my way his fiery temper brooks not opposition and must be met with soft and subtle arts with crouching courtesy and honyd words such as assuage the fierce and bend the strong see bakers chronicle in giving an account of northumberland marching with his troops out of london the   th of july he marched through shoreditch with  000 horse and  000 foot and though there were many spectators in the streets as he passed none wished him success now judge how high the poet comes where he makes pembroke a spectator  i saw him marching at his armys head i marked him issuing through the city gates and for he wore his beaver up could read upon his visage horror and dismay no voice of friendly salutation cheered him none wished his arms might thrive or bad heaven speed him but through a staring ghastly looking crowd unhaild unblest with heavy heart he went the duke of northumberland went back to cambridge to wait for more succors from london but hearing how matters were carried he dismissed his troops and went to the marketplace only accompanied with the mayor and himself for want of a herald flung up his cap for joy and cried god save queen mary but the earl of arundel came with orders from the queen to apprehend him as one guilty of treason and brought him from cambridge to the tower on the   th of july and on the   d of august      was beheaded this passage is described by the duke of suffolk to his daughter the lady jane  with some sew followers he arrived at cambridge but there even they forsook him and himself was forced with heavy heart and watery eye to cast his cap up with dissembled cheer and cry god save queen mary but alas little availed the semblance of that loyalty for soon thereafter by the earl of arundel with treason was he charged and there arrested and now they bring him prisoner up to london i must confess in my judgment there is a great many fine thoughts in this play but i leave em to yours only i must beg leave to point you out one and so conclude for i reckon by this time youre as tired with reading as i with writing  it is in the conclusion of the  th act where guilford is bewailing the loss of each other in death but she endeavors to comfort him by telling him they shall meet again  behold the universal works of nature where life still springs from death to us the sun dies every night and every morn revives the flowers which winters icy head destroyed lift their fair heads and live again in spring mark with what hopes upon the furrowed plain the careful ploughman casts the pregnant grain there hid as in a grave a while it lies till the revolving season bids it rise till natures genial powers command a birth and potent call it from the teeming earth then large increase the buried treasures yield and with full harvest crown the plenteous field i shall trouble you no farther and i shall think my pains amply required if this succinct but true account can give any satisfaction to the entire friend of  sir your humble servant w r c  finis
