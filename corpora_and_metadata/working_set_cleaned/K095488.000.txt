new beauty blooms a beauty formed to fly new love begins a love produced to dye new parts distress the troubled scenes of life the fondling mistress and the ruling wife men born to labor all with pains provide women have time to sacrifice to pride they want the care of man their want they know and dress to please with heartalluring show the show prevailing for the sway contend and make a servant where they meet a friend thus in a thousand waxerected forts a loitering race the painful be supports from sun to sun from bank to bank he flies with honey loads his bag with wax his thighs fly where he will at home the race remain prune the silk dress and murmuring eat the gain yet here and there we grant a gentle bride whose temper betters by the fathers side unlike the rest that double human care fond to relieve or resolute to share happy the man whom thus his stars advance the curse is general but the blessing chance thus sung the sisters while the gods admire their beauteous creature made for man in ire the young pandora she whom all contend to make too perfect not to gain her end then bid the winds that fly to breathe the spring return to bear her on a gentle wing with wafting airs the winds obsequious blow and land the shining vengeance safe below a golden coffer in her hand she bore the present treacherous but the bearer more twas fraught with pangs for jove ordained above that gold should aid and pangs attend on love her gay descent the man perceived afar wondering he run to catch the falling star but so surpised as none but he can tell who loved so quickly and who loved so well over all his veins the wandering passion burns he calls her nymph and every nymph by turns her form to lovely venus he prefers or swears that venus must be such as hers she proud to rule yet strangely framed to teize neglects his offers while her airs she plays shoots scornful glances from the bended frown in brisk disorder trips it up and down then hums a careless tune to lay the storm and sits and blushes smiles and yields in form now take what jove designed she softly cried this box thy portion and myself thy bride fired with the prospect of the double charms he snatched the box and bride with eager arms unhappy man to whom so bright she shone the fatal gift her tempting self unknown the winds were silent all the waves asleep and heaven was traced upon the flattering deep but whilst he looks unmindful of a storm and thinks the water wears a stable form what dreadful din around his ears shall rise what frowns confuse his picture of the skies at first the creature man was framed alone lord of himself and all the world his own for him the nymphs in green forsook the woods for him the nymphs in blue forsook the floods in vain the satyrs rage the tritons rave they bore him heroes in the secret cave no care destroyed no sick disorder preyed no bending age his sprightly form decayed no wars were known no females heard to rage and poets tell us twas a golden age when woman came those ills the box confined burst furious out and poisoned all the wind from point to point from pole to pole they flew spread as they went and in the progress grew the nymphs regretting left the mortal race and altring nature wore a sickly face new terms of folly rose new states of care new plagues to suffer and to please the fair the days of whining and of wild intrigues commenced or finished with the breach of leagues the mean designs of welldissembled love the sordid matches never joined above abroad the labor and at home the noise mans double sufferings for domestic joys the curse of jealousy expense and strife divorce the public brand of shameful life the rivals sword the qualm that takes the fair disdain for passion passion in despair  these and a thousand yet unnamd we find ah fear the thousand yet unnamd behind thus on parnassus tuneful hesiod sung the mountain echoed and the valley rung the sacred groves a fixed attention show the crystal helicon forbore to flow the sky grew bright and if his verse be true the muses came to give the laurel too but what availed the verdant prize of wit if love swore vengeance for the tales he writ ye fair offended hear your friend relate what heavy judgment proved the writers fate though when it happened no relation clears it is thought in five or five and twenty years where dark and silent with a twisted shade the neighboring woods a native arbor made there often a tender pair for amorous play retiring toyd the ravished hours away a locrian youth the gentle troilus he a fair milesian kind evanthe she but swelling nature in a fatal hour betrayed the secrets of the conscious bower the dire disgrace her brothers count their own and track her steps to make its author known it chanced one evening it was the lovers day concealed in brakes the jealous kindred lay when hesiod wandering mused along the plain and fixed his seat where love had fixed the scene a strong suspicion strait possessed their mind for poets ever were a gentle kind but when evanthe near the passage stood flung back a doubtful look and shot the wood now take at once they cry thy due reward and urged with erring rage assault the bard his corpse the sea received the dolphins bore it was all the gods would do the corpse to shore methinks i view the dead with pitying eyes and see the dreams of ancient wisdom rise i see the muses round the body cry but hear a cupid loudly laughing by he wheels his arrow with insulting hand and thus inscribes the moral on the sand here hesiod lies ye future bards beware how far your moral tales incense the fair unlovd unloving twas his fate to bleed without his quiver cupid caused the deed he judged this turn of malice justly due and hesiod died for joys he never knew song when thy beauty appears in its graces and airs all bright as an angel new dropped from the sky at distance i gaze and am awed by my fears so strangely you dazzle my eye but when without art your kind thoughts you impart when your love runs in blushes through every vein when it darts from your eyes when it pants in your heart then i know youre a woman again there is a passion and pride in our sex she replied and thus might i gratify both i would do still an angel appear to each lover beside but still be a woman to you a song thyrsis a young and amorous swain saw two the beauties of the plain who both his heart subdue gay caelias eyes were dazzling fair sabinas easy shape and air with softer magic drew he haunts the stream he haunts the grove lives in a fond romance of love and seems for each to die till each a little spiteful grown sabina caelias shape ran down and she sabinas eye their envy made the shepherd find those eyes which love could only blind so set the lover free no more he haunts the grove or stream or with a truelove knot and name engraves a wounded tree ah caelia sly sabina cried though neither love we are both denied now to support the sexs pride let either fix the dart poor girl says caelia say no more for should the swain but one adore that spite which broke his chains before would break the others heart song my days have been so wondrous free the little birds that fly with careless ease from tree to tree were but as blessed as i ask gliding waters if a tear of mine increased their stream or ask the flying gales if ever i lent one sigh to them but now my former days retire and i am by beauty caught the tender chains of sweet desire are fixed upon my thought ye nightingales ye twisting pines ye swains that haunt the grove ye gentle echoes breezy winds ye close retreats of love with all of nature all of art assist the dear design o teach a young unpracticed heart to make my nancy mine the very thought of change i hate as much as of despair nor ever covet to be great unless it be for her it is true the passion in my mind is mixed with soft distress yet while the fair i love is kind i cannot wish it less anacreontic when spring came on with fresh delight to cheer the soul and charm the sight while easy breezes softer rain and warmer suns salute the plain twas then in yonder piny grove that nature went to meet with love green was her robe and green her wreath wherever she trod twas green beneath wherever she turned the pulses beat with new recruits of genial heat and in her train the birds appear to match for all the coming year raised on a bank where daizys grew and vilets intermixed a blue she finds the boy she went to find a thousand pleasures wait behind aside a thousand arrows ly but all unfeatherd wait to fly when they met the dame and boy dancing graces idle joy wanton smiles and airy play conspired to make the scene be gay love paired the birds through all the grove and nature bid them sing to love sitting hopping fluttering sing and pay their tribute from the wing to fledge the shafts that idly ly and yet unfeatherd wait to fly it is thus when spring renews the blood they meet in every trembling wood and thrice they make the plumes agree and every dart they mount with three and every dart can boast a kind which suits each proper turn of mind from the towering eagles plume the generous hearts accept their doom shot by the peacocks painted eye the vain and airy lovers dye for careful dames and frugal men the shafts are speckled by the hen the pyes and parrots deck the darts when prattling wins the panting hearts when from the voice the passions spring the warbling finch affords a wing together by the sparrow stung down fall the wanton and the young and fledged by geese the weapons fly when others love they know not why all this as late i chanced to rove i learned in yonder waving grove and see says love who called me near how much i deal with nature here how both support a proper part she gives the feather i the dart then cease for souls averse to sigh if nature cross ye so do i my weapon there unfeatherd flies and shakes and shuffles through the skies but if the mutual charms i find by which she links you mind to mind they wing my shafts i poize the darts and strike from both through both your hearts anacreontic gay bacchus liking estcourts wine a noble meal bespoke us and for the guests that were to dine brought comus love and jocus the god near cupid drew his chair near comus jocus placed for wine makes love forget its care and mirth exalts a feast the more to please the sprightly god each sweet engaging grace put on some clothes to come abroad and took a waiters place then cupid named at every glass a lady of the sky while bacchus swore he would drink the lass and had it bumperhigh fat comus tossed his brimmers over and always got the most jocus took care to fill him more wheneer he missed the toast they called and drank at every touch he filled and drank again and if the gods can take too much it is said they did so then gay bacchus little cupid stung by reckoning his deceits and cupid mocked his stammring tongue with all his staggring gaits and jocus drolld on comus ways and tales without a jest while comus called his witty plays but waggeries at best such talk soon set em all at odds and had i homers pen i would sing ye how they drunk like gods and how they fought like men to part the fray the graces fly who make em soon agree nay had the furies selves been nigh they still were three to three bacchus appeased raised cupid up and gave him back his bow but kept some darts to stir the cup where sack and sugar flow jocus took comus rosy crown and gayly wore the prize and thrice in mirth he pushed him down as thrice he strove to rise then cupid sought the myrtle grove where venus did recline and venus close embracing love they joined to rail at wine and comus loudly cursing wit rolled off to some retreat where boon companions gravely sit in fat unweildy state bacchus and jocus still behind for one fresh glass prepare they kiss and are exceeding kind and vow to be sincere but part in time whoever hear this our instructive song for though such friendships may be dear they cannot continue long a fairy tale in the ancient english style in britains isle and arthurs days when midnight faeries dauncd the maze lived edwin of the green edwin i wis a gentle youth endowed with courage sense and truth though badly shaped he been his mountain back mote well be said to measure height against his head and lift itself above yet spite of all that nature did to make his uncouth form forbid this creature dared to love he felt the charms of ediths eyes nor wanted hope to gain the prize could ladies look within but one sir topaz dressed with art and if a shape could win a heart he had a shape to win edwin if right i read my song with slighted passion paced along all in the moony light twas near an old enchaunted court where sportive faeries made resort to revel out the night his heart was drear his hope was crossed twas late twas far the path was lost that reached the neighbortown with weary steps he quits the shades resolved the darkling dome he treads and drops his limbs adown but scant he lays him on the floor when hollow winds remove the door a trembling rocks the ground and well i ween to count aright at once an hundred tapers light on all the walls around now sounding tongues assail his ear now sounding feet approachen near and now the sounds increase and from the corner where he lay he sees a train profusely gay come pranckling over the place but trust me gentles never yet was dight a masquing half so neat or half so rich before the country lent the sweet perfumes the sea the pearl the sky the plumes the town its silken store now whilst he gazed a gallant dressed in flaunting robes above the rest with awful accent cried what mortal of a wretched mind whose sighs infect the balmy wind has here presumed to hide at this the swain whose venurous soul no fears of magic art control advanced in open sight nor have i cause of dreed he said who view by no presumption led your revels of the night twas grief for scorn of faithful love which made my steps unweeting rove amid the nightly dew it is well the gallant cries again we faeries never injure men who dare to tell us true exalt thy lovedejected heart be mine the task or ere we part to make thee grief resign now take the pleasure of thy chance whilst i with mab my partner dance be little mable thine he spoke and all a sudden there light music floats in wanton air the monarch leads the queen the rest their faerie partners found and mable trimly tript the ground with edwin of the green the dancing past the board was laid and siker such a feast was made as heart and lip desire withouten hands the dishes fly the glasses with a wish come nigh and with a wish retire but now to please the faerie king full every deal they laugh and sing and antic feats devise some wind and tumble like an ape and othersome transmute their shape in edwins wondering eyes till one at last that robin hight renowned for pinching maids by night has hent him up aloof and full against the beam he flung where by the back the youth he hung to spraul unneath the roof from thence reverse my charm he cries and let it fairly now suffice the gambol has been shown but oberon answers with a smile content thee edwin for a while the vantage is thine own here ended all the phantome play they smelt the fresh approach of day and heard a cock to crow the whirling wind that bore the crowd has clapped the door and whistled loud to warn them all to go then screaming all at once they fly and all at once the tapers die poor edwin falls to floor forlorn his state and dark the place was never wight in sike a case through all the land before but soon as dan apollo rose full jolly creature home he goes he feels his back the less his honest tongue and steady mind han rid him of the lump behind which made him want success with lusty livelyhed he talks he seems a dancing as he walks his story soon took wind and beauteous edith sees the youth endowed with courage sense and truth without a bunch behind the story told sir topaz moved the youth of edith erst approved to see the revel scene at close of eve he leaves his home and wends to find the ruined dome all on the gloomy plain as there he bides it so befell the wind came rustling down a dell a shaking seized the wall up spring the tapers as before the faeries bragly foot the floor and music fills the hall but certes sorely sunk with woe sir topaz sees the elphin show his spirits in him die when oberon cries a man is near a mortal passion cleeped fear hangs flagging in the sky with that sir topaz hapless youth in accents faultring ay for ruth entreats them pity grant for als he been a mister wight betrayed by wandering in the night to tread the circled haunt ah losell vile at once they roar and little skilled of faerie lore thy cause to come we know now has thy kestrell courage fell and faeries since a ly you tell are free to work thee woe then will who bears the wispy fire to trail the swains among the mire the caitive upward flung there like a tortoise in a shop he dangled from the chambertop where whilome edwin hung the revel now proceeds apace deffly they frisk it over the place they sit they drink and eat the time with frolic mirth beguile and poor sir topaz hangs the while till all the rout retreat by this the stars began to wink they skriek they fly the tapers sink and down ydrops the knight for never spell by faerie laid with strong enchantment bound a glade beyond the length of night chill dark alone adreed he lay till up the welkin rose the day then deemed the dole was over but wot ye well his harder lot his seely back the bunch has got which edwin lost before this tale a sybilnurse ared she softly strokd my youngling head and when the tale was done thus some are born my son she cries with base impediments to rise and some are born with none but virtue can itself advance to what the favorite fools of chance by

sacred fire ye tuneful nine ye sweet celestial quire from helicons imbowring height repair attend my labors and reward my prayer the dreadful toils of raging mars i write the springs of contest and the fields of fight how threatening mice advanced with warlike grace and waged dire combats with the croaking race not louder tumults shook olympus towers when earthborn giants dared immortal powers those equal acts in equal glory claim and thus the muse records the tale of fame once on a time fatigued and out of breath and just escaped the stretching claws of death a gentle mouse whom cats pursued in vain fled swiftoffoot across the neighboring plain hung over a brink his eager thirst to cool and dipped his whiskers in the standing pool when near a courteous frog advanced his head and from the waters hoarseresounding said what art thou stranger what the line you boast what chance has cast thee panting on our coast with strictest truth let all thy words agree nor let me find a faithless mouse in thee if worthy friendship proffered friendship take and entering view the pleasurable lake range over my palace in my bounty share and glad return from hospitable fare this silver realm extends beneath my sway and me their monarch all its frogs obey great physignathus i from peleus race begot in fair hydromedes embrace where by the nuptial bank that paints his side the swift eridanus delights to glide thee too thy form thy strength and port proclaim a sceptered king a son of martial fame then trace thy line and aid my guessing eyes thus ceased the frog and thus the mouse replies known to the gods the men the birds that fly through wild expanses of the midway sky my name resounds and if unknown to thee the soul of great psycarpax lives in me of brave troxartas line whose sleeky down in love compressed lychomile the brown my mother she and princess of the plains wherever her father pternotroctas reigns born where a cabin lifts its airy shed with figs with nuts with varied dainties fed but since our natures naught in common know from what foundation can a friendship grow these curling waters over thy palace roll but mans high food supports my princely soul in vain the circled loaves attempt to lie concealed in flaskets from my curious eye in vain the tripe that boasts the whitest hue in vain the gilded bacon shuns my view in vain the cheeses offspring of the paile or honeyd cakes which gods themselves regale and as in arts i shine in arms i fight mixed with the bravest and unknown to flight though large to mine the human form appear not man himself can smite my soul with fear sly to the bed with silent steps i go attempt his finger or attack his toe and six indented wounds with dextrous skill sleeping he feels and only seems to feel yet have we foes which direful dangers cause grim owls with talons armed and cats with claws and that false trap the den of silent fate where death his ambush plants around the bait alldreaded these and dreadful over the rest the potent warriors of the tabby vest if to the dark we fly the dark they trace and rend our heroes of the nibbling race but me nor stalks nor watrish herbs delight nor can the crimson radish charm my sight the lakeresounding frogs selected fare which not a mouse of any taste can bear as thus the downy prince his mind expressed his answer thus the croaking king addressed thy words luxuriant on thy dainties rove and stranger we can boast of bounteous jove we sport in water or we dance on land and born amphibious food from both command but trust thyself where wonders ask thy view and safely tempt those seas i will bear thee through ascend my shoulders firmly keep thy seat and reach my marshy court and feast in state he said and bent his back with nimble bound leaps the light mouse and clasps his arms around then wondering floats and sees with glad survey the winding banks resembling ports at sea but when aloft the curling water rides and wets with azure wave his downy sides his thoughts grow conscious of approaching woe his idle tears with vain repentance flow his locks he rends his trembling feet he rears thick beats his heart with unaccustomed fears his sighs and chilled with danger longs for shore his tail extended forms a fruitless oar halfdrenchd in liquid death his prayers he spoke and thus bemoaned him from the dreadful lake so passed europa through the rapid sea trembling and fainting all the venurous way with oary feet the bull triumphant rode and safe in crete deposed his lovely load ah safe at last may thus the frog support my trembling limbs to reach his ample court as thus he sorrows death ambiguous grows lo from the deep a waterhydra rose he rolls his sanguind eyes his bosom heaves and darts with active rage along the waves confused the monarch sees his hissing foe and dives to shun the sable fates below forgetful frog the friend thy shoulders bore unskilled in swimming floats remote from shore he grasps with fruitless hands to find relief supinely falls and grinds his teeth with grief plunging he sinks and struggling mounts again and sinks and strives but strives with fate in vain the weighty moisture clogs his hairy vest and thus the prince his dying rage expressed nor thou that flingst me floundring from thy back as from hard rocks rebounds the shattring wrack nor thou shall scape thy due perfidious king pursued by vengeance on the swiftest wing at land thy strength could never equal mine at sea to conquer and by craft was thine but heaven has gods and gods have searching eyes ye mice ye mice my great avengers rise this said he sighing gaspd and gasping died his death the young lychopinax espied as on the flowery brink he passed the day baskd in the beams and loiterd life away loud shrieks the mouse his shrieks the shores repeat the nibbling nation learn their heros fate grief dismal grief ensues deep murmurs sound and shriller fury fills the deafend ground from lodge to lodge the sacred heralds run to fix their council with the rising sun where great troxartas crowned in glory reigns and winds his lengthening court beneath the plains psycarpax father father now no more for poor psycarpax lies remote from shore supine he lies the silent waters stand and no kind billow wafts the dead to land book ii when rosysingerd morn had tinged the clouds around their monarchmouse the nation crowds slow rose the sovereign heaved his anxious breast and thus the council filled with rage addressed for lost psycarpax much my soul endures it is mine the private grief the public yours three warlike sons adorned my nuptial bed three sons alas before their father dead our eldest perished by the ravning cat as near my court the prince unheedful sat our next an engine fraught with danger drew the portal gaped the bait was hung in view dire arts assist the trap the fates decoy and men unpitying killed my gallant boy the last his countrys hope his parents pride plunged in the lake by physignathus died rouse all the war my friends avenge the deed and bleed that monarch and his nation bleed his words in every breast inspired alarms and careful mars supplied their host with arms in verdant hulls despoiled of all their beans the buskined warriors stalked along the plains quills aptly bound their bracing corselet made faced with the plunder of a cat they flayed the lamps round boss affords their ample shield large shells of nuts their covering helmet yield and over the region with reflected rays tall groves of needles for their lances blaze dreadful in arms the marching mice appear the wondering frogs perceive the tumult near forsake the waters thickning form a ring and ask and hearken whence the noises spring when near the crowd disclosed to public view the valiant chief embasichytros drew the sacred heralds scepter graced his hand and thus his words expressed his kings command ye frogs the mice with vengeance fired advance and decked in armor shake the shining lance their hapless prince by physignathus slain extends incumbent on the watery plain then arm your host the doubtful battle try lead forth those frogs that have the soul to die the chief retires the crowd the challenge hear and proudlyswelling yet perplexed appear much they resent yet much their monarch blame who rising spoke to clear his tainted fame o friends i never forced the mouse to death nor saw the gaspings of his latest breath he vain of youth our art of swimming tried and venurous in the lake the wanton died to vengeance now by false appearance led they point their anger at my guiltless head but wage the rising war by deep device and turn its fury on the crafty mice your king directs the way my thoughts elate with hopes of conquest form designs of fate where high the banks their verdant surface heave and the steep sides confine the sleeping wave there near the margin clad in armor bright sustain the first impetuous shocks of fight then where the dancing feather joins the crest let each brave frog his obvious mouse arrest each strongly grasping headlong plunge a foe till countless circles whirl the lake below down sink the mice in yielding waters drowned loud flash the waters and the shores resound the frogs triumphant tread the conquered plain and raise their glorious trophies of the slain he spoke no more his prudent scheme imparts redoubling ardour to the boldest hearts green was the suit his arming heroes chose around their legs the greaves of mallows close green were the beets about their shoulders laid and green the colewort which the target made formed of the varied shells the waters yield their glossy helmets glistned over the field and tapring seareeds for the polished spear with upright order pierced the ambient air thus dressed for war they take the appointed height poize the long arms and urge the promised fight but now where joves irradiate spires arise with stars surrounded in aetherial skies a solemn council called the brazen gates unbar the gods assume their golden seats the sire superior leans and points to show what wondrous combats mortals wage below how strong how large the numerous heroes stride what length of lance they shake with warlike pride what eager fire their rapid march reveals so the fierce centaurs ravaged over the dales and so confirmed the daring titans rose heaped hills on hills and bid the gods be foes this seen the power his sacred visage rears he casts a pitying smile on worldly cares and asks what heavenly guardians take the list or who the mice or who the frogs assist then thus to pallas if my daughters mind have joined the mice why stays she still behind drawn forth by savry steams they wind their way and sure attendance round thine altar pay where while the victims gratify their taste they sport to please the goddess of the feast thus spoke the ruler of the spacious skies but thus resolved the blueeyd maid replies in vain my father all their dangers plead to such thy pallas never grants her aid my flowery wreaths they petulantly spoil and rob my crystal lamps of feeding oil ills following ills but what afflicts me more my veil that idle race profanely tore the web was curious wrought with art divine relentless wretches all the work was mine along the loom the purple warp i spread cast the light shoot and crossed the silver thread in this their teeth a thousand breaches tear the thousand breaches skilful hands repair for which vile earthly dunns thy daughter grieve the gods that use no coin have none to give and learnings goddess never less can owe neglected learning gains no wealth below nor let the frogs to win my succor sue those clamorous fools have lost my favor too for late when all the conflict ceast at night when my stretched sinews worked with eager fight when spent with glorious toil i left the field and sunk for slumber on my swelling shield lo from the deep repelling sweet repose with noisy croakings half the nation rose devoid of rest with aching brows i lay till cocks proclaimed the crimson dawn of day let all like me from either host forbear nor tempt the flying furies of the spear lest heavenly blood or what for blood may flow adorn the conquest of a meaner foe some daring mouse may meet the wondrous odds though gods oppose and brave the wounded gods over gilded clouds reclined the danger view and be the wars of mortals scenes for you so moved the blueeyd queen her words persuade great jove assented and the rest obeyed book iii now front to front the marching armies shine haltere they meet and form the lengthening line the chiefs conspicuous seen and heard afar give the loud signal to the rushing war their dreadful trumpets deepmouthed hornets sound the sounded charge remurmurs over the ground even jove proclaims a field of horror nigh and rolls low thunder through the troubled sky first to the fight the large hypsiboas flew and brave lychenor with a javelin slew the luckless warrior filled with generous flame stood foremost glittering in the post of fame when in his liver struck the javelin hung the mouse fell thundering and the target rung prone to the ground he sinks his closing eye and soiled in dust his lovely tresses lie a spear at pelion troglodytes cast the missive spear within the bosom past deaths sable shades the fainting frog surround and lifes red tide runs ebbing from the wound embasichytros felt seutlaeus dart transfix and quiver in his panting heart but great artophagus avenged the slain and big seutlaeus tumbling loads the plain and polyphonus dies a frog renowned for boastful speech and turbulence of sound deep through the belly pierced supine he lay and breathed his soul against the face of day the strong lymnocharis who viewed with ire a victor triumph and a friend expire and fiercely flung where troglodytes fought with heaving arms a rocky fragment caught a warrior versed in arts of sure retreat but arts in vain elude impending fate full on his sinewy neck the fragment fell and over his eyelids clouds eternal dwell lychenor second of the glorious name striding advanced and took no wandering aim through all the frog the shining javelin flies and near the vanquished mouse the victor dies the dreadful stroke crambophagus affrights long bred to banquets less inured to fights heedless he runs and stumbles over the steep and wildly floundring flashes up the deep lycheror following with a downward blow reached in the lake his unrecoverd foe gasping he rolls a purple stream of blood distains the surface of the silver flood through the wide wound the rushing entrails throng and slow the breathless carcass floats along lymnisius good tyroglyphus assails prince of the mice that haunt the flowery vales lost to the milky fares and rural seat he came to perish on the bank of fate the dread pternoglyphus demands the fight which tender calaminthius shuns by slight drops the green target springing quits the foe glides through the lake and safely dives below but dire pternophagus divides his way through breaking ranks and leads the dreadful day no nibbling prince excelled in fierceness more his parents fed him on the savage boar but where his lance the field with blood imbrued swift as he moved hydrocharis putsud till fallen in death he lies a shattring stone sounds on the neck and crushes all the bone his blood pollutes the verdure of the plain and from his nostrils bursts the gushing brain lycopinax with borbocaetes fights a blameless frog whom humbler life delights the fatal javelin unrelenting flies and darkness seals the gentle croakers eyes incensed prassophagus with spritely bound bears cnissodioctes off the rising ground then drags him over the lake deprived of breath and downward plunging sinks his soul to death but now the great psycarpax shines afar scarce he so great whose loss provoked the war swift to revenge his fatal javelin fled and throthe liver struck pelusius dead his freckled corpse before the victor fell his soul indignant sought the shades of hell this saw pelobates and from the flood heaved with both hands a monstrous mass of mud the cloud obscene over all the hero flies dishonours his brown face and blots his eyes enraged and wildly sputtring from the shore a stone immense of size the warrior bore a load for laboring earth whose bulk to raise asks ten degenerate mice of modern days full on the leg arrives the crushing wound the frog supportless writhes upon the ground thus flushed the victor wars with matchless force till loud craugasides arrests his course hoarsecroaking threats precede with fatal speed deep through the belly run the pointed reed then strongly tugged returned imbrued with gore and on the pile his reeking entrails bore the lame sitophagus oppressed with pain creeps from the desperate dangers of the plain and where the ditches rising weeds supply to spread their lowly shades beneath the sky there lurks the silent mouse relieved from heat and safe embourd avoids the chance of fate but here troxartes physignathus there whirl the dire furies of the pointed spear but where the foot around its ankle plies troxartes wounds and physignathus flies halts to the pool a safe retreat to find and trails a dangling length of leg behind the mouse still urges still the frog retires and half in anguish of the flight expires then pious ardor young pressaeus brings betwixt the fortunes of contending kings lank harmless frog with forces hardly grown he darts the reed in combats not his own which faintly tinkling on troxartes shield hangs at the point and drops upon the field now nobly towering over the rest appears a gallant prince that far transcends his years pride of his sire and glory of his house and more a mars in combat than a mouse his action bold robust his ample frame and meridarpax his resounding name the warrior singled from the fighting crowd boasts the dire honors of his arms aloud then strutting near the lake with looks elate to all its nations threats approaching fate and such his strength the silver lakes around might roll their waters over unpeopled ground but powerful jove who shows no less his grace to frogs that perish than to human race felt soft compassion rising in his soul and shook his sacred head that shook the pole then thus to all the gazing powers began the sire of gods and frogs and mice and man what seas of blood i view what worlds of slain an iliad rising from a days campaign how fierce his javelin over the trembling lakes the blackfurrd hero meridarpax shakes unless some favoring deity descend soon will the frogs loquacious empire end let dreadful pallas winged with pity fly and make her aegis blaze before his eye while mars refulgent on his rattling car arrests his raging rival of the war he ceased reclining with attentive head when thus the glorious god of combats said nor pallas jove though pallas take the field with all the terrors of her hissing shield nor mars himself though mars in armor bright ascend his car and wheel amidst the fight not these can drive the desperate mouse afar or change the fortunes of the bleeding war let all go forth all heaven in arms arise or launch thy own red thunder from the skies such ardent bolts as flew that wondrous day when heaps of titans mixed with mountains lay when all the giantrace enormous fell and huge enceladus was hurled to hell twas thus the armipotent advised the gods when from his throne the cloudcompeller nods deep lengthning thunders run from pole to pole olympus trembles as the thunders roll then swift he whirls the brandished bolt around and headlong darts it at the distant ground the bolt discharged inwrapd with lightning flies and rends its flaming passage through the skies then earths inhabitants the nibblers shake and frogs the dwellers in the waters quake yet still the mice advance their dread design and the last danger threats the croaking line till jove that inly mourned the loss they bore with strange assistants filled the frighted shore poured from the neighboring strand deformed to view they march a sudden unexpected crew strong suits of armor round their bodies close which like thick anvils blunt the force of blows in wheeling marches turned oblique they go with harpy claws their limbs divide below fell sheers the passage to their mouth command from out the flesh their bones by nature stand broad spread their backs their shining shoulders rise unnumberd joints distort their lengthened thighs with nervous cords their hands are firmly braced their round black eye balls in their bosom placed on eight long feet the wondrous warriors tread and either end alike supplies a head these mortal wits to call the crabs agree the gods have other names for things than we now where the jointures from their loins depend the heroes tails with sevring grasps they rend here short of feet deprived the power to fly there without hands upon the field they lie wrenchd from their holds and scattered all around the bended lances heap the cumberd ground helpless amazement fear pursuing fear and mad confusion through their host appear over the wild waste with headlong flight they go or creep concealed in vaulted holes below but down olympus to the western seas farshooting phoebus drove with fainter rays and a whole war so jove ordained begun was fought and ceased in one revolving

silver feet with annual osier crowned she runs for ever through poetic ground how flame the glories of belindas hair made by thy muse the envy of the fair less shone the tresses egypts princess wore which sweet callimachus so sung before here courtly trifles set the world at odds belles war with beaux and whims descend for gods the new machines in names of ridicule mock the grave phrenzy of the chymic fool but know ye fair a point concealed with art the sylphs and gnomes are but a womans heart the graces stand in sight a satyr train peep over their heads and laugh behind the scene in fames fair temple over the boldest wits inshrind on high the sacred virgil sits and sits in measures such as virgils muse to place thee near him might be fond to choose how might he tune the alternate reed with thee perhaps a strephon thou a daphnis he while some old damon over the vulgar wise thinks he deserves and thou deserve the prize rapt with the thought my fancy seeks the plains and turns me shepherd while i hear the strains indulgent nurse of every tender gale parent of slowrets old arcadia hail here in the cool my limbs at ease i spread here let thy poplars whisper over my head still

great thy homer warms with all his ancient heat he shines in council thunders in the fight and flames with every sense of great delight long has that poet reigned and long unknown like monarchs sparkling on a distant throne in all the majesty of greek retired himself unknown his mighty name admired his language failing wrapped him round with night thine raised by thee recals the work to light so wealthy mines that ages long before fed the large realms around with golden oar when choked by sinking banks no more appear and shepherds only say the mines were here should some rich youth if nature warm his heart and all his projects stand informed with art here clear the caves there open the leading vein the mines detected flame with gold again how vast how copious are thy new designs how every music varies in thy lines still as i read i feel my bosom beat and rise in raptures by anothers heat thus in the wood when summer dressed the days when windsor lent us tuneful hours of ease our ears the lark the thrush the turtle blessed and philomela sweetest over the rest the shades resound with song  o softly tread while a whole season warbles round my head this to my friend  and when a friend inspires my silent harp its masters hand requires shakes off the dust and makes these rocks resound for fortune placed me in unfertile ground far from the joys that with my soul agree from wit from learning  far oh far from thee here mossgrown trees expand the smallest leaf here half an acres corn is half a sheaf here hills with naked heads the tempest meet rocks at their side and torrents at their feet or lazy lakes unconscious of a flood whose dull brown naiads ever sleep in mud yet here content can dwell and learned ease a friend delight me and an author please even here i

cows neglectful of their pasture stand by turns obsequious to the milkers hand when damon softly trod the shaven lawn damon a youth from city cares withdrawn long was the pleasing walk he wandered through a covered arbor closed the distant view there rests the youth and while the feathered throng raise their wild music thus contrives a song here wasted over by mild etesian air thou country goddess beauteous health repair here let my breast through quivering trees inhale thy rosy blessings with the morning gale what are the fields or flowers or all i see ah tasteless all if not enjoyed with thee joy to my soul i feel the goddess nigh the face of nature cheers as well as i over the flat green refreshing breezes run the smiling dazies blow beneath the sun the brooks run purling down with silver waves the planted lanes rejoice with dancing leaves the chirping birds from all the compass rove to tempt the tuneful echoes of the grove high funny summits deeply shaded dales thick mossy banks and flowery winding vales with various prospect gratify the sight and scatter fixed attention in delight come country goddess come nor thou suffice but bring thy mountainsister exercise called by thy lively voice she turns her pace her winding horn proclaims the finished chase she mounts the rocks she skims the level plain dogs hawks and horses crowd her early train her hardy face repels the tanning wind and lines and meshes loosely float behind all these as means of toil the feeble see but these are helps to pleasure joined with thee let sloth lie softning till high noon in down or lolling fan her in the sultry town unnervd with rest and turn her own disease or foster others in luxurious ease i mount the courser call the deepmouthed hounds the fox unkennelld flies to covert

bright presence clouds of sorrow fly for her i mow my walks i plait my bowers clip my low hedges and support my flowers to welcome her this summer seat i dressed and here i court her when she comes to rest when she from exercise to learned ease shall change again and teach the change to please now friends conversing my sost hours refine and tullys tusculum revives in mine now to grave books i bid the mind retreat and such as make me rather good than great or over the works of easy fancy rove where flutes and innocence amuse the grove the native bard that on sicilian plains first sung the lowly manners of the swains or maros muse that in the fairest light paints rural prospects and the charms of sight these soft amusements bring content along and fancy void of sorrow turns to song here beauteous health for all the year remain when the next comes i will charm thee thus again the flies an eclogue when in the river cows for coolness stand and sheep for breezes seek the lofty land a youth whom aesop taught that every tree each bird and insect spoke as well as he walked calmly musing in a shaded way where flowring hawthorn broke the sunny ray and thus instructs his moral pen to draw a scene that obvious in the field he saw near a low ditch where shallow waters meet which never learnt to glide with liquid feet whose naiads never prattle as they play but screend with hedges slumber out the day there stands a slender ferns aspiring shade whose answring branches regularly laid put forth their answring boughs and proudly rise three stories upward in the nether skies for shelter here to shun the noonday heat an airy nation of the flies retreat some in soft air their silken pinions ply and some from bough to bough delighted sly some rise and circling light to perch again a pleasing murmur hums along the plain so when a stage invites to pageant shows if great and small are like appear the beaux in boxes some with spruce pretension sit some change from seat to seat within the pit some roam the scenes or turning cease to roam preluding music fills the lofty dome when thus a fly if what a fly can say deserves attention raised the rural lay where late amintor made a nymph a bride joyful i flew by young favonias side who mindless of the feasting went to sip the balmy pleasure of the shepherds lip i saw the wanton where i stooped to sup and half resolved to drown me in the cup till brushed by careless hands she soared above cease beauty cease to vex a tender love thus ends the youth the buzzing meadow rung and thus the rival of his music sung when suns by thousands shone in orbs of dew i wafted soft with zephyretta flew saw the clean pail and sought the milky cheer while little daphne seized my roving dear wretch that i was i might have warned the dame yet sat indulging as the danger came but the kind huntress left her free to soar ah guard ye lovers guard a mistress more thus from the fern whose highprojecting arms the sleeting nation bent with dusky swarms the swains their love in easy music breathe when tongues and tumult stun the field beneath black ants in teams come darkning all the road some call to march and some to lift the load they strain they labor with incessant pains pressed by the cumbrous weight of single grains the flies struck silent gaze with wonder down the busy burghers reach their earthy town where lay the burdens of a wintry store and thence unwearied part in search of more yet one grave sage a moments space attends and the small citys loftiest point ascends wipes the salt dew that trickles down his face and thus harangues them with the gravest grace ye foolish nurslings of the summer air these gentle tunes and whining songs forbear your trees and whispering breeze your grove and love your cupids quiver and his mothers dove let bards to business bend their vigorous wing and sing but seldom if they love to sing else when the flourets of the season fail and thus your fenny shade forsakes the vale though one would save ye not one grain of wheat should pay such songsters idling at my gate he ceased the flies incorrigibly vain heard the mayrs speech and fell to sing again an elegy to an old beauty in vain poor nymph to please our youthful fight you sleep in cream and frontlets all the night your face with patches soil with paint repair dress with gay gowns and shade with foreign hair if truth in spite of manners must be told why really fiftyfive is something old once you were young or one whose lifes so long she might have born my mother tells me wrong and once since envys dead before you dye the women own you played a sparkling eye taught the light foot a modish little trip and pouted with the prettiest purple lip  to some new charmer are the roses fled which blew to damask all thy cheek with red youth calls the graces there to fix their reign and airs by thousands fill their easy train so parting summer bids her flowery prime attend the sun to dress some foreign clime while withering seasons in succession here strip the gay gardens and deform the year but thou since nature bids the world resign it is now thy daughters daughters time to shine with more address or such as pleases more she runs her female exercises over unfurls or closes raps or turns the fan and smiles or blushes at the creature man with quicker life as gilded coaches pass in sideling courtesy

nice machine by nature formed to fail my change arrives the change i meet before i thought it nigh my spring my years of pleasure fleet and all their beauties dye in age i search and only find a poor unfruitful gain grave wisdom stalking slow behind oppressed with loads of pain my ignorance could once beguile and fancied joys inspire my errors cherished hope to smile on newlyborn desire but now experience shows the bliss for which i fondly fought not worth the long impatient wish and ardour of the thought my youth met fortune fair arrayed in all her pomp she shone and might perhaps have well essayed to make her gifts my own but when i saw the blessings shower on some unworthy mind i left the chase and owned the power was justly painted blind i passed the glories which adorn the splendid courts of kings and while the persons moved my scorn i rose to scorn the things my manhood felt a vigorous fire by love increased the more but years with coming years conspire to break the chains i wore in weakness safe the sex i see with idle luster shine for what are all their joys to me which cannot now be mine but hold  i feel my gout decrease my troubles laid to rest and truths which would disturb my peace are painful truths at best vainly the time i have to roll in sad reflection flies ye fondling passions of my soul ye sweet deceits arise i wisely change the scene within to things that used to please in pain philosophy is spleen in health it is only ease a nightpiece on death by the blue tapers trembling light no more i waste the wakeful night intent with endless view to pore the schoolmen and the sages over their books from wisdom widely stray or point at best the longest way i will seek a readier path and go where wisdoms surely taught below how deep yon azure dies the sky where orbs of gold unnumberd lie while through their ranks in silver pride the nether crescent seems to glide the slumbering breeze forgets to breathe the lake is smooth and clear beneath where once again the spangled show descends to meet our eyes below the grounds which on the right aspire in dimness from the view retire the left presents a place of graves whose wall the silent water laves that steeple guides thy doubtful sight among the livid gleams of night there pass with melancholy state by all the solemn heaps of fate and think as softlysad you tread above the venerable dead time was like thee they life possessed and time shall be that thou shall rest those graves with bending osier bound that nameless heave the crumbled ground quick to the glancing thought disclose where toil and poverty repose the flat smooth stones that bear a name the chissels slender help to fame which ere our set of friends decay their frequent steps may wear away a middle race of mortals own men half ambitious all unknown the marble tombs that rise on high whose dead in vaulted arches lie whose pillars swell with sculptured stones arms angels epitaphs and bones these all the poor remains of state adorn the rich or praise the great who while on earth in fame they live are senseless of the fame they give ha while i gaze pale cynthia fades the bursting earth unveils the shades all slow and wan and wrapped with shrouds they rise in visionary crowds and all with sober accent cry think mortal what it is to die now from yon black and funeral yew that bathes the charnelhouse with dew methinks i hear a voice begin ye ravens cease your croaking din ye tolling clocks no time resound over the long lake and midnight ground it sends a peal of hollow groans thus speaking from among the bones when men my scythe and darts supply how great a king of fears am i they view me like the last of things they make and then they dread my stings fools if you less provoked your fears no more my spectreform appears deaths but a path that must be trod if man would ever pass to god a port of calms a state of ease from the rough rage of swelling seas why then thy flowing sable stoles deep pendent cypress mourning poles loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds long palls drawn herses covered steeds and plumes of black that as they tread nod over the scutcheons of the dead nor can the parted body know nor wants the soul these forms of woe as men who long in prison dwell with lamps that glimmer round the cell wheneer their suffering years are run spring forth to greet the glittering sun such joy though far transcending sense have pious souls at parting hence on earth and in the body placed a few and evil years they waste but when their chains are cast aside see the glad scene unfolding wide clap the glad wing and tower away and mingle with the blaze of day a hymn to contentment lovely lasting peace of mind sweet delight of humankind heavenly born and bred on high to crown the favorites of the sky with more of happiness below than victors in a triumph know whither o whither art thou fled to lay thy meek contented head what happy region do thou please to make the seat of calms and ease ambition searches all its sphere of pomp and state to meet thee there increasing avarice would find thy presence in its gold enshrined the bold adventrer ploughs his way through rocks amidst the foaming sea to gain thy love and then perceives thou were not in the rocks and waves the silent heart which grief assails treads soft and lonesome over the vales sees daisies open rivers run and seeks as i have vainly done amusing thought but learns to know that solitudes the nurse of woe no real happiness is found in trailing purple over the ground or in a soul exalted high to range the circuit of the sky converse with stars above and know all nature in its forms below the rest it seeks in seeking dies and doubts at last for knowledge rise lovely lasting peace appear this world itself if thou art here is once again with eden blessed and man contains it in his breast twas thus as under shade i stood i sung my wishes to the wood and lost in thought no more perceived the branches whisper as they waved it seemed as all the quiet place confessed the presence of the grace when thus she spoke  go rule thy will bid thy wild passions all be still know god  and bring thy heart to know the joys which from religion flow then every grace shall prove its guest and i will be there to crown the rest oh by yonder mossy seat in my hours of sweet retreat might i thus my soul employ with sense of gratitude and joy raised as ancient prophets were in heavenly vision praise and prayer pleasing all men hurting none pleased and blessed with god alone then while the gardens take my sight with all the colors of delight while silver waters glide along to please my ear and court my song i will lift my voice and tune my string and thee great source of nature sing the fun that walks his airy way to light the world and give the day the moon that shines with borrowed light the stars that gild the gloomy night the seas that roll unnumberd waves the wood that spreads its shady leaves the field whose ears conceal the grain the yellow treasure of the plain all of these and all i see should be sung and sung by me they speak their maker as they can but want and ask the tongue of man go search among your idle dreams your busy or your vain extremes and find a life of equal bliss or own the next begun in this the hermit far in a wild unknown to public view from youth to age a reverend hermit grew the moss his bed the cave his humble cell his food the fruits his drink the crystal well remote from man with god he passed the days prayer all his business all his pleasure praise a life so sacred such serene repose seemed heaven itself till one suggestion rose that vice should triumph virtue vice obey this sprung some doubt of providences sway his hopes no more a certain prospect boast and all the tenor of his soul is lost so when a smooth expanse receives impressed calm natures image on its watery breast down bend the banks the trees depending grow and skies beneath with answring colors glow but if a stone the gentle sea divide swift ruffling circles curl on every side and glimmering fragments of a broken sun banks trees and skies in thick disorder run to clear this doubt to know the world by sight to find if books or swains report it right for yet by swains alone the world he knew whose feet came wandering over the nightly dew he quits his cell the pilgrimstaff he bore and fixed the scallop in his hat before then with the sun a rising journey went sedate to think and watching each event the morn was wasted in the pathless grass and long and lonesome was the wild to pass but when the southern sun had warmed the day a youth came posting over a crossing way his raiment decent his complexion fair and soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair then near approaching father hail he cried and hail my son the reverend sire replied words followed words from question answer flowed and talk of various kind deceived the road till each with other pleased and loath to part while in their age they differ join in heart thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around now sunk the sun the closing hour of day came onward mantled over with sober gray nature in silence bid the world repose when near the road a stately palace rose there by the moon through ranks of trees they pass whose verdure crowned their sloping sides of grass it chanced the noble master of the dome still made his house the wandering strangers home yet still the kindness from a thirst of praise proved the vain flourish of expensive ease the pair arrive the livryd servants wait their lord receives them at the pompous gate the table groans with costly piles of food and all is more than hospitably good then led to ress the days long toil they drown deep sunk in sleep and silk and heaps of down at length it is morn and at the dawn of day along the wide canals the zephyrs play fresh over the gay parterres the breezes creep and shake the neighboring wood to banish sleep up rise the guests obedient to the call an early banquet decked the splendid hall rich luscious wine a golden goblet graced which the kind master forced the guests to taste then pleased and thankful from the porch they go and but the landlord none had cause of woe his cup was vanished for in secret guise the younger guest purloind the glittering prize as one who spies a serpent in his way glistning and basking in the summer ray disordered stops to shun the danger near then walks with faintness on and looks with fear so seemed the fire when far upon the road the shining spoil his wiley partner showed he stopped with silence walked with trembling heart and much he wished but durst not ask to part murmuring he lifts his eyes and thinks it hard that generous actions meet a base reward while thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds the changing skies hang out their sable clouds a sound in air presaged approaching rain and beasts to covert scud across the plain warned by the signs the wandering pair retreat to seek for shelter at a neighboring seat twas built with turrets on a rising ground and strong and large and unimprovd around its owners temper timorous and severe unkind and griping caused a desert there as near the misers heavy doors they drew fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew the nimble lightning mixed with showers began and over their heads loudrolling thunder ran here long they knock but knock or call in vain driven by the wind and battered by the rain at length some pity warmed the masters breast it was then his threshold first received a guest slow creaking turns the door with jealous care and half he welcomes in the shivering pair one frugal faggot lights the naked walls and natures fervor through their limbs recals bread of the coarsest sort with eager wine each hardly granted served them both to dine and when the tempest first appeared to cease a ready warning bid them part in peace with still remark the pondring hermit viewed in one so rich a life so poor and rude and why should such within himself he cried lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside but what new marks of wonder soon took place in every settling feature of his face when from his vest the young companion bore that cup the generous landlord owned before and paid profusely with the precious bowl the stinted kindness of this churlish soul but now the clouds in airy tumult fly the sun emerging opes an azure sky a fresher green the smelling leaves display and glittering as they tremble cheer the day the weather courts them from the poor retreat and the glad master bolts the wary gate while hence they walk the pilgrims bosom wrought with all the travel of uncertain thought his partners acts without their cause appear twas there a vice and seemed a madness here detesting that and pitying this he goes lost and confounded with the various shows now nights dim shades again involve the sky again the wandrers want a place to lie again they search and find a lodging nigh the soil improved around the mansion neat and neither poorly low nor idly great it seemed to speak its masters turn of mind content and not for praise but virtue kind hither the walkers turn with weary feet then bless the mansion and the master greet their greeting fair bestowed with modest guise the courteous master hears and thus replies without a vain without a grudging heart to him who gives us all i yield a part from him you come for him accept it here a frank and sober more than costly cheer he spoke and bid the welcome table spread then talked of virtue till the time of bed when the grave household round his hall repair warned by a bell and close the hours with prayer at length the world renewed by calm repose was strong for toil the dappled morn arose before the pilgrims part the younger crept near the closed cradle where an infant slept and writhed his neck the landlords little pride o strange return grew black and gaspd and died horror of horrors what i his only son how looked our hermit when the fact was done not hell though hells black jaws in sunder part and breathe blue fire could more assault his heart confused and struck with silence at the deed he flies but trembling fails to fly with speed his steps the youth pursues the country lay perplexed with roads a servant showed the way a river crossed the path the passage over was nice to find the servant trod before long arms of oaks an open bridge supplied and deep the waves beneath the bending glide the youth who seemed to watch a time to sin approached the careless guide and thrust him in plunging he falls and rising lifts his head then flashing turns and sinks among the dead wild sparkling rage inflames the fathers eyes he bursts the bands of fear and madly cries detested wretch  but scarce his speech began when the strange partner seemed no longer man his youthful face grew more serenely sweet his robe turned white and flowed upon his feet fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair celestial odours breathe through purpled air and wings whose colors glittered on the day wide at his back their gradual plumes display the form etherial bursts upon his sight and moves in all the majesty of light though loud at first the pilgrims passion grew sudden he gazed and wist not what to do surprise in secret chains his word suspends and in a calm his settling temper ends but silence here the beauteous angel broke the voice of music ravished as he spoke thy prayer thy praise thy life to vice unknown in sweet memorial rise before the throne these charms success in our bright region find and force an angel down to calm thy mind for this commissioned i forsook the sky nay cease to kneel  thy fellow servants i then know the truth of government divine and let these scruples be no longer thine the maker justly claims that world he made in this the right of providence is laid its sacred majesty through all depends on using second means to work his ends it is thus withdrawn in state from human eye the power exerts his attributes on high your actions uses nor controuls your will and bids the doubting sons of men be still what strange events can strike with more surprise than those which lately struck thy wondering eyes yet taught by these confess the almighty just and where you cannot unriddle learn to trust the great vain man who fared on costly food whose life was too luxurious to be good who made his ivory stands with goblets shine and forced his guests to morning draughts of wine has with the cup the graceless custom lost and still he welcomes but with less of cost the mean suspicious wretch whose bolted door never moved in duty to the wandering poor with him i left the cup to teach his mind that heaven can bless if mortals will be kind conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl and feels compassion touch his grateful soul thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead with heaping coals of fire upon its head in the kind warmth the metal learns to glow and loose from dross the silver runs below long had our pious friend in virtue trod but now the child halfweand his heart from god child of his age for him he lived in pain and measured back his steps to earth again to what excesses had his dotage run but god to save the father took the son to all but thee in fits he seemed to go and twas my ministry to deal the blow the poor fond parent humbled in the dust now owns in tears the punishment was just but how had all his fortune felt a wrack had that false servant sped in safety back this night his treasured heaps he meant to steal and what a fund of charity would fail thus heaven instructs thy mind this trial over depart in peace resign and sin no more on sounding pinions here the youth withdrew the sage stood wondering as the seraph flew thus looked elisha when to mount on high his master took the chariot of the sky the fiery pomp ascending left the view the prophet gazed and wished to follow too the bending hermit here a prayer begun lord as in heaven on earth thy will be done then gladly turning sought his ancient place and passed a life of piety and peace visions published in the spectators etc by the same hand vision i spectator no   0 decipimur specie recti  hor our defects and follies are too often unknown to us nay they are so far from being known to us that they pass for demonstrations of our worth this makes us easy in the midst of them fond to show them fond to improve in them and to be esteemed for them then it is that a thousand unaccountable conceits gay inventions and extravagant actions must afford us pleasures and display as to others in the colors which we ourselves take a fancy to glory in and indeed there is something so amusing for the time in this state of vanity and illgrounded satisfaction that even the wiser world has chosen an exalted word to describe its enchantments and called it the paradise of fools perhaps the latter part of this reflection may seem a false thought to some and bear another turn than what i have given but it is at present none of my business to look after it who am going to confess that i have been lately amongst them in a vision  methought i was transported to a hill green flowery and of an easy ascent upon the broad top of it resided squinteyed error and popular opinion with many heads two that dealt in sorcery and were famous for bewitching people with the love of themselves to these repaired a multitude from every side by two different paths which lead toward each of them some who had the most assuming air went directly of themselves to error without expecting a conductor others of a softer nature went first to popular opinion from whence as she influenced and engaged them with their own praises she delivered them over to his government  when we had ascended to an open part of the summit where opinion abode we found her entertaining several who had arrived before us her voice was pleasing she breathed odours as she spoke she seemed to have a tongue for every one every one thought he heard of something that was valuable in himself and expected a paradise which she promised as the reward of his merit thus we were drawn to follow her till she should bring us where it was to be bestowed and it was observable that all the way we went the company was either praising themselves in their qualifications or one another for those qualifications which they took to be conspicuous in their own characters or dispraising others for wanting theirs or vying in the degrees of them  at last we approached a bower at the entrance of which error was seated the trees were thick woven and the place where he sat artfully contrived to darken him a little he was disguised in a whitish robe which he had put on that he might appear to us with a nearer resemblance to truth and as she has a light whereby she manifests the beauties of nature to the eyes of her adorers so he had provided himself with a magical wand that he might do something in imitation of it and please with delusions this he listed solemnly and muttering to himself bid the glories which he kept under enchantment to appear before us immediately we cast our eyes on that part of the sky to which he pointed and observed a thin blue prospect which cleared as mountains in a summer morning when the mists go off and the palace of vanity appeared to sight  the foundation hardly seemed a foundation but a set of curling clouds which it stood upon by magical contrivance the way by which we ascended was painted like a rainbow and as we went the breeze that played about us bewitched the senses the walls were gilded all for show the lowest set of pillars were of the slight fine corinthian order and the top of the building being rounded bore so far the resemblance of a bubble  at the gate the travelers neither met with a porter nor waited till one should appear every one thought his merits a sufficient passport and pressed forward in the hall we met with several phantoms that roved amongst us and ranged the company according to their sentiments there was decreasing honor that had nothing to show in but an old coat of his ancestors achievements there was ostentation that made himself his own constant subject and gallantry strutting upon his tiptoes at the upper end of the hall stood a throne whose canopy glittered with all the riches that gayety could contrive to lavish on it and between the gilded arms sat vanity decked in the peacocks feathers and acknowledged for another venus by her votaries the boy who stood beside her for a cupid and who made the world to bow before her was called selfconceit his eyes had every now and then a cast inwards to the neglect of all objects about him and the arms which he made use of for conquest were borrowed from those against whom he had a design the arrow which he shot at the soldier was fledged from his own plume of feathers the dart he directed against the man of wit was winged from the quills he writ with and that which he sent against those who presumed upon their riches was headed with gold out of their treasuries he made nets for statesmen from their own contrivances he took fire from the eyes of ladies with which he melted their hearts and lightning from the tongues of the eloquent to inflame them with their own glories at the foot of the throne sat three false graces flattery with a shell of paint affectation with a mirror to practice at and fashion ever changing the posture of her clothes these applied themselves to secure the conquests which selfconceit had gotten and had each of them their particular polities flattery gave new colors and complexions to all things affectation new airs and appearances which as she said were not vulgar and fashion both concealed some home defects and added some foreign external beauties  as i was reflecting upon what i saw i heard a voice in the crowd bemoaning the condition of mankind which is thus managed by the breath of opinion deluded by error ird by selfconceit and given up to be trained in all the courses of vanity till scorn or poverty come upon us these expressions were no sooner handed about but i immediately saw a general disorder till at last there was a parting in one place and a grave old man decent and resolute was led forward to be punished for the words he had uttered he appeared inclined to have spoken in his own defense but i could not observe that any one was willing to hear him vanity cast a scornful smile athim selfconceit was angry flattery who knew him for plaindealing put on a vizard and turned away affectation tossed her fan made mouths and called him envy or slander and fashion would have it that at least he must be illmanners thus slighted and despised by all he was driven out for abusing people of merit and figure and i heard it firmly resolved that he should be used no better wherever they met with him hereafter  i had already seen the meaning of most part of that warning which he had given and was considering how the latter words should be fulfilled when a mighty noise was heard without and the door was blackned by a numerous train of harpies crowding in upon us folly and broken credit were seen in the house before they entered trouble shame infamy scorn and poverty brought up the rear vanity with her cupid and graces disappeared her subjects ran into holes and corners but many of them were found and carried off as i was told by one who stood near me either to prisons or cellars solitude or little company the mean arts or the viler crafts of life but these added he with a disdainful air are such who would fondly live here when their merits neither matched the luster of the place nor their riches its expenses we have seen such scenes as these before now the glory you saw will all return when the hurry is over i thanked him for his information and believing him so incorrigible as that he would stay till it was his turn to be taken i made off to the door and overtook some few who though they would not hearken to plaindealing were now terrified to good purpose by the example of others but when they had touched the threshold it was a strange shock to them to find that the delusion of error was gone and they plainly discerned the building to hang a little up in the air without any real foundation at first we saw nothing but a desperate leap remained for us and i a thousand times blamed my unmeaning curiosity that had brought me into so much danger but as they began to sink lower in their own minds methought the palace sunk along with us till they were arrived at the due point of esteem which they ought to have for themselves then the part of the building in which they stood touched the earth and we departing out it retired from our eyes now whether they who stayed in the palace were sensible of this descent i cannot tell it was then my opinion that they were not however it be my dream broke up at it and has given me occasion all my life to reflect upon the fatal consequences of following the suggestions of vanity  vision ii spectator no  0  how are we tortured with the absence of what we covet to possess when it appears to be lost to us what excursions does the soul make in imagination after it and how does it turn into itself again more foolishly fond and dejected at the disappointment our grief instead of having recourse to reason which might restrain it searches to find a further nourishment it calls upon memory to relate the several passages and circumstances of satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed the pleasures we purchased by those riches that are taken from us or the power and splendor of our departed honors or the voice the words the looks the temper and affections of our friends that are deceased it needs must happen from hence that the passion should often swell to such a size as to burst the heart which contains it if time did not make these circumstances less strong and lively so that reason should become a more equal match for the passion or if another desire which becomes more present did not overpower them with a livelier representation these are thoughts which i had when i fell into a kind of vision upon this subject and may therefore stand for a proper introduction to a relation of it  i found myself upon a naked shore with company whose afflicted countenances witnessed their conditions before us flowed a water deep silent and called the river of tears which issuing from two fountains on an upper ground encompassed an island that lay before us the boat which plied in it was old and shattered having been sometimes overset by the impatience and haste of single passengers to arrive at the other side this immediately was brought to us by misfortune who steers it and we were all preparing to take our places when there appeared a woman of a mild and composed behavior who began to deter us from it by representing the dangers which would attend our voyage hereupon some who knew her for patience and some of those too who till then cried the loudest were persuaded by her and returned back the rest of us went in and she whose goodnature would not suffer her to forsake persons in trouble desired leave to accompany us that she might at least administer some small comfort or advice while we sailed we were no sooner embarked but the boat was pushed off the sheet was spread and being filled with sighs which are the winds of that country we made a passage to the farther bank through several difficulties of which t of us seemed utterly regardless  when we landed we perceived the island to be strangely overcast with fogs which no brightness could pierce so that a kind of gloomy horror sat always brooding over it this had something in it very shocking to easy tempers insomuch that some others whom patience had by this time gained over left us here and privily conveyed themselves round the verge of the island to find a ford by which she told them they might escape  for my part i still went along with those who were for piercing into the center of the place and joining ourselves to others whom we found upon the same journey we marched solemnly as at a funeral through bordering hedges of rosemary and through a grove of yewtrees which love to overshadow tombs and flourish in churchyards here we heard on every side the wailings and complaints of several of the inhabitants who had cast themselves disconsolately at the feet of trees and as we chanced to approach any of these we might perceive them wringing their hands beating their breasts tearing their hair or after some other manner visibly agitated with vexation our sorrows were heightened by the influence of what we heard and saw and one of our number was wrought up to such a pitch of wildness as to talk of hanging himself upon a bough which shot temptingly across the path we traveled in but he was restrained from it by the kind endeavors of our abovementioned companion  we had now gotten into the most dusky silent part of the island and by the redoubled sounds of sighs which made a doleful whistling in the branches the thickness of air which occasioned faintish respiration and the violent throbbings of heart which more and more affected us we found that we approached the grotto of grief it was a wide hollow and melancholy cave sunk deep in a dale and watered by rivulets that had a color between red and black these crept slow and half congealed amongst its windings and mixed their heavy murmur with the echo of groans that rolled through all the passages in the most retired part of it sat the doleful being herself the path to her was strewed with goads stings and thorns and the throne on which she sat was broken into a rock with ragged pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon a heavy mist hung above her her head oppressed with it reclined upon her arm thus did she reign over her disconsolate subjects full of herself to stupidity in eternal pensiveness and the profoundest silence on one side of her stood dejection just dropping into a swoon and paleness wasting to a skeleton on the other side were care inwardly tormented with imaginations and anguish suffering outward troubles to suck the blood from her heart in the shape of vultures the whole vault had a genuine dismalness in it which a few scattered lamps whose blueish flames arose and sunk in their urns discovered to our eyes with increase some of us fell down overcome and spent with what they suffered in the way and were given over to those tormenters that stood on either hand of the presence others galled and mortified with pain recovered the entrance where patience whom we had left behind was still waiting to receive us  with her whose company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her we winded round the grotto and ascended at the back of it out of the mournful dale in whose bottom it lay on this eminence we halted by her advice to pant for breath and listing our eyes which till then were fixed downwards felt a sullen sort of satisfaction in observing through the shades what numbers had entered the island this satisfaction which appears to have ill nature in it was excusable because it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own concern to have respect to that of others and therefore we did not consider them as suffering but ourselves as not suffering in the most forlorn estate it had also the groundwork of humanity and compassion in it though the mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it but as we proceeded onwards it began to discover itself and from observing that others were unhappy we came to question one another when it was that we met and what were the sad occasions that brought us together then we heard our stories we compared them we mutually gave and received pity and so by degrees became tolerable company  a considerable part of the troublesome road was thus deceived at length the openings among the trees grew larger the air seemed thinner it lay with less oppression upon us and we could now and then discern tracts in it of a lighter greyness like the breakings of day short in duration much enlivening and called in that country gleams of amusement within a short while these gleams began to appear more frequent and then brighter and of a longer continuance the sighs that hitherto filled the air with so much dolefulness altered to the sound of common breezes and in general the horrors of the island were abated  when we had arrived at last at the ford by which we were to pass out we met with those fashionable mourners who had been ferried over along with us and who being unwilling to go as far as we had coasted by the shore to find the place where they waited our coming that by showing themselves to the world only at that time when we did they might seem also to have been among the troubles of the grotto here the waters that rolled on the other side so deep and silent were much dried up and it was an easter matter for us to wade over  the river being crossed we were received upon the further bank by our friends and acquaintance whom comfort had brought out to congratulate our appearance in the world again some of these blamed us for staying so long away from them others advised us against all temptations of going back again every one was cautious not to renew our trouble by asking any particulars of the journey and all concluded that in a case of so much affliction we could not have made choice of a fitter companion than patience here patience appearing serene at her praises delivered us over to comfort comfort smiled at his receiving the charge immediately the sky purpledon that side to which he turned and double day at once broke in upon me  vision iii guardian no    quid mentem traxisse polo quid profuit altum erexisse caput pecudum si more pererrant claud i was considering last night when i could not sleep how noble a part of the creation man was designed to be and how distinguished in all his actions above other earthly creatures from whence i fell to take a view of the change and corruption which he has introduced into his own condition the grovelling appetites the mean characters of sense and wild courses of passions that cast him from the degree in which providence had placed him the debasing himself with qualifications not his own and his degenerating into a lower sphere of action this inspired me with a mixture of contempt and anger which however was not so violent as to hinder the return of sleep but grew confused as that came upon me and made me end my reflections with giving mankind the opprobrious names of inconsiderate mad and foolish  here methought where my waking reason left the subject my fancy pursued it in a dream and i imagined myself in a loud soliloquy of passion railing at my species and walking hard to get rid of the company i despised when two men who had overheard me made up on either hand these i observed had many features in common which might occasion the mistake of the one for the other in those to whom they appear single but i who saw them together could easily perceive that though there was an air of severity in each it was tempered with a natural sweetness in the one and by turns constrained or tussled by the designs of malice in the other  i was at a loss to know the reason of their joining me so briskly when he whose appearance displeased me most thus addressed his companion pray brother let him alone and we shall immediately see him transformed into a tiger this struck me with horror which the other perceived and pitying my disorder bid me be of good courage for though i had been savage in my treatment of mankind whom i should rather reform than rail against he would however endeavor to rescue me from my danger at this i looked a little more cheerful and while i testified my resignation to him ve saw the angry brother sling away from us in a passion for his disappointment being now left to my friend i went back with him at his desire that might know the meaning of those words which so affrightted me  as we went along to inform you says he with whom you have this adventure my name is reproof and his reproach both born of the same mother but of different fathers truth is our common parent friendship who saw her fell in love with her and she being pleased with him he begat me upon her but a while after enmity lying in ambush for her became the father of him whom you saw along with me the temper of our mother enclines us to the fame sort of business the informing mankind of their faults but the differing complexions of our fathers make us differ in our designs and company i have a natural benevolence in my mind which engages me with friends and he a natural impetuosity in his which casts him among enemies  as he thus discoursed he came to a place where there were three entrances into as many several walks which lay beside one another we passed into the middlemost a plain strait regular walk set with trees which added to the beauty of the place but did not so close their boughs over head as to exclude the light from it here as we walked i was made to observe how the road on one hand was full of rocks and precipices over which reproach who had already gotten thither was furiously driving unhappy wretches the other side was all laid out in gardens of gaudy tulips amongst whose leaves the serpents wreathed and at the end of every grassy walk the enchantress flattery was weaving bowers to lull souls asleep in we continued still walking on the middle way till we arrived in a building in which it terminated this was formerly erected by truth for a watch tower from whence she took a view of the earth and as she saw occasion sent out reproof or even reproach for our reformation over the door i took notice that a face was carved with a heart upon the lips of it and presently called to mind that this was the ancients emblem of sincerity in the entrance i met with freedom of speech and complaisance who had for a long time looked upon one another as enemies but reproof has so happily brought them together that they now act as friends and fellowagents in the same family before i ascended up the stairs i had my eyes purified by a water which made me see extremely clear and i think they said it sprung in a pit from whence as democritus had reported they formerly brought up truth who had hid herself in it i was then admitted to the upper chamber of prospect which was called the knowledge of mankind here the window was no sooner opened but i perceived the clouds to roll off and part before me and a scene of all the variety of the world presented itself  but how different was mankind in this view from what it used to appear methought the very shape of most of them was lost some had the heads of dogs others of apes or parrots and in short wherever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy qualities of other creatures the change of his soul became visible in his countenance the strutting pride of him who is endued with brutality instead of courage made his face shoot out in the form of a horses his eyes became prominent his nostrils widened and his wig untying flowed down on one side of his neck in a waving mane the talkativeness of those who love the ill nature of conversation made them turn into assemblies of geese their lips hardened into bills by eternal using they gabbled for diversion they hissed in scandal and their ruffles falling back on their arms a succession of little feathers appeared which formed wings for them to flutter with from one visit to another the envious and malicious lay on the ground with the heads of different sorts of serpents and not endeavoring to erect themselves but meditating mischief to others they sucked the poison of the earth sharpened their tongues to stings upon the stones and rolled their trains unperceivably beneath their habits the hypocritical oppressors wore the faces of crocodiles their mouths were instruments of cruelty their eyes of deceit they committed wickedness and bemoaned that there should be so much of it in the world they devoured the unwary and wept over the remains of them the covetous had so hooked and worn their fingers by counting interest upon interest that they converted to the claws of harpies and these they still were stretching out for more yet seemed unsatisfied with their acquisitions the sharpers had the looks of camelions they every minute changed their appearance and fed on swarms of flies which fell as so many collies amongst them the bully seemed a dunghill cock he crested well and bore his comb aloft he was beaten by almost every one yet still sung for triumph and only the mean coward pricked up the ears of a hare to fly before him critics were turned into cats whose pleasure and grumbling go together fopes were apes in embroidered jackets flatterers were curled spaniels sawning and crouching the crafty had the face of a fox the slothful of an ass the cruel of a wolf the illbred of a bear the leachers were goats and the gluttons swine drunkenness was the only vice that did not change the face of its professors into that of another creature but this i took to be far from a privilege for these two reasons because it sufficiently deforms them of itself and because none of the lower ranks of beings is guilty of so foolish an intemperance  as i was taking a view of these representations of things without any more order than is usual in a dream or in the confusion of the world itself i perceived a concern within me for what i saw my eyes began to moisten and as if the virtue of that water with which they were purified was lost for a time by their being touched with that which arose from a passion the clouds immediately began to gather again and close from either hand upon the prospect i then turned toward my guide who addressed himself to me after this manner you have seen the condition of mankind when it descends from its dignity now therefore guard yourself from that degeneracy by a modest greatness of spirit on one side and a conscious shame on the other endeavor also with a generosity of goodness to make your friends aware of it let them know what defects you perceive are growing upon them handle the matter as you see reason either with the airs of severe or humourous affection sometimes plainly describing the degeneracy in its full proper colors or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun you give them to such a day or so many months to turn bears wolves or foxes etc neither neglect your more remote acquaintance where you see any worthy and susceptible of admonition expose the beasts whose qualities you see them putting on where you have no mind to engage with their persons the possibility of their applying this is very obvious the egyptians saw it so clearly that they made the pictures of animals explain their minds to one another instead of writing and indeed it is hardly to be missed since aesop took them out of their mute condition and taught them to speak for themselves with relation to the actions of mankind  vision iv guardian no    there is a set of mankind who are wholly employed in the illnatured office of gathering up a collection of stories that lessen the reputation of others and spreading them abroad with a certain air of satisfaction perhaps indeed an innocent and unmeaning curiosity a desire of being informed concerning those we live with or a willingness to prosit by reflection upon the actions of others may sometimes afford an excuse or sometimes a defense for inquisitiveness but certainly it is beyond all excuse a transgression against humanity to carry the matter further to tear off the dressings as i may say from the wounds of a friend and expose them to the air in cruel fits of diversion and yet we have something more to bemoan an outrage of an higher nature which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to spread the stories of folly frailty and vice but even enlarge them or invent new ones and blacken characters that we may appear ridiculous or hateful to one another from such practices as these it happens that some feel a sorrow and others are agitated with a spirit of revenge that scandals or lies are told because another has told such before that resentments and quarrels arise and injuries are given received and multiplied in a scene of vengeance  all this i have often observed with abundance of concern and having a perfect desire to further the happiness of mankind i lately set myself to consider the causes from whence such evils arise and the remedies which may be applied whereupon i shut my eyes to prevent distraction from outward objects and a while after shot away upon an impulse of thought into the world of ideas where abstracted qualities became visible in such appearances as were agreeable to each of their natures  that part of the country where i happened to light was the most noisy that i had ever known the winds whistled the leaves rustled the brooks rumbled the birds chatterd the tongues of men were heard and the echo mingled something of every sound in its repetition so that there was a strange confusion and uproar of sounds about me at length as the noise still increased i could discern a man habited like a herald and as i afterward understood called novelty that came forward proclaiming a solemn day to be kept at the house of common fame immediately behind him advanced three nymphs who had mostrous appearances the first of these was curiosity habited like a virgin and having an hundred ears upon her head to serve in her inquiries the second of these was talkativeness a little better grown she seemed to be like a young wife and had an hundred tongues to spread her stories the third was censoriousness habited like a widow and surrounded with an hundred squinting eyes of a malignant influence which so obliquely darted on all around that it was impossible to say which of them had brought in the informations she boasted of these as i was informed had been very instrumental in preserving and rearing common fame when upon her birthday she was shuffled into a crowd to escape the search which truth might have made after her and her parents curiosity found here there talkativeness conveyed her away and censoriousness so nursed her up that in a short time she grew to a prodigious size and obtained an empire over the universe wherefore the power in gratitude for these services has since advanced them to her highest employments the next who came forward in this procession was a light damsel called credulity who carried behind them the lamp the silver vessel with a spout and other instruments proper for this solemn occasion she had formerly seen these three together and conjecturing from the number of their ears tongues and eyes that they might be the proper genii of attention familiar converse and ocular demonstration she from that time gave herself up to attend them the last who followed were some who had closely muffled themselves in upper garments so that i could not discern who they were but just as the soremost of them was come up i am glad says she calling me by my name to meet you at this time stay close by me and take a strict observation of all that passes her voice was sweet and commanding i thought i had somewhere heard it and from her as i went along i learned the meaning of every thing which offered  we now marched forward through the rookery of rumors which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us at length we arrived at the house of common fame where a hecatomb of reputations was that day to fall for her pleasure the house stood upon an eminence having a thousand passages to it and a thousand whispering holes for the conveyance of found the hall we entered was formed with the art of a music chamber for the improvement of noises rest and silence are banished the place stories of different natures wander in light flocks all about sometimes truths and lies or sometimes lies themselves clashing against one another in the middle stood a table painted after the manner of the remotest asiatic countries upon which the lamp the silver vessel and cups of a white earth were planted in order then dried herbs were brought collected for the solemnity in moonshine and water being put to them there was a greenish liquor made to which they added the flower of milk and an extraction from the canes of america for performing a libation to the infernal powers of mischief after this curiosity retiring to a withdrawingroom brought forth the victims being to appearance a set of small waxen images which she laid upon the table one after another immediately talkativeness gave each of them the name of some one whom for the time they were to represent and censoriousness stuck them all about with black pins still pronouncing at every one she stuck something to the prejudice of the persons represented no sooner were these rites performed and incantations uttered but the sound of a speaking trumpet was heard in the air by which they knew the deity of the place was propitiated and assisting upon this the sky grew darker a storm arose and murmurs sighs groans cries and the words of grief or resentment were heard within it thus the three sorceresses discovered that they whose names they had given to the images were already affected with what was done to them in essigy the knowledge of this was received with the loudest laughter and in many congratulatory words they applauded one anothers wit and power  as matters were at this high point of disorder the muffled lady whom i attended on being no longer able to endure such barbarous proceedings threw off her upper garment of reserve and appeared to be truth as soon as she had confessed herself present the speaking trumpet ceased to sound the sky cleared up the storm abated the noises which were heard in it ended the laughter of the company was over and a serene light till then unknown to the place was diffused around it at this the detected sorceresses endeavored to escape in a cloud which i saw began to thicken about them but it was soon dispersed their charms being controuled and prevailed over by the superior divinity for my part i was exceedingly glad to see it so and began to consider what punishments she would inflict upon them i fancied it would be proper to cut off curiositys ears and six them to the eaves of the houses to nail the tongue of talkativeness to indian tables and to put out the eyes of censoriousness with a flash of her light in respect of credulity i had indeed some little pity and had i been judge she might perhaps have escaped with a hearty reproof  but i soon found that the discerning judge had other designs she knew them for such as will not be destroyed entirely while mankind is in being and yet ought to have a brand and punishment affixed to them that they may be avoided wherefore she took a seat for judgment and had the criminals brought forward by shame ever blushing and trouble with a whip of many lashes two phantoms who had dogged the procession in disguise and waited till they had an authority from truth to lay hands upon them immediately then she ordered curiosity and talkativenees to be fettered together that the one should never suffer the other to rest nor the other ever let her remain undiscovered light credulity she linkt to shame at the tormenters own request who was pleased to be thus secure that her prisoner should not escape and this was done partly for her punishment and partly for her amendment censoriousness was also in like manner begged by trouble and had her assigned for an eternal companion after they were thus chained with one another by the judges order she drove them from the presence to wander for ever through the world with novelty stalking before them  the cause being now over she retreated from sight within the splendour of her own glory which leaving the house it had brightned the sounds that were proper to the place began to be as loud and consused as when we entered and there being no longer a clear distinguished appearance of any objects represented to me i returned from the excursion i had made in fancy  vision v whatever industry and eagerness the modern discoverers have shown for the knowledge of new countries there yet remains an ample field in the creation to which they are utter strangers and which all the methods of traveling hitherto invented will never bring them acquainted with of this i can give a very particular instance in an accident which lately happened to me  as i was on the  th of this instant being february      walking with my eyes cast upward i fell into a reflection on the vast tracts of air which appeared before me as uninhabited and wherefore said i to myself should all this space be created can it only be for an odd bird to fly through as now and then a man may pass a desert or are there also kingdoms with their particular polities and people of a species which we know nothing of ordained to live in it  it was in this manner i continued my thought when my feet forsook the level and i was insensibly mounted in the air till i arrived at a footing as firm and level as what i had left but with what surprise did i find myself among creatures distinct from us in shape and customs  the inhabitants are of a small stature below those which history describes for pigmies the tallest of them exceed not fourteen or fifteen inches and the least are hardly three this difference proceeds only from their growth before they are brought to light for after we never observe them to grow unless it please their parents who have this uncommon method of enabling them they recall them to the womb where having been for some time they receive an addition to their bulk then go back to their houses and continue at a stand as they did before the experiment has been often tried with success but some have suffered extremely by undergoing it  their skins are like the ancient britain all drawn over with a variety of figures the color made use of for this end is generally black i have indeed observed in some of the religious and lawyers of the country red here and there intermingled though not so commonly of late they tell me too they often used to paint with all colors and i visited two or three of the old inhabitants who were adorned in that fashion but this is now disused since the new inventions by which the use of a black fountain that belongs to that country is rendered more useful and serviceable  the clothes in which they go clad are the skins of beasts worn by some plain by others with figure wrought upon them gold is also made use of by some to beautify their apparel but very seldom silver unless as buckles are by us for fastening the garment before i have seen some of them go like seamen in thin blue shirts others like indians in a partycolored loose kind of apparel and others who they told me were the politicians of the country go about stark naked  the manner of dressing them is this at first when they come into the world they have a suit given them which if it do not fit exactly is not as with us fitted up again but the children are in a cruel manner cut and squeezed to bring them to its proportion yet this they seem not much to regard provided their principal parts are not affected when the dress is thus settled on them they are clad for life it being seldom their custom to alter it or put it off in short they live in it night and day and wear it to rags rather than part with it being sure of the same torture and a greater danger if they should be dressed a second time i have further taken notice that they delight to go open breasted most of them showing their bosoms speckled some lawyers indeed wear them quite white perhaps for distinction sake or to be known at a distance but the finest show is among the beaux and ladies who mightily affect something of gold both before and behind them  food i never saw them eat they being a people who as i observed live in air their houses are all single and high having no back rooms but frequently seven or eight stories which are all separate houses above one another they have one gate to their city and generally no doors to their houses though i have sometimes seen them have particular doors and even made of glass where the inhabitants have been observed to stand many days that their fine apparel may be seen through them if at any time they lie down which they do when they come from their habitations as if coming abroad were their greatest fatigue they will lie together in heaps without receiving hurt though the soundest sleep they get is when they can have dust enough to cover them over  the females amongst them are but few nothing being there produced by a marriage of sexes the males are of a different strength or endowment of parts some having knowledge in an extreme degree and others none at all yet at the same time they are mighty pretenders to instruct others their names for as many as would discover them to me i observed to be the very same as ours are upon earth i met a few who made theirs a mystery but why i am yet to learn they are so communicative that they will tell all the knowledge they boast if a stranger apply himself to their conversation and this may be worth his while if he considers that all languages arts and sciences are professed amongst them i think i may say it without vanity that i knew a certain talisman with proper figures and characters inscribed whereby their greatest people may be charmed brought to reside with a man and serve him like a familiar in the conduct of life  there is no such thing as fighting amongst them but their controversies are determined by words wherein they seldom own themselves conquered yet proceed no further than two or three replies perhaps indeed two others take up their neighbors quarrel but then they desist too after the same manner sometimes however blows have ensued upon their account though not amongst them in such a case they have descended to inspire mankind with their sentiments and chosen champions from among us in order to decide it  the time of their life is very different some die as soon as born and others in their youth some get a new lease of life by their entering into the womb again and if any weather it out to a hundred years they generally live on to an extreme age after which it is remarkable that instead of growing weaker as we do by time they increase in strength and become at last so confirmed in health that it is the opinion of their country they never can perish while the world remains  the sicknesses which may take them of besides what happens from their natural weakness of body are of different sorts one is overmoisture which affecting their mansions makes them lose their complexions become deformed and rot away insensibly this is often obviated by their not keeping too much within doors another is the worms which prey upon their bowels if they be maimed by accidents they become like us so far useless and that maim will some time or other be the occasion of their ruin however they perish by these means only in appearance and like spirits who vanish in one place to be seen in another but as men die of passions so disesteem is what the most nearly touches them then they withdraw into holes and corners and consume away in darkness or if they are kept alive a few days by the force of spices it is but a short reprieve from their perishing to eternity without any honor but that instead of a burial a small pyre of past should be erected over them while they like the ancient romans are reduced to ashes n b this vision is to be understood of a library of books   the life of zoilus and his remarks on homers battle of the frogs and mice vide quam iniqui sunt divinorum munerum aestimatores etiam quidam professi sapientiam seneca preface having some time ago heard that the translation of homers iliad would be attempted i resolved to confer with the gentleman who undertook it i found him of a tall presence and thoughtful countenance with his hands folded his eyes fixed and his beard untrimmd this i took to be a good omen because he thus resembled the constantinopolitan statue of homer which cedrenus describes and surely nothing could have been liker had he but arrived at the character of age and blindness as my business was to be my introduction i told him how much i was acquainted with the secret history of homer that no one better knows his own horse than i do the camel of bactria in which his soul resided at the time of the trojan wars that my acquaintance continued with him as he appeared in the person of the grecian poet that i knew him in his next transmigration into a peacock was pleased with his return to manhood under the name of ennius at rome and more pleased to hear he would soon revive under another name with all his full luster in england this particular knowledge added i which sprung from the love i bear him has made me fond of a conversation with you in order to the success of your translation  the civil manner in which he received my proposal encouraging me to proceed i told him there were arts of success as well as merits to obtain it and that he who now dealt in greek should not only satisfy himself with being a good grecian but also contrive to hasten into the repute of it he might therefore write in the title page translated from the original greek and select a motto for his purpose out of the same language he might obtain a copy of verses written in it to prefix to the work and not call the titles of each book the first and second but iliad alpha and beta he might retain some names which the world is least acquainted with as his old translator chapman uses ephaistus instead of vulcan baratrum for hell and if the notes were filled with greek verses it would more increase the wonder of many readers thus i went on when he told me smiling i had shown him indeed a set of arts very different from merit for which reason he thought he ought not to depend upon them a success says he founded on the ignorance of others may bring a temporary advantage but neither a conscious satisfaction nor future fame to the author men of sense despise the affectation which they easily see through and even they who were dazzled with it at first are no sooner informed of its being an affectation but they imagine it also a veil to cover imperfection  the next point i ventured to speak on was the sort of poetry he intended to use how some may fancy a poet of the greatest fire would be imitated better in the freedom of blank verse and the description of war sounds more pompous out of rhyme but will the translation said he be thus removed enough from prose without greater inconveniences what transpositions is milton forced to as an equivalent for want of rhyme in the poetry of a language which depends upon a natural order of words and even this would not have done his business had he not given the fullest scope to his genius by choosing a subject upon which there could be no hyperboles we see however he be deservedly successful that the ridicule of his manner succeeds better than the imitation of it because transpositions which are unnatural to a language are to be fairly derided if they ruin it by being frequently introduced and because hyperboles which outrage every lesser subject where they are seriously used are often beautiful in ridicule let the french whose language is not copious translate in prose but ours which exceeds it in copiousness of words may have a more frequent likeness of sounds to make the unison or rhyme easier a grace of music that atones for the harshness our consonants and monosyllables occasion  after this i demanded what air he would appear with whether antiquated like chapmans version or modern like la mottes contraction to which he answered by desiring me to observe what a painter does who would always have his pieces in fashion he neither chooses to draw a beauty in a ruff or a frenchhead but with its neck uncovered and in its natural ornament of hair curled up or spread becomingly so may a writer choose a natural manner of expressing himself which will always be in fashion without affecting to borrow an odd solemnity and unintelligible pomp from the past times or humouring the present by falling into its affectations and those phrases which are born to die with it  i asked him lastly whether he would be strictly literal or expatiate with further licenses i would not be literal replies he or tied up to line for line in such a manner wherein it is impossible to express in one language what has been delivered in another neither would i so expatiate as to alter my authors sentiments or add others of my own these errors are to be avoided on either hand by adhering not only to the word but the spirit and genius of an author by considering what he means with what beautiful manner he has expressed his meaning in his own tongue and how he would have expressed himself had it been in ours thus we ought to seek for homer in a version of homer other attempts are but transformations of him such as ovid tells us where the name is retained and the thing altered this will be really what you mentioned in the compliment you began with a transmigration of the poet from one country into another  here ended the serious part of our conference all i remember further was that having asked him what he designed with all those editions and comments i observed in his room he made answer that if any one who had a mind to find fault with his performance would but stay till it was entirely finished he should have a very cheap bargain of them  since this discourse i have often resolved to try what it was to translate in the spirit of a writer and at last chose the battle of the frogs and mice which is ascribed to homer and bears a nearer resemblance to his iliad than the culex does to the acneid of virgil statius and others think it a work of youth written as a prelude to his greater poems chapman thinks it the work of his age after he found men ungrateful to show he could give strength lineage and fame as he pleased and praise a mouse as well as a man thus says he the poet professedly flung up the world and applied himself at last to hymns now though this reason of his may be nothing more than a scheme formed out of the order in which homers works are printed yet does the conjecture that this poem was written after the iliad appear probable because of its frequent allusions to that poem and particularly that there is not a frog or a mouse killed which has not its parallel instance there in the death of some warrior or other  the poem itself is of the epic kind the time of its action the duration of two days the subject however its nature frivolous or ridiculous raised by having the most shining words and deeds of gods and heroes accommodated to it and while other poems often compare the illustrious exploits of great men to those of brutes this always heightens the subject by comparisons drawn from things above it we have a great character given it with respect to the fable in gaddius de script non eccles it appears says he nearer perfection than the iliad or odysses and excels both in judgment wit and exquisite texture since it is a poem perfect in its own kind nor does crusius speak less to its honor with respect to the moral when he cries out in an apostrophe to the reader whoever you are mind not the names of these little animals but look into the things they mean call them men call them kings or counselors or human polity itself you have here doctrines of every sort and indeed when i hear the frog talk concerning the mouses family i learn equality should be observed in making friendships when i hear the mouse answer the frog i remember that a similitude of manners should be regarded in them when i see their councils assembling i think of the bustles of human prudence and when i see the battle grow warm and glorious our struggles for honor and empire appear before me  this piece had many imitations of it in antiquity as the sight of the cats the cranes the starlings the spiders etc that of the cats is in the bodleian library but i was not so lucky as to find it i have taken the liberty to divide my translation into books though it be otherwise in the original according as the fable allowed proper restingplaces by varying its scene or nature of action this i did after the example of aristarchus and zenodotus in the iliad i then thought of carrying the grammarians example further and placing arguments at the head of each which i framed as follows in imitation of the short ancient greek inscriptions to the iliad book i in alpha the ground of the quarrel is found book ii in beta we the council see book iii dire gamma relates the work of the fates   but as i am averse from all information which lessens our surprise i only mention these for a handle to quarrel with the custom of long arguments before a poem it may be necessary in books of controversy or abstruse learning to write an epitome before each part but it is not kind to forestal us in the work of fancy and make our attention remiss by a previous account of the end of it  the next thing which employed my thoughts was the heroes names it might perhaps take off somewhat from the majesty of the poem had i cast away such noble sounds as physignathus lycopinax and crambophagus to substitute bluffcheek lickdish and cabbageeater in their places it is for this reason i have retained them untranslated however i place them in english before the poem and sometimes give a sfort character extracted out of their names as in polyphonus pternophagus etc that the reader may not want some light of their humor in the original  but what gave me a greater difficulty was to know how i should follow the poet when he inserted pieces of lines from his iliad and struck out a sprightliness by their new application to supply this in my translation i have added one or two of homers particularities and used two or three allusions to some of our english poets who most resemble him to keep up some image of this spirit of the original with an equivalent beauty to use more might make my performance seem a cento rather than a translation to those who know not the necessity i lay under  i am not ignorant after all my care how the world receives the best compositions of this nature a man need only go to a painters and apply what he hears said of a picture to a translation to find how he shall be used upon his own or his authors account there one spectator tells you a piece is extremely fine but he sets no value on what is not like the face it was drawn for while a second informs you such another is extremely like but he cares not for a piece of deformity though its likeness be never so exact  yet notwithstanding all which happens to the best when i translate i have a desire to be reckoned amongst them and i shall obtain this if the world will be so goodnatured as to believe writers that give their own characters upon which presumption i answer to all objections beforehand as follows  when i am literal i regard my authors words when i am not i translate in his spirit if i am low i choose the narrative style if high the subject required it when i am enervate i give an instance of ancient simplicity when affected i show a point of modern delicacy as for beauties there never can be one found in me which was not really intended and for any faults they proceeded from too unbounded fancy or too nice judgment but by no means from any defect in either of those faculties  the life of zoilus pendentem volo zoilum videre martial they who have discoursed concerning the nature and extent of criticism take notice that editions of authors the interpretations of them and the judgment which is passed upon each are the three branches into which the art divides itself but the last of these that directs in the choice of books and takes care to prepare us for reading them is by the learned bacon called the chair of the critics in this chair to carry on the figure have sat aristotle demetrius phaleraeus dionysius halicarnassensis cicero horace quintilian and longinus all great names of antiquity the censors of those ages which went before and the directors of those that come after them with respect to the natural and perspicuous manners of thought and a expression by which a correct and judicious genius may be able to write for the pleasure and profit of mankind  but whatever has been advanced by men really great in themselves has been also attempted by others of capacities either unequal to the undertaking or which have been corrupted by their passions and drawn away into partial violences so that we have sometimes seen the province of criticism usurped by such who judge with an obscure diligence and a certain dryness of understanding incapable of comprehending a figurative style or being moved by the beauties of imagination and at other times by such whose natural moroseness in general or particular designs of envy has rendered them indefatigable against the reputation of others  in this last manner is zoilus represented to us by antiquity and with a character so abandoned that his name has been since made use of to brand all succeeding critics of his complexion he has a load of infamy thrown upon him great in proportion to the fame of homer against whom he opposed himself if the one was esteemed as the very residence of wit the other is described as a profligate who would destroy the temple of apollo and the muses in order to have his memory preserved by the envious action i imagine it maybe no ungrateful undertaking to write some account of this celebrated person from whom so many derive their character and i think the life of a critic is not unseasonably put before the works of his poet especially when his censures accompany him if what he advances be just he stands here as a censor if otherwise he appears as an addition to the poets fame and is placed before him with the justice of antiquity in its sacrifices when because such a beast had offended such a deity he was brought annually to his altar to be slain upon it  zoilus us was born at amphipolis a city of thrace during the time in which the macedonian empire flourished who his parents were is not certainly known but if the appellation of thracian slave which the world applied to him be not merely an expression of contempt it proves him of mean extraction he was a disciple of one polycrates a sophist who had distinguished himself by writing against the great names of the ages before him and who when he is mentioned as his master is said to be particularly famous for a bitter accusation or invective against the memory of socrates in this manner is zoilus set out to posterity like a plant naturally baneful and having its poison rendered more acute and subtle by a preparation  in his person he was tall and meagre his complexion was pale and all the motions of his face were sharp he is represented by aelian with a beard nourished to a prodigious length and his head kept close shaved to give him a magisterial appearance his coat hung over his knees in a slovenly fashion his manners were formed upon an aversion to the customs of the world he was fond of speaking ill diligent to sow dissension and from the constant bent of his thought had obtained that sort of readiness for slander or reproach which is esteemed wit by the light opinion of some who take the remarks of ill nature for an understanding of mankind and the abrupt lashes of rudeness for the spirit of expression this at last grew to such a height in him that he became careless of concealing it he threw off all reserves and managements in respect of others and the passion so far took the turn of a frenzy that being one day asked why he spoke ill of every one it is says he because i am not able to do them ill though i have so great a mind to it such extravagant declarations of his general enmity made men deal with him as with the creature he affected to be they no more spoke of him as belonging to the species he hated and from henceforth his learned speeches or fine remarks could obtain no other title for him but that of the rhetorical dog  while he was in macedon he employed his time in writing and reciting what he had written in the schools of sophists his oratory says dionysius halicarnassensis was always of the demonstrative kind which concerns itself about praise or dispraise his subjects were the most approved authors whom he chose to abuse upon the account of their reputation and to whom without going round the matter in faint praises or artificial insinuations he used to deny their own characteristics with this gallantry of opposition did he censure xenophon for affectation plato for vulgar notions and isocrates for incorrectness demosthenes in his opinion wanted fire aristotle subtilty and aristophanes humor but as to have reputation was with him a sufficient cause of enmity so to have that reputation universal was what wrought his frenzy to its wildest degree for which reason it was homer with whom he was most implacably angry and certainly if envy choose its object for the power to give torment it should here if ever have the glory of fully answering its intentions for the poet was so worshipped by the whole age that his critic had not the common alleviation of the opinion of one other man to concur in his condemnation  zoilus however went on with indefatigable industry in a voluminous work which he entitled the  or censure of homer till having at last finished it he prepares to send it into the world with a pompous title at the head invented for himself by way of excellency and thus inserted after the manner of the ancients  zoilus the scourge of homer writ this against that lover of fables thus did he value himself upon a work which the world has not thought worth transmitting to us and but just left a specimen in five or six quotations which happen to be preserved by the commentators of that poet against whom he writ it if any one be fond to form a judgment upon him from these instances they are as follows il   he says homer is very ridiculous a word he was noted to apply to him when he makes such a god as apollo employ himself in killing dogs and mules il   homer is very ridiculous in describing diomedes helmet and armor as sparkling and in a blaze of fire about him for then why was he not burned by it il   when idaeus quitted his fine chariot which was entangld in the fight and for which he might have been slain the poet was a fool for making him leave his chariot he had better have run away in it il    when achilles makes priam lie out of his tent lest the greeks should hear of his being there the poet had no breeding to turn a king out in that manner od   the poet says ulysses lost an equal number out of each ship the critic says that is impossible od  0 he derides the men who were turned into swine and calls them homers poor little blubbering pigs the first five of these remarks are found in didymus the last in longinus   such as these are the cold jests and trifling quarrels which have been registered from a composition that according to the representation handed down to us was born in envy lived a short life in contempt and lies for ever buried with infamy  but as his design was judged by himself wonderfully well accomplished macedon began to be esteemed a stage too narrow for his glory and egypt which had then taken learning into its patronage the proper place where it ought to diffuse its beams to the surprise of all whom he would persuade to reckon themselves hitherto in the dark and under the prejudices of a false admiration however as he had prepared himself for the journey he was suddenly diverted for a while by the rumor of the olympic games which were at that time to be celebrated thither he steered his course full of the memory of herodotus and others who had successfully recited in that large assembly and pleased to imagine he should alter all greece in their notions of wit before he left it  upon his arrival he found the field in its preparation for diversion the chariots stood for the race carved and gilded the horses were led in costly trappings some practiced to wrestle some to dart the spear or whatever they designed to engage at in a kind of flourish beforehand others were looking on to amuse themselves and all gaily dressed according to the custom of those places through these did zoitus move forward baldheaded bearded to the middle its a long sadcolourd vestment and inflexibly stretching forth his hands filled with volumes rolled up to a vast thickness a figure most venerably slovenly able to demand attention upon account of its oddness and indeed he had no sooner fixed himself upon an eminence but a crowd flocked about him to know what he intended then the critic casting his eyes on the ring opened his volume slowly as considering with what part be might most properly entertain his audience it happened that the games at patroclus obsequies came first into his thought whether it was that he judged it suitable to the place or knew that he had fallen as well upon the games themselves as upon homer for celebrating them and could not resist his natural disposition to give mankind offense every one was now intently fastened upon him while he undertook to prove that those games signified nothing to the taking of troy and therefore only furnished an impertinent episode that the fall of the lesser ajax in cow dung the squabble of the chariotrace and other accidents which attend such sports are mean or trifling and a world of other remarks for which he still affirmed homer to be a fool and which they that heard him took for studied invectives against those exercises they were then employed in men who frequent sports as they are of a cheerful dispostion so are they lovers of poetry this together with the opinion they were affronted wrought them up to impatience and further licenses there was particularly a young athenian gentleman who was to run three chariots in those games who being an admirer of homer could no longer contain himself but cried out what in the name of castor have we here zoilus from thrace and as he said it struck him with a chariotwhip immediately then a hundred whips were seen curling round his head so that his face naturally deformed and heightened by pain to its utmost caricatura appeared in the midst of them as we may fancy the visage of envy if at any time her snakes rise in rebellion to lash their mistress nor was this all the punishment they decreed him when once they imagined he was zoilus the scyronian rocks were near em and thither they hurried him with a general cry to that speedy justice which is practiced at places of diversion  it is here that according to suidas the critic expired but we following the more numerous testimonies of other authors conclude he escaped either by the lowness of those rocks whence he was thrust or by bushes which might break his fall and soon after following the courses of his first intention he set sail for egypt  egypt was at this time governed by ptolemy philadelphus a prince passionately fond of learning and learned men particularly an admirer of homer to adoration he had built the finest library in the world and made the choicest as well as most numerous collection of books no encouragements were wanting from him to allure men of the brightest genius to his court and no time thought too much which he spent in their company from hence it is that we hear of eratosthenes and aristophanes those universal scholars and candid judges of other mens performances callimachus a poet of the most easy courteous delicacy famous for a poem on the cutting of berenices hair and whom ovid so much admired as to say it was reason enough for him to love a woman if she would but tell him he exceeded callimachus theocritus the most famous in the pastoral way of writing and among the young men aristarchus and apollonius rhodius the one of whom proved a most judicious critic the other a poet of no mean character  these and many more filled the court of that munificent prince whose liberal dispensations of wealth and favor became encouragements to every one to exert their parts to the utmost like streams which flow through different sorts of soils and improve each in that for which it was adapted by nature  such was the court when zoilus arrived but before he entered alexandria he spent a night in the temple of isis to enquire of the success of his undertaking not that he doubted the worth of his works but his late misfortune had instructed him that others might be ignorant of it having therefore performed the accustomed sacrifice and composed himself to rest upon the hide he had a vision which foretold of his future fame  he found himself sitting under the shade of a dark yew which was covered with hellebore and hemlock and near the mouth of a cave where sat a monster pale wasted surrounded with snakes fostring a cockatrice in her bosom and cursing the sun for making the work of the deities appear in its beauty the sight of this bred fear in him when she subddenly turning her sunk eyes put on a hideous kind of a loving grin in which he discovered a resemblance to some of his own features then turning up her snakes and interlacing them in the form of a turbant to give him less disgust thus she addressed herself go on my son in whom i am renewed and prosper in thy brave undertakings on mankind assert their wit to be dullness prove their sense to be folly know truth only when it is on thy own side and acknowledge learning at no other time to be useful spare not an author of any rank or size let not thy tongue or pen know pity make the living feel thy accusations make the ghosts of the dead groan in their tombs for their violated fame but why do i spend time in needless advice which may be better used in encouragement let thy eyes delight themselves with the future recompense which i have reserved for thy merit thus spoke the monster and shrieked the name of zoilus the shades who were to bear the same name after him became obedient and the mouth of the cave was filled with strange supercilious countenances which all crowded to make their appearance these began to march before him with an imitation of his mien and manners some crowned with wild sorrel others having leaves of dead bays mingled amongst it whilst the monster still described them as he passed and touched each with a livid track of malignant light that shot from her eye to point where she meant the description they says she in the chaplets of wild sorrel are my writers of prose who erect scandal into criticism they who wear the withered bay with it are such who write poems which are professedly to answer all rules and be left for patterns to men of genius these that follow shall attack others because they are excelled by them the next rank shall make an authors being read a sufficient ground of opposition here march my grammarians skilled to torture words there my sons of sophistry ever ready to wrest a meaning observe how faint the foremost of the procession appear and how they are now lost in yonder mists which roll about the cave of oblivion this shows it is not for themselves that they are to be known the world will consider them only as managing a part of thy endowments and so know them by thy name while they live that their own shall be lost for ever but see how my cave still swarms how every age produces men upon whom the preservation of thy memory devolves my darling the fates have decreed it thou art zoilus and zoilus shall be eternal come my serpents applaud him with your hisses that is all which now can be done in modern times my sons shall invent louder instruments and artificial imitations noises which drown the voice of merit shall furnish a concert to delight them here she arose to clasp him in her arms a strange noise was heard the critic started at it and his vision forsook him  it was with some confusion that he lay musing a while upon what he had seen but reflecting that the goddess had given him no answer concerning his success in egypt he strengthened his heart in his ancient selflove and enmity to others and took all for an idle dream born of the fumes of indigestion or produced by the dizzy motion of his voyage in this opinion he told it at his departure to the priest who admiring the extraordinary relation registered it in hieroglyphics at canopus  the day when he came to alexandria was one on which the king had appointed games to apollo and the muses and honors and rewards for such writers as should appear in them this he took for a happy omen at his entrance and not to lose an opportunity of showing himself repaired immediately to the public theater where as if every thing was to favor him the very first accident gave his spleen a diversion which we find at large in the proem of the seventh book of vitruvius it happened that when the poets had recited six of the judges decreed the prizes with a full approbation of all the audience from this aristophanes alone dissented and demanded the first prize for a person whose bashful and interrupted manner of speaking made him appear the most disgustful for he says the judge is alone a poet and all the rest reciters and they who are judges should not approve thefts but writings to maintain his assertion those volumes were produced from whence they had been stolln upon which the king ordered them to be formally tried for theft and dismissed with infamy but placed aristophanes over his library as one who had given a proof of his knowledge in books this passage zoilus often afterward repeated with pleasure for the number of disgraces which happened in it to the pretenders in poetry though his envy made him still careful not to name aristophanes but a judge in general  however criticism had only a short triumph over poetry when he made the next turn his own by stepping forward into the place of reciting here he immediately raised the curiosity and drew the attention of both king and people but as it happened neither the one nor the other lasted for the first sentence where he had registered his own name satisfied their curiosity and the next where he offered to prove to a court so devoted to homer that he was ridiculous in every thing went near to finish his audience he was nevertheless heard quietly for some time till the king seeing no end of his abusing the prince of philological learning as vitruvius words it departed in disdain the judges followed deriding his attempt as an extravagance which could not demand their gravity and the people taking a license from the precedent hooted him away with obloquy and indignation thus zoilus failed at his first appearance and was forced to retire stung with a most impatient sense of public contempt  yet notwithstanding all this he did not omit his attendance at court on the day following with a petition that he might be put upon the establishment of learning and allowed a pension this the king read but returned no answer so great was the scorn he conceived against him but zoilus still undauntedly renewed his petitions till ptolemy being weary of his persecution gave him a flat denial homer says the prince who has been dead these thousand years has maintained thousands of people and zoilus who boasts he has more wit than he ought not only to maintain himself but many others also  his petitions being thrown carelessly about were fallen into the hands of men of wit whom according to his custom he had provoked and whom it is unsafe to provoke if you would live unexposd i can compare them to nothing more properly than to the be a creature winged and lively fond to rove through the choicest flowers of nature and blessed at home among the sweets of its own composition not illnatured yet quick to revenge an injury not wearing its sting out of the sheath yet able to wound more sorely than its appearance would threaten now these being made personal enemies by his malicious expressions the court rung with petitions of zoilus transversd new petitions drawn up for him catalogues of his merits supposed to be collected by himself his complaints of mans injustice set to a harp out of tune and a hundred other sports of fancy with which their epigrams played upon him these were the ways of writing which zoilus hated because they were not only read but retained easily by reason of their spirit humor and brevity and because they not only make the man a jest upon whom they are written but a farther jest if he attempt to answer them gravely however he did what he could in revenge he endeavored to set those whom he envied at variance among themselves and invented lies to promote his design he told eratosthenes that callimachus said his extent of learning consisted but in a superficial knowledge of the sciences and whispered callimachus that eratosthenes only allowed him to have an artful habitual knack of versifying he would have made aristophanes believe that theocritus rallied his knowledge in editions as a curious kind of trifling and theocritus that aristophanes derided the rustical simplicity of his shepherds though of all his stories that which be most valued himself for was his constant report that every one whom he hated was a friend to antiochus king of syria the enemy of ptolemy  but malice is unsuccessful when the character of its agent is known they grew more friends to one another by imagining that even what had been said as well as what had not was all of zoiluss invention and as he grew more and more the common jest their derision of him became a kind of life and cement to their conversation  contempt poverty and other misfortunes had now so assaulted him that even they who abhorred his temper contributed something to his support in common humanity yet still his envy like a vitiated stomach converted every kindness to the nourishment of his disease and twas the whole business of his life to revile homer and those by whom he himself subsisted in this humor he had days which were so given up to impatient ill nature that he could neither write any thing nor converse with anyone these he sometimes employed in throwing stones at children which was once so unhappily returned upon him that he was taken up for dead and this occasioned the report in some authors of his being stoned to death in egypt or sometimes he conveyed himself into the library where he blotted the name of homer wherever he could meet it and tore the best editions of several volumes for which the librarians debarred him the privilege of that place these and other mischiefs made him universally shunned nay to such an extravagance was his character of envy carried that the more superstitious egyptians imagined they were fascinated by him if the day were darker or themselves a little heavier than ordinary some wore sprigs of rue by way of prevention and others rings made of the hoof of a wild ass for amulets lest they should suffer by his fixing an eye upon them  it was now near the time when that splendid temple which ptolemy built in honor of homer was to be opened with a solemn magnificence for this the men of genius were employed in finding a proper pageant at last they agreed by one consent to have zoilus the utter enemy of homer hanged in effigy and the day being come it was on this manner they formed the procession twelve beautiful boys lightly habited in white with purple wings representing the hours went on the foremost after these came a chariot exceeding high and stately where sat one representing apollo with another at his feet who in thig pomp sustained the person of homer apollos laurel had little gilded points like the appearance of rays between its leaves homers was bound with a blue sillet like that which is worn by the priests of the deity apollo was distinguished by the golden harp he bore homer by a volume richly beautified with horns of inlaid ivory and tassels of silver depending from them behind these came three chariots in which rode nine damsels each of them with that instrument which is proper to each of the muses among whom calliope to give her the honor of the day sat in the middle of the second chariot known by her richer vestments after these marched a solemn train aptly habited like those sciences which acknowledge their rise or improvement from this poet then the men of learning who attended the court with wreaths and rods or scepters of laurel as taking upon themselves the representation of rhapsodists to do honor for the time to homer in the rear of all was slowly drawn along an odd carriage rather than a chariot which had its sides artfully turned and carved so as to bear a resemblance to the heads of snarling mastiffs in this was borne as led in triumph a tall image of deformity whose head was bald and wound about with nettles for a chaplet the tongue lay lolling out to show a contempt of mankind and was forkd at the end to confess its love to detraction the hands were manacled behind and the fingers armed with long nails to cut deep through the margins of authors its vesture was of the paper of nilus bearing inscribed upon its breast in capital letters zoilus the homeromastix and all the rest of it was scrawld with various monsters of that river as emblems of those productions with which that critic used to fill his papers when they had reached the temple where the king and his court were already placed to behold them from its galleries the image of zoilus was hung upon a gibbet there erected for it with such loud acclamations as witnessed the peoples satisfaction this being finished the hours knocked at the gates which flew open and discovered the statue of homer magnificently seated with the pictures of those cities which contended for his birth ranged in order around him then they who represented the deities in the procession laying aside their ensigns of divinity ushered in the men of learning with a sound of voices and their various instruments to assist at a sacrifice in honor of apollo and his favorite homer  it may be easily believed that zoilus concluded his affairs were at the utmost point of desperation in egypt wherefore filled with pride scorn anger vexation envy and whatever could torment him except the knowledge of his unworthiness he flung himself aboard the first ship which left that country as it happened the vessel he sailed in was bound for asia minor and this landing him at a port the nearest to smyrna he was a little pleased amidst his misery to think of decrying homer in another place where he was adored and which chiefly pretended to his birth so incorrigible was his disposition that no experience taught him anything which might contribute to his ease and safety  and as his experience wrought nothing on him so neither did the accidents which the opinion of those times took for ominous warnings for he is reported to have seen the night he came to smyrna a venerable person such as homer is described by antiquity threatening him in a dream and in the morning he found a part of his works gnawed by mice which says aelian are of all beasts the most prophetic insomuch that they know when to leave a house even before its fall is suspected envy which has no relaxation still hurried him forward for it is certainly true that a man has not firmer resolution from reason to stand by a good principle than obstinacy from perverted nature to adhere to a bad one  in the morning as he walked the street he observed in some plates inscriptions concerning homer which informed him where he lived where he had taught school and several other particularities which the smyrneans glory to have recorded of him all which awakened and irritated the passions of zoilus but hit temper was quite overthrown by the venerable appearance which he saw upon entering the homereum which is a building composed of a library porch and temple erected to homer here a phrenzy seited him which knew no bounds he raved violently against the poet and all his admirers he trampled on his works he spurned about his commentators he tore down his busts from the niches threw the medals that were cast of him out of the windows and passing from one place to another beat the aged priests and broke down the altar the cries which were occasioned by this means brought in many upon him who observed with horror how the most sacred honors of their city were profaned by the frantic impiety of a stranger and immediately dragged him to punishment before their magistrates who were then sitting he was no sooner there but known for zoilus by some in court a name a long time most hateful to smyrna which as it valued itself upon the birth of homer so bore more impatiently than other places the abuses offered him this made them eager to propitiate his shade and claim to themselves a second merit by the death of zoilus wherefore they sentenced him to suller by fire as the due reward of his desecrations and ordered that their city should be purified by a lustration for having entertained so impious a guest in pursuance to this sentence he was led away with his compositions born before him by the public executioner then was he fastened to the stake prophesying all the while how many should arise to revenge his quarrel particularly that when greek should be no more a language there shall be a nation which will both translate homer into prose and contract him in verse at last his compositions were lighted to set the pile on fire and he expired sighing for the loss of them more than for the pain he suffered and perhaps too because he might foresee in his prophetic rapture that there should arise a poet in another nation able to do homer justice and make him known amongst his people to future ages  thus died this noted critic of whom we may observe from the course of the history that as several cities contended for the honor of the birth of homer so several have contended for the honor of the death of zoilus with him likewise perished his great work on the iliad and the odysse concerning which we observe also that as the known worth of homers poetry makes him survive himself with glory so the bare memory of zoiluss criticism makes him survive himself with infamy these are deservedly the consequences of that ill nature which made him fond of detraction that envy which made him choose so excellent a character for its object and those partial methods of injustice with which he treated the object he had chosen  yet how many commence critics after him upon the same unhappy principles how many labor to destroy the monuments of the dead and summon up the great from their graves to answer for trifles before them how many by misrepresentations both hinder the world from favoring men of genius and discourage them in themselves like boughs of a baneful and barren nature that shoot across a fruittree at once to screen the sun from it and hinder it by their droppings from producing any thing of value but if these who thus follow zoilus meet not the same severities of fate because they come short of his indefatigableness or their object is not so universally the concern of mankind they shall nevertheless meet a proportion of it in the inward trouble they give themselves and the outward contempt others fling upon them a punishment which every one has hitherto felt who has really deserved to be called a zoilus and which will always be the natural reward of such mens actions as long as zoilus is the proper name of envy  zoiluss remarks ingenium magni livor detrectat amici quisquis et ex illo zoile nomen habes  i must do my reader the justice before i enter upon these notes of zoilus to inform him that i have not in any author met this work ascribed to him by its title which has made me not mention it in the life but thus much in general appears that he wrote several things besides his censure on the iliad which as it gives ground for this opinion encourages me to offer an account of the treatise  being acquainted with a grave gentleman who searches after editions purchases manuscripts and collects copies i applied to him for some editions of this poem which he readily obliged me with but added he taking down a paper i doubt i shall discourage you from your translation when i show this work which is written upon the original by zoilus the famous adversary of homer zoilus said i with surprise i thought his works had long since perished they have so answered he all except this little piece which has a preface annexed to it accounting for its preservation it seems when he parted from macedon he left this behind him where he lodged and where no one entered for a long time in detestation of the odiousness of his character till maevius arriving there in his travels and being desirous to lie in the same room luckily found it and brought it away with him this the author of the preface imagines the reason of horaces wishing maevius in the  0th epode such a shipwreck as homer describes as it were with an eye to his having done something disadvantageous to that poet from maevius the piece came into the hand of carbilius pictor who when he wrote against virgil called his book with a respectful imitation of zoilus the aeneidomastix and from him into the hands of others who are unknown because the world applied to them no other name than that of zoilus in order to sink their own in oblivion thus it ever found some learned philologist or critic to keep it secret from the rage of homers admirers yet not so secret but that it has still been communicated among the literati i am of opinion that our great scaliger borrowed it to work him up when he writ so sharply against cardan and perhaps le clerc too when he proved q curtius ignorant of every particular branch of learning  this formal account made me give attention to what the book contained and i must acknowledge that whether it be his or the work of some grammarian it appears to be writ in his spirit the open profession of enmity to great geniuss and the fear of nothing so much as that he may not be able to find faults enough are such resemblances of his strongest features that any one might take it for his own production to give the world a notion of this i have made a collection of some remarks which most struck me during that short time in which i was allowed to peruse the manuscript  the remarks of zoilus upon homers battle of the frogs and mice page    ver    to fill my rising song as protagoras the sophist found fault with the beginning of the iliad for its speaking to the muse rather with an abrupt command than a solemn invocation so i says zoilus done the other hand find fault with him for using any invocation at all before this poem or any such trifles as he is the author of if he must use one protagoras is in the right if not i am this i hold for true criticism notwithstanding the opinion of aristotle against us nor let any one lay a stress on aristotle in this point he alas knows nothing of poetry but what he has read in homer his rules are all extracted from him or founded in him in short homers works are the examples of aristotles precepts and aristotles precepts the methods homer wrought by from hence it is to be concluded as the opinion of this critic that whoever would entirely destroy the reputation of homer must renounce the authority of aristotle beforehand the rules of building may be of service to us if we design to judge of an edifice and discover what may be amiss in it for the advantage of future artificers but they are of no use to those who only intend to overthrow it utterly  after the word song in the first line the original adds what i have written in my tablets these words which are dropped in the translation as of no consequence the great zoilus has thought fit to expunge asserting for a reason without backing it with farther proof that tablets were it not of fo early invention now it must be granted this manner of proving by affirmation is of an extraordinary nature but however it has its end with a set of readers for whom it is adapted one part of the world knows not with what assurance another part can express itself they imagine a reasonable creature will not have the face to say any thing which has not some shadow of reason to support it and run implicitly into the snare which is laid for goodnature by these daring authors of definitive sentences upon bare assertion  page    ver    whom cats pursued the greek word here expressly signifies a cat zoilus whom perizonius follows affirms it was weezels which the mouse fled from and then objects against its probability but it is common with one sort of critics to show an author means differently from what he really did and then to prove that the meaning which they find out for him is good for nothing  page    ver   if worthy friendship in this proposal begins the moral of the whole piece which is that hasty illfounded or unnatural friendships and leagues will naturally end in war and discord but zoilus who is here mightily concerned to take off from homer all the honor of having designed a moral asserts on the other hand that the poets whole intent was to make a fable that a fable he has made and one very idle and trifling that many things are ascribed to homer which poor homer never dreamed of and he who finds them out rather shows his own parts than discovers his authors beauties in this opinion has he been followed by several of those critics who only dip into authors when they have occasion to write against them and yet even these shall speak differently concerning the writers if the question be of their own performances for to their own works they write prefaces to display the grandness of the moral regularity of the scheme number and brightness of the figures and a thousand other excellencies which if they did not tell no one would ever imagine for others they write remarks which tend to contract their excellencies within the narrow compass of their partial apprehesion it were well if they could allow such to be as wise as themselves whom the world allows to be much wiser but their being naturally friends to themselves and professedly adversaries to some greater genius easily accounts for these different manners of speaking i will not leave this note without giving you an instance of its practice in the great julius scaliger he has been free enough with homer in the remarks he makes upon him but when he speaks of himself i desire my reader would take notice of his modesty i give his own words lib   poet cap     in deum patrem hymnum cum scriberemus tanquam rerum omnium conditorem ab orbis ipsius creatione ad nos nostraque usque duximus  in quo abduximus animum nostrum a corporis carcere ad liberos campos contemplationis quae me in illum transformaret tum autem sanctissimi spiritus ineffabilis vigor ille canto ardore celebratus est ut cum lenissimis numeris esset inchoatus hymnus repentino divini ignis impetu conslagravit  page    ver   the circled loaves zoilus here finds fault with the mention of loaves tripes bacon and cheese as words below the dignity of the epic as much says he as it would be to have opprobrious names given in it by which expression we easily see he hints at the first book of the iliad now we must consider in answer that it is a mouse which is spoken of that eating is the most appearing chatacteristic of that creature that these foods are such as please it most and to have described particular pleasures for it in any other way would have been as incongruous as to have described a haughty loud anger without those names which it throws out in its fierceness and which raise it to its pitch of phrenzy in the one instance you still see a mouse before you however the poet raises it to a man in the other you shall see a man before you however the poet raises him to a demigod but some call that low which others call natural every thing has two handles and the critic who sets himself to censure all he meets is under an obligation still to lay hold on the worst of them  page    ver   but me nor stalks in this place zoilus laughs at the ridiculousness of the poet who according to his representation makes a prince refuse an invitation in heroics because he did not like the meat he was invited to and that the ridicule may appear in as strong a light to others as to himself he puts as much of the speech as concerns it into burlesque airs and expressions this is indeed a common trick with remarkers which they either practice by precedent from their master zoilus or are beholden for it to the same turn of temper we acknowledge it a fine piece of satire when there is folly in a passage to lay it open in the way by which it naturally requires to be exposed do this handsomely and the author is deservedly a jest  on the contrary you dress a passage which was not originally foolish in the highest humor of ridicule you only frame something which the author himself might laugh at without being more nearly concerned than another render  page    ver   so passed europa this simile makes zoilus who sets up for a professed enemy of fables to exclaim violently we had says he a frog and a mouse hitherto and now we get a bull and a princess to illustrate their actions when will there be an end of this fablingfolly and poetry which i value myself for being unacquainted with o great polycrates how happily have thou observed in thy accusation against socrates that whatever he was before he deserved his poison when he began to make verses now if the question be concerning homers good or bad poetry this is an unqualifying speech which affords his friends just grounds of exception against the critic wherefore be it known to all present and future cenfors who haver or shall presume to glory in an ignorance of poetry and at the same time take upon them to judge of poets that they are in all their degrees for evere excluded the post they would usurp in the first place they who know neither the use nor practice of the art in the second they who know it but by halves who have hearts insensible of the beauties of poetry and are however able to find fault by rules and thirdly they who when they are capable of perceiving beauties and pointing out defects are still so ignorant in the nature of their business as to imagine the province of criticism extends itself only on the side of dispraise and reprehension how could any one at this rate be seen with his proper balance of perfection and error or what were the best performances in this indulgence of ill nature but as apartments hung with the deformities of humanity done by some great hand which are the more to be abhorred because the praise and honor they receive results from the degree of uneasiness to which they put every temper of common goodness  page    ver    ye mice ye mice the ancients believed that heroes were turned into demigods at their death and in general that departing fouls have something of a sight into futurity it is either this notion or a care which the gods may take to abate the pride of insulting adversaries which a poet goes upon when he makes his leaders die foretelling the end of those by whom they are slain zoilus however is against this passage he says that every character ought to be strictly kept that a general ought not to invade the character of a prophet nor a prophet of a general he is positive that nothing should be done by any one without having been hinted at in some previous account of him and this he asserts without any allowance made either for a change of states or the design of the gods to confirm this observation he strengthens it with a quotation out of his larger work on the iliad where he has these words upon the death of hector how foolish is it in homer to make hector who through the whole course of the iliad had made use of helenus to learn the will of the gods becomes prophet just at his death let every one be what he ought without falling into those parts which others are to sustain in a poem this he has said not distinguishing rightly between our natural dispostions and accidental offices and this he has said again not minding that though it be taken from another book it is still from the same author however vanity loves to gratify itself by the repetition of what it esteems to be written with spirit and even when we repeat it ourselves provided another hears us hence has he been followed by a magisterial set of men who quote themselves and swell their new perfomances with what they admire in their former treatises this is a most extraordinary knack of arguing whereby a man can never want a proof if he be allowed to become an authority for his own opinion  page    ver    and no kind billow how impertinent is this case of pity says zoilus to bemoan that the prince was not tossed toward land it is enough he lost his life and there is an end of his suffering where there is an end of his feeling to carry the matter farther is just the same foolish management as homer has shown in his iliads which he spins out into forty trifles beyond the death of hector but the critic must allow me to put the renders in mind that death was not the last distress the ancients believed was to be met upon earth the last was the remaining unburyd which had this misery annexed that while the body was without its funeralrites in this world the soul was supposed to be without rest in the next which was the case of the mouse before us and accordingly the ajax of sophocles continues after the death of its hero more than an act upon the contest concerning his burial all this zoilus knew very well but zoilus is not the only one who disputes for victory rather than truth these foolish to show how much they can write against an author they act unfairly that they may be sure to be sharp enough and trifle with the reader in order to be voluminous it is needless to wish them the return they deserve their disregard to candor is no sooner discovered but they are for ever banished from the eyes of men of sense and condemned to wander from stall to stall for a temporary refuge from that oblivion which they cannot escape  page    ver   our eldest perished zoilus had here taken the recapitulation of those misfortunes which happened to the royal family as an impertinence that expatiates from the subject though indeed there seems nothing more proper to raise that sort of compassion which was to inslame his audience to war but what appears extremely pleasant is that at the same time he condemns the passage he should make use of it as an opportunity to fall into an ample digression on the various kinds of mousetraps and display that minute learning which every critic of his sort is fond to show himself master of this they imagine is tracing of knowledge through its hidden veins and bringing discoveries to daylight which time had covered over indefatigable and useless mortals who value themselves for knowledge of no consequence and think of gaining applause by what the reader is careful to pass over unread what did the disquisition signify formerly whether ulyssess son or his dog was the elder or how can the account of a vesture or a players masque deserve that any should write the bulk of a treatise or others read it when it is written a vanity thus poorly supported which neither affords pleasure nor profit is the unsubstantial amusement of a dream to ourselves and a provoking occasion of our derision to others  page    ver       quills aptly bound  faced with the plunder of a cat they flayed this passage is something difficult in the original which gave zoilus the opportunity of inventing an expression which his followers conceitedly use when any thing appears dark to them this say they let phoebus explain as if what exceeds their capacity must of necessity demand oracular interpretations and an interposal of the god of wit and learning the basis of such arrogance is the opinion they have of that knowledge they ascribe to themselves they take criticism to be beyond every other part of learning because it gives judgment upon books written in every other part they think in consequence that every critic must be a greater genius than any author whom he censures and therefore if they esteem themselves critics they set enthroned infancy at the head of literature criticism indeed deserves a noble elogy when it is enlarged by such a comprehensive learning as aristotle and cicero were masters of when it adorns its precepts with the consummate exactness of quintilian or is exalted into the sublime sentiments of longinus but let not such men tell us they participate in the glory of these great men and place themselves next to phoebus who like zoilus entangle an author in the wrangles of grammarians or try him with a positive air and barren imagination by the set of rules they have collected out of others  page  0 ver   ye frogs the mice at this speech of the heralds which recites the cause of the war zoilus is angry with the author for not finding out a cause entirely just for says he it appears not from his own fable that physignathus invited the prince with any malicious intention to make him away to this we answer  st that it is not necessary in relating facts to make every war have a just beginning  dly this doubtful cause agrees better with the moral by showing that illfounded leagues have accidents to destroy them even without the intention of parties  dly there was all appearance imaginable against the frogs and if we may be allowed to retort on our adversary the practice of his posterity there is more humanity in an hostility proclaimed upon the appearance of injustice done us than in their custom of attacking the works of others as soon as they come out purely because they are esteemed to be good their performances which could derive no merit from their own names are then sold upon the merit of their antagonist and if they are so sensible of fame or even of envy they have the mortification to remember how much by this means they become indebted to those they injure  page  0 ver    where high the banks this project is not put in practice during the following battle by reason of the fury of the combatants yet the mention of it is not impertinent in this place forasmuch as the probable face of success which it carties with it tended to animate the frogs zoilus however cannot be so satisfied it were better says he to cut it entirely out nor wond homer be the worse if half of him were served in the same manner so continues he they will find it whoever in any country shall hereafter undertake so odd a task as that of translating him thus envy finds words to put in the mouth of ignorance and the time will come when ignorance shall repeat what envy has pronounced so rashly  page    ver    and tapring seareeds if we here take the reed for that of our own growth it is no spear to match the long sort of needles with which the mice had armed themselves but the cane which is rather intended has its splinters stiff and sharp to answer all the uses of a spear in battle nor is it here to be lightly past over since zoilus moves a question upon it that the poet could not choose a more proper weapon for the frogs than that which they choose for themselves in a defensive war they maintain with the serpents of nile they have this stratagem says aelian to protect themselves they swim with pieces of cane across their mouths of too great a length for the breadth of the serpents throats by which means they are preserved from being swallowed by them this is a quotation so much to the point that i ought to have ushered in my author with more pomp to dazzle the reader zoilus and his followers who seldom praise any man are however careful to do it for their own sakes if at any time they get an author of their opinion though indeed it must be allowed they still have a drawback in their manner of praise and rather choose to drop the name of their man or darkly hint him in a periphrasis than to have it appear that they have directly assisted the perpetuating of any ones memory thus if a dutch critic were to introduce for example martial he would instead of naming him say ingeniosus ille epigrammaticus bilbilicus or if one of our own were to quote from among ourselves he would tell us how it has been remarked in the works of a learned writer to whom the world is obliged for many excellent productions etc all which proceeding is like boasting of our great friends when it is to do ourselves an honor or the shift of dressing up one who might otherwise be disregarded to make him pass upon the world for a responsible voucher to our own assertions  page    ver    but now where joves at this fine episode in which the gods are introduced zoilus has no patience left him to remark but runs some lines with a long string of such expressions as trifler fabler liar foolish impious all which he lavishly heaps upon the poet from this knack of calling names joined with the several arts of finding fault it is to be suspected that our zoiluss might make very able libellers and dangerous men to the government if they did not rather turn themselves to be ridiculous censors for which reason i cannot but reckon the state obliged to men of wit and under a kind of debt in gratitude when they take off so much spleen turbulency and ill nature as might otherwise spend itself to the detriment of the public  page    ver   if my daughters mind this speech which jupiter speaks to pallas with a pleasant kind of air zoilus takes gravely to pieces and affirms it is below jupiters wisdom and only agreeable with homers folly that he should borrow a reason for her assisting the mice from their attendance in the temple when they waited to prey upon those things which were sacred to her but the air of the speech rendering a grave answer unnecessary i shall only offer zoilus an observation in return for his there are upon the stone which is carved for the apotheosis of homer figures of mice by his footstool which according to cuperus its interpreter some have taken to signify this poem and others those critics who tear or vilify the works of great men now if such can be compared to mice let the words of zoilus be brought home to himself and his followers for their mortification that no one ought to think of meriting in the state of learning only by debasing the best performances and as it were preying upon those things which should be sacred in it  page    ver    in vain my father the speech of pallas is disliked by zoilus because it makes the goddess carry a resentment against such inconsiderable creatures though he ought to esteem them otherwise when they represent the persons and actions of men and teach us how the gods disregard those in their adversities who provoke them in prosperity but if we consider pallas as the patroness of learning we may by an allegorical application of the mice and frogs find in this speech two sorts of enemies to learning they who are maliciously mischievous as the mice and they who are turbulent through ostentation as the frogs the first are enemies to excellency upon principle the second accidentally by the error of selflove which does not quarrel with the excellence itself but only with those people who get more praise than themselves by it thus though they have not the same perverseness with the others they are however drawn into the same practices while they ruin reputations lest they should not seem to be learned as some women turn prostitutes lest they should not be thought handsome enough to have admirers  page    ver   their dreadful trumpets upon the reading of this zoilus becomes full of discoveries he recollects that homer makes his greeks come to battle with silence and his trojans with shouts from whence he discovers that he knew nothing of trumpets again he sees that the hornet is made a trumpeter to the battle and hence he discovers that the line must not be homers now had he drawn his consequences fairly he could only have found by the one that trumpets were not in use at the taking of troy and by the other that the battle of frogs and mice was laid by the poet for a later scene of action than that of the iliad but the boast of discoveries accompanies the affectation of knowledge and the affectation of knowledge is taken up with a design to gain a command over the opinions of others it is too heavy a task for some critics to sway our rational judgments by rational inferences a pompous pretense must occasion admiration the eyes of mankind must be obscured by a glare of pedantry that they may consent to be led blindfold and permit that an opinion should be dictated to them without demanding that they may be reasoned into it  page    ver    big seutlaeus tumbling zoilus has happened to brush the dust of some old manuscript in which the line that kills seutlaeus is wanting and for this cause he fixes a general conclusion that there is no dependence upon any thing which is handed down for homers so as to allow it praise since the different copies vary amongst themselves but is it fair in zoilus or any of his followers to oppose one copy to a thousand and are they impartial who would pass this upon us for an honest balance of evidence when there is such an inequality on each side is it not more than probable that the number carry the authors sense in them and the single one its transcribers errors it is folly or madness of passion to be thus given over to partiality and prejudices men may flourish as much as they please concerning the value of a newfound edition in order to bias the world to particular parts of it but in a matter easily decided by common sense it will still continue of its own opinion  page    ver    with borbocaetes fights through the grammatical part of zoiluss work he frequently rails at homer for his dialects these says he in one place the poet made use of because he could not write pure greek and in another they strangely contributed to his fame by making several cities who observed something of their own in his mixed language contend for his being one of their natives now since i have here practiced a license in imitation of his by shortning the word borbocaetes a whole syllable it seems a good opportunity to speak for him where i defend myself remember then that any great genius who introduces poetry into a language has a power to polish it and of all the manners of speaking then in use to settle that for poetical which he judges most adapted to the art take notice too that homer has not only done this for necessity but for ornament since he uses various dialects to humor his sense with sounds which are expressive of it thus much in behalf of my author to answer zoilus as for myself who deal with his followers i must argue from necessity that the word was stubborn and would not ply to the quantities of an english verse and therefore i altered it by the dialect we call poetical which makes my line so much smoother that i am ready to cry with their brother lipsius when he turned an o into an i vel ego me amo vel me amavit phoebus quando hoc correxi to this let me add a recrimination upon some of them as  st such as choose words written after the manner of those who preceded the purest age of a language without the necessity i have pleaded as regundi for regendi perduit for perdidit which restoration of obsolete words deserves to be called a critical license or dialect  dly those who pretending to verse without an ear use the poetical dialect of abbreviation so that the lines shall run the rougher for it and  dly those who presume by their critical licenses to alter the spellings of words an affectation which destroys the etymology of a language and being carried on by private hands for fancy or fashion would be a thing we should never have an end  page    ver    nor pallas jove i cannot says zoilus reflect upon this speech of mars is where a mouse is opposed to the god of war the goddess of valor the thunder of jupiter and all the gods at once but i rejoice to think that pythagoras saw homers soul in hell hanging on a tree and surrounded with serpents for what he said of the gods thus he who hates fables answers one with another and can rejoice in them when they flatter his envy he appears at the head of his squadron of critics in the full spirit of one utterly devoted to a party with whom truth is a lie or as bad as a lie when it makes against him and false quotations pass for truth or as good as truth when they are necessary to a cause  page    ver    and a whole war here says zoilus is an end of a very foolish poem of which by this time i have effectually convinced the world and silenced all such for the future who like homer write fables to which others find morals characters whose justness is questioned unnecessary digressions and impious episodes but what assurance can such a zoilus have that the world will ever be convinced against an established reputation by such people whose faults in writing are so very notorious who judge against rules affirm without reasons and censure without manners who quote themselves for a support of their opinions found their pride upon a learning in trifles and their superiority upon the claims they magisterially make who write of beauties in a harsh style judge of excellency with a lowness of spirit and pursue their desire to decry it with every artifice of envy there is no disgrace in being censured where there is no credit to be favored but on the contrary envy gives a testimony of some perfection in another and one who is attacked by many is like a hero whom his enemies acknowledge for such when they point all the spears of a battle against him in short an author who writes for every age may even erect himself a monument of those stones which envy throws at him while the critic who writes against him can have no fame because he had no success or if he fancies he may succeed he should remember that by the nature of his undertaking he would but undermine his own foundation for he is to sink of course when the book which he writes against and for which alone he is read is lost in disrepute or oblivion  the end of mr parnells works as published by mr pope

spread the beasts afford a rich manure fly my boys and bring the lure up the mountains down the vales through the woods and over the dales for this if full the clusters grow your bowls shall doubly overflow so cheered with more officious haste they bring the dung of every beast the loads they wheel the roots they bare they lay the rich manure with care while often he calls to labor hard and names as often the red reward the plants revive new leaves appear the thickning clusters load the year the season swiftly purple grew the grapes hung dangling deep with blue a vineyard ripe a day serene now calls them all to work again the fawns through every furrow shoot to load their flaskets with the fruit and now the vintage early trod the wines invite the jovial god strew the roses raise the song see the master comes along lusty revel joined with laughter whim and frolic follow after the fawns beside the vatts remain to show the work and reap the gain all around and all around they sit to riot on the ground a vessel stands amidst the ring and here they laugh and there they sing or rise a jolly jolly band and dance about it hand in hand dance about and shout amain then sit to laugh and sing again but as an ancient author sung the vine manured with every dung from every creature strangely drew a tang of brutal nature too twas hence in drinking on the lawns new turns of humor seized the fawns here one was crying out by jove another fight me in the grove this wounds a friend and that the trees the lions temper reigned in these another grins and leaps about and keeps a

meats and full of wine this takes his temper from the swine here some who hardly seem to breathe drink and hang the jaw beneath gaping tender apt to weep their natures altered by the sheep twas thus

eyes lost ariadne raves the thread she bore trails on unwinding as she walks the shore and desperate phaedra seeks the lonely groves to read her guilty letter while she roves red shame confounds the first the second wears a starry crown the third a halter bears fair laodamia mourns her nuptial night of love defrauded by the thirst of fight yet for another as delusive cries and dauntless sees her heros ghost arise here thisbe canace and dido stand all armed with swords a fair but angry band this sword a lover owned a father gave the next the last a stranger chanced to leave and there even she the goddess of the grove joined with the phantom fairs affects to rove as once for latmos she forsook the plain to steal the kisses of a slumbering swain around her head a starry fillet twines and at the front a silver crescent shines these and a thousand and a thousand more with sacred rage recall the pangs they bore strike the deep dart afresh and ask relief or sooth the wound with softening words of grief at such a tide unheedful love invades the dark recesses of the madding shades through long descent he fans the fogs around his purple feathers as he flies resound the nimble beauties crouding all to gaze confess the common troubler of their ease though dulling mists and dubious day destroy the fine appearance of the fluttering boy though all the pomp that glitters at his side the golden belt the clasp and quiver hid and though the torch appear a gleam of white that faintly spots and moves through haizy night yet still they know the god the general foe and threatening lift their airy hands below as mindless of their rage he slowly sails on pinions cumberd in the misty vales ah fool to light the nymphs no more obey nor was this region ever his to sway cast in a deepend ring they close the plain and seize the god reluctant all in vain from hence they lead him where a myrtle stood the saddest myrtle in the mournful wood devote to vex the god twas here before hells awful empress soft adonis bore when the young hunter scorned her graver air and only venus warmed his shadow there fixed to the trunk the tender boy they bind they cord his feet beneath his hands behind he mourns but vainly mourns his angry fate for beauty still relentless acts in hate though no offense be done no judge be nigh love must be guilty by the common cry for all are pleased by partial passion led to shift their follies on anothers head now sharp reproaches ring their shrill alarms and all the heroines brandish all their arms and every heroine makes it her decree that cupid suffer just the same as she to fix the desperate halter one essayed one seeks to wound him with an empty blade some headlong hang the nodding rocks of air they fall in fancy and he feels despair some toss the hollow seas around his head the seas that want a wave afford a dread or shake the torch the sparkling fury flies and flames that never burned afflict his eyes the groaning myrrha bursts her rinded womb and drowns his visage in the moist perfume while others seeming mild advise to wound with humrous pains by sly derision found that prickling bodkins teach the blood to flow from whence the roses first begin to glow or in the flames to singe the boy prepare that all should choose by wanton fancy where the lovely venus with a bleeding breast she too securely through the circle pressed forgot the parent urged his hasty fate and spurred the female rage beyond debate over all her scenes of frailty swiftly runs absolves herself and makes the crime her sons that clasped in chains with mars she chanced to lie a noted fable of the laughing sky that from her loves intemprate heat began sicanian eryx born a savage man the loose priapus and the monsterwight in whom the sexes shamefully unite nor words suffice the goddess of the fair she snaps the rosywreath that binds her hair then on the god who feared a fiercer woe her hands unpitying dealt the frequent blow from all his tender skin a purple dew the dreadful scourges of the chaplet drew from whence the rose by cupid tinged before now doubly tinged flames with luster more here ends their wrath the parent seems severe the strokes unfit for little love to bear to save their foe the melting beauties fly and cruel mother spare thy child they cry to loves account they placed their deaths of late and now transfer the sad account to fate the mother pleased beheld the storm assuage thanked the calm mourners and dismissed her rage thus fancy once in dusky shade expressed with empty terrors worked the time of rest where wretched love endured a world of woe for all a winters length of night below then soared as sleep dissolved unchaind away and through the port of ivory reached the day to dr swift urged by the warmth of sacred friendships flame but more by all the wonders of thy fame by all those offsprings of thy learned mind in judgment solid as in wit refined resolved i sing though laboring up the way to reach my theme  o swift accept my lay rapt by the force of thought and raised above through contemplations airy fields i rove where powerful fancy purifies my eye and lights the beauties of a brighter sky fresh paints the meadows bids green shades ascend clear rivers wind and opening plains extend then fills its landscape through the varied parts with virtues graces sciences and arts superior forms of more than mortal air more large than mortals more serenely fair and there two chiefs the guardians of thy name contend to raise thee to the point of fame ye future times  i heard the silver sound i saw the graces form a circle round each where she fixed attentive seemed to root and all but eloquence herself was mute high over the throng i saw the goddess rise free to the breeze her upper garment flies by turns within her eye the passions burn the softer passions languish in their turn upon her lips convincing proof resides through all her speech persuasion melting glides a golden crown confessed her high command and waving action gently graced her hand out of her bosom where the treasure lay she drew thy labors to the blaze of day then gazed and read the charms she could inspire and taught the listening audience to admire how strong thy flight how large thy grasp of thought how just thy schemes how regularly wrought how sure you wound when ironies deride which must be seen yet feign to turn aside how far uncommon with an air of ease how nicely taking are thy turns of praise fame wants no words to make the patriot shine but yet to choose the best must borrow thine what public spirit in thy works appears what rolling language fills the ravished ears where nature all her force of writing shows where art concealing art with nature goes she ceased applause attended on the close then poetry her sister art arose her fairer sister born in deepest ease not made so much for business as to please upon her cheeks sits beauty ever young the soul of music warbles on her tongue bright in her eyes a pleasing ardour glows and from her heart the sweetest temper flows a laurelwreath adorns her curling hair and binds their order to the dancing air she shakes the colors of her radiant wing while from the spheres she takes her pitch to sing thrice happy genius his whose works have hit the lucky point of business and of wit they seem like showers which april months prepare to call the flowery glories up to air the drops descending make the varied bow and while they fall for profit dress for show to me retiring often he finds relief from slow consuming care and pining grief from me retreating often he gives to view what eases care and grief in others too ye fondly grave be wise enough to know life never unbent is but a life of woe i will gently steal you from your toils away where balmy winds and scents ambrosial play where on the banks as crystal rivers flow they teach immortal amaranths to grow then from the wild indulgence of the scene restore your tempers strong for toils again she ceased soft music trembled in the wind and sweet delight diffused through every mind the little smiles which still the goddess grace sportive arose and run from face to face but chief  a gentle band their eager joys express here friendship asks and love of merit longs to hear the goddesses renew their songs there great benevolence to men is pleased these own their swift and grateful hear him praised you gentle band you well may bear your part you reign superior graces in his heart o swift if friendships warm yet lasting flame if love of merit have to praise a claim if just esteem from every temper flows to crown a tender sense of human woes these fair returns are thine nor could thou lie unknown alive nor wilt unlovely dye or if high fame be life and well we know that bards and heroes have esteemed it so thou can not all expire thy works will shine to future times and life in fame be thine piety or the vision twas when the night in silent sable fled when cheerful morning sprung with rising red when dreams and vapors leave to crowd the brain and best the vision draws its heavenly scene twas then as slumbering on my couch i lay a sudden splendour seemed to kindle day a breeze came breathing in a sweet perfume blown from eternal gardens filled the room and in a void of blue that clouds invest appeared a daughter of the realms of rest her head a ring of golden glory wore her honored hand the sacred volume bore her raiment glittering seemed a silver white and all her sweet companions sons of light strait as i gazed my fear and wonder grew fear barred my voice and wonder ixd my view when lo a cherub of the shining crowd that sailed as guardians in her azure cloud fanned the soft air and downward seemed to glide and to my lips a living coal applied then while the warmth on all my pulses ran diffusing comfort thus the maid began where glorious mansions are prepared above the seats of music and the seats of love thence i descend and piety my name to warm thy bosom with celestial flame to teach thee praises mixed with humble prayers and tune thy soul to sing seraphic airs be thou my bard a vial here she caught an angels hand the crystal vial brought and as with awful sound the word was said she poured a sacred unction on my head then thus proceeded be thy muse thy zeal dare to be good and all my joys reveal while other pencils flattering forms create and paint the gaudy plumes that deck the great while other pens exalt the vain delight whose wasteful revel wakes the depth of night or others softly sing in idle lines how damon courts or amaryllis shines more wisely thou select a theme divine tis fames their recompense it is heaven is thine despise the fervours of unhallowed fire where wine or passion or applause inspire low restless life and ravings born of earth whose meaner subjects speak their humble birth like working seas that when loud winters blow not made for rising only rage below mine is a great and yet a lasting heat more lasting still as more intensely great producd where prayer and praise and pleasure breathe and ever mounting whence it shot beneath unpaint the love that hovering over beds from glittering pinions guilty pleasure sheds restore the color to the golden mines with which behind the feathered idol shines to flowring greens give back their native care the rose and lily never his to wear to sweet arabia send the balmy breath strip the fair flesh and call the phantom death his bow be sabled over his shafts the same and fork and point them with eternal flame but urge thy powers thine utmost voice advance make the loud strings against thy fingers dance tis love that angels praise and men adore tis love divine that asks it all and more fling back the gates of everblazing day pour floods of liquid light to gild the way and all in glory wrapped through paths untrod pursue the great unseen descent of god hail the meek virgin bid the child appear the child is god and call him jesus here he comes but where to rest a mangers nigh make the great being in a manger lie fill the wide skies with angels on the wing make thousands gaze and make ten thousands sing let men afflict him men he came to save and still afflict him till he reach the grave make him resigned his loads of sorrow meet and me like mary weep beneath his feet ill bathe my tresses there my prayers rehoarse and glide in flames of love along thy verse hah while i speak i feel my bosom swell my raptures smother what i long to tell tis god a present god through cleaving air i see the throne i see the jesus there placd on the right he shows the wounds he bore my fervours often have won him thus before how pleased he looks my words have reached his ear he bids the gates unbar and calls me near she ceased the cloud on which she seemed to tread its curls unsolded and around her spread bright angels waft their wings to raise the cloud and sweep their ivory lutes and sing aloud the scene moves off while all its ambient sky is tuned to wondrous music as they fly and soft the swelling sounds of music grow and faint their softness till they fail below my dowy sleep the warmth of phoebus broke and while my thoughts were settling thus i spoke thou beauteous vision on the soul impressed when most my reason would appear o rest twas sure with pencils dipped in various lights some curious angel limnd thy sacred sights from blazing suns his radiant gold he drew white moons the silver gave and air the blue i will mount the roving winds expanded wing and seek the sacred hill and light to sing it is known in jewry well i will make my lays obedient to thy summons sound with praise but still i fear unwarmd with holy flame i take for truth the flattries of a dream and barely wish the wondrous gift i boast and faintly practice what deserves it most indulgent lord whose gracious love displays joys in the light and fills the dark with ease be this to bless my days no dream of bliss or be to bless my nights my dreams like this ecstacy the fleeting joys which all affords below work the fond heart with unavailing show the wish that makes our happier life complete nor grasps the wealth nor honors of the great nor loosely sails on pleasures easy stream nor gathers wreaths from all the groves of fame weak man who charms to these alone confine attend my prayer and learn to make it thine from thy rich throne where circling trains of make day that is endless infinitely bright thence heavenly father thence with mercy dart one beam of brightness to my longing heart dawn through the mind drive errors clouds away and still the rage in passions troubled sea that the poor banished soul serene and free may rise from earth to visit heaven and thee come peace divine shed gently from above inspire my willing bosom wondrous love thy purpld pinions to my shoulders tie and point the passage where i want to fly but whither whither now what powerful fire with this blessed influence equals my desire i rise or love the kind deluder reigns and acts in fancy such enchanted scenes earth lessening flies the parting skies retreat the fleecy clouds my waving feathers beat and now the sun and now the stars are gone yet still methinks the spirit bears me on where tracts of ether purer blue display and edge the golden realm of native day o strange enjoyment of a bliss unseen o ravishment o sacred rage within tumultuous pleasure raised on peace of mind sincere excessive from the world refined i see the light that veils the throne on high a light unpiercd by mans impurer eye i hear the words that issuing thence proclaim let gods attendants praise his awful name then heads unnumberd bend before the shrine mysterious seat of majesty divine and hands unnumberd strike the silver string and tongues unnumberd hallelujah sing see where the shining seraphim appear and sink their decent eyes with holy fear see flights of angels all their feathers raise and range the orbs and as they range they praise behold the great apostles joyful met and high on pearls of azure ether set behold the prophets full of heavenly fire with wandering fingers wake the trembling lyre and hear the martyrs tune and all around the church triumphant makes the region sound with harps of gold with boughs of evergreen with robes of white the pious throngs are seen exalted anthems all their hours employ and all is music and excess of joy charmed with the sight i long to bear a part the pleasure flutters at my ravished heart sweet saints and angels of the heavenly quire if love has warmed me with celestial fire assist my words and as they move along with hallelujah crown the burdened song father of all above and all below o great beyond expression  no bounds thy knowledge none thy power confine for power and knowledge in their source are thine around thee glory spreads her golden wing sing glittering angels hallelujah sing son of the father first begotten son ere the short measring line of time begun the world has seen thy works and joyd to see his bright effulgence manifest in thee the world must own thee loves unfathomed spring sing glittering angels hallelujah sing proceeding spirit equally divine in whom the godheads full perfections shine with various graces comforts unexprest with holy transports you refine the breast and earth is heavenly where your gifts you bring sing glittering angels hallelujah sing but where is my rapture where my wondrous heat what interruption makes my bliss retreat this worlds got in the thought of tothers crossed and the gay pictures in my fancy lost with what an eager zeal the conscious soul would claim its seat and soaring pass the pole but our attempts these chains of earth restrain deride our toil and drag us down again so from the ground aspiring meteors go and ranked with planets light the would below but their own bodies sink them in the sky when the warmths gone that taught them how to fly finis
