the devil upon two sticks a comedy written by mr foot published by mr colman  price one shilling and sixpence  the devil upon two sticks a comedy in three acts as it is performed at the theater royal in the haymarket written by the late samuel foot esquire and now published by mr colman  london printed by t sherlock for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxviii  advertisement some copies of spurious impressions of the cozeners and the maid of bath having been printed and circulated before the application to the court of chancery for an injunction it has been thought advisable in vindication of the property of the editor as well as in justice to the deceased author immediately to commit to the press genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces abovementioned together with this comedy which had been also without authority advertised for publication  on inspection of the spurious impressions it appears that all the errors of careless and ignorant transcribers are there religiously preserved and all the additions and improvements made by the facetious writer are omitted many instances of this will occur on perusal of those comedies and particularly the cozeners in which besides the restoration of several passages always spoken on the stage the reader will find a whole scene at the end of the first act and another still more entertaining and popular at the beginning of the third both which were wholly wanting in the spurious impressions  unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property but commonly prove injurious to the public for the copies being obtained by clandestine and indirect means are for the most part as has happened in the present instance incorrect and imperfect  dramatis personae devil mr foot sir thomas maxwell mr

what occasion for dignity in tne common concerns of my house why the deuce cannot you converse like the rest of the world if you want money to pay off my bills you move me for further supplies if i turn away a servant you condemn me for so often changing my ministry and because i lock up my daughter to prevent her eloping with the paltry clerk of a pitiful trader it is forsooth an invasion of the bill of rights and a mortal stab to the great charter of liberty   marg as sergeant secondem said in the debate on the cornbill then why dont you choose better ground brother and learn to enlarge your bottom a little consider you must draw the line of liberty somewhere for if these rights belong    sir tho mercy on us   marg but indeed my dear brother you are got quite out of your depth woman i tell you is a microcosm and rightly to rule her requires as great talents as to govern a state and what says the aphorism of cardinal polignac if you would not have a person deceive you be careful

she is not beholden to you nor can you though a father with reason justice or law take it from her   sir tho why margaret you forget where you are this child is the town of madrid you are amongst a sage steady people who know and revere the natural rights of a parent   marg natural rights can a right to tyrannize be founded in nature   sir tho lookee margaret you are but losing your time for

hearing our story the owner of the house may lend his assistance this i suppose is the laboratory and this door leads to the shop   devil in a bottle heighho   har who is that   inv that where   har did not you hear a voice   inv none fancy my love only your feats   devil heighho   har there again   inv i hear it now  who is there   devil me   inv me he speaks english who and where are you   devil here in this bottle where i have been corkd up for these six months   inv corkd up in a bottle i never heard of such a thing in my life unless indeed in the haymarket once  corkd up in a bottle do you say   devil ay by the master of this house a magician   inv a magician why then you are a spirit i suppose   devil you are right i am the devil   har mercy on us   devil dont be terrified miss you remember the old proverb the devil is not so black as he is painted   inv well but sir    devil a truce to your questions my good sir for the present  consider rammd up in this narrow compass i cannot be much at my ease now if you will but break the bottle before you on the floor     har for heavens sake mr invoice take care what you do   devil why my pretty miss what risque do you run your affairs can hardly be changed for the worse   har that is true indeed   devil believe me miss as matters stand we can be of mutual use your lover may deliver me from prison and i can prevent you both from going into confinement   inv what says my harriet shall i rely on the gentlemans word   devil do madam i am a devil of honor besides you have but a little time to consider in less than five minutes you will have the consul and all his crew in the house   inv nay then  pray which is the bottle   devil that in the middle right before you   inv there it goes   he breaks the bottle and devil rises out of it thunder har oh what a    devil i am not surpised miss that you are a little shocked at my figure i could have assumed a much more agreeable form but as we are to be a little better acquainted i thought it best to quit all disguise and pretense therefore madam you see me just as i am   har i am sure sir you are ve  ve  very agreeable   devil yo  yo  you are pleased to compliment madam  come answer me sincerely am i such a being as you expected to see   har really sir i can hardly say what i expected to see   devil i own it is a puzzling question at least if the world does us justice in the contradictory qualities they are pleased to afford us   inv you will forgive me if i dont understand you   devil why for all their superlative epithets you cannot but see how much men are beholden to us by our means it is that you measure the extent both of your virtues and vices   inv as how   devil as thus in describing your friends or your foes they are devilish rich devilish poor devilish ugly devilish handsome now and then indeed to vary the mode of conversing you make a little free with our condition and country as hellish dull damned clever hellish cold psha how damned hot it is   inv true sir but i consider this as a rhetorical figure a manner of speaking devised and practiced by dullness to conceal the lack of ideas and the want of expressions   devil partly that i confess not but there is some truth in the case for at different times we have the power and do assume the various forms you assign us   inv we i observe you always make use of the plural is that sir by way of distinction or is your family pretty large and extensive   devil multitudinous as the sands on the beach or the moats in a sunbeam how the deuce else do you think we could do all the business below why there is scarce an individual amongst you at least of any rank or importance but has five or six of us in his train   inv indeed   devil a little before i got rammed in that phial i had been for some time on very hard duty in this part of the world   inv of what kind   devil the demon of power and i had long laid siege to a subject the man a grandee i was then a popular spirit and wore the mask of a patriot at different times we possessed him by turns but in the midst of a violent struggle by which means i got lame on this leg and obtained the nickname of the devil upon sticks the demon of vanity a low understrapper amongst us held over his head a circle of gold with five knobs on the top and whew flew away with our prize in an instant   inv understrapper what are there different ranks and orders amongst you   devil without doubt   inv and pray sir  i hope no offense but i would not be wanting in proper respect  are you when at home of condition or how must i    devil you mean am i a devil of fashion or one of the base born   inv i do   devil i have no reason to be ashamed of my family   inv i dont doubt it you will forgive me if i make a mistake perhaps my lord lucifer   devil who   inv lord lucifer   devil lord lucifer how little you know of our folks lucifer a lord why that is the meanest rascal amongst us   inv indeed   devil oh a paltry mechanic the very genius of jobbing a mere bull and bear booby the patron of lame ducks brokers and fraudulent bankrupts   inv you amaze me i vow i always thought him a principal agent   devil he not at all the fellow indeed gave himself some airs of importance upon following the camp and having the contractors and commissaries under his care but that affair you know closed with the war   inv what then are they now entirely out of his hands   devil yes quite out of his he only suggested their cent per cent squeezings and prompted the various modes of extortion and rapine but in his room they have six or seven demons apiece to direct the dissipation of their illgotten wealth   inv indeed   devil poor lucifer it is all over with him if it were not for the fluctuation of india an occasional lottery or a contested election the alley would be empty and lucifer have as little to do as a pickpocket when the playhouses are shut   inv perhaps sir then your name may be beelzebub   devil he worse and worse not a devil that has the least regard to his character would choose to be seen in his company besides it is the most petulant waspish quarrelsome cur  but no wonder he is the imp of chicane and protects the rotten part of the law   inv then he at least has employment enough   devil yes during the term he has a good deal to do he is the parent of quibbles the guardian of pettifoggers bad bail and of bailiffs the supporter of alibis the source of sham pleas the maker and finder of flaws the patron of perjury and a sworn foe to all trials by jury not long ago though my gentleman was put to his shifts   inv how was that   devil the law had laid hold of an old friend of his for being too positive as to a matter of fact evidence evasion protraction pleas every art was employed to acquit him that the most consummate skill could suggest but all to no purpose   inv that was strange   devil beyond all belief he could have hanged a dozen innocent people with half the pains that this paltry perjury gave him   inv how came that about   devil why  i dont know  he had unfortunately to do with an obstinate magistrate who bears a mortal hatred to rogues and whose sagacity could not be deceived but however though he was not able to save his friend from the shame of conviction a trifle which he indeed but little regarded yet he had the address to evade or at least defer the time of his punishment   inv by what means   devil by finding a flaw   inv a flaw what is a flaw   devil a legal loophole that the lawyers leave open for a rogue now and then to creep through that the game may not be wholly destroyed   inv provident sportsmen would it not be too much trouble to favor me with this particular instance   devil not at all why sir when matters grew desperate and the case was given over for lost little belzy starts up in the form of an able practitioner and humbly conceived that his client could not be convicted upon that indictment forasmuch as therein he was charged with forswearing himself now whereas it clearly appeared by the evidence that he had only forsworn himself then if indeed he had been indicted generally for committing perjury now and then proofs might be produced of any perjury he may have committed whereas by limiting the point of time to the now no proofs could be admitted as to the then so that with submission he humbly conceived his client was clearly absolved and his character as fair and as spotless as a babe that is just born and immaculate as a sheet of white paper   inv and the objection was good   devil fatal there was no getting rid of the flaw   inv and the gentleman    devil walks about at his ease not a public place but he thrusts his person full in your face   inv that ought not to be the contempt of the public that necessary supplement to the bestdigested body of laws should in these cases be never dispensed with   devil in days of yore when the world was but young that method had merit and the sense of shame was a kind of a curb but knaves are now so numerous and wealthy they can keep one another in countenance and laugh at the rest of the world   inv there may be something in that  well sir i have twice been out of my guess will you give me leave to hazard a third perhaps you are belphegor or uriel   devil neither they too are but diminutive devils the first favors the petty pilfering frauds he may be traced in the double score and soapd pot of the publican the alum and chalk of the baker in the sophisticated mixtures of the brewers of wine and of beer and in the false measures and weights of them all   inv and uriel   devil he is the demon of quacks and of mountebanks a thriving race all over the world but their true seat of empire is england there a short sword a tie and a nostrum a months advertising with a shower of handbills never fail of creating a fortune but of this tribe i foresee i shall have occasion to speak hereafter   inv well but sir    devil come sir i will put an end to your pain for from my appearance it is impossible you should ever guess at my person  now miss what think you of cupid   har you you cupid you the gay god of love   devil yes me me miss  what i suppose you expected the quiver at my back and the bow in my hand the purple pinions and filleted forehead with the blooming graces of youth and of beauty   har why i cannot but say the poets had taught me to expect charms    devil that never existed but in the fire of their fancy all fiction and phrenzy   inv then perhaps sir these creative gentlemen may err as much in your office as it is clear they have mistaken your person   devil why their notions of me are but narrow it is true i do a little business in the amorous way but my dealings are of a different kind to those they describe  my province lies in forming conjunctions absurd and preposterous it is i that couple boys and beldames girls and greybeards together and when you see a man of fashion locked in legitimate wedlock with the stale leavings of half the fellows in town or a lady of fortune setting out for edinburgh in a postchaise with her footman you may always set it down as some of my handywork but this is but an inconsiderable branch of my business   inv indeed   devil the several arts of the drama danceing music and painting owe their existence to me i am the father of fashions the inventor of quints trente quarante and hazard the guardian of gamesters the genius of gluttony and the author protector and patron of licentiousness lewdness and luxury   inv your department is large   devil one time or other i may give you a more minute account of these matters at present we have not a moment to lose should my tyrant return i must expert to be again corkd up in a bottle knocking and hark it is the consul that knocks at the door therefore be quick how can i serve you   inv you are no stranger sir to our distress here we are unprotected and friendless could your art convey us to the place of our birth    devil to england   inv if you please   devil without danger and with great expedition come to this window and lay hold of my cloak  i have often resided in england at present indeed there are but few of our family there every seventh year we have a general dispensation for residence for at that time the inhabitants themselves can play the devil without our aid or assistance  off we go stick fast to your hold thunder exeunt   act ii a street in london enter devil invoice and harriet devil well my good friends i hope you are not displeased with your journey   inv we had no time to be tired   har no vehicle was ever so easy   devil then by you mortals what injustice is done us when every crazy creeking jolting jumbling coach is called the devil of a carriage   inv very true   devil oh amongst you we are horridly used  well sir you now see i am a devil of honor and have punctually obeyed your commands but i shant limit my gratitude to a literal compliance with our compact is there any thing else for your service   inv were i not afraid to trespass too much on your time     devil a truce to your compliments though they are the common change of the world we know of what base metal the coin is composed and have cried down the currency speak your wishes at once   inv england sir is our country it is true but miss maxwell being born abroad and my leaving it young have made us both as much strangers to its manners and customs as if you had set us down at ispahan or delhi give us then some little knowledge of the people with whom we are to live   devil that task young gentleman is too much even for the devil himself where liberty reigns and property is pretty equally spread independence and pride will give each individual a peculiar and separate character when classed in professions indeed they then wear some singular marks that distinguish them from the rest of their race these it may be necessary for you to know   inv you will highly oblige me   devil and at the same time that i am showing you persons i will give you some little light into things health and property you know are the two important objects of human attention you shall first see their state and situation in london   inv you mean the practice of physic and law   devil i do and as to the first you will find it in some of the professors a science noble salutary and liberal in others a trade as mean as it is mercenary a contemptible combination of dunces nurses and apothecaries but you have now a lucky opportunity of knowing more in an hour of the great improvements in this branch of civil society than by any other means seven years could have taught you   inv explain if you please   devil the spirit of discord prevails the republic of tied periwigs like the romans of old have turned their arms from the rest of mankind to draw their short swords on themselves   inv but how came this about   devil to carry on the metaphor you must know in this great town there are two corpse of these troops equally numerous and equally formidable the first it is true are disciplined and fight under a general whom they christen a president the second contains the hussars and pandours of physic they rarely attack a patient together not but the latter singlehanded can do good execution   inv but their cause of contention   devil pride the light troops are jealous of some honors the others possess by prescription and though but a militia think they have right to an equal rank with the regulars   inv why this in time may ruin their state   devil true but that we must prevent it is our interest to make up this breach already we feel the fatal effects of their feuds by neglecting their patients the weekly bills daily decline and new subjects begin to grow scarce in our realms   inv this does indeed claim your attention   devil we purpose to call in the aid of the law bleeding the purse is as effectual for damping the spirit as opening a vein for lowering the pulse the demon of litigation has already possessed the licentiates i must infuse the same passion into the president and i warrant you in two or three terms with two or three trials all sides will be heartily tired but apropos i see a brace of apothecaries coming this way they seem deep in debate let us listen we shall best learn from them the present posture of  hush hide  you shall here too have a proof what a proteus i am they retire   enter julep and apozem with a letter julep i tell you apozem you are but young in the business and dont foresee how much we shall be all hurt in the end   apozem well but what can be done mr julep here dr hellebore writes me word that they threaten a siege and are provided with firearms would you have them surrender the college at once   julep firearms if they are mad enough not to know that the pen is the doctors best pistol why let them proceed   apozem but are we to stand quietly by and see the very seat of the science demolished and torn   julep and with what arms are we to defend it where are our cannon we have mortars indeed but then they are fit to hold nothing but pestles and as to our small arms of what use can they be in a siege they are made you know to attack only the rear   apozem come come mr julep you make too light of these matters to have the lawful descendants from galen the throne of esculapius overturned by a parcel of goths   julep peace apozem or treat your betters with proper respect what numskull do you think all physicians are blockheads who have not washed their hands in the came or the isis   apozem well but i hope you will allow that a universitydoctor    julep may for aught you know be a dunce besides fool what have we to do with degrees the doctor that doses best is the best doctor for us you talk of the college there are some of their names i am sure that i never desire to see on my file   apozem indeed   julep indeed no indeed why there is dr diet that makes such a dust he had a person of fashion a patient of mine under his care the other day as fine a slow fever i was in hopes of half making my fortune    apozem yes i love a slow fever was it nervous   julep ay with a lovely dejection of spirits   apozem that was delightful indeed i look upon the nerves and the bile to be the two best friends we have to our back  well pray and how did it answer   julep not at all the scoundrel let him slip through my hands for a song only a paltry six pounds and a crown   apozem shameful   julep infamous and yet forsooth he was one of your college well now to show you the difference in men but the very week after dr linctus from leyden run me up a bill of thirty odd pounds for only attending alderman soakpot six days in a surfeit   apozem ay that was doing of business   julep ah that is a sweet pretty practitioner apozem we must all do our utmost to push him   apozem without doubt but notwithstanding all that you say mr julep there are some of the gentlemen of the college that i know    julep ah as fine fellows as ever fingered a pulse not one of the trade will deny it   apozem but amongst all now old not nightshade is the man for my money   julep yes not not has merit i own but pox take him he is so devilish quick to be sure he has a very pretty fluent pen whilst it lasts but then he makes such dispatch that one has hardly time to send in two dozen of draughts   apozem yes the doctor drives on to be sure   julep drives on if i am at all free in the house when old nightshade is sent for as a preparatory dose i always recommend an attorney   apozem an attorney for what   julep to make the patients will before he swallows the doctors prescription   apozem that is prudent   julep yes i generally afterward get the thanks of the family   apozem what mr julep for the attorney or the physician ha ha   julep ha ha you are arch little apozem quite a wag i profess   apozem why you know brother julep these are subjects upon which one can hardly be serious   julep true true but then you should never laugh loud in the street we may indulge indeed a kind of simpering smile to our patients as we drive by in our chariots but then there is a decency not to say dignity that becomes the public demeanor of us who belong to the faculty   apozem true and yet there are times when one can hardly forbear why the other day now i had like to have burst i was following a funeral into st georges  a sweet pretty burying velvet pall hatband and gloves and indeed the widow was quite handsome in all things paid my bill the next week without sconcing off sixpence though they were thought to have lived happily together  but as i was asaying as we were entering the church who should stand in the porch but kit cabbage the tailor with a new pair of breeches under his arm the sly rogue made me a bow servant master apozem says he what you are carrying home your work too i see did you ever hear such a dog   julep ay ay let them let them  but is not that dr squib that is crossing the way   apozem yes you may see it is squib by his shuffle what i suppose now he is scouring away for the college   julep who squib how little you know of him he did not care if all our tribe was tipped into the thames   apozem no   julep no lord help you he is too much taken up with the national illness to attend to particular ails why he would quit the best patient in town to hunt after a political secret and would rather have a whisper from a great man in the court of requests than five hundred pounds for attending him in a chronical case   apozem wonderful  who can that dirty boy be that he has in his hand   julep one of his scouts i suppose  we shall see   reenter devil as dr squib and printers devil squib and you are sure this was worked off one of the first   boy not a single one sir has been sent out as yet   squib that is daintily done my dear devil here child here is sixpence when your master gives you the rest you need not be in haste to deliver them but step
