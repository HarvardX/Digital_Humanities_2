jonathan servant to morley selina niece to sir nicholas mrs felix her cousin and wife to the colonel jenny servant to selina servants of sir nicholas etc  scene the country mansion of the oddfish family the happy prescription act the first scene i enter sir nicholas in debate with mrs felix and selina mrs felix what a strange declaration  it gives me the spleen but it is what good sir nicholas never can mean  sir nicholas not mean it fair lady  by jupiter yes and my project you will see will be crowned with success i am joyous myself and it is ever my plan to give those i love all the joy that i can  mrs felix we own it  but joy is like diet dear cousin one palate may not relish what pleases a dozen nor will i allow that my appetites vicious if perchance i dont like what you think most delicious  sir nicholas rare dainty distinctions  but can i believe that a woman ever lived since the wedding of eve whose heart though most coyly her head might be carried did not fervently wish to be speedily married not to wound your nice ears with the name of desires which youth renders lovely and nature inspires your sex from its weakness demands a defender whom pride and affection make watchful and tender and if my fair coz is no hypocrite grown the truth of my maxims you will honestly own while the wars from your arms the brave colonel detain is the want of a husband the source of no pain  mrs felix there indeed you have touched me a little too near my soldier you know to my soul is most dear i own  and my frankness you never will blame i would purchase his presence with ought but his fame  sir nicholas well said thou dear honest and warmhearted wife for thy truth may good angels still watch over his life and while others the rough field of slaughter are treading send him

glides in peace by your gentle direction she thinks and i own i approve her remark in conjugal cares it is too soon to embark her bosom untouched by loves dangerous dart fate has not yet shown her the man of her heart  sir nicholas the man of her heart  these nonsensical fancies you lightheaded females pick out of romances that i am no tyrant you know very well so cousin dont teach my good niece to rebel i am no greedy guardian who thinks it his duty on the altar of plutus to sacrifice beauty whose venal barbarity justly abhorred ties a lovely young girl to an old crippled lord and basely to gain either rank or estate makes her swear she will love what she cannot but hate from such a protector heaven guard my dear niece i wish her to wed that her joys may increase and the deuce must be in the strange girl who discovers no man to her mind in such plenty of lovers to no very great length will my cruelty run if from twenty admirers i bid her choose one  mrs felix but why dear sir nicholas why in such haste  sir nicholas it is thus that my projects are ever disgraced with the false names of hurry and precipitation because i abhor silly procrastination that thief of delight who deludes all our senses who cheats us for ever with idle pretenses by whom like the dog in the fable betrayed we let go the substance to snap at the shade to seize present time is the true art of life it is time who now cries make selina a wife the season is come i have so long wished to see from the moment i dandled her first on my knee she you know to my care was bequeathed by my brother and having this child i never wished for another through life i have kept myself single for her her interest her joy to my own i prefer  selina your kindness dear sir i can never repay  sir nicholas in truth my dear damsel you easily may i demand no return so enormously great i ask but a boy to possess my estate  selina lord uncle how come such odd thoughts in your head  mrs felix from his heart i assure you  it is pleasantly said a fair stipulation  both parties agreed the compact i trust in due time will succeed but patience dear knight you will have your desire nor wait very long for a young little squire  sir nicholas the cold stream of patience never creeps in my veins but the wish my heart forms my quick spirit attains i am none of your chill atmospherical wretches whose affections are subject to starts and to catches whose wish like a weathercock veering about now turns toward hope and now changes to doubt no mine like the needle without variation only looks to one point and that points consummation i want to behold this young urchin arise before i have lost or my legs or my eyes that i may enjoy all his little vagaries as the changeable season of infancy varies i long to be moulding his heart and his spirit to show him the fields he is born to inherit lead him round our rich woods while my limbs are yet limber and tell the young rogue how i have nursed up his timber that when the worn thread of my life is untwisted he long may remember that i have existed and when my old frame in our monument rests as he walks by my grave with a few worthy guests he thus to some warmhearted friend may address him here lies my odd honest old uncle  god bless him  mrs felix thank heaven dear cousin your hale constitution shows not the least sign of a near dissolution  selina to make your life happy whatever the condition has been my dear uncle my highest ambition to fulfill every wish that your fancy can frame still is as it ought to be ever my aim but if by your voice i am doomed to the altar with terror and pain my weak accents must falter unless my kind stars a new lover should send me unlike all the swains who now deign to attend me  sir nicholas nice wench do you want the whole world to adore you would you have all the men of the earth ranged before you for thanks to your charms and to fortunes kind bounty you may rank in your train all the youth of our county and choose whom you will if the man has but worth and is nearly your equal in wealth and in birth i give my consent  you are free from restriction but i will not be plagued with perverse contradiction i will see you wed without any delay your two fittest lovers are coming today young sapphic whose verses delight all the fair and dicky decisive sir jacobs next heir both young and both wealthy both comely and clever to gain you no doubt each will warmly endeavor for they come for a month by my own invitation on purpose to found my dear girls inclination i have said to them both and no man can speak fairer let him who can please her most win her and wear her  selina aside to mrs felix good angels defend me  mrs felix i see nothing frightful our month with such guests must be very delightful when sapphics soft verses incline us to dose dick will keep us awake with satirical prose  sir nicholas dont cross me i say nor mislead my good niece by jove if she thwarts me with any caprice like a certain old justice i will ring up my maids and marry the first of the frankhearted jades for perverse contradiction i never will bear but provide for myself a more dutiful heir  mrs felix dear cousin in spite of his worships decision you cannot be certain of such a provision attempts of that nature are subject to fail  sir nicholas my designs you shall see madam always prevail for if this nice gipsy by your machination declines every offer to give me vexation like my late jolly neighbor sir timothy trickum who vindictively married the frail molly quickum i will make sure of the matter and choose me a wife with an heir ready placed on the threshold of life for as i have said though a foe to restriction i never will suffer perverse contradiction you now know my mind which no mask ever covers so farewell and prepare to receive your two lovers exit  mrs felix go thy way thou strange mixture of sense and of blindness a model at once of oppression and kindness thy will thou odd compound of goodness and whim is a stream against which it is treason to swim yet we must cross the current   selina dear cousin say how direct opposition he will not allow what can you devise as a plan of prevention how divert his keen spirit from this new intention i had much rather die than be ever united to one of the lovers that he has invited my heart has a thorough aversion to both yet to make him unhappy i am equally loath when i think what i owe to his tender protection the worst of all ills is to lose his affection  mrs felix dear girl your warm gratitude gives you new charms it is an amiable fear which your bosom alarms and i from your uncles quick humor would screen you nor loosen the bands of affection between you he merits your love and you know he has mine yet we somehow must baffle his hasty design nor suffer his whim thus to make you a wife to repent the rash business the rest of his life take courage kind chance may assist us   selina i doubt it yet heaven knows how we shall manage without it for when his hearts set on a favorite scheme his ardor and haste as you know are extreme like a medicine illtimed opposition is vain and inflames the disorder twas meant to restrain  mrs felix in his fevers indeed there is no intermission and thanks gentle coz to your soft disposition so sweet and compliant your temper has been you have taught him to think contradiction a sin and here all around him confirm that belief his vassals all bow to the nod of their chief here shut from the world in this rural dominion no mortal opposes his will or opinion and thus he is spoiled  politicians all say human natures not fashioned for absolute sway  selina it is true though the world as you say think him odd in this sphere he is held a diminutive god and when i behold how his fortune is spent in suppressing vexation and spreading content when i hear all the poor his kind bounty expressing and thoroughly know how he merits their blessing my feelings with theirs in his eulogy join and confess that his nature is truly divine  mrs felix thou excellent girl if such fondness and zeal for a warmhearted whimsical uncle you feel with what fine sensations your bosom will glow what tender attachment your temper will show when your fortunate lord love and hymen invest with higher dominion over that gentle breast but tell me dear cousin  be honest  declare has no young secret swain formed an interest there i suspect  but dont let my suspicion affright you though the good knights rare virtues amuse and delight you from this gloomy old hall you would wish to get free had not cupid preserved you from feeling ennui come tell me the name of the favorite youth i am sure i guess right  selina no in sad sober truth i never have seen in the course of my life a mortal to whom i should choose to be wise  mrs felix ye stars what a pity  i wish i could learn that my colonel from india would shortly return both for your sake and mine for our present distress he would speedily turn into joyous success as his regiment must some young hero afford who might throw at your feet both himself and his sword what say you my dear to a soldier   enter jenny jenny oh madam here is young mr sapphic  i vow if i had them i would give fifty pounds had you seen how politely he begged me to tie a sweet nosegay up tightly which is jolted to pieces  well he is a sweet beau and now with his pencil he is writing below i believe it is a posy he writes it so neatly and i am sure it is fine verse maam it sounded so sweetly  mrs felix oh charming his vows will be very sublime and i trust we shall hear his proposals in rhyme  selina how can you dear cousin so cruelly jest in a business you know i am really distressed in i shall certainly forfeit my uncles protection for i never can wed where i feel no affection do help me  mrs felix good girl this perplexity smother and think your two lovers will banish each other there is much to be hoped from our present affairs  jenny o maam mr sapphic is coming up stairs aside as she goes out i am mightily pleased with this marrying plan and i hope in my spirit that he will be the man exit  enter sapphic sapphic fair ladies the moments have seemed to be hours while i stopped in your hall to adjust a few flowers for the season i am told they are uncommonly fine but i still wish the tribute more worthy the shrine  bowing and presenting them to selina selina mr sapphic is always extremely polite these roses indeed are a wonderful sight you are far better florists than we are  mrs felix my dear mr sapphic has magic to make them appear and flora is bribed by the songs he composes to produce for her poet extempore roses into this early bloom all her plants are bewitched but you do not observe how the gift is enriched here is a border of verse if my eyes dont deceive me  selina aside to mrs felix dear cousin you will read it  i pray you relieve me i shall blush like a fool at each civil expression  mrs felix aside to selina taking the paper now with emphasis just and with proper discretion mrs felix reads ye happy flowers give and receive perfume as on selinas fragrant breast ye bloom from earth though not arrangd in order nice ye are transplanted into paradise if on that spot ye languish into death twill be from envy of her sweeter breath it is a delicate compliment tender and pretty what original spirit how graceful and witty  sapphic dear maam youre too good to find any thing in it it is a mere hasty trifle  the work of a minute on the anvil had not a moment to hammer and i fear in my haste i have sinned against grammar  mrs felix all slight imperfections i never regard when i meet with such vigor of thought in a bard with a fancy so brilliant   sapphic o maam youre too kind but candors the test of an amiable mind i wish that your taste all our critics might guide to soften that rigor with which they decide  mrs felix from critics dear sir you have litttle to fear if mr decisive himself had been here he must have been charmed with this sweet jeu desprit which as he is coming today he shall see i am eager to hear how his wit will applaud it to conceal it would be of due praise to defraud it  sapphic in mercys name ladies i beg your protection preserve my poor rhymes from decisives inspection consider how hasty   mrs felix say rather how sprightly   sapphic composed in a moment   mrs felix produced so politely  sapphic he will cut them to atoms  mrs felix dear sir he is your friend and i thought he had seen all the poems you penned i was told that to him your long works you rehearse  does mr decisive himself write in verse  sapphic i wish from my soul that he did now and then but he uses the penknife much more than the pen and too freely has slashed all who write in the nation to give them an opening for retaliation my old friend decisive has honor and wit to the latter indeed he makes most things submit and thinks it fair sport as a friend or a foe to knock down a bard by a flaming bon mot to your sex indeed his chief failings i trace for the fairones so flattered his figure and face that too early he ceased the chaste muses to follow and being adonis would not be apollo  mrs felix yet he has much fancy  sapphic o madam no doubt and genius that study would soon have brought out had his thoughts been less turned to his legs and his looks ere this he would have written some excellent books it is pity such parts should through indolence fall but he never composes and reads not at all  selina not read mr sapphic you surely mistake your friend cannot be an illiterate rake our neighbors who lately from london came down declare that his word forms the taste of the town  sapphic dear madam the business is easily done he judges all authors but never reads one  mrs felix i am sure he must own this impromptu is sweet and i vow he shall read it   sapphic dear maam i entreat i conjure you to spare me this earnest petition i know you will grant me   mrs felix on this one condition that for six lines suppressed you indulge me with twenty come show us your pocketbook  there you have plenty of tender poetical squibs for the fair  sapphic taking out his pocketbook dear maam here is nothing  mrs felix a volume i swear o charming well now youre an excellent man it is stuffed like a pincushion   sapphic yes maam  with bran  mrs felix fie fie youre too modest and murder my meaning what a harvest is here yet i ask but a gleaning it would not be fair to seize all the collection though all is most certainly worthy inspection indulge us dear sir come i will take no refusal  sapphic indeed maam here is nothing that is fit for perusal  mrs felix there are fifty fine things and one cannot choose amiss  sapphic taking out a paper here is one new little song   mrs felix well then let me have this  sapphic after giving a paper they all are so jumbled i fear i am wrong i meant to have shown you a new little song which was written last week on the ball at our races where i heard the miss trotters compared to the graces i could not help saying it was very profane it was taking the name of the graces in vain  mrs felix reads  on seeing selina and jenny near each other in  the garden o mercy dear madam you must not read those a stanza unfinished   mrs felix how sweetly it flows selina pray hear it  selina aside to mrs felix dear cousin enough how can you delight in his horrible stuff  mrs felix reads though each in the same garden blows the poet must be crazy who when invited by the rose can stoop to pick the daisy  selina aside to mrs felix if you love me dear cousin assist me i pray to end all this nonsense and get him away  pray sir when you came was my uncle below  sapphic he is abroad maam your servant informed me   selina o no you have heard he is building a temple to pan and we hope that your taste may embellish the plan at the end of the walk in his favorite grove where there formerly stood an old ruined alcove you will find him and as it is an art you are skilled in twill please him to know what you think of the building  mrs felix aye do mr sapphic inspect what is done for the workmen all blunderd when first they begun your opinion i am sure will oblige the good knight  selina an inscription he once said he wished you to write  sapphic dear madam  the hint is delightful i vow to the god of arcadia i hasten to bow i shall find the good knight in the midst of the dome i am heartily glad that he is not from home we shall surely contrive something clever between us and the muse will compose by the order of venus  bows tenderly to selina and exit selina how could you so praise that impertinent creature and praise him without discomposing a feature  i could not have thought before this conversation that your frankness could turn into such adulation  mrs felix the world my dear child is to you quite unknown when you see it you will find such discourse is the ton fine folks in high life learn to praise with great glee such persons and things as they sicken to see to me your best thanks for my speeches are due  by thus flattering the poet i surely serve you he will now play the skylark instead of the dove and stun me with songs while youre saved from his love  enter jenny jenny dear maam now i hope mr sapphics quite blessed for he flies through the walks like a bird to his nest  he is a sweet pretty gentleman  mrs felix aside to selina this if i show it will soon banish jennys regard for the poet  jenny see what your friend mr sapphic has written  jenny dear maam with his verses i always am smitten having read the stanza a daisy indeed to be sure i am neat but though i am a servant i hope i am sweet when he makes my young mistress a rose or a lilly he might turn me at least to a daffydowndilly but a daisy forsooth with no fragrance at all  i will cross him for this   selina what is that noise in the hall  jenny as sure as i live it is your other gay spark for i saw a new chaise driving into the park  i will see maam  aside going out i will show this fine poet a trick  a daisy that no one but children will pick exit  mrs felix this simile jenny i see cannot swallow and her anger may ruin this son of apollo for in courtship this maxim is often displayed he has half lost the mistress who loses the maid  enter decisive decisive alone my dear ladies  they told me below our friend sapphic was here your poetical beau i was almost afraid that my sudden intrusion might check the rich stream of some lyric effusion  to selina i am happy to see you so lovely today but i hope i have not frighted your poet away  selina o no  mr sapphic had bid us adieu   mrs felix and not without saying some fine things of you he declares that with those brilliant parts you possess it is a sin you never send any work to the press  decisive good sapphic in truth it is his comfort to think the whole duty of man lies in spilling of ink and at paradise gate his large volumes of meter will i hope be allowed a fair pass by saint peter  mrs felix then the saint must be free from your critical spirit for i know you have little esteem for their merit youre a rigorous judge and to poets terrific  decisive i wish my friends muse was not quite so prolific but in rhymes when a child i have heard he would squeak and so proved a poet before he could speak on his deathbed i doubt not he will still think of verse and groan out a rhyme to his doctor or nurse  mrs felix i fancy your favorite reading is prose here is a new set of travels pray have you read those  decisive taking the book this author is lucky to meet with a buyer a travellers but a soft word for a liar such works may please those who have never been abroad but men who have traveled perceive all the fraud  mrs felix is the work so deceitful it seems you have read it  decisive not a syllable madam   mrs felix pray who then has said it  decisive not a soul that i know  but such books are a trade and i perfectly know how those volumes are made  mrs felix it is a work i am told that has great reputation both for wit and for truth   decisive we are a credulous nation   mrs felix pray what kind of books are your favorite study  decisive i find modern works only make the brain muddy as my friends grew by reading more awkward than wise and ruined their persons and clouded their eyes i have wisely resolved not to read any more since each living author is turned to a bore  mrs felix how can you so waste all your bright mental powers it is pity you men have not such works as ours  what do you say to my knotting   takes out her work decisive your box wants a hinge and i will give you a much better pattern for fringe i brought it from france  mrs felix now i see my good friend there is no kind of work which your skill cannot mend in all arts you possess a distinguishing head from building a temple to knotting a thread  decisive apropos of a temple  pray has the good knight raised his altar to pan  he had fixed on the site is the structure begun  i have not seen his plan   mrs felix then hasten and pay your devotions to pan sir nicholas now in his vestibule stands to guide all his workmen and quicken their hands and sapphic is gone to attend the good knight and try what inscription his genius can write  decisive poor pan by the graces you are left in the lurch thy temple will look like a trim parish church with sapphics inscriptions like scraps of the bible put up as the churchwardens say in a libel  mrs felix indeed we much fear so  pray haste to inspect it and exert all your exquisite taste to correct it  decisive maam i will do what i can for it puts me in wrath to see a fine temple disgraced by a goth exit  mrs felix well my dear your two lovers like true men of fashion do not pester you much with the heat of their passion you will be quite at your ease  thanks to pan and the muse  enter jenny hastily jenny news news my dear ladies most excellent news  selina the girl is quite wild  mrs felix what transports you so jenny  jenny i have news for you madam that is well worth a guinea i have news from the colonel   mrs felix a letter where is it  jenny no maam here is a stranger arrived on a visit and he comes from the place where the colonel is fighting  mrs felix and with letters for me  jenny madam that i am not right in for i run from his man when i got half my story but the colonel he says is all riches and glory  mrs felix dear girl that is enough through my life i shall feel due regard for thy warm and affectionate zeal but where is this stranger  jenny just walked to my master his poor man has met with a cruel disaster he was wounded in battle  selina pray treat him with care  in your joy my dear cousin i heartily share  mrs felix this strangers a jewel for you from the east he is a captain i hope my dear jenny at least  jenny ah madam my fancy supposed him so too but we are both in the wrong and for miss he will not do for i learnt from his man he is only a doctor  mrs felix poor jane how the difference of title has shocked her for my part i cannot find by my reason or feeling that the art of destroying excels that of healing we may equally love the professors of both  jenny that miss though should marry a doctor i am loath  mrs felix come my dear let us meet em  i cannot rest above  how slowly fly letters from hands that we love  end of act i act the second scene i enter jenny and jonathan jenny come dear mr jonathan tell me the whole an account of a battle i love to my soul there is nothing on earth i so truly delight in as to hear a brave soldier discourse about fighting  so the colonel was wounded you say near the wall whereabouts was the shot did he instantly fall  jonathan no recoiling a little he rushed on again and fought like a lion made fiercer by pain though a cursed keen arrow an indian let fly pierced the bone of his cheek just below the right eye twas a horrible wound but it could not appal him  jenny o mercy that such a hard fate should befall him alas i am afraid that his fine manly face must have lost by the fear all its spirit and grace does he look very hideous  jonathan no thanks to my master you can hardly perceive that he ever wore a plaster there never was known a more wonderful cure but kind heaven assists my good master i am sure without it the skill of no mortal could save the many brave lads he has kept from the grave you would weep with delight to behold him surrounded with a hundred fine fellows once horribly wounded who with thanks for their lives are still eager to greet him and hail him with blessings whenever they meet him  jenny god reward him say i for the good he has done and of those he has saved i am glad you are one  jonathan aye twice he preserved me when all thought me dead and once brought me off at the risque of his head it was not his business to mix in the strife and some thought him mad when he ventured his life to bring off a poor mangled private like me but i have still a heart left in this trunk that you see which loves the brave spirit who snatched me from death and will serve him i hope till my very last breath  jenny your scenes of hard service i hope are all over it is now fairly time you should both live in clover your master i trust has brought home as much treasure as will make him a parliament man at his pleasure and to recompense you for the wound in your arm perhaps he will buy you a snug little farm  jonathan when a gentleman comes from the east my good girl you all think he is loaded with diamonds and pearl you fancy his treasure too great to be told and suppose he possesses a mountain of gold a few daring blades by a bold kind of stealth have indeed from the indies brought home so much wealth that with all their keen senses they never could employ it and have died from the want of a heart to enjoy it but some hundred brave lads whom gay youth led to enter that promising region of hope and adventure have toiled many years in those richburning climes with small share of their wealth and with none of their crimes now my master and i both belong to this tribe not a single nabob have we killed for a bribe and to tell you a truth which i hope you will not doubt we are as poor and as honest as when we set out  jenny what your master still poor in so thriving a trade and with patients so rich has he never been paid for the wounds he has healed  jonathan yes my dear for his fees i know he has touched many thousand rupees but the fight of distress he could never endure what he took from the rich he bestowed on the poor  jenny well heaven will pay him no doubt in due season but what brings him home  i would fain know the reason why he leaves that rich land in the bloom of his life i suppose from the want of a cherrycheekd wife they say those black wenches are sad nasty creatures and though they have fine shapes they have horrible features does he want a white sweetheart or has he a black  jonathan it is indeed a white woman that brings us both back but alas it is an old one  my master it seems has a fond simple mother that is troubled with dreams and he like a tender and softhearted youth resigns his fine prospect and comes home forsooth because the old dame has expressed her desires to see him in england before she expires and egad since he is come she will live long enough for she seems to be made of good durable stuff  jenny well now i shall love him a hundred times more than i did for the stories you told me before god bless the kind soul who behaves to his mother as if he well knew he could never have another and were he my son i could not live without him i could stay here all day while youre talking about him  but it is time to be gone we must both disappear for the colonels sweet wife and your master are here  jonathan stop i must peep at her  she is as bright as the day  jenny and her heart is as good as her spirit is gay  come i will show you our walks  we may get out this way  exeunt enter mrs felix and morley mrs felix dear excellent friend since i owe to your worth the safety of what i most value on earth with those it loves best my heart yields you a place and i clasp your kind hand with a sisters embrace to judge of the man whom such service endears i want not the tardy acquaintance of years but in strong though guick ties that no chances can sever in an instant he seizes my friendship for ever and had i much less obligation to you my regard and esteem i should still think your due from the picture my felix has drawn of your mind  morley his warm soul to his friends is most partially kind but such as i am i most truly am yours your goodness my grateful attachment ensures and my heart with proud transport your friendship embraces though i never gazed before on your personal graces i have beguiled some long weeks of hard wearisome duty with frequent discourse on your virtues and beauty and i own for the colonel it raised my esteem to mark with what pleasure he dwelt on the theme  mrs felix youre an excellent creature to sooth a fond wife who regards her lords love hardly less than his life but since you have replied with good humor so steady to the ten thousand questions i have asked you already i will spare you today and if it is in my power mention felixs name only once in an hour that my thoughts to the indies no longer may roam let me talk to you now about matches at home your counsel may make our perplexity less and finish our odd tragicomic distress first tell me and speak without any disguise though i fancy i read all your thoughts in your eyes what do you think of my cousin  morley her graces indeed the glowing description of felix exceed though in praising her often he with pleasure has smiled like a father describing his favorite child for my part i think she is lavishly blessed with those beauties by which the pure mind is expressed that her heart is with truth and with tenderness warm that sweet sensibility shines in her form a form on which no man his eye ever turned without feeling his breast in her welfare concerned it is the lot of such graces wherever they dwell none can see their soft mistress and not wish her well  mrs felix very gallantly said and the praise is her due  but how came her lovers so well known to you  morley her lovers  dear madam i hope youre in jest  or if by their vows your sweet friend is addressed heaven grant for the peace of her delicate mind that her hand may be never to either resigned  mrs felix from my soul i assure you i join in your prayer but whence does it spring  morley i will freely declare though they are both men of fortune fair birth and good name with figures that set some young nymphs in a flame though at each many ladies are ready to catch at what the world calls a most excellent match yet if i have read your fair cousin aright a bosom so tender a spirit so bright must be wretched with such a companion for life as each of these lovers would prove to his wife  mrs felix you are right but their characters where could you know  morley i knew them at college a few years ago before by a whimsical odd sort of fate and some family losses too long to relate in europe my views of prosperity ceased and chance sent me forth to my friends in the east  mrs felix pray what sort of youths were these two modish men  morley you now find them both what they seemed to be then two characters formed like most young men of fashion whose cold selfish pride is their sovereign passion in each though they are men of an opposite turn the same heartfreezing vanity still you discern to indulge that dear vanity each still displays all the force of his mind though in different ways thence in spinning weak verse sapphics toil never ends and decisive never stops in deriding his friends each equally fancies no nymph can resist his lips which he thinks all the graces have kissed  mrs felix perfect knowledge of both your just picture has shown  the warmth of these lovers diverts me i own of conquest each seems to himself very clear and feels from his rivals no diffident fear it is easy to see from their satisfied air each loves his own person much more than the fair but my poor gentle coz wishes both at a distance and i want to contrive by your friendly assistance to relieve her and quietly send them from hence without the knights knowledge  morley as neither wants sense cannot the lady pronounce their dismission at once which none can mistake but an impudent dunce  mrs felix this measure seems easy indeed at first view but alas it is a measure we dare not pursue our warmhearted whimsical positive knight allows not to woman this natural right and hence my young friend in a pitiful case knows not how to reject what she never can embrace for nothing her uncles resentment would smother should she banish one suitor and not take the other  morley then indeed i am grieved for the ladys distress but how can i aid her  mrs felix it is hard i confess to a sudden retreat this bold pair to oblige and make two such heroes abandon a siege yet i wish we could do it  and when they recede the departure of both must appear their own deed  morley after a pause well  my friendship for you has suggested a scheme  mrs felix it is a service our hearts will for ever esteem but what is your project  morley dont question me what lest you think me a fool for too simple a plot it is simple and yet i would venture my life it will drive from these beaus all the thoughts of a wife and if my scheme prospers with joy i will confess what a whimsical trifle produced our success  mrs felix well keep your own secret if silence is best though a woman for once i will in ignorance rest  here comes our friend sapphic  he seems in a flurry  morley his step shows indeed a poetical hurry and we shall be called in as gossips fair neighbor for by the bards bustle his muse is in labor  enter sapphic sapphic dear maam may i ask you for paper and ink lest a fresh jeu desprit in oblivion should sink for when my free fancy has brought forth my verse my treacherous memory proves a bad nurse  mrs felix o pray for your muse let us rear her young chit for the bantling no doubt must have spirit and wit as a cradle to hold it i beg you will take that giving him a paper and your friend here will aid you in dressing the brat at a rite so important i merit no place and i beg to withdraw while youre washing its face exit  sapphic that is a charming gay creature  luxuriant and young  but i have lost half a stanza  the deuce take her tongue  let me see  let me see if i cannot recollect it  it is done  and now morley pray hear or inspect it  morley the poet himself his own verse should recite  sapphic youre a sensible fellow  your maxim is right reads thy old arcadia pan resign for this more rich retreat a fairer nymph here decks thy shrine be this thy favorite seat well my friend will not this bring the old god out of greece  morley aye and make good sir nicholas give you his niece  sapphic yes i fancy this stanza will make the girl mine  morley what poet can wish for a prize more divine i give you much joy on your conquest my friend yet the eyes of regret on your nuptials i bend and grieve in reflecting that conjugal joy your poetical harvest of fame must destroy  sapphic what the deuce do you mean  morley to those great works adieu which the world now expects with impatience from you the poet when blessed can no more be sublime and a chill matrimonial must strike through his rhyme  sapphic youre mistaken dear doctor  connubial delight will give a new zest to each poem i write and you will see such productions   morley it is true now and then polemics by marriage have quickened their pen a dutch critic i knew by the aid of his wife made a book and a child every year of his life but total seclusion from venus and bacchus is you know to the bard recommended by flaccus a grand epic poem i hear you are writing it is a work that your country will take great delight in but consider my friend when youre deep in heroics as poets have not all the patience of stoics how you will grieve to be checked in the flow of your verse by a young squalling child and an old scolding nurse even the qualms of your lady may drive from your brain fine thoughts that you never can recover again reflect how you will feel with such hopes of succeeding if your muse should miscarry because your wifes breeding  sapphic egad in that case i should think my fate hard  morley i myself have beheld an unfortunate bard who his nails for a rhyme unsuccessfully bit when family cares had extinguished his wit with many who sing in the muses full choir it would do them no mischief to muffle their lyre but for you whom the nine with a tender presage are prepared to proclaim the first bard of our age for you who of taste are the favorite theme   sapphic yes i think i stand high in the public esteem   morley for you i should grieve if domestic delight on your fair rising laurels should fail as a blight it is the pride of great minds whom the muses inflame to sacrifice joy on the altar of fame your passions renown  of this girl are you fonder  on this delicate point i must leave you to ponder consider it while i attend the old knight exit  sapphic alone after a pause by jove i believe my friend morley is right thou fame art my mistress to win thee i sing this girl though she is handsome is but a dull thing it is clear whensoeer i a poem rehearse that she has no relish for elegant verse  her fortune indeed would be rather convenient but the glorious to me is before the expedient egad i would quit venus herself if i knew that the system of morley was certainly true i dont think the girl to decisive inclined but here comes her maid who may tell me her mind enter jenny my good little jenny youre trusty and true and your mistress i know tells her secrets to you what you know to a friend you may safely impart and give me a perfect account of her heart pray how do i stand in your ladys regard  jenny now is my time to be even with this saucy bard  aside to be sure sir the taste of my lady is odd but poetry moves her no more than a clod  sapphic what no relish for rhyme  does she never repeat the soft little sonnets i have laid at her feet  jenny ah sir would my mistress were once of my mind for i read all the verses of yours that i find but my ladys so cruel she thwarts my desire and to hide them from me throws them into the fire  sapphic she is a fool  she is a fool  aside  i should have a fine life with such a prosaic dull jade of a wife  jenny but my good sir i hope you will not be dejected i could tell you by whom all your wit is respected there is a heart upon which you have made such impression  but i must not betray her by my indiscretion  sapphic whom d ye mean my good jenny come tell me my dear  jenny you would make a bad use of the secret i fear  now i hope i shall lead the bard into a scrape  aside for he bites like a gudgeon and cannot escape  sapphic come say who is in love with me  if she is fair i will not leave the dear creature i vow to despair  jenny o lud i protest she is coming this way but i did not intend her regard to betray i must fly  but i beg that you will not be too free exit  sapphic madam felix  i thought she was partial to me  enter mrs felix mrs felix may i enter without incommoding the muse  sapphic by a question like this your own charms you abuse those eyes my dear madam were formed i profess to inspirit a poet and not to depress from your presence he surely must catch inspiration  mrs felix a very poetical fine salutation but i seriously beg if youre busy with rhyme that you will not allow me to take up your time as i am not selina youre free from restriction and may tell me plain truths unembellishd with fiction  sapphic then i swear my dear creature i swear by this hand that i feel as i touch it my genius expand that your lips  o by jove he is a madman or booby who roves to the indies for diamond or ruby and each vein in my heart his strange folly condemns who leaves these more bright and more exquisite gems sweet fair let me keep while their richness i praise the cold damp of neglect from oerclouding their rays   while mr sapphic kisses mrs felix with great vehemence jenny enters unperceived jenny o ho  have i caught you impertinent poet this is more than i hoped for  my master shall know it exit  mrs felix good god mr sapphic what frantic illusion has produced this ridiculous scene of confusion all poets are quixotes in love i am told and the truth of the adage in you i behold as the knight once mistook an old mill for a giant your sense as disordered your fancy as pliant takes me for my cousin  your loves ebullition i only can pardon on this supposition i fain would suppose that no insult was meant nor believe you could think what i ought to resent  sapphic o talk not of anger with lips that inspire the strongest sensation of rapturous fire that with loves sweet convulsions shake every nerve o think not that i your resentment deserve because my warm heart thus engrossed by your charms is ambitious of filling these dear empty arms no let me while basking beneath your bright eye the place of a thankless deserter supply and in this melting breast kindle ecstacys flame which nature designed for so glowing a frame  mrs felix away sir and since in your fondling insanity you reject the excuse which i formed for your vanity my threats must inform you   sapphic o frown not sweet creature let not wrath spoil the charm of thy every feature  mrs felix regain you your sense  from my wrath you are free which should not be raised by a being like thee begone then  my pardon in vain you will implore if you dare on this subject to breathe a word more  sapphic words indeed my warm fair one by natures confession for the love that i feel are no proper expression the souls fond intent in soft murmurs should swell and kisses explain what no language can tell ye gods how luxuriant  mrs felix away quit my arm or my cries in an instant the house shall alarm  sapphic provoking sweet creature  indulge my fond passion come come dont i know youre a woman of fashion your coyness i have heard you can sometimes give over and i am sure youre too wise to be true to a rover besides i have learnt that with partial regard you have cast a kind eye on your illtreated bard  mrs felix away thou vain coxcomb nor base as thou art insult the bright lord of so loyal a heart begone  i abhor thee  my person release   sir nicholas entering is it thus my young sir you pay court to my niece  sapphic confusion what devil has sent the old knight  sir nicholas how dare you pert stripling almost in my sight to insult a chaste female that is under my roof  but since of your baseness you give me such proof you shall feel it repaid by a proper correction  sapphic  aside deuce take this perverse and unlucky detection i wish i had wisely as morley had taught me renounced that jade venus before he thus caught me what excuse can i make him   to sir nicholas my dear worthy sir though i now seem most justly your wrath to incur yet as you grow cool your opinion will vary you will not resent much an idle vagary a mere romping frolic   sir nicholas a frolic do you say then a frolic of mine shall your frolic repay call our servants to punish this frolic some spark they shall drag him across the new pond in the park  sapphic  aside it is what he cannot mean  yet his countenance such is i wish from my soul i was out of his clutches   to sir nicholas dear sir i assure you i am grieved beyond measure that i thus have awakened your furious displeasure when calmer   sir nicholas young man i am not in a fury a sentence more just never came from a jury such frolics as yours have old england disgraced in high life let them flourish as fashion and taste to those wanton young fellows i am not severe who attack the loose wife of a vain gambling peer my lady whose lord wastes at hazard the night may plead to more generous pleasures some right i care not how each keeps their conjugal oath since honor and peace must be strangers to both but when a brave soldier pure glorys true son ennobled with laurels laboriously won when risking in far distant climates his life to his country he leaves a fair innocent wife accursed be the man who to friendship unjust fails to guard as his soul this most delicate trust or to punish those pops who insult her chaste beauty and invite her to swerve from her honor and duty of the doom that i think to such libertines due i will give to the world an example in you our old english discipline ducking by name shall atone for your outrage by quenching your flame here william and john  mrs felix for my sake i entreat that you will not dear sir this rough vengeance complete  sir nicholas by jupiter cousin to make him less fond he shall croak out his love to the frogs of our pond  here william tell jack after stephen to skip and tell the old huntsman to come with his whip then wait all together around the hall door  sapphic o mercy dear sir i your mercy implore you will not destroy me  sir nicholas no only correct and teach you a brave soldiers wife to respect  mrs felix yet think my dear cousin yet think for my sake what a noise this ridiculous matter will make you know that my felixs nature is such he dont wish his wife to be talked of too much his honor and quiet let us make our care and bury in silence this foolish affair perhaps in my manners too easy and gay my levity led the young poet astray  sir nicholas no no my good creature you must not arraign your innocent self in a business so plain besides his offense by this plea cannot sink for they are the worst of all puppies that think each womans a wanton who is not precise and that cheerfulness must be the herald of vice  mrs felix however this may be  as he is now all repentance i earnestly beg a repeal of your sentence  sapphic dear maam i adore you for this intercession and i trust the good knight will forgive my transgression  sir nicholas well sir as beyond your desert youre befriended by that virtue which you have so grossly offended you are free to depart but remember young swain that you never touch the wife of a soldier again  sapphic if i do may i die by the wind of a ball heaven bless you good folks and this sociable hall since my amorous folly your friendship thus loses my amors shall henceforth be confined to the muses exit  mrs felix i thank you dear sir and rejoice in my heart that in safety you have suffered this youth to depart  sir nicholas by jupiter coz i had cooled your warm poet had i not been afraid all our neighbors might know it and make you the subject of such conversation as i think your nice colonel would hear with vexation then since for your sake i have let the bard go come and aid me to settle all matters below that my anxious cares in her comfort may cease i am resolved young decisive shall marry my niece  end of act ii act the third scene i enter mrs felix and selina mrs felix well my dear what do you think of our medical friend whom the letters of felix so highly commend if my gratitude does not my judgment mislead he is the man in the world who with you might succeed though gentle yet manly though bashful polite are you not half in love   selina yes indeed at first sight  his service to you on my heart is engraved and i love him i own for the life he has saved to win me perhaps he might not find it hard so esteemed as he is by the friends i regard but i fancy such thoughts will not enter his brain and for my part instead of attracting a swain i only shall think as they heartily vex me of escaping from those who already perplex me  mrs felix o make yourself easy i pray on that head in the deepest disgrace the poor poet is fled and i trust that the critic will soon share his fate come with me  i have a most curious tale to relate let us haste  i perceive that decisive is near in whose present discourse i would not interfere exeunt  enter decisive and morley decisive so while in the grove i was coolly projecting new plans for the temple the knight is erecting our poet addicted to amorous sin grew a little too fond of the ladies within but discovery happened his passion to damp and this is the cause of his haste to decamp  morley the old knight i believe such resentment expressed as quickened the speed of his fugitive guest on terrors swift wing he is certainly flown and as he has retreated the field is your own  decisive as a rival i had not much fear of poor sapphic bad rhymes current coin in most amorous traffic but would not pass here  morley i think not in your view as it finds such a critical touchstone in you the poets dismission your triumph ensures and the prize my good friend is now certainly yours a prize that we justly may call very great a lovely sweet girl with a noble estate  decisive the girls very well but knows nothing of life it will cost me some pains to new model my wife but i think she will gladly receive my correction and my wealthy old kinsman approve the connection   coughs morley you have a cough my good friend  decisive yes a trifling one hem have you got any indian prescription for phlegm  morley believe me that cough is no trifling affair it calls i assure you for caution and care with regret i point out so unpleasant a truth but your constitution i have known from your youth your hectic appearance i see with concern as i know with your frame if health takes such a turn the least indiscretion your life may destroy the slightest excess in diversion and joy even those tender cares which on lifes purest plan must belong to the state of a family man may lead to disease from which art cannot save and rapidly hurry you into the grave twere better this courtship of yours should miscarry for you will certainly die in six months if you marry  decisive are you serious dear doctor  morley by such a sad end i lately have lost a poor goodhumored friend you remember jack dangle at college no doubt he was just of your age and a little more stout he with other young sages left westminster hall to teach english law to the slaves of bengal but jack in his new chamberpractice at least too eagerly followed the rules of the east a bad cough ensued much like yours in its found  decisive coughs good god i could swear twas poor jack under ground it is his tone so exactly sepulchral and hollow the system he slighted i hope you will follow with pains in his breast he was sharply tormented but as he at first to my guidance consented some time my strict regimen kept him alive poor dangle once more was beginning to thrive and had he some months in my plan perseverd on the earth at this moment he might have appeared but chance threw a pretty white girl in his way and eager for marriage fond jack would not stay in vain i conjured him to wait half a year and showed him the danger he ran very clear he thought the remains of his cough but a trifle and being unable his passion to stifle he took his fair wife  but alas the vile cough increased every day till it carried him off  decisive i dont recollect any pain in my breast but i feel a strange tightness just now in my chest  morley how is your stomach  decisive i have nothing to fear on that score  morley do you eat as you did  decisive yes i think rather more  morley that ravenous hungers the thing that i dread how do you sleep  decisive all the time that i pass in my bed  morley indeed  i dont like so lethargic a slumber  decisive why my friend of good symptoms these rank in the number  morley alas you may call them all good if you please by that title you only confirm your disease in which though the patient declines very fast he for ever will flatter himself to the last believe me your symptoms are rather alarming yet your present disorder there is not much harm in if you can but abstain with a spirit resigned from all that may harrass your body or mind to a different climate i wish you would repair and for one winter breathe a less changeable air spend a christmas at naples and when you return you may marry without any anxious concern but youre now at that critical period of life when in such frames as yours nature feels an odd strife and if quiet does not all her functions befriend the short earthly scene on a sudden will end on a point so important you will pardon my freedom  decisive your cautions oblige me i feel that i need em for in truth i am growing as thin as a rabbit and there is something consumptive i know in my habit my father died soon after taking a wife and coughd out his soul when i jumped into life i suppose i am going  morley take courage my friend on your own prudent conduct your life will depend if you take but due care for two years i will engage you will stand a fair chance for a healthy old age nor would i advise you this girl to refuse a distant attachment your mind will amuse and no doubt for a man of your fortune and figure she will wait till your health has recovered its vigor  decisive i can part with the girl without feeling a chasm in my heart that will shake with no amorous spasm for to tell you the truth my old rich uncle cob is more eager than i for this marrying job by this scheme the old blade is supremely delighted because two large manors may thus be united but when of his park i have extended the bound it will do me small good if i sink under ground and i am not such a fool in these projects of pelf to humor my friends and endanger myself  morley indeed i would not wed for an old uncles whim but here comes our knight i shall leave you with him as i think you have some delicate points to adjust exit  decisive alone i am in no haste to sleep with my ancestors dust it is wiser my weak constitution to save than to marry and so travel post to the grave  enter sir nicholas sir nicholas come give me your hand and rejoice my young neighbor youre the man that is to order the pipe and the tabor and by jove well all dance on so joyous a day your wedding dear dick shall be speedy and gay for your rival is gone with our serious displeasure and i give to your wishes my young lovely treasure  a treasure she is though the girl is my niece heaven grant ye long years of affection and peace and a fine chopping boy ere the end of the first  remember that i am to see the rogue nursed go you happy young dog go and seal with a kiss and teach the old hall to reecho your bliss as i know on this match what sir jacob intends and we can so well trust each other as friends short contracts will answer as well as the best our lawyers at leisure may finish the rest i know all suspense in such cases is hard and you shall not i swear from your bliss be debarred while over acres of parchment they are crawling like snails  decisive dear sir upon weighing in reasons just scales your very great favors and my weak pretension i find i am unworthy of such condescension and must with regret the high honor resign which i once vainly thought might with justice be mine  sir nicholas heyday what does all this formality mean why dick has the devil possessed you with spleen or has love made your mind thus with diffidence sore false modesty never was your foible before you think youre unworthy  the thought is so new that i hardly can tell what to say or to do if you love the good girl full as much as you said i think you have very just claims to her bed but if your minds changed and you feel your love lighter it is better to say so than marry and slight her and if this be the  sir you have your release for although i am eager to marry my niece though i am partial to you yet i beg you to note that i dont want to cram her down any mans thtoat  decisive i am truly convinced of the ladys perfection and twould plea e dar sir to preserve the connection though now by particular reasons am led to revisit the continent once ere i wed in the time of my absence i cannot be exact but in what form you please i will freely contract in the course of two years to receive as my wife   sir nicholas do you mean to insult me you puppy odslife ere i would tie my dear girl to so silly a fop for life i would condemn her to trundle a mop and let me advise you young man for the future to know your own mind ere you go as a suitor  decisive i perceive sir my presence grows irksome to you and you will therefore allow me to bid you adieu  sir nicholas your departure indeed i dont wish to restrain and have little concern when i see you again  exit decisive sir nicholas alone what can make this pert puppy recede from his suit my fair cousin and he have scarce had a dispute she would hardly affront him on purpose to vex me  here she comes to explain all the points that perplex me enter mrs felix well cousin my scheme for a weddings suspended the beaux are both gone and their courtship is ended with an air so mysterious decisive withdraws i a little suspect youre concerned as the cause confess have you had any words with this youth  mrs felix not i my dear sir on my honor and truth but i am ready to own that the news you impart with surprise and with pleasure enlivens my heart i think your sweet niece has a lucky escape i would almost as soon see her marry an ape as her union with one of these coxcombs behold the bard is too warm and the critic too cold  sir nicholas i find that they are not such lads as i thought em the world all the worst of its fashions has taught em and the world is indeed at a very fine pass when such puppies insult so attractive a lass young fellows of fortune now think it hard duty to pay a chaste homage to virtue and beauty but i will leave these pert fops to their own vile caprice and soon find a much fitter match for my niece other orders of men for a husband i will search and i think i can settle my girl in the church  mrs felix lord cousin i thought you detested the cloth  sir nicholas our rector i own often kindles my wrath but all parsons are not like my neighbor old squabble who has learnt from his geese both to hiss and to gobble we have in our neighborhood three young divines and each i believe to selina inclines our bishops smart nephew deserves a sweet wench he himself in due time may be raised to the bench with him i should like very well to unite her and if he hereafter should rise to the mitre then perhaps we together might bring to perfection a muchwanted plan for the churchs correction  mrs felix a very fine scheme which you will manage no doubt  sir nicholas more wonderful things i have known brought about and though my first plan as you see has miscarried i am resolved that my niece shall be speedily married i will unite the good girl to a priest if i am able for the young olive branch never fails at his table there is one i prefer  but to leave the girl free i allow her to make a fair choice of the three i shall therefore invite the whole groupe to the hall and i will now go and make her write cards to them all exit  mrs felix alone what a wonderful creature is this worthy knight to make others happy is all his delight yet misled by some wild philanthropic illusion he is for ever involved in odd scenes of confusion it is well that our critic has made his last bow i rejoice he is removed and i long to know how  enter morley morley thank my stars my dear maam i have dispatched your commission your sweet friend is i hope in a tranquil condition from her two irksome lovers she now is relieved  mrs felix and i am dying to know how all this was achieved come tell me good creature how could you effect it  morley by a project so simple you would never suspect it i have banished both swains by declaring a wife would rob one of glory and the other of life i persuaded the bard his poetical fame could never exist with a conjugal flame hence he grew with your charms so licentiously free but forgive me this ill which i could not foresee decisive more wisely abandons the fair to make his own lungs his particular care  mrs felix what on such points as these have they taken your word  morley dear madam mankind credit things most absurd when they come from the mouth of a medical man hence mountebanks never want skill to trepan the extent of our empire indeed there is no seeing when we act on the fears of a true selfish being  mrs felix how simple soever the means you have employed you have remedied ills by which we were annoyed having thus cleared the scene from each troublesome lover can you not for the nymph a fit husband discover you see how she is pressed by her uncle to wed who never quits a scheme he once takes in his head  suppose her kind fancy should lean toward you is your heart quite as free as i am sure twould be true is it not preengagd  morley as in mirths sportive sally it pleases you thus a poor pilgrim to rally your good nature i know will forgive me if i to your pleasantry make a too serious reply it is my maxim to speak whatsoever be the theme with a heart undisguisd to the friends i esteem had i all indias wealth twould be my inclination to offer it all to your lovely relation but supposing it possible you could be willing to unite her with one who is scarce worth a shilling believe me dear madam my pride is too great to wish her to stoop to my humble estate  mrs felix such pride though it rests upon no strong foundation is noble i own and deserves admiration i call it illfounded because in my mind if there is fortune enough for a couple when joined if talents and worth are by each duly shared if in all other points they are equally paired and mutual regard mutual merit enhances it signifies not which supplied their finances  morley your pardon  how often when fortunes unequal gay weddings produce a most turbulent sequel but could i once hope your sweet cousin to gain how many things are there such hopes to restrain suppose your dear colonel my most noble friend whom success to your arms may more speedily send suppose having closed the bright work he has planned his return from the east he should hasten by land suppose him arrived with what face could i meet the man whom my heart should exultingly greet if he found me attempting in spite of my station to wed though a beggar your wealthy relation  mrs felix from these words my dear friend which i almost adore and a few slighter hints that escaped you before i have caught a quick hope which is fraught with delight that i soon shall be blessed with my felixs sight i begin to suspect he is in england already i perceive that you cannot keep your countenance steady with his usual attention his love has reflected how my poor foolish nerves by surprise are affected and lest they should fail me beyond all revival has sent you to prepare for his wished for arrival am i right in my guess is he not very near could i trust my own heart i should think felix here  colonel felix entering sweet foreboder behold him restored to your arms  mrs felix o my felix this transport oerpays all alarms thus to see thee restored and ennobled with fame in what words shall affection thy welcome proclaim  colonel my love my blessed treasure than glory more dear the bliss of this meeting which shines in thy tear that we owe to this friend let us never forget  morley my share in your transport oerpays all the debt  but colonel your fondness has traveled full speed and has not allowed me the time you agreed  colonel i meant not indeed to have joined you tody but i found love forbade my intended delay  morley well my duty is done now you happily meet heaven bless you together   mrs felix stay stay i entreat you must not go yet and before you depart i will open to felix the scheme of my heart  selina  behind the scene indeed sir i never can write such a card  sir nicholas behind the scene then you will forfeit at once my paternal regard  colonel heyday in the house i much fear somethings wrong as sir nicholas talks in a language so strong  mrs felix does he know you are here  colonel no my dear i think not unless he the tidings from jenny has got she alone saw me come and without much ado most kindly directed me where to find you  mrs felix they are coming this way  let us withdraw all together and contrive how to turn this loud storm to fair weather  exeunt enter sir nicholas and selina sir nicholas i insist on your writing such cards to em all  selina dear uncle i beg you will this order recall you know your commands i much wish to obey but reflect on this matter what people will say youre so eager to marry your niece they will swear that you hawk her about just like goods at a fair  sir nicholas well my dear let em say so and i will say so too for your simile proves what a guardian should do he who wants to dispose of a tender young maid may take a good hint from the gingerbread trade if he has any sense twill be ever his plan to part with soft pastry as soon as he can for egad an old maid is like old hardened paste you may cry it about but nobody will taste come do as i bid you and take up your pen  selina lord sir it will seem very odd to these men you will make me appear in a horrible light i vow my hand shakes so i never can write excuse me dear sir from this business pray do and let me live single for ever with you  sir nicholas all business where womans concerned i believe must partake of the curse from our grandmother eve all her daughters the steps of their parent have followed contradiction the core of the apple she swallowed in their veins still fermenting new ills can produce and all their blood seems coloquintida juice  you froward cross baggage your word should i take and bid you live single five years for my sake of the barbarous uncle you would quickly complain who from natures just right a young girl would restrain  selina indeed sir i should not  sir nicholas i tell you you would from perverseness alone you oppose your own good it is only to thwart me because i desire to see you well settled before i expire that you now with your soft hypocritical carriage affect to have no inclination to marriage but you will never contrive though your tongue may be nimble to convince me your heart is as cold as your thimble i know of what stuff froward damsels are made the guardian must force you who cannot persuade that you will like a good husband i never can doubt and married you shall be before the months out or at least your kind uncle no more you shall teaze but may even go to rome and turn nun if you please  selina  aside i have lost all the love he has shown me for years if i strive to reply i shall burst into tears  sir nicholas come answer me miss will you scribble or not  enter the colonel mrs felix and morley colonel my worthy old friend what can make you so hot  sir nicholas ha colonel  you find me a little concerned  but i am heartily glad you are safely returned your arrival indeed is a welcome surprise though before you your fame a bright harbinger flies we have heard your success and we all triumph in it  colonel i trust i am come in a fortunate minute to make all your present embarrassment cease for i bring a young husband my friend for your niece  sir nicholas egad that is well said and i am sure it is well meant and if he is like you he shall have my consent  colonel he has many more virtues and just as much wealth and from india brings home both his morals and health here my friend is the man  as i owe him my life i wish to present him so lovely a wife half my fortune is his  here i freely declare it and have only to hope that selina may share it i have regarded her long as a child of my own nor can my affection more truly be shown than by wishing to place the dear girl in the arms of the friend whose rare virtues are worthy her charms  morley dear generous felix i am quite overcome thy bounty is such it strikes gratitude dumb  colonel this was ever my friend my most settled intention though my very just purpose i chose not to mention from the hope i should find what i gladly embrace a moment from which it may borrow some grace when my gift its plain value may rise far above by the aid it affords to the wishes of love and i own as a prophet i am proud of my art now i see the effects of her charms on your heart  morley o felix can i thus deprive thy free spirit of wealth the reward of heroical merit can i the victorious commander despoil of what he has purchased with danger and toil should love and delight on thy present attend i could never be happy in robbing a friend no i still must decline   sir nicholas my dear boy say no more youre the match that i never could meet with before i have long sought in vain for an heir to my mind but all my soul wished in your spirit i find you shall not rob your friend of a single an indian coin gold mohr he can raise heirs enough to inherit his store to such men as himself let him haste
