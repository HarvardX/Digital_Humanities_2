hannah hewit  hannah hewit or the female crusoe being the history of a woman of uncommon mental and personal accomplishments who after a variety of extraordinary and interesting adventures in almost every station of life from splendid prosperity to abject adversity was cast away in the grosvenor eastindiaman and became for three years the sole inhabitant of an island in the south seas  supposed to be written by herself  there is an especial providence in the fall of a sparrow volume i  london printed for c dibdin at his music warehouse no     strand  advertisement it is particularly requested that the following address to the public may not be read till after a perusal of the work itself for though it is not intended as a key no such thing being necessary it is so far a sort of elucidation that a previous knowledge of it might serve by anticipating some of the circumstances to take off the edge of the readers curiosity which be it as keen as it may will often be whetted in the course of his acquaintance with hannah hewit  to the public the readers of hannah hewit having been requested to suppose that her life was written by herself are now entreated to go on and suppose a little more and first that her brother captain higgins to whom hewits chest was given in care was shipwrecked and lost in his passage home on one of the scilly islands and that the cargo and different effects of the dane and of course hewits chest fell a prey to the fishermen smugglers and other uncivilized boors who inhabit those islands  let me then intrude for a further supposition that hewits chest having been thrown among some lumber in a cellar was discovered eight years afterward by a grubstreet poet who tired out by a long series of literary disappointments turned misanthrope and went to reside in that obscure part of the world  this supposed permit me to make interest for one more supposition that by some circuitous route no matter what the whole of these materials came into my possession that i found them a large loose indigested mass that i separated methodized and regulated them and that they are now given to the public in that form which i thought would be most acceptable  these suppositions let me tell the reader are not amiss first if captain higgins notwithstanding his boasted security and implicit reliance on the wind was cast away what cause would there be to admire the prescience of hannah hewit who warned him against taking the voyage and actually prevailed on seven other persons to stay with her thereby saving their lives  next the supposition that hewits chest filled with manuscripts should be thrown about like lumber among a set of people who could not read is really neat enough and again it is not only ingenious to say an author should be the first to rescue them from oblivion but it is fairly in point being poor that he should wish to get something by them the only wonder is that he did not pass them for his own except indeed we believe that they are his invention and that as lady writing is now very fashionable he thought it his interest to foist them upon hannah but this last will not do for it knocks up the other suppositions  the last supposition that this work by some means or other came into my hands is not to be so easily cleared for account for it how i may it is impossible that i should every where gain credit my readers therefore for i hope there will be a great many and i am sure they will all be candid and kind having so handsomely indulged me with several suppositions for my accommodation are respectfully requested on this subject to add a supposition for themselves  in the mean time i shall speak of this work as if i expected implicit belief that it was found in hewits chest not that i mean to say i ever saw hewits chest for that would be as times go rather too ticklish an assertion no no i only speak of the manuscripts the chest was left as a memento on the scilly island which undoubted fact if this history were of consequence enough to make such a stir about it i could procure to be authenticated by the signatures of the parson and churchwardens and the marks of the overseers and half the inhabitants  but i am afraid i am wrong and by appearing so anxious to establish this fact like the old woman who swept the dust about the house till she lost it it will be suspected of being no fact at all i shall therefore take bolder ground and say that so far from not being possible the thing is very likely  dont we know that don quixote instead of being written by cervantes was found and i believe in a chest among the writings of cid hamet benanjulo were not to our certain knowledge the entire works of aristotle as i had occasion largely to illustrate in the preface to my other novel buried in the earth for two hundred and seventy years and afterward known to be genuine  will any body after this tell me that i need make myself uneasy that such a trifling work should have been found in a chest only eight years after it was deposited there and in what chest too a seamans chest what is a seaman without his chest what so likely to be found after a shipwreck where is it more probable that a ship should be wrecked than on the scilly islands for my part i think it would be impertinence to offer another proof  let it however be remembered that the pains i have taken have been solely on my own account i have no wish in this business to get into any public controversy let every tub or rather chest stand upon its own bottom i cannot help however confessing that it will be an unspeakable satisfaction to me to find that in elucidating the truth of my own argument i shall have been fortunate enough to establish and confirm the worlds belief of any similar fact or which expression is i believe more fashionable  fac simile  having now so positively proved how this history was found i shall go on to show first the probability of its having been written by hannah hewit and secondly how far as to its circumstances it is entitled to implicit credit from the public  as to the first consideration  if hannah hewit did not write this book will the reader have the kindness to tell me who did this i think is unanswerable indeed who but she could have given so minute and particular an account of all that happened both before and during the time she was secluded from the world who could have broached her opinions explained her resources or entered as it were into the recesses of her heart but herself  there is a vein all the way through i will not say of egotism for hannah was above being tainted with vanity but of that laudable ambition which all men and women too entertain to set up in their own example a model for the worlds imitation and which cannot be given in colors so glowing from the pen of any other as the person by whom it is felt  i believe it will be given me that this propensity prevails throughout human nature and that there is no regular system be it cock fighting love eating reform swearing dressing bamming simpering lounging backbiting or whatever else may happen to be the reigning pleasure or business of the moment but some son or daughter of creation is emulous to hold out as a worthy example to his or her fellow creatures  if hannah could have had a foible i think it would have been this her intellects were strong her invention prompt and her conclusions found and just added to exquisite feminine suseeptibility she had a male mind in short she had those requisites without which no female can be absolutely a writer and if these deceived her into an opinion that a moral application would be made of her work and that under the idea of doing good for evil she should do a great deal to please a world that had done a great deal to vex her the error will of course be pardoned in favor of the intention  having as completely proved that hannah wrote her own life as that it was found in hewits chest i shall go into the probability of its being authentic and then after a few conclusive remarks take my leave of the reader  as to the authenticity of this work for my own part were i not so situated as to be under the necessity of speaking to it in some degree i should be wholly silent for whenever i take up a book so the matter is entertaining and the sentiments are just it is perfectly indifferent to me whether they are conveyed through the medium of fact or fiction and as to the present subejct having never to the best of my recollection seen any more of mrs hewit than of her husbands chest it would not only be proposterous folly but an insult to the public which no hannah hewit shall ever catch me at were i to pledge myself to the literal truth of a single iota throughout the whole business  i am nevertheless strongly inclined to believe that this history is at least essentially true for there are many of the circumstances the similarity of which i recognize correctly and i should be very apt to pin an implicit faith upon the whole exactly as it is here set down were it not that these persons and these circumstances are cut out now and then and fitted so as to answer a judicious purpose instead of being suffered to stand in their original character and form  for instance i once knew a man so extremely like sourby that i defy hannah hewit to bring forward any plan of domestic ruin her sourby ever meditated but i will match with one fabricated by mine indeed i should fancy them one and the same person if it was not that her sourby was swallowed by a shark whereas i met mine the other day lolling in his chariot  the conduct of every nefarious lawyer is so alike that it is not wonderful having as walmesley would have said seen some desperate service that i should know the exact representative of lawyer higgins the fact is one trifling difference excepted i could point at the man which difference is only this that hannahs lawyer was hanged at tyburn whereas mine is not hanged yet  by circumstances like these i am now and then given to believe that in the fullness of her zeal hannah sometimes bounced that is to say poetically and she was right for if it be true which it is and a lamentable consideration into the bargain that vice is seldomer punished than moral justice requires it is fairly the business of the poet occasionally to call in a shark or a halter that a literary work may go ino the world not only to encourage the virtues of the good but to gnaw and choke the consciences of the bad  but to continue my examination i knew the man and have a good reason to remember him who under the title of captain higgins performed that exploit in the britannia and afterward commanded the eagle all which as well as the vigo business his being cheated by his merchants his going to the fleet and afterward to india and many other things are to my knowledge literally true  if it were necessary i might next go into the good natured thoughtlessness of walmesley the weakness that perpetually betrayed hewit into indiscretion the unaffected manliness of binns and the fine mind of young hewit and say that i virtually knew every one of them for though i have been pretty roughly treated in the world as well as hanah i have still a pleasure and a willingness to confess that such characters are to be found the misfortune is that being in the garden of life though a very beautiful yet a very humble plant they are so choked up and trampled upon that it requires both sound judgment and keen penetration to discover them and even then they are so warped and distorted that they seldom display their native sweetness and beauty except when nurtured in the shades of obscurity  these observations may serve to convince the reader that the characters are drawn in the spirit of truth it will be only necessary therefore to see whether the incidents in this history are brought about by probable means which i shall certainly not shrink from but it must appear reasonable to any one that i ought here to have a large latitude if circumstances arise from others which though they are in their nature improbable we actually know may and do occasionally happen the ground of those circumstances being strong the circumstances will be strong also  for instance when a ship is underweigh upon ever so long or ever so hazardous a voyage how infinite the odds are that she is not cast away therefore a shipwreck is a very improbable thing but we know that ships have been cast away and that the grosvenor east indiaman was one of them and we also know that the crew and passengers suffered unheard of hardships this is one of the strong consequences i allude to which though not prima facie a probability is both as probable and as natural a consequence as the commonest deduction from the commonest cause  it is upon this principle that i would guard the reader from fancying that though upon the first blush there may appear something of the extravaganza in this work there is nothing of the mavelous and though i shall take but little time in doing so i dont despair of bringing home to the conviction of the reader a broad and liberal probability even to the same degree that i believe it myself that the work as i said before is essentially true  it must be remembered that i advertised this work as the history of a woman of uncommon mental and personal accomplishments the latter the reader has a better right to credit than ever reader had to credit the beauty of any heroine yet recorded for though a woman and writing her own history she does not at any one time tell you whether she was tall or short or fair or brown whether her favorite mode of doing execution was by an ogle a smile a sigh a lisp a pat a loll a leer or a trip but leaves for proof the force of her charms to the impression they made on her various admirers from sourby to the monkies the word uncommon is therefore the most proper epithet i could have chosen  but if hannah is silent on her personal accomplishments she pays it off by describing those of her mind even to mnutie not however that she would have done this had it not been positively necessary for let an indifferent person take up the meanest article made by the meanest artiza and but that it is customary to see such articles constantly before his eyes he would think it was performed by miracle her difficulty therefore was to prove that one person could do so much but i can in my mind very easily get over this  the principle of every thing is almost exactly alike and the comprehension that can clearly and correctly admit this in one instance will by perseverence find little difficulty to admit it in every instance thus the principle learnt an active mind has nothing to do but to fashion and vary it and every thing in time may be accomplished especially with those who have strength of conception enough to teach themselves  i will illustrate this for i cannot make out my position too forcibly by a very extraordinary instance when i was in beverly in yorkshire i enquired for a person to tune a piano forte i was told that the organist was out of town but they could send for quiz being the first time i ever heard the word and i would not lay a wager that it was not its origin i was curious to know who they meant by quiz when i learnt that the person in question was a journeyman tailor of the name of oliver who had occasionally worked at every sort of business till at last having been captivated by music like the man who was determined to learn boyers dictionary by heart by way of teaching himself french he thought he should get at the whole science of music through the medium of tuning piano fortes  i found quiz a much more extraordinary creature than he was described for i was curious and he was communicative without knowing any thing systematically it is astonishing what conclusions he had formed by going over again and again the different distances necessary for tuning an instrument and then every thing he used he had made himself not having money enough to buy a tuning hammer he actually took the stand of his goose to a blacksmiths shop and shaped one out of it which i saw and it answered the purpose even better than tuning hammers in general  but this is nothing two or three patents had been procured for inventions of his suggestion one was for clothing of deathhead buttons a machine for the performance of which having seen that clothed four buttons at a time he made the man a model for one that would cloth forty who took this friendly advantage of the poor fellows ingenuity in short there is nothing in mechanics that he could not have undertaken with success and had he been in the situation of hannah hewit i have no doubt but he could have accomplished every thing she accomplished and yet he was in every other respect illiterate and uninformed what wonder then that she should do all she tells us who possessed so many superior advantages  the astonishing ingenuity of hannah hewit being completely got over i shall now examine the incidents in her history and first i believe it will be allowed me that there is nothing in the three first books that bears the slightest hue of improbability i shall however mention the business of her predicting the fate of france because it will be said by those who let me take what pains i may will still believe this book to be my invention that it is easy to prophecy a thing after it has happened to all such i answer that if i could myself have predicted the fate of france nineteen years ago why could not hannah hewit nay i did predict it so no doubt did the duke of dorset so did count dillon whose reputations were stained by the insidious whispers of that monster dorieans  so i am sure did the emperr he would never have refused to marry a woman who in her death proved herself an honor to her sex and to human nature had he not feared that by a closer alliance with france he should intail misery on his own subjects while they went no further than wearing clothes the color of the queens hair he considered it as gallantry and a compliment to his amiable sister but when they wore the emperors eyes he began to look about him  in short he came determined to know the character of the french thoroughly for this he came incog for this he mixed with every order of the people and by this he so completely discovered a spirit of revolt hid like a smothered spark throughout the kingdom that as an instance of it when he was at nanci in lorraine had he hinted such a wish they would once more have cut off that province from france and hailed him its prince  every thing after the grosvenor was cast away will of course be found of that extraordinary kind which extraordinary exigencies seem to justify hannahs hardships which like camomile or anteus she resisted in proportion as she was oppressed will easily be admitted even the shark though i treated it with pleasantry by no means outrages probability and as to the lion to those whose convictions have not yielded to the many instances hannah herself has adduced i shall only say that there is at this moment in the tower a tiger a creature of a much more ferocious nature than the lion that was the playfellow of a midshipman all the way from india  hannahs escape from the lioness is also reconcilable enough and though many similar instances may not have occured there are not wanting some to bear us out father philip dechausse a carmelite relates a circumstance still more extraordinary a portugese sailing in the bauge an orientalriver went ashore to enjoy the beauty of the place he had scarcely walked many paces when a frightful crocodile appeared ready to devour him he instantly recoiled and measured his way back again as fast as possible and just as he seemed in safety from the jaws of the crocodile a famished tiger made a spring at him when avoiding him by a providential inclination of his body the tiger passed over the traveller with such force that he fell into the jaws of the crocodile and became its prey  but i am got into such length that i cannot now stop at trifles i shall therefore leaving every thing else to the candor of the reader go to hannahs winding up the whole which i beg once more to be pardoned for calling her living apotheosis and yet i cannot see how i could have used a weaker term i dare say every one of her hearers felt her words like the inspiration of a deity how much more then would those words have borne that resemblance could any one have whispered that they were a warning to save eight such friends as surely never met together but upon that island from destruction  thus i have troubled the reader with such a clue as i flatter myself will serve to show how this book was found by whom it was written and that the circumstances it contains are within the scope of probability and i would not have any one fancy upon the faith of my having omitted any thing that i have not enough to say if ever the probability of the circumstance should be attacked most of the difficult things i know to be practicable and have no doubt but i can prove it by time place and person therefore before any caviler thinks proper to indulge a different opinion i would have him look to the validity of his own experience and not pronounce a thing impossible merely because his ability is not equal to the task  and now if this work should become popular and the persons concerned in it attract public curiosity as it is ten years since captain higgins left the island and therefore the probability i like the word is that there are by this time plenty of young hewits higginses and walmesleys i do not think it would be amiss only it would be a pity to disturb them if some ship on a discovery were to try all the comora islands round till they met with hannahs eden in which case we might not only hear what they were about but establish a sort of place of call for the india ships like the cape of good hope and st helena besides in that case hannah might have the satisfaction both of reading her life in print according to captain higginss words and also of learning the fate of that relation whom she so much valued and for whom she so much feared which considerations again would bind the little commonwealth of edenites with a fresh degree of satisfaction to their resolution of remaining in their paradise  all this however i leave to the public assuring them that if any more of hannahs writings should be discovered and deposited with me i shall lend my helping hand to usher them into the world with the same fidelity which i have made my ground of conduct in the present instance i would however recommend a caution this being a notable age for literary discoveries lest they should be imposed upon by some spurious hannah hewit and so advising that my hint may not be thrown away and begging pardon for this long intrusion i shall finish in the true advertising strain and say beware of counterfeits for such are abroad  hannah hewit book i containing the juvenile adventures of hannah hewit chap i in which after a modest apology the subject of these adventures relates a train of circumstances that threw her early upon the world heaven only knows whether these particulars will ever be made public but as they contain the history of a harmless and inoffensive individual whose life has been chequered by a train of extraordinary events as they show the firmness and vigor with which providence vouchsafes to endow the human mind in proportion to its various trials and above all as it proves in every line the indulgent and benevolent care with which our all merciful creator is graciously pleased to watch and protect the meanest of his creatures so i think it my duty to trust these sheets to chance in hopes through one of those unforeseen accidents by which men are permitted to wonder and admire many a fair eye and many a manly heart may pay a tribute of sympathy to the memory of hannah hewit  i was born may  0      in one of those cottages which are scattered through that well known spot called coalbrook dale my father whose name was higgins worked occasionally in the coalmines assisted in burning coke extracting iron from ore and polishing cylinders he was an honest man and contrived with the assistance of my mother who spun worsted and knit stockings to keep six children a bedridden aunt and my mothers brother who had been three years deaf and blind in consequence of an explosion in a coalmine at which time several persons were crushed to death and among the rest my brother peter who was three years older than i  never was a family so marked by misfortune as mine when i was only five years old i lost my father my mother and brother and sister in the following extraordinary manner my father had killed a a large bacon hog and was preparing to singe it at which ceremony my mother and such of the children as were able assisted indeed it was a feast to us hogs puddings and chitterlings being danties we could not get every day while we were thus busily employed we observed an uncommon light in the little hovel that served us for a habitation it was occasioned by my little brother who had put straw under his sisters cradle a child of six months old and set it on fire to singe her in imitation of my father who was singing the hog my father who divined the cause flew like lightning into the house and being exasperated at my brother who was dancing round the cradle all in flames struck at him as he thought with his hand but it unfortunately contained the fatal knife with which he had killed the hog the moment he discovered what he had done he raved and screamed out  that he had killed his child then full of destraction ran to throw himself into the severn my mother now roused from that stupefaction into which she had been thrown followed him with such expedition that she caught hold of him as he reached the margin of the river neither force nor entreaty could prevail on him to abandon his desperate resolution she struggled with him but in vain till at length his strength being superior to here is as she would not let go her hold they both fell in and were drowned  young as i was i shall never forget the impression this awful scene made on my tender mind and as if providence whose daughter i am and whose care i have always been had determined to arm me with proper fortitude for my alarming situation and vigor to support through life the various misfortunes i was born to encounter my reflections became firm and decisive and i was no longer a child from that moment  the unhappy condition of those of my family that remained excited the pity of my fathers employer and we were by his interest admitted into the workhouse i had learnt to spin long before this but here i learnt to read and write which so employed my mind that i was never so happy as when i was improving myself this extraordinary industry and application attracted the notice of the vicar a venerable and most amiable man of whom i shall have frequent occasion to speak i owe to him those sentiments that have been the comfort and consolation of my life his name was williams and if he be alive and should read this he will have fresh occasion to commend me for observing his lessons which though my life has been unfortunate has kept it irreproachable  as soon as i had perfected myself in one thing i learnt another and there was no trade practiced in the workhouse that i had not some notion of reading and writing however were at that time the greatest pleasures of my life and to those employments i devoted all my leisure hours but what begat in me the greatest emulation was reading those works written by my own sex who i confess i secretly envied and devoutly wished that in time i might aspire to the enviable distinction of being considered as a female writer little divining so fatal a propensity would only be gratified by recording upon the leaves of a tree in an uninhabited island the sad vicissitudes of my unfortunate life  this desire was considerably increased by the success that attended mr williamss daughter a young lady of uncommon talents and a prodigy of learning her poems were read with admiration and she was considered as the best lady writer since sapho to be sure she wrote a play which did not succeed but this was attributed to its having been written with strict decency a circumstance often neglected i must confess but i hope for the honor of my sex that when their writings verge toward obscenity it is not because that style is natural or habitual to them but because it is necessary to write indelicately to please an indelicate age  in this however miss williams whose christian name was margery considered less her fame than her honor and i flatter myself i have so well profitted by her example that though i may have in the course of this work many strong circumstances to relate no one will be able to accuse me of suffusing the check of modesty with a blush  in addition to the smattering of literature i picked up at over hours which i employed in whatever industry i was set about at the vicars i studied superficially all those accomplishments which miss williams possessed in so perfect a degree so that what between the workhouse and the vicars before i was ten years old i could spin knit knot sew stitch darn make gloves mend shoes do rush straw and cane work write draw point a hobnail and play upon the guitar  but now a much larger field for the exercise of my talents was opened to me a considerable manufacturer at wolverhampton having dined at the vicars and taken notice not only of the adroitness with which i had under the tuition of miss margery williams set about painting a fireskreen but the improvements i had suggested to the carpenter as to the principle on which he had mounted it declared from what he saw i should be of infinite service in the japanning line into which employ it is very common to take girls from the workhouse  my benefactor caught at this suggestion and to be brief for this is a part of my history that i ought to compress into as narrow a compass as possible in less than six weeks i was bound apprentice to mr smallbrook who every body must remember as an eminent manufacturer in the japan line at wolverhampton  my employ was to paint birds beasts butterflies fruit and landscapes upon urns tea boards bread baskets and toilette boxes and i have no doubt but many of my fair readers may be induced from this passage to wish that some commode pincase or patchbox in their possession may be of my painting certainly if such a fact could be ascertained many a trifle that has passed these hands might from the singular circumstances of my strange fortune be considered in as curious and valuable a light as the mould of a queen elizabeths farthing or the feathers upon the wing of the hunchback beetle  to such as are desirous of knowing whether they are in possession of any vestige of those toys and utensils which from      to      were principally suggested by me and which have rendered so celebrated the manufactory of pontipool i shall hold out a clue to discover the truth if the subject be a shepherdess getting over a style and unconsciously betraying the symetry of a well turned leg to a concealed shepherd or as its companion a strephon plunging into a transparent brook and buffetting aside the yielding waves with his sinewy limbs while his enamoured daphne her lamb by her side stands facinated as she peeps through the umbrage of a close enwovened wood the design is sure to be mine and perhaps the execution  the last subject even at this distance of time forces tears into my eyes for it brings to my recollection that fatal day i fell in love with john hewit the author of all my pains and pleasures the only difference in the situation of the picture is that i was varnishing a plate warmer in the garret with a cat upon my shoulder and he was tinning a saucepan in the smithy  this circumstance of the cat is extremely well worth attending to and i am particularly pleased that my noticing it here gives me an opportunity of recollecting that i must have had an extraordinary consideration and respect for the unfortunate at my time of life for i perfectly well remember that my partiality to cats arose from their being an animal that all the world persecuted i will confess that being a female and fond of erudition i had some uneasy moments lest my predelection for tabbies might be the means of my becoming an old maid but having seen john hewit i grew perfectly easy on that head  i need not apologize in this place to the intelligent reader who knows that the minutest circumstances are of consequence in an extraordinary and complicate history like mine and i may perhaps have hereafter reason to remark that providence permitted this very prepossession singular and almost ludicrous as it was to inspire me with a desire of soliciting a protection to which i at this moment owe the preservation of my life and my honor  but of that in its place  chap ii some remarks on the force of destiny and an account of john hewit and his two male friends the variety of occupations followed at wolverhampton coming in contact with a mind thirsting after improvement and fertile in invention like mine no wonder if my progress as an artist and a mechanic was remarkable no ingenious device elegant form or tasty invention was put into hand till i was consulted at length my judgment and opinion became so celebrated that before i was fifteen my abilities were considered as equal to a fortune and i might have made my choice among the most opulent at wolverhampton  destiny however which all must obey an observation that never was more truly verified than in my wayward fortune ordained otherwise john hewit though a man of indifferent character bad connections low conversation and only an appretice to a tinman why or wherefore i did not know won my heart in spite of me and for him i rejected with disdain the most eligible offers  were i to avail myself of my privilege as a writer i might defend my conduct upon various principles but as i am writing a life and not a controversy i shall only speak of myself as a woman and say that though my conduct was madness i could not have courage to argue with the impulse i felt and therefore yielded to what i knew would make me miserable  to account for my partiality to the object of my affections his exclusive possession of my heart to the discomfiture of so many plateharness button buckle and thimblemakers for the rancour scandal and slander of all the wolverhampton females and in short for that discontent to others and misery to myself which i caused in my implicit obedience to my destiny i shall only say that whatever he might be in other respects john hewit was the handsomest man eyes ever beheld  that i may not however lay under the imputation of sensuality i had many other motives for this conduct in the first place he had a vile character and with what pleasure did i contemplate the glory i should reap in reclaiming him  then he was illiterate uninformed and brutal and how could i employ the information i had picked up better than in instructing polishing and civilizing him could i have a properer opportunity to put into active practice that beneficence and philanthropy i had learnt from the vicar and his daughter to oblige any fellow creature is a satisfaction to a heart like mine but to oblige a handsome man and one whom fate destined for her husband is surely the most brilliant trait that ever complimented the disernment and mind of a female  john hewit was the son of a cowdriver near shefnal his father had the misfortune to be tried and convicted of a highway robbery but as every body knew he was not guilty of the theft which beyond a doubt was committed by the son of a rich grazier in the neighborhood the jury and in particular the father of the thief who was one of them recommended him to mercy in consequence of which he was only transported for life  the family of old hewit consisting of a wife and three children of whom john was the eldest were now obliged to shift for themselves and john being admired for his beauty by the wife of a farrier who besides had a regard for his mother he was employed being thirteen years old to hold the horses and to do whatever else he could to render himself useful  though this farrier was very like vulcan being lame brutal and a blacksmith i cannot say his good dame in the smallest degree bore a resemblance to venus except in her passion for adonis whose perfect resemblance as far as description goes she certainly had in her house and fame does them both injustice or the resemblance of their amor was also realized for the farrier before john was fifteen became such a nayword that he turned him away but not till he had purloined a ring and a watch which circumstance the good lady did not think proper to impart to her husband  after this he rambled about with some gypsies and took one short trip to sea at last good parson williams who was the constant friend of distress and who indeed had been instrumental in saving the life of johns father undertook out of pity to his mother to put him out apprentice  being heartily tired of his rambles he took to his business pretty well and for two years his master was perfectly satisfied with him but as folly is a combustible in which the smallest spark will easily cause an explosion so the notice that was taken of him for being now upwards of seventeen he went by the name of the handsome tinman puffed up his vanity to such a degree that he began to be fully convinced he should make his fortune by means of his person  in this preposterous idea he was encouraged by his companions with whom he was perpetually in the company of loose women among these companions was one called thomas sourby a name i have reason enough to curse this man had ruined the principles of many young men and young women too in the neighborhood a matter of no great difficulty in a manufacturing place where so many males and females of all ages and complexions promiscuously work together  he had such consummate art and such a perfect knowledge of mankind that he made them subservient to his pleasures and convenience under an idea of teaching them how to go through the world and was so adroit in his business that whenever he did amiss somebody else was suspected and whenever others did what was praise worthy he was sure to arrogate all the credit if any one was protected from a thief or their goods saved out of a fire though he came perhaps after the danger was over he so managed it that he was considered as the sole instrument of their preservation and on the contrary if he wired twenty hares the suspicion lay upon somebody else  it is singular however that nothing could be so obvious as his real character and yet nobody saw it he had no employ no fortune no means yet he was always flush of money he was arrogant ignorant and presuming yet every body listened to his advice every body despised him every body feared him and every body courted him  i divined him to my misforrune in a moment his whole conduct consisted but of three qualities which qualities whoever has the unmerciful courage to practice however despicable they may appear in the eyes of men of intrinsic merit will with the generalty of the world be loaded with caresses  these qualities were penetration to discover the follies of others impudence to defend your own and want of feeling to take advantage of both no man ever possessed these diabolical qualities in a stronger degree than thomas sourby and of course no man could be more calculated to wind round his finger such an easy vain credulous creature as john hewit  there was another young man at wolverhampton whose name was william binns he was exactly the reverse of sourby his heart being as good as the others was wicked and indeed they were not only marked by contrary sentiments but contrary fortunes sourby living at random nobody knew how and binns being established as an active partner with mr gregory his half uncle a respectable and flourishing manufacturer  this partnership arose from the following circumstance  mr gregory had a brother who was many years his partner upon mutual shares this brother died and left his proportion of the concern to his widow whose maiden name was binns she had an idle brother who after lavishing away what his parents could afford him and losing many good opportunities of establishing himself at last forfeited the good opinion of his relations was discarded and rather than starve got an employment something similar to that of my father in coalbrook dale  there he married a poor but industrious woman who brought him several children and behaved so well to him that he grew more sober and discreet this induced his sister the widow to consider him again as her brother but as low company was his delight and indeed he was not by nature calculated for any liberal or ingenious pursuit she contented herself with eking out his pittance with a small annuity and in other respects contributing at times to his comfort and convenience she was also often heard to declare she should remember his children in her will and when he should have a boy grown to a proper age she would take care of his education and bring him up in the business in which she yet retained her share as she was very anxious to keep up the name of binns  the unhappy wife of this man fell a victim among others to that explosion of a coalmine in which as i have already mentioned my uncle was so materially hurt and my poor little brother killed after her loss the husband relapsed into his former irregularities his sister however still commiserated his situation and took his children now reduced to two a boy and a girl under her protection and though she would not openly countenance him prevailed on the beneficent parson williams secretly to administer to his necessities  she afterward died and left her property between her nephew and niece the first of whom the very binns i am speaking of became mr gregorys partner and the latter a very sweet girl managed the house  binns who was acquainted with hewit took a great deal of trouble to show him the absurdity of his conduct and of course got affronted for his pains this however did not check him he returned to the charge and persevered till at last he showed john so strongly the folly of counting upon personal advantages with an uncultivated mind that he really began to feel a little right pride for the first time and i own my wish to complete such a meritorious work originated from receiving this information  chap iii an account of john hewits two female friends and a most powerful instance of the dreadful effects of indiscretion about this time an affair happened that became a town talk one jenny rhodes a sorry hussy who worked in a large button manufactory proved with child and though her connections with the young men in the place were certainly very promiscuous she determined to swear the child to john hewit not because there was a greater probability of his being the father than several others but because he had slighted her for one susan wingrove another wolverhampton girl who also bore a bad character  this last mentioned girl convinced that if the other had not taken a false oath she had at least sworn very hard levelled a whole volley of abuse at her as she came from her examination before the justice  she reiterated the names of all those to whom jenny rhodes had shown her favors and pointed out plainly by circumstances to the satisfaction of a surrounding mob who were wonderfully entertained at this curious scene the great improbability of johns being the father of the child  it has been remarked that there is nothing which a disappointed woman will not meditate and so it happened in the present instance for being thus exposed and laughed at this wretch conceived the most horrid design that ever entered a subtle head or was conceived by a vile heart she knew that john hewit was to meet this susan wingrove that evening in a walk about a mile from the town called lovelane there she concealed herself and watching an opportunity favorable for her purpose that is to say at the very moment john was crossing over a style and could not see what passed in the lane she rushed upon this poor wretch plunged a knife into her bosom and instantly escaped  when hewit came to the spot where he was to meet this girl he found her weltering in her blood she seemed to have some signs of life but could not speak while he stood in a state of distraction wishing to adminster relief to her and not knowing in what manner he saw sourby at a distance who summoned by a loud hollow came up and seemed extremely shocked at the dreadful spectacle before him he shrugged and called it a strange business but said that it was proper nevertheless out of charity to convey the poor creature to some place where she might be taken care of  she was received into a neighboring cottage and a surgeon sent for in the mean time a thousand enquiries went forward as to how this murder came about john told very artlessly but with great contradiction and embarrassment all he knew and upon the whole so satisfied his hearers that except a few doubts which took their birth from his perplexity it was universally believed to be selfmurder which sourby taking hewit by the hand said he sincerely believed for he had so good an opinion of his friend that he was sure he was incapable of perpetrating so attrocious an act  in the mean time by some means or other she whole town had rung with the news that john hewit had killed susan wingrove and the surgeon had scarcely searched her wound and pronounced that it was mortal and she must infallibly die when binns who from circumstances perhaps had seen more of the real truth than any other did or chose to see pulled him aside and told him to lose no time in making his escape for that there was a warrant against him for murder  hewit ever tainted with that cowardice that attends weak minds took his friends advice and slipped away and now first arrived the mistress of the cottage who said the poor creature could speak and the only word she had uttered was hewit next it was discovered that hewit had run away for which they blamed one another all round and last arrived the constables to take him up  let every young man who reads this passage take warning by it and shun bad women as he would shun inevitable destruction for it is a road to perdition in which tread as cautiously as he will he is in danger of perishing at every step as soon as the poor wretch could speak she did indeed pronounce the name of hewit as the good woman of the cottage had informed her neighbors but had she staid five minutes longer in the room she would have heard her acquit him of the crime and accuse jenny rhodes  a hue and cry was now made after jenny rhodes but the constables who are not remarkable for vigilance either at wolverhamton or elsewhere were again at fault for when they arrived at her habitation she had also made her escape  the public conversation turned variously upon the subject some would have it that hewit was the murderer and that the girl out of affection to her lover and hatred to her rival had accused her and acquitted him others insisted that it must have been jenny rhodes who was known to be a wicked hussy adding that it was very unlikely the poor dying young creature would tell a lie with her last breath and others again very sagaciously remarked that they must both have had a hand in it for that both had ran away those words however were not her last nor was the surgeons judgment so infallible as he had pronounced it for she soon grew better and in six weeks got perfectly well  jenny rhodes as soon as she heard that susan wingrove was out of danger returned and as she could not be tried for murder made no scruple to declare that she had given the wound to get rid of them both for that hewit was the only man she ever loved and finding herself slighted she resolved to do one or other or both a mischief the first opportunity in the business of the child she also acknowledged she was actuated by revenge for that hewit could not possibly be the father  as john was in every respect innocent he now became an object of universal compassion and every possible step was taken to induce him to return but in vain his master advertised him as a runaway apprentice which advertisement appeared in the daily advertiser of the   th of september    0 hand bills were distributed no john returned at last at christmas time in the year      i am sure i have reason enough to remember the circumstance he was passed to his parish from the coast of sussex in a most miserable and emaciated state as a vagrant  thus the wicked wretch who had been the cause of all this mischief stayed upon the spot brazening out every thing and glorying in her infamy while he whose crime amounted at most to imprudence bore all the punishment  but the decree was just bold guilt will ever in the end find its reward the law will overtake it and so it did here for jenny rhodes was hanged at warwick two years afterward sor the murder of this very child she falsely swore to hewit but imprudence carries with it its own punishment it is a coward in vice and trembles at scarecrow consequences invented by fear had john hewit felt himself fully conscious that his conduct had been completely irreproachable he would have braved an investigation but as he knew he had associated with wretches who were capable of swearing his life away innocence itself was no shield for him and out of despair he left his home to become a wanderer and to suffer as the reader shall see punishment enough let not young men therefore be imprudent the torture cannot punish innocence the mind can smile at it whereas self reproaching imprudence will goad the mind until it find a torture for itself which indeed is its only escape from infamy for i will venture to say that any young man who has been repeatedly imprudent and has not reproached himself has gone a great way indeed toward villainy  but if it be difficult for a young man to retreat from imprudence  what must it be for a young woman the world are very little inclined to soften imprudence with the mild name of misfortune and it is generally impossible and always very difficult for the poor wretch hertself howsoever well she may be inclined to overcome the contumely and scorn that is constantly thrown upon her thus one crime follows another and unhappy wretches of this description are lost first to themselves and afterward to society except when some extraordinary circumstance points out to the world a mode of reconciliation they themselves have not the courage to adopt both these consequences happened in the present case jenny rhodes was hanged and susan wingrove having leisure to repent of her past life upon a sick bed became afterward by the good offices of parson williams a sincere penitent and was treated as an unfortunate woman entitled to the countenance of her sex and the consideration of society  chap iv touches upon sagacity and prudence and informs the reader of some particulars relative to hannahs eldest brother john hewit had scarcely left the country when i got a complete insight into the business that had terminated so unfortunately for him i found that he and the two women had been dupes to sourby who contrived the whole with the diabolical intention of getting rid of them all and these were his reasons he was tired of a connection with jenny rhodes by whom he had that child which she falsely swore to hewit he loved susan wingrove of whom he was determined to be revenged because she preferred hewit to him and he detested hewit for perpetually stepping before him in the favor of women notwithstanding all his own arts and besides all this he had a more powerful motive a secret design against me in which he thought he stood no chance of success unless he could put hewit out of the way  i have already said that i thoroughly knew the heart and principles of this man this knowledge with which one would think i was inspired seemed to guard me against all his practices and it was retentively keeping to myself how completely i had in my mind developed his character that gave me opportunity not only of frustrating all his designs but of coming at their motives  hewit had hardly turned his back when sourby unmasked and gave me clearly to understand that he wished me to consider him as a lover timed as this declaration was i could not but see in a moment into the whole mystery i concealed however my suspicions and turning his own arts against himself i contrived by leading questions in different conversations to come in parcels at the whole of what i have just related nor even young and inexperienced as i was is there any thing extraordinary in this he was too vain of his influence over others to believe he could possibly be vulnerable himself besides he had conquered and deceived experienced and artful women what need then of much caution with one so artless as i was this foible i played upon i pretended to listen to him with pleasure till i had wormed out of him enough for my purpose i then unmasked in my turn and showed him he was in my power but like tamerline bid him keep his own wicked secret and be safe upon condition he never troubled me again with his nauseous love  it is so eafy for women completely virtuous to penetrate the arts of designing lovers that i am astonished they ever fall into a snare the confident and brutal manner in which clarissa confesses lovelace eyed her in the coach from hampstead would have been enough for me and however through the medium of exaggeration such circumstances upon paper may serve as a warning i will venture to say the woman in real life who notices and feels the force of such a look from a profligate lover and is afterward betrayed lends a helping hand to her own destruction  as to myself i had long made my determination to have john hewit or remain single otherwise as i have before noticed i could have had my choice of husbands and among the rest who like edwin sighed but never spoke of love was that honest creature binns  that part of my life which past during the absence of hewit was certainly little more than a chasm in an active history like mine i therefore as if i felt a presentiment of all that was to befall me was constantly employed in qualifying myself in every thing that could counteract the evils of life and above all in storing my mind with every gift and ingredient necessary to become the best wife in the world  so much was my mind occupied in this manner that nothing was more common than to hear people say that if hannah hewit were to be thrown destitute upon an uninhabited island she would find so many resources in her own ingenuity as to give her little reason to regret her separation from society which remarks i never heard but i shuddered though at that time nothing could be farther from my thoughts than that i should have such deplorable cause to call that ingenuity into action  it may not be amiss in the interval before hewits return at which time this history will become more active to give some account of what became of my own family the reader will remember the untimely fate of my father and mother and my little brother and sister and that after that unfortunate circumstance there remained only my uncle and aunt and my two brothers my uncle and aunt died in the workhouse my eldest brobrother who was nine years older than i and of a wild disposition ran away and entered on board of ship and my other brother who was not so old by four years having learnt to write a fine hand was taken into the house of an attorney and at last became so useful to him that he articled him as a clerk  wild as my eldest brother was his mind was noble and he had an enterprising spirit i knew him to be incapable of any thing vile or unworthy and therefore had not the least doubt but that he would honorably make his way through the world it was not long before i was convinced of this for as he had a great affection for me and had faithfully kept up a correspondence with me as often as his precarious way of life gave him opportunity i not only became acquainted with all that he did but had it in my power by means of answers to his letters to give him a little sisterly advice which though in his light way he commented on with great humor he certainly took in good part and never failed kindly to thank me for  my brother when a private man was chosen by the admiral as his cockswain he was afterward placed upon the quarter deck and in process of time passed as a lieutenant but as promotion in the navy was slow and many young men of gallantry had at that time a thirst for privateering though he had not interest to procure a command for himself he got to be first lieutenant of a very fine privateer out of bristol of twentyeight guns called the britannia  this was about six months after john hewit left wolverhampton and my brother being at that time cruising in the channel and of course frequently in and out of port i heard from him often which indeed was almost unnecessary for the newspapers were perpetually speaking of his valor and conduct and though only second in command in a privateer his character as a naval officer stood very high  about this time he was concerned in an adventure that made a great noise the particulars of which he imparted to me in a letter and i cannot do better than lay it before my readers i have certainly no copy of it but am able to transcribe it from my memory with great fidelity it will serve to give an excellent trait of his character  chap v the letter of captain higgins dear hannah i have struck a stroke that has made my fortune if i had failed i should have been hanged what i did was mutiny i have succeeded and the world and especially the merchants of bristol will call it magnanimity but this is the nature of mankind  not to keep you in suspense we fell in four days ago with a loggerheaded st domingo man richly laden with cotton and indigo but almost double our force we called a counsel of the officers and the captain was against fighting her and by all the laws of prudence he was right being however a kind of now or never business for me i took advantage of the anxiety of the fine fellows who longed to have a brush at her and used every argument in my power to obtain his consent but in vain  cursedly mortifying to lose such a prize such a regale to so many jolly dogs and their families i took another touch at persuading him it would not do he represented the risk we ran and the almost utter impossibility of avoiding being taken he appealed particularly to me whether i did not know him for a man of courage and said this was not courage it was madness lord i knew every word he uttered to be truth but what then had we not a fine stupid looking hull in sight lined with bales of cotton ah hannah if you had but seen how we were standing up to her when we received positive orders to put about ship and run away damme you would have done as i did come my lads said i well fight her the wicked rogues what dye think they did they gave me three cheers very well said the captain remember i have no hand in this this is mutiny dye hear that my boys said i the captain orders all hands to quarters so on i went you see as my brother the lawyer says secundem artem sanctioning all my orders with the captains name while he was cursing away in the cabin and swearing he would bring me to a court martial well what would you have we knocked her about gloriously it would have done your heart good to have been with us at last running long side of her captain said i i am going by your orders to board the st domingo man no sooner said than done whip i was aboard her in the poising of a capstern bar struck her colors with my own hand you jade got her papers battened every thing right and tight well what dye ye think was the next thing found two women in the cabin there was a prize i dont know how it is but you never knew a fellow in your life that was in half so good a cue for making love as when he had just been a fighting and then i had been out of sight of shore so long i brushed up to them both  what do you think happened turning my eyes toward the state room a poor unfortunate woman lay at her length the poor soul had received her commission for the next world but looking further a helpless little infant  the little toad has at this moment got hold of my finger hannah  let me write you little slut do well she was to all appearance dead she had fallen it seems with her mother and lain for more than a quarter of an hour weltering in blood till she had screamed herself hoarse and lost her strength this you see i learnt from my two enamoratas who had seen all this and had given the poor little soul no assistance i was devilishly in love with them now to be sure you never heard such fine love language in your life i cursed them for two infernal hellcats and bid them bestir themselves and assist the poor little creature or i would put them in irons well away i went to work brought her to got a fire but the best of it was our people not hearing any thing of me thought i was murdered so aboard they came in a shoal what dye think i was about making pap for little britannia i mean to call her britannia hannah i have taken good care of her ever since whenever i can spare time she is upon my knee and then by way of mortifying the jezabels who would have let her die without help i make them turn out watch and watch to nurse her but hannah you are to understand these are not english women they are a sort of spanish mulattos no no i have seen a pretty many countries but either for beauty or goodness there are no women in the world like the english the mother of my little charge was an american her features are very beautiful and so after a bit of a snivel for you know i am a woman in these matters i had her treated with all decency and then committed her to davy joness locker and for want of a chaplain i said the burial service myself and perhaps with as much sincerity as his reverence and so you see the love i was in such a cursed hurry to entertain for the dingy ladies i transferred to the mother of my little smiling companion you dont know what good company she is though she cannot speak but that you know she will pay off with interest when she grows up ill make her fortune if i live but dont you think i have made a good distinction no no that is my pride a true sailor never thinksof skin deep pleasures whenever any thing comes across him that interests the heart  but i must be brief as the ghost says in hamlet the prize is going to leave us i have put on board the second lieutenant as prizemaster jack ringbolt dick dawson joe musgrove and the cleverest fellow of an ordinary seaman i ever met with one charles walmsley i entered him myself at bristol he is a devilish sightly sellow and sings a good song but what is better as we boarded the st domingo man he sent a spanish rascal to abrahams bosom just as he was aiming a a pole ax at my head  now after all i will tell you what i am almost sorry for what has been done the captain is sulky and will not avail himself of of our good fortune he has taken the command of the ship again and ordered us to go for bristol where he says he will bring us to account lord love him i know him to be as good a man as ever lived and as clever a seaman as ever stepped between stem and stern a valuable friend an affectionate husband and a tender father but i have ruined him for all that by disobeying his orders and yet his orders were reasonable it is true he will convince his owners that we were guilty of mutiny but will he convince them that this st domingo man is not worth five and fifty thousand pounds but i hope to reconcile him before we arrive in which case he shall freely have all the glory of the battle and i will content myself with having saved little britannia from a watery grave in either case i know you love me well enough to give me your approbation adieu the first box of indigo we unpack i will send you as a present to blue your clothes being  dear hannah your affectionate brother thomas higgins   chap vi the sequel of captain higginss information  a letter from charles wamlesley  and some account of hannahs second brother the event turned out as my brother had predicted he was carried round bristol on the sailors shoulders the owners immediately subscribed to build a privateer of thitysix guns the largest that ever sailed out of that port and the poor captain was advised to stay at home with his family and looked upon as a very peaceable worthy member of society but as one not fit to command a fighting ship nay he could never after get an employ in the merchants service for of course he who would not not attack an enemy could not defend himself  i must do my brother the justice to say that he was indefatigable in defending the reputation of his captain but all his efforts were considered as handsome instances of his own forbearance and disinterestedness and only served while they the better confirmed him in the good opinion of his employers to load the poor unfortunate captain with additional obliquy  at length the vessel was ready and never was there greater parade upon any similar occasion she was launched with as much form and ceremony as a first rate a ball was given to the ladies favors were worn glasses were blown with the names of the ship and commander cut on their rims fan mounts carried her portrait in short expectation was never more a tip toe nor was it ever better gratified his success was astonishing and he found himself presently worth seventeen thousand pounds his share of the prize money arising from his different captures  for my own part i grew as rich as a jew and as happy as a queen for he was continually sending me presents and would have had me come and live with him at bristol where sailor like he had a house open to all comers but i was bound both by inclination and duty to stay where i was for i own i could not give over the hope i had of once more seeing john hewit and then again exchanging a life of industry for a life of idleness was little suited to my taste besides i was an apprentice in a worthy family and had my points of honor to consider as well as my brother had his  this trade continued for a year and a half at length nothing was heard of my brother nor his ship and the conjectures of all his friends were that he was either lost or taken after i had been about three months in this state of uncertainty i received by the post the following letter  to mrs hannah higgins living at mr smallbrooks manufacturer wolverhampton mrs hannah madam being for the present disabled of the use of my right arm by reason of a wound from a splinter in running under the fort of vigo i write by the hand of the gentleman next in command i being by your brothers goodness first lieutenant to let you know that i am very much afraid your brothers hanged but dont be alarmed let them hang him at their peril if they do i will run up the two spaniards at the yard arm and so i have sent them word  the thing is your brother has been conquered by treachery fair fighting would never have done it last saturday was a fortnight at two oclock p m we put into vigo for water captain higgins was invited ashore by the governor in a very handsome manner that i must needs say but let a spaniard alone they had it seems declared war against england and we being at sea never heard of it  so after giving my captain a good dinner he got a very pretty piece of news for his desert they told him he was a prisoner and desired he would send instructions to me his first lieutenant to deliver up the ship and cargo to two swarthy rascals of spaniards that they sent aboard of us captain higgins who always valued his owners interest above his own wrote on the margin in a figure hand that nobody understood but he and i these words walmesley dont regard what i have written above but slip your cable and out to sea whatever becomes of me show your usual readiness to oblige me by obeying my orders  i scratched my head and looked like a fool there was not a moment to lose at last it came into my mind that by keeping the two spaniards we might save our captain so i got them below gave them some liqoeurs notified my orders and we were under a flowing topsail in the striking of a jack as soon as the spaniards discovered what we were after they said i had better go back for that we should see captain higgins hanging on the town walls well said i my lads give a good look out and if it be so run up these good gentlemen that will be some revenge at any rate two to one will be odds  but now we had something else to think of we were running under the fort and gloriously pepper us they did but never mind that i have brought the vessel safely to lisbon spaniards and all and have applied to the english consul and he says he will do what he can for us and as i knew nothing would give your brother so much satisfaction as relieving you from any uneasiness you might be under upon his account i have troubled you with these few lines being all at present from  your humble servant charles walmesley   this letter gave me considerable uneasiness the uncertainty of my brothers fate was a dreadful reflection to me and there was little probability that i should be very soon relieved from my suspense but there were other circumstances which caused me many unpleasant thoughts this charles walmesley my brother had in his letters represented to me as a handsome man and a worthy character and indeed in his plain but strongly affectionate manner had requested i would think of him as a husband declaring that if on their return i should like him he would share his last sixpence with us  i certainly had a proper sense of his kindness and turned the matter in my mind very frequently but those who know any thing of love will confess with me that opposition confirms his reign and obstacles serve only to stimulate his exertions my brothers idea of a handsome man might not be to my taste and then all the world could not have bribed me to marry a sailor again how to give up the flattering expectation of reforming poor hewit who was a handsome man to my taste these and other reflections created a conflict in my mind between my wishes and those of my brother my excuses to him however had been nothing more than that it was a strange thing even upon his recommendation to fall in love with a man i had never seen i might not think on the subject like him that an agreeable companion to him on board ship might be ill calculated to make himself agreeable to me ashore and that it did not follow because he was a good seaman and an honorable character he would make such a husband as i should approve of  these excuses were always combated with such sort of answers as seemed as if he had some person who was a spy upon my actions he knew my reasons  i did not like worth and honor i liked profligacy and a vagrant in short he at length pofitively gave me to understand that he was perfectly acquainted with my partiality for hewit but assured me if ever i expected to receive any countenance from him i must think of no other person than walmesley  it came into my mind immediately that sourby was the cause of all this for as every body had heard of my brother and even the newspapers instructed any body how to address him nothing could be easier than for sourby to give this information relative to me which i had no doubt his malignant mind would induce him to represent in every possible way to my disadvantage  it was at the time i was preparing to combat this treachery which i had so sagaciously discovered that i received the letter from walmesley which i own had a most extraordinary effect on my mind it was so full of gratitude to my brother so personally brave so sensible as to conduct and then the poor fellow with his arm in a sling to think of sending me word of my brothers misfortune not apparently out of solicitude on my account but because he thought it would give his benefactor pleasure and all this without a word of love if he had seen and known me ever so he could not have taken so complete a method of interesting me in his favor i own i felt this most sensibly and so little does human reason take reflection with it that i wished for a moment there was no such person in the world as john hewit  as i was constrained to wait till my patience was fairly worn out before this matter was elucidated i cannot do better than employ that tedious interval in speaking of my other brother who was as great a disgrace and reproach to me as my elder brother was an honor and a credit  he was as i have said already articled to an attorney but instead of bending his mind to make his profession an instrument of comfort and convenience to his fellow creatures his uniform study was to harrass and distress them if he was sent to serve a writ or levy an execution it was not sufficient to insult the poor wretch its sacrifice he enjoyed with a detestible pleasure the misery of the wife and the terror of the children and with the most ingenious cruelty magnified their apprehensions  his idea seemed to be that hardness of heart and subtilty were the only characteristic requisites in the practice of an attorney but how he could acquire all this is astonishing for really mr cleverly with whom he lived was a quiet worthy character who had gone through life with great credit and respectability and then living at so remote a part of the world but i dont know how it is there seems to be an inherent spark of mental virus in our natures that like the leaven in our constitutions which is said to generate the small pox when it comes in contact with that contagious malady stamps our minds beautiful or deformed according to its degree of strength and influence if we are but slightly affected with it our feelings reach no further than solly but if severely vice and all its hideous train mark every feature of the mind and this was never more truly exemplified than in my brother who from an infant be the game or play what it might was sure to get his companions into some litigation till at last finding the country no place for such aspiring talents he ran away from his master who was glad enough to get rid of him and arrived in london the true scene of action for genius like his  from circumstances that afterward came to my knowledge i am enabled to relate the following particulars of him when he first arrived in town his brother lawyers were shy of him fearing he might have been tainted in the country with foolish prejudices or scruples but in a short time they became so well convinced to the contrary that he got a great deal of practice as an agent and it was very soon remarked as a great feather in his cap that he could swear to a service puzzle a declaration instruct a willing evidence or smooth an honest one with any practitioner of his age belonging to the courts  at length he began to figure away upon his own account and thanks to the vindictive spirit of mankind became flush of money he turned his hand to every thing he would parade the recesses of a prison and drain the purses of the poor wretches immersed there by advising them to issue supersedeases bring habeas corpuses or sue for groats he would court the alliance of jews in dukes place to be instrumental in obtaining post obits and purchasing annuities he would be houseadviser to a bailiff the better to squeeze and perplex the affairs of the debtors whom that bailiff might chance to have in his custody he would manufacture bankruptcies he would connive at swindling in short there cannot be a nefarious villainy which those pests of society pettifogging attorneys perpetually practice but he would occasionally engage in so he could make it turn to account  having now prodigious practice he married a woman he knew to have been kept by a man of fashion who he hoped would pay her attention afterward that thus he might be able to hamper him in an action of crim con and either hush the matter up by a handsome composition or recover large damages should it be brought to trial in which latter case he would be enabled to get rid of the woman and marry another from the same views he was however deceived in this for she made an honest wife in spite of his teeth which so irritated him that he beat her for not prostituting herself but upon her making a heavy complaint against him he was obliged to consent to a separate maintenance  this circumstance gave him not a little uneasiness for she was unavoidably in possession of some of his secret practices to get rid therefore of every ill consequence that might arise from her discovering him he connived at a prosecution against himself for a perjury before she could be ripe for any such attack and thus by properly preparing the evidence he avoided all possible danger because no man can be tried for the same offense a second time  of this crime every one believed him guilty but since the law did not find him so mere opinions were to him of very little consequence in newgate he was visited by people of fashion when he was acquitted a hired rabble gave a shout of applause and he spent that evening at one of the first gaming houses in town and though he was kicked out for want of money he returned in a short time with his pockets well lined and afterward reigned master of a pharaoh bank from whence he used to say he had seen men rise nabobs at night who had been beggars in the morning and others beggars who in the morning had been nabobs  chap vii two attempts at a rape upon poor hannah one by sourby and the other by nobody knows who together with the heroism of binns and the arrival of a stranger matters were in this state my elder brother i knew not where and my other brother i cared not where when a very extraordinary circumstance happened  sourby had notwithstanding his frequent repulses pestered me at times with his fulsome love and one day made an attempt to violate my honor when binns rescued me from his power and gave him a severe chastisement after which upon my threatening at mr smallbrooks desire to prosecute him for attempting to commit a rape he left wolverhampton and we had not heard of him for a considerable time  binns who was rejoiced at his rivals absence paid me after this more particular attention and ventured now and then to hint that if hewit did not return his assiduity might probably in the end conquer my indifference  something i saw plainly he was meditating and one day upon my treating him with more than ordinary civility i thought i diserned in his eyes a peculiar kind of self satisfaction like that which i have spoken of before to have been noticed by clarissa in the eyes of lovelace he being however a lover of a very different stamp i had no apprehensions upon this account and having received on his leaving me a very disagreeable piece of news my mind was so totally absorbed in it that binns and the whole conversation went out of my head  the intelligence i received was that one mrs crow a poor old soul who had been miss williamss nurse and whom on that account as well as her being a most pious and good woman i treated as far as my circumstances could permit me with every attention and kindness in my power was taken dangerously ill and requested to see me this was in the afternoon and as it was winter time and mrs crow lived two miles out of town it was nearly dark before i reached her house  to my very great astonishment i found her in perfect health at which i was so delighted that i had chatted away some time before i considered this falfe intelligence must have been sent me with some bad design mrs crow joined me in this opinion and we determined that i should stay there all night for it was now quite dark when who should come in but the very man who had brought me the message  we both began questioning him and were informed that binns had sent him and as i had paid him handsomely for he was a kind of errand man and occasionally a porter in the town he said he had come himself to see how poor mrs crow did and to know if he could render her any further service  there was something so ingenuous in this confession that without hesitation i agreed that he should be my guide home for after all there was some work to be given out early in the morning which nobody could fit but myself and however satisfied i might be as to mr smallbrooks considerateness i made it a rule never to neglect his business unless upon any pressing occasion as this would have been had it not been cleared up in which case he would have blamed me for standing upon so much ceremony  as to binns i own i never was so astonished in my life as at what i had heard but i did not suppose singular as his conduct was i had any thing to appre hend from it because he had always appeared to me to be a man of strict honor besides i was well guarded and i felt a peculiar impulse which never in my life has deceived me that i should come to no harm  it was uncommonly dark and if my guide had not been furnished with a lantern by mrs crow we should scarcely been able to sind our way for a good distance we went on pretty well but there was something at last in the business i did not like the fellow was every minute crying out hush dont you hear a noise and this when there was no cause for apprehension and therefore it must have been to frighten me by and bye when we came exactly to that part of lovelane where jenny rhodes stabbed susan wingrove he cried out  lord have mercy upon us fell down and extinguished the light  full of vexation and indeed suspicion i groped about and called to the man but received no answer i had very little time to deliberate when a man caught me in his arms and began to grow very rude i screamed out  hush cried he in a whisper dont you know me i am binns  i can no longer resist my passion for you and this moment shall witness my happiness  he spoke not another word but began to treat me with such violent rudeness that in spite of all my resistance i began to entertain the most dreadful apprehensions i entreated prayed screamed struggled till at length my strength became totally exhausted and i fainted away  i had not been long in this situation when the voice of binns for he spoke loud enough now reiterated in my ears he seemed so rejoiced at my returning to life that i thought the man would have gone mad with pleasure as i was perfectly convinced my honor was safe i took this for repentance and severely lectured him for his strange and violent conduct he called heaven to witness he had used no such conduct toward me but on the contrary had been so fortunate as to rescue me once more from the hands of a ravisher  i said i was glad of any thing that had induced him to repent of his brutality but that what he uttered was false for it was plain he had not only sent the sham message but had tutored the man who brought it how to betray me into his power  he declared by all that was sacred he did not comprehend me and was going on when a man with a lantern in his hand came running up to us and having held the light first to binnss face and then to mine cried i have not strength to support myself and fell down  we now left off our altercation and began to inquire into the situation of the poor fallen man but we had not pursued our good offices a moment when seeing a number of people come toward us with lights binns cried out tis he hannah as sure as you are born it is john hewit  you are right messmate said the man on the ground i am john hewit sure enough but i am very weak and flurying myself to come up with you it overcome the little strength i had left but i shall be better presently they tell me i shall have a good birth at the workhouse and after i have taken a little stowage in my hold there is no fear but i shall right  a possee now came up they consisted of parish officers constables and a number of idle people who were collected together out of curiosity we learnt that they were conveying some paupers to the workhouse which was situate about a quarter of a mile further one of these was john hewit who had been shipwrecked on the coast of sussex and upon telling his name and parish had been passed home as a vagrant they added that on hearing some person at a distance scream violently they were coming up as expediciously as they could but not fast enough for hewits impatience who weak as he was snatched a lantern out of the constables hand and ran toward us with such speed that the effort overcame him in the manner before described  binns said he had been told of this circumstance and was going to the workhouse to use his best interest for hewits accommodation when he also heard a screaming and being considerably nearer was fortunate enough to lend me the assistance i stood in need of  i gave binnss declaration what degree of credit i thought proper but choosing at present to agree to this interpretation of his conduct i answered the various enquiries that were made in such a way as induced the by standers to believe that i had been set upon by some robber and rescued by the gallantry of binns who seemed in their opinion to be born for my champion for there was no person present who had not heard of his preserving my honor from the rude attempts of sourby  a number of sagacious observations were now made some of them not very good natured one said that lovelane was a very good place for people to meet in the dark another said some people squeaked out when nobody was a hurting them one talked something about mock modesty another what a fine thing it was to be a favorite of the ladies to all which binns made very suitable answers as to myself i was involved in such a train of thinking that i had neither spirits nor ability to make any reply and if i had wished to do so perhaps my contempt would have withheld me and as for poor hewit who seemed very ill he appeared to listen to the whole in sullen silence  as this strange scene wore more and more a very serious complexion i hastened to put a stop to it and desiring binns to accompany me home i parted from this motley tribe first assuring hewit that i would mention his case that very evening to mr smallbrook who i had no doubt would do every thing in his power to serve him he seemed scarcely to thank me and we parted  going home i insisted upon an explanation from binns of all his strange conduct telling him as circumstances i supposed he must have known of every thing i knew relative to the false message and benjamin dark the messengers coming to mrs crows which had occasioned all that had happened in lovelane  he declared most solemnly that what he had before told me was the literal truth he said he had heard in the morning from the master of the workhouse that hewit and some other paupers who had been examined at the quarter sessions for the county were that day expected that it had immediately struck him he certainly now could have no chance of gaining my affection and therefore the utmost he should expect would be my friendship which he said he was determined to deserve by every means in his power that to effect this he was resolved to do every thing he could to serve and assist hewit that he was even delighted with his project which he declared had given him more substantial pleasure than ever he had felt in his life and it was this very pleasure that infused into his countenance the confident satisfaction of which the reader may remember i had taken such particular notice in the morning so that for that time my sagacity was fallible  he said he would have returned to the workhouse after seeing me home but from the temper hewit seemed then to be in it was better let alone besides the master was his particular friend and would be sure to pay hewit every possible attention and after all one night was soon passed and in the morning there could be no doubt but matters would be cleared to the satisfaction of every body  admitting all this to be truth it should appear that this benjamin dark was the ruffian who had set upon me in which case he must have made use of binnss name as the most likely person i would in such a case have relied upon and it now struck me that as the fellow came at different times on business to our house he used to venture at some awkward compliments and pass some rough jokes that seemed then to have nothing particular in them but which appeared now to mean supposing binns to have told the truth a good deal  the morning however was to elucidate every thing to that the dispute was referred binns assured me he would find dark and confront him face to face and desired i would form no favorable opinion of his conduct but in proportion as it should appear unobjectionable from an impartial investigation of it  this was so fair that it was impossible to object to it i wished him a good night and retired to bed with a more perturbed mind than i had ever before experienced  chap viii the mystery of the rape leads to another mystery of a more complex kind which not only poses the sagacity of hannah but of all wolverhampton it will very easily be credited that i scarcely closed my eyes the whole night a variety of conflicting ideas agitated my mind and i very plainly saw i was in such a situation that i had need of a protector my talents were such an object of envy and my conduct was so exemplary that i had no doubt if i continued long in a single state but the vulgar malignity of the wretches who had too little principle to imitate me would one day or other induce them to fabricate some lie with such artful circumstances as might gain general credit and then all my towering prospects of superiority would vanish into air  from all those combatting considerations i thought it incumbent on me to form an immediate resolution john hewit was now come back on him i had set my heart what then i could not make the first declaration and though he would find plenty of informers of whom he would learn that my name on his account had been finely bandied about in his absence yet it did not follow that this would appear a matter of any moment to him his strange conduct the night before had given me no expectation that it would and after all he might be married himself  i determined therefore whatever might have been my former thoughts that if there was any unsurmountable bar to my union with hewit it still should not hinder me qualified as i was from settling in life the next object therefore that presented itself was walmesley whom yet why or wherefore i did not know i could not get out of my head a match with him would gratify my brother and then he appeared to be such a worthy good creature but then where was he and again if he were to return how could i bear to think of marrying a sailor and it was very little likely that he would give up his profession on my account  dismissing walmesley from my mind i was naturally led to think of binns who i certainly had a most sincere friendship for and who if he made out the story of lovelane in his favor had really many and various calls upon my gratitude but i dont know how it was i never thought of him as a husband without shuddering he was a very well looking young man and people would say by way of low wit that after all hewit stood no chance for any body might see binns and hannah higgins would be man and wife they were so alike each other  thus i went on tormenting myself and putting this question into every possible point of view my poor heart like the faithful needle reverting perpetually to john hewit the only point that had any attraction for it  i had scarcely breakfasted when binns came to inform me that benjamin dark had made his escape in the night and had taken with him several letters and notes with which he had been as was very customery entrusted to deliver to the postoffice and added that as his honesty had never been before impeached and it was impossible he could have address enough to pass these notes the gentleman who had sustained the loss conjectured that he was only an instrument in the hands of some more artful person and they were therefore drawing up a proper hand bill to circulate all over the country so that whoever should be concerned in the business might be detected  binns said that he hoped the alacrity he should show in forwarding this detection would serve to acquit him in my opinion of any improper intention as to his conduct of the evening before and added that as hewit was come back and there could be no chance of obtaining my heart he would with the greatest pleasure exert his utmost endeavors to bring about our union in effecting which though he should of course lose all prospect of being my lover he hoped he should merit by his assiduity so far my esteem that i might consider him as a brother  there was something so truly noble in the whole of this declaration that i thanked him in the handsomest terms for his uncommon kindness and sincere friendship and assured him that whoever possessed my love i should ever consider him in the highest degree entitled to my gratitude  he now undertook to visit hewit and completely to overcome in his mind whatever prejudices he might have imbibed from what he had seen and heard in lovelane which no doubt had been sufficiently exaggerated since this conversation he said he would manage with the properest delicacy toward me which would spare me a great deal of awkward embarrassment and he would afterward take care to inform me of the state of hewits mind that i might make up my own so as to act according to circumstances  the beneficence mingled in this friendship brought tears into my eyes whoever i marry said i god send for the sake of my susceptible heart that he may have a mind like yours and yet said i mr binns so capricious is human nature though i highly value you for your noble sentiments and count your friendship as the highest compliment that was ever paid from exalted worth to unprotected honor if there was not another man upon the face of the earth i dont know how it is but pray be not offended at my frankness i could not think of you as a husband  he said he had long seen it and so far from being offended at my frankness he admired it he then took leave of me to go to hewit and in the afternoon when he called upon me again informed me that he could not tell what to make of his embassy hewit had said that it was his intention to return to his master who he had no doubt when all the hardships he had undergone were considered would not be averse to receiving him as it was now very much his wish to stick to his business and make up for lost time but that he did not choose to owe this favor or any other to any persons solicitation whatever  binns said he had but an awkard account to give of his love negotiation which he had determined to enter upon collaterally collecting what he had to gather from hewit by introducing a conversation on the adventures of the night before hewit did not seem to place an implicit faith in what binns advanced on the contrary gave hints according to his idea not much to my advantage saying he had heard a little of the young ladys conduct for he had sailed in her brothers ship and had there learnt that she was promised to one walmesley her brothers first lieutenant  how hewit came aboard the ship i could not possibly conceive but this appeared to unravel the strange circumstance of that intelligence which my brother had got relative to my sentiments i no longer blamed sourby for the blame if any was clearly imputable to hewit himself who very naturally did what he could to combat walmesleys pretensions the better to establish his own and i confess i felt myself flattered at the circumstance for it proved whatever might be his sullenness at present that his thoughts had been occupied on me and again the adroit means he must have used to manage this so as not to discover he was the very hewit had not only the fervor but the ingenuity of love and therefore proved that his sentiments of me were as favorable as i could wish  i told binns that my brother had certainly made me a proposal to marry walmesley who had done his duty nobly and honorably but as he was a person i had never seen i had no doubt but upon a proper representation of the matter he would be easily induced to forego his intension in favor of hewit who in this instance of happening to be on board his ship might perhaps have done his duty too more conversation of this kind passed and binns reiterated his promises of friendship and services with great warmth and after making some arrangement as to the mode of managing matters concerning hewit we parted  the first thing i heard the next morning was that binns had gone unexpectedly to london the night before i was so astonished at this extraordinary intelligence that i begged mr smallbrook would enquire of his uncle with whom i before mentioned he was in partnership what could possibly have caused so unexpected an event the uncle said for answer that it had originated from a very singular mistake he had received information that a considerable house with which he was connected in town was on the eve of failing and that by a speedy application for a settlement of accounts perhaps their concerns would escape the general wreck  the uncle said that upon this news his nephew had seemed very anxious to make the application in person because being a party he could more immediately act as necessity should point out than if the matter was conducted by an agent he thought he said that there was a particular earnestness in this zeal which he greatly commended him for and he immediately consented to his setting out but he added that the precaution was from first to last unnecessary for he had that morning not only received remittances which set him perfectly at ease as to the solvency of the concern but large orders on their own account as well as from other respectable houses through their recommendation  he said whence this curious business could originate he was at a loss to guess but his nephew would in a minute discover the fraud and of course take coach and come back again this prediction however was not verified for he did not return nor have i set eyes on him but once and that but for a moment and by a mere accident from that time to this  the false intelligence in the course of a few days was attributed to binns himself so was the false message i had received through benjamin dark and indeed now was the embezzlement of the notes for otherwise how could it have been worth his while to have left a reputable business in which he had a handsome concern for he did not appear to have taken any considerable property or sum of money of his own  and indeed this involved the business in complete mystery his character had been the fairest that ever was known his uncle had a great value for him and intended when he had once settled to have retired and left him and his sister the whole concern first drawing a handsome income out of it for his own support  having perhaps more charity than my neighbors i was on these accounts the last that yielded to what every days observation seemed to confirm for which i was not a little reflected on it was said i must be out of my senses if he had not embezzled the notes who had if he had not made benjamin dark the instrument of his intention to ruin me who had in short i could not help at last inclining toward the general opinion and as the most natural excuse i could make for him i attributed all his conduct to his love for me which had induced him to contrive a plan for my ruin he had not the heart to accomplish to take afterward the supererogate and romantic resolution of bringing about my union with hewit and in short of forming all those strange and nonsensical resolutions which could enter the head of no man out of bedlam except a man in love  yet to take leave of his principles as well as his friends was a thing beyond my comprehension no young man upon earth ever went so far into life with a more unblemished character he was quoted as an example for all the men and admired and esteemed among the worthy part of the women nay he was the last in the world to profit by the folly he had committed for he knew nothing of trick or deceit and all those who valued him who were not a few in wolverhampton naturally expected that he would manage the accomplishment of his fraud so awkwardly that they should hear of his being detected and brought back  nothing of this however happened the intelligence we got of binns was that he was set down safely in the borough and shortly afterward left the inn to go as he said into the city but that he never returned and in the mean time as the money for several of the notes had been received before proper intelligence could be sent to stop their payment the most probable conjecture was that he had gone abroad all this appeared so feasible to the uncle that though he was under no obligation so to do he declared that if his nephew did not return in a twelvemonth and a day and if in the mean time the gentlemen who were losers upon this account did not receive some satisfactory reason to render it unnecessary he would rather than throw a slur upon his family reimburse their losses  this handsome conduct so operated that the hand bill was not published lest binns might be apprehended and suffer an ignominious death i own none of these circumstances pleased me i could not from my soul fully believe him guilty and though it so happened that this fraud was committed exactly at the time when his inconsiderate love for me induced him to leave his friends there was such inherent goodness in his composition that i could not reconcile to myself how one and the same man could be a valuable member of society and a vile cheat  i knew however that my feeble voice had i exerted it would have had but little weight against a whole town who were every day hearing or forging some fresh proof of his guilt a circumstance to me of all others astonishing but it never in any instance proved to be otherwise for circulate a story to a mans advantage see if credited at all with what reluctance it is credited and then he has done no more than he ought whereas accuse the best man in the world of a nefarious act and the very suspicion shall hunt him to his grave some thought it would come to that others had suspected it a good while before in short a thousand undandsome and unfeeling hints and sneers are insinuated about and though the unfortunate wretch may have done many positive acts to merit esteem and admiration yet this one implied crime is a blot large enough to eclipse all his virtues and in the midst of friends he may die for want of an advocate  chap ix hannah receives a visit from miss binns who perplexes matters a little more this nail is clinched by a letter from dark i was tormented with these cogitations when my sweet friend miss binns called on me and said she had something very particular to communicate to me before however i inform the reader what the nature of her business was i shall go into some particulars relative to that young lady with whom i had unceasingly continued on a footing of intimacy though other matters of more immediate importance to this history have hitherto prevented me from noticing it  i have already mentioned that the widow gregory took binns and his sister under her protection as well to keep their manners from being tainted by the influence of those bad examples before their eyes in the conduct of their profligate father as to rescue her maiden name of binns from oblivion for the old lady being of welsh extraction was not a little proud of her ancestors though her genealogical tree had a very uncertain root and was now so blighted that it boasted but one branch and that a very rotten one seeing the young scion binns however shoot from it strong handsome and full of vigor she was determined to transplant it into her own nursery where by her fostering care it might improve and flourish and at length restore the tree to its pristine luxuriance  this was the widows darling contemplation and though she was a very good woman it is more than probable had there been no son in the case her brothers children would not have been removed from coalbrook dale to wolverhampton  thus binnss fortune was her peculiar care but finding in his sister every thing she could wish for that was amiable and dutiful she at her death made no distinction between them  the affection of miss binns for her brother was of so tender a nature that it bordered upon the romantic she was jealous of every one to whom he paid particular attention and refused for his sake every offer made to her she certainly had a warm and sincere friendship for me but i am convinced it arose from my uniform and immovable determination not to consider binns in the light of a lover otherwise i have no doubt but i should have possessed very little of her esteem  the unlimited confidence between us frequently gave me opportunity of expostulating with her upon this strange conduct i represented to her that it was very natural and very laudable to love a brother but it was the duty of a sister to wish that a brother should establish himself in the world and that the good of society called upon her to do the same besides if her brother did not marry what would become of the welsh pedigree  her answer was she loved goodness and honor and therefore she loved her brother that she did not think any woman could deserve him that as to herself it would be time enough to think of a husband when he had got a wife and as to her aunts projects as she had not lived to see them fulfilled it was no great matter in her opinion even if they never were to be fulfilled at all  this was the character of miss binns who now came to me to make an important discovery she told me that from some mysterious circumstances she had lately become acquainted with there appeared very little doubt of her brothers guilt but even were he guilty to the utmost extent of what had been suspected there was still something amiable in the motive though egregiously weak and unpardonable in the transaction  she gave me to understand that her brother had become a sacrifice to filial duty she had known over and above the money her father received through mr williams which her aunt had enjoined them both never to augment that binns had privately supplied him with sums at different times and had also paid several debts this she did not blame for in fact she had winked at it but she began at last to be seriously uneasy for he had not only had many interviews with his father at a distance from town but had encouraged him to come clandestinely to his uncles where they were perpetually closeted as if concerting some scheme nay the very night before he went to london she saw him let him out through a back garden and heard him say be faithful to me and this business will make your fortune  upon a further enquiry she had learnt that the father was gone off as well as the son she had therefore very strong reason to suppose that he had been enthralled by the artful machinations of a parent to commit a crime which though the transaction bassled common sense and set probability at defiance appeared nevertheless to be true first by his flight then by his fathers and again because there was no trace of a discovery by which it could attach to any body else  she said that she came to me as the truest friend she had to confide in me her suspicions and the cause of them and to ask my advice as to whether it was proper to acquaint her uncle gregory with them i said that after his generous conduct i should consider it a very blameable thing indeed if she concealed from him a single syllable she at length agreed with me and after laying together every thing we could devise to excuse binns without the smallest shadow of success we promised to continue kind friends to each other and parted  about a week afterward i received the following letter which i shall give to the reader exactly as it was written  to mrs hanny higgins mrs hanny this is to let u no that binns his a grate rog he a got al thee munny for the nots and lef me in lurche hard tims mrs hanny when rogs cant hang together i do suphose hit is dangurouse to cum bak

mrs hanny is is grate rog two     the letter from dark which i immediately communicated to miss binns served with a variety of corroborating circumstances to render my efforts to establish the innocence of binns altogether fruitless i therefore though i was not yet satisfied in my mind talked as little on the subject as possible nor did i make answer to any of those who now and then would din in my ears what a guilty wretch he was but that guilty or innocent i pitied him from my soul for if guilty what between his own mind and his accusers rancour he had already received punishment enough and if innocent nothing could make him amends for what he suffered  end of the first book hannah hewit book ii containing the adventures of hannah hewit from the time of johns return to the period of her marriage chap i a further account of john hewit  a hint or two concerning sunday schools  and some particulars relative to captain higgins and charles walmesley i shall now speak of hewit who two days after he came to wolverhampton was taken extremely ill at his masters house where he had received a most cordial welcome i could not with any propriety visit him myself but i prevailed on mrs crow to see him and do every thing in her power to give him assistance this trust i knew she would discharge in every respect to my satisfaction for she was acquainted with my intentions relative to hewit and approved of them and having this opportunity of being near him she did not sail to avail herself of it  her excuse for calling on him was that as he had formerly been taken by the hand by parson williams she was sure it would give the good vicar pleasure to hear of his determination to leave off wandering and become a sober man  from this she would take occasion to advert to the good that gentleman had done in the neighborhood and how many thoughtless young people would have been thrown away if he had not interested himself in their favor this gave her an opportunity of noticing what a credit i had been to his recommendation and how much i was the admiration of the whole place with the exception indeed of a few worthless people whose good or ill word it was not worth my while to concern myself about  he replied very little to all this at first but as he grew better he became very curious about me he had heard as i said before many stories he did not like told with an invidious intention and in particular he could not stomach the last business in lovelane but the good old lady set him right in every respect and at last he professed a wish to see me adding he had something very particular indeed to say to me concerning my brother  i had been told as the reader knows of hewits being on board my brothers ship and had made my own remarks on his conduct in relation to walmesley but it now struck me that he had told binns my brother was determined i should marry walmesley and i imagined he wanted to see how my sentiments were on that subject i therefore longed for an interview with him besides i thought it possible that he might give me some account of my brother who i much wished to hear of  as he was now able to walk out i agreed to meet him at mrs crows house where every sunday it was my custom to instruct poor children in their spiritual and temporal duty it had always been my idea that if the laboring people had some rational mode of employing the sunday they would be less inclined to frequent alehouses and get into debauchery particularly in manufacturing towns i used therefore by way of an example for others better enabled both as to abilities and means than myself to teach as many children as appeared desirous of improving themselves in reading writing arithmetic and in short whatever might be necessary for the common purposes of life and that it might not be all labor i added by way of amusement a little music such as hymns anthems and oratorios i believe through me wolverhampton was the first place where the works of the immortal handel were introduced which are now so well known and understood in country towns  it had often occurred to me that all minds ought to be enlightened that human creatures were all made of the same materials and that nature in her general endowments paid no regard to rank and distinction but that she often gifted with strong intellects the mean and lowly and branded with gross ignorance the high and dignified that great talents and brilliant genius were as unconfined as the heavenly essence that inspired them and that the genial sun delights to shine as resplendantly on a cottage as on a palace  i had no doubt but this philanthropic scheme of mine would one day or other be universally adopted and indeed before the fatal day i left my native country i had the inexpressible pleasure of seeing it in an infant state carried into effect if it should have generally obtained at the time i am now writing i have no doubt but it has operated to the honor of morality the promotion of industry and the advantage of order and good government there were certainly however some who did not spare to say but envy will always be cavilling that were this the case it would become a serious and an alarming evil for as there are never wanting malignant spirits who hatch infernal designs to sap the foundation of domestic quiet and make men swerve from their different duties of husband father friend and subject so if ever any such wretch to gratify his own hellish purposes should wish to unhinge order and introduce anarchy he had nothing to do but speciously to appeal without truth without argument without common sense to the bewildered imaginations of the multitude through the medium of that very superficial and ineffectual information with which i had astonished but not convinced their minds  but this futile observation refutes itself and though it is impossible that i in this desolate place can speak to what passes in my own country yet i will venture to say it is in no similar danger for the purity of true english blood will always prove an antidote to the poison of any such viper  after my school hours were over i had as i before mentioned appointed john hewit to meet me at mrs crows and indeed my design on him was to beg his assistance in my philanthropic plan which i had no doubt would greatly contribute to soften his manners and fit him for the purposes of society  as he had told mrs crow that what he had to say to me was very material so indeed i found it for after a proper preparation i learnt that my brother had been shipwrecked with him and very probably drowned for that none of the crew as far as his knowledge went escaped except himself and walmesley  i was extremely shocked at this intelligence as the reader may well suppose but as it was never my inclination to make my particular misfortunes an inconvenience to my friends i made an effort to recover myself as soon as possible and begged he would relate all that had happened to him since he had left wolverhampton  chap ii john hewits story john hewit now began to relate his adventures and as one judges better of a mans feelings by his own language than by any substitute for it i shall here endeavor to set his story down in the very words he told it  i can only say said john in answer to my noticing that he had enough to tell me that you have hit it there is enough indeed if it was but of the right sort when i left wolverhampton with the five guineas binns would force upon me all is one for that i may pay him one day or other may hap i steered for worcester being determined to push for bristol and to go to sea well the first thing that happened was they took me up for a deserter stole my money and marched me to their head quarters at birmingham and there after keeping me in a dungeon for four days and bringing me to a court martial i was ordered by the name of robert grigsby to receive three hundred lashes as it was my first offense god knows it was an offense i had not committed but i must needs say i could give but a poor account of myself and so i was had out and tied up to the halbert  i had received about sixty or seventy lashes when a party came and enquired what was doing they were answered no great matter only flogging a deserter one robert grigsby why damme that is impossible said the other heres robert grigsby handsomely handcuffed we took him this morning oh that is another thing said the sergeant leave off drummer some little mistake here i find so i was untied and escorted back to the inn  the hand bill that advertised a reward for the apprehension of grigsby certainly described a person exactly my size and complexion but when we came face to face we were not like at all but as they had no power to discharge me without their officer who was gone upon a party of pleasure with some milliners apprentices to see the leasowes and hagley and other places about the country i was crammed into the dungeon for two days more and then brought up for reexamination the officer who was the lefthanded son of a demirep of distinction by a trooper in the guards said it was all owing to my own sulkiness for if i had given a proper account of myself i might have come off well enough but come said he my lad you have had a taste of our life and so what say you suppose you enlist  i told him the taste i had had would serve me for a meal and only begged that i might have what belonged to me and be permitted to go he asked me what i meant i said they had taken five guineas from me and some silver they all swore most righteously that i lied and said i must be a hardened villain indeed to accuse poor harmless fellows of such a crime when they were only doing the kings duty yes said i and you were doing the kings duty i suppose when you apprehended me for another here the officer interposed who certainly had not done his duty in not suspending all proceedings against me till the party had returned who alone knew grigsby he said i might thank my stars i had come off so well that it was necessary to persecute the military law with rigor and that there was not so fine a code of ethics in the world as the articles of war for said he if any one strikes his commanding officer he shall be inflicted upon with death or worse punishment  that said i is what you want to inflict upon me for it is worse than death for a poor innocent fellow to starve in a dungeon and be slogged for a crime he is not guilty of while his friends are wondering what is become of him ay said he and where now mr conundrum are your friends waiting for you i had now got a story by heart and said at bristol well that we shall see said he i shall give you over to the civil power and if mr justice is satisfied that you are compos you may go to your friends whenever you will so no animosity my friend these little broolies will happen and it is all fortune de queer  queer enough thought i so i was had before the justice as a suspicious person that could not give any account of himself they first sent me to bridewell till the examining day where every body that had been robbed was desired to attend  when the day came i was examined like an horse at a fair one said that if i had been a little shorter he could have almost sworn i was the man that cheated him by dropping a ring one day at market another said he had a good mind to swear i had stolen his horse for though he was fifty miles off at the time every body told him it was just such another ill looking fellow one man said he could not exactly say who i was but he recollected perfectly that he had often seen me with a straw in my shoe at the assize hall at warwick and another remembered as if it had been but yesterday that i had been arraigned at the old baily by the name of sligo alias hard favored jack  why all these people should be so desirous of my being hanged who had never done them an injury i could not imagine nor indeed did i much care my only fear was that the real murder would come out and that the wretch who had committed it would swear my life away however it did not and i was discharged after making out a pretty good story by saying i was a sailor and that i belonged to the brittannia privateer which the newspapers informed me was mustering her compliment of hands and on board which ship i knew your brother was first lieutenant  it was in vain to say any thing about my money so i set off without it and a thought came across me that as it was stourbitch fair i might by holding horses or doing any job that was wanted pick up a few shillings my only fear was that in such a public place i should be known so i put a black patch upon my eye stained my skin with wallnut shells and cut my hair close to my head  when i got to the fair i found them all alive but the first thing i took notice of was a company of players who were very busy preparing a booth as i stood looking on one of them asked me by the name of blinky to lend them a hand and finding i went readily to work they gave me some bread and cheese and some beer to encourage me at last they found me so useful that i was chief cook and pilot with them and at night when we were at supper all of us hey fellow well met ladies and gentlemen kings cobblers and harlequins they swore i was such a comical dog that they would take me in upon a share indeed without vanity i was as good a one for their purpose as any in the company for i could play upon the fiddle sing a song and dance a hornpipe as you know mrs hannah  when they found this i was no man to be trifled with business was chalked out for me and the part of jack in distress was advertised with a song and a hornpipe in character by a real sailor who had the misfortune to lose one of his eyes in the field of battle  to have seen the shifts we were all put to and our comical distress while we prepared for action you would have laughed at and pitied us paper handkerchiefs were made for the ladies the gentlemens legs were chalked to make stockings and gilt leather hilts were tacked to wooden swords but the scarcest article was shirts i shall never forget the distress of one of the actors and how he enjoyed it he had sent his best shirt he had but another to be washed and the washerwoman had returned it by her little girl who said her mammy could not wash that shirt for if she did it was so rotten she should rub it all to pieces with all the good humor in the world my sweet little cherub of the washhouse said he tell that empress of soap suds your mama if she is afraid of rubbing the shirt to pieces to pin it up against the wall and throw a pail of water at it  indeed for the little time i was with them i never saw people so miserable and so merry at last the night came when i was to make my appearance i had got through the song a second time for it was encored and was in the middle of the hornpipe when who should i see staring me full in the face but joe tailor our bridewell keeper here at wolverhampton  convinced he was come with a warrant to seize me especially as he must have known my voice again i could not make another step but shuffled and shuffled about in confussion till at last i darted behind the scenes ran out of the booth cleared the fair and was two miles off before i ventured to look round nor was i then satisfied that i was out of danger for nothing could get it out of my head but that i was still pursued  i nevertheless went a little slower and this convinced me my fears were not groundless for i not only heard footsteps but presently a voice listening however with more attention somebody called out in a tone that i knew perfectly well blinky and then what faster still nay and thou wilt run i will trot as well as thee and other speeches from plays in imitation of different actors by which i at last found that it was one charles walmesley a mimic and fearing no danger from him i halted till he came  he informed me that joe tailor had not come for me but for him that one of the actors had learnt this from the man who sold beer at the next booth and had advised him to escape this happening just as i ran out of the booth he followed me as fast as possible under an idea that i might be making my escape from the same person for in my cups one night i was foolish enough to hint that i was afraid of the philistines as they called the officers of justice  chap iii hannah interupts john who afterward goes on with his story well walmesley and i  nay but stop said i walmesley charles walmesley surely this is not the man my brother wants me to marry and yet you went to sea together were cast away together and saved together it can be no other person  you shall know all in good time said hewit for the matter of that walmesley and i have never been separated since that day till i left him upon the coast of sussex well on we came but i should tell you that at the time he made his escape he was going on in the character of a bear to dance and play upon the fiddle so that when he overtook me he was completely dressed in a very handsome bear skin and having no time to lose he said he had brought the fiddle along with him to raise the wind as he called it if it should be necessary that is to say by pawning it  a thought struck me that we could make the fiddle tum to better account and i proposed to walmesley that he should till we got into cash still personate the bear and that i would fiddle to his dancing through the different villages by which means we should certainly get undiscovered to bristol where i told him i would introduce him to a man the most likely of all others to make his fortune meaning your brother for that mimickry and humor suited his taste exactly  he snapt at the proposal and on we went my bear was admired by men women and children he tumbled danced played at quarterstaff drank the companys health and did a thousand monkey tricks one day however walmesley had like to have paid for his frolie a butcher wanted to have him baited i said i did not dare bait him for that at coventry where by the bye we had never been he hugged so many dogs to death that the mayor would not sign my traveling license which i pretended though no such thing can be granted to have in form without i gave security never to bait him again the mayor very justly observing that bear dancing was a funny recreative amusement but bear baiting was cruel and not tolerated by act of parliament and he was right said a lawyer bear baiting or baiting bears is exploded and nulled and voided by anno secundus liber secundo guliemus secundum  i said besides that the poor creature ever since they made him drink punch with too much acid in it at stourbitch fair had been a good deal disordered and hoped as he done more than it was in the power of any other bear to do upon the truth of which i offered to bet a hundred guineas they would with their usual indulgence excuse the baiting  this however did not satisfy the butcher who with a whistle brought to him a most powerful bull dog that at the hint of to him my boy flew like a tiger at poor walmesley the lawyer told the butcher at his peril to proceed for that if dog killed bear an action would lay to recover the value of said bear and he would undertake to maintain it my rhetoric proved however of more use than the lawyers for laying on the dog with the bears pole i sent him yelping away  the butcher asked if an action would not lay for that the lawyer said no dog set upon bear and the master or owner of dog stood by aiding abetting and comforting therefore master or owner of bear had only acted se osfendendo or in his own defense for bear was the same as himself seeing that a man may defend a domestic as if he were naturalibus and bonus fidum defending himself now though dog was a domestic too he was not a domestic in the same degree of consanguinity that is to say use or utility as some call it as bear for by bear bearwarder by license from his worship the mayor of coventry who was a wise and an upright man and knew how to make extinctions got his livelihood now it could not be said that butcher got his livelihood by dog he might be said to secure his livelihood by dog but he did not get his livelihood by dog and again as to the value of the bipeds or animals he little thought one of them was a biped by the bye there was a great distinction bears flesh was valuable it made westphalia hams saviloys and polony sausages indeed it had been said that the same thing had been done with dogs flesh but how had it been done not legalibus pactum it must have been an overt act and therefore hidden now selling bears flesh was a covert act and therefore open and after all there could be no comparison in the flavor  in short said the lawyer as that glorious character lord chatham said as every mans house is his castle his dwarf his giant and his bugle horn as every master has a right to protect his domestic or his domestic animal as a bear is a domestic animal superior to a dog because a dog is a domestic animal inferior to a bear action certainly would lay against master of dog for an assault on bear he standing by as aforesaid aiding abetting and comforting but as he was not so great a friend to setting people together by the ears as butcher had seemed to be to set dogs and bears together by the ears he should propose that a large quantity of punch in bowl or bowls should be provided to be paid for on delivery by butcher and that in said punch all animosity or querelous contention should be drowned liquidated and washed away  every body having an interest in this proposal it was unanimously agreed to the lawyer taking to himself great praise for his able and judicious decision and the butcher not thinking it worth while to enter into any further contention as he knew he had to make friends with him concerning a little poaching business which was to come on at the next adjournment of the quarter sessions peace therefore being restored i locked bruin up in the stable of the inn and went to join the company  the first moment i could get away under pretense of feeding the bear i locked myself into the stable and had a conversation with walmesley we agreed as we had plenty of cash to carry us on to bristol to set out as soon as possible and have nothing more to do with bear baiting but determined first of all to have a little fun at the expense of the butcher i carried some clothes that i had bought the day before into the stable walmesley dressed himself in them i let him out privately with the bearskin which he hid in a neighboring field and when this was done i ran to the house in the greatest confusion and said somebody had stolen the bear  a hue and cry was now set up but no bear was to be found the butcher as i expected enjoyed this pretended distress and the lawyer as i also expected saw in a minute that the butcher must have been the cause of it and the punch having been put pretty freely about the altercation grew high he said it was a shame to obstruct a man in the honest persecution of his avocations honest said the butcher why will you purtend that a strolling vagabond of a bearkeeper is for to be compared to a man of property and a tradesman such as i be  sir i would have you to know said the lawyer that bear dancing is a tolerable employment and has been sanctioned and permitted for centries did you never hear of valentine and orson beargardens synods and hudibras that great lawyer says speaking of synods and beargardens  and thus a synod and a bearward do differ only in a mere word   that is to say they are collaterally the same and there is not a pin to choose now if synods which are a religious invocation sanctified and hyperbolized by mandates manifestos and mandamuses issuing from corpus eclesiasticus or the spiritual court will any body tell me that bair dancing is not a tolerable employment clear clear cried the company  tolerable or not tolerable said the butcher i know it is a shame that a vagabond of a fellow should come here and knock my dogs about damme i will lame his bear yet if i catch him i wish there was a law to keep all bears out of the kingdom they may well say the laws want mending i know this that since the ladies have used bears grease the mutton fat is all blowed upon and since wesphaly hams and these things have been all the kick we dont sell half so much pork as we used to do a damned shame that honest tradesmen should be left to pay taxes and starve while such fellows as these comes about and runs away with all our money and then the cruel rascal making his bear hug all the dogs to death if it was sticking a calf or a lamb it would be another guess thing that is allowable and in the way of business  this is all very well said i gentlemen but in the mean time what am i to do for my bear i strongly suspect mr butcher you have had a hand in this business and i will not leave the place till i am satisfied ill satisfy thee with a douse in the chops presently said the butcher damned if doant touch him at your peril said the lawyer how dare you break the peace in my presence i will have action little nobis informationis and idicctmentatis against you the butcher raved i laughed for i could not think of quarrelling with a man i had so provoked when all of a sudden news came that the bear was found  this news was brought by walmesley himself who now entered with the scouting party that had been sent after the bear he said he had seen him about two miles off in the hands of a butcher who was also driving some sheep sir said he addressing himself to me i thought it was your bear for i recollect seeing him dance at a village i was passing through but for gods sake added he give me something to eat it is impossible to talk about bears when one is so cursedly hungry some cold beef was set before him and he went on talking and eating  as i was saying gentlemen the bear used to drink the companys health if you please i will imitate him for i am cursedly dry  devilish good well enquiring of the butcher who he was and what he was going to do with the bear he said he belonged to master grim thats enough said the lawyer the act of the servant is the act of the master where were you driving this bear to mr grim why damme if you ent all mad said the butcher i know nothing about your damned bear  oh said walmesley ill tell you where they were driving him they were driving him to the pound where i saw poor bruin safe and even there broke off and came away the lawyer swore an action would lay for false imprisonment in banco regis i swore i would instantly employ him to bring it and the butcher swore that we and our actions might go to the devil he owned that his man most certainly must have been that way driving sheep because he had sent him but that he knew of no business he had with the bear and therefore would not stand to any thing he had thought proper to do the lawyer said we should see how matters stood if it could be proved that the butcher had not done the thing with malice purpense that if it was an act of the servant solus cum solo without the precipitation of his master if bearward found bear uninjured unmutilated unimpaired he should advise a weeks wages of the man to be stopped put down expended and laid out in punch for the good of the company the butcher himself thought this but fair in which he was of course joined by all the rest and we set out in a body to release bruin all but walmesley who said he had no leisure to look after bears for that he must be a good many miles off before sun set  when we had got about a quarter of a mile i pretended to have forgot the proper halter for the bear and said i should be very sorry to drive him in any other for fear he should be galled for that the poor creature was sick enough before and i dared say he had not been a bit the better for being driven about they all thought this reasonable and promised to walk slowly on but how slow they went or how far i never heard for i joined walmesley who was waiting for me in a sield out of their sight and we scampered across the country as hard as we could drive till after halting now and then for refreshment we were before sunset at least ten miles from the village  chap iv conclusion of john hewits story we were now safe out of danger and yet how it happened i dont know for if the country people had not been a set of stupid louts we should have been twenty times found out though i must needs say what with the glass eyes a false tongue upon wires and a string that pulled the ears up and down all which were managed very dexteriously walmesley made a devilish good bear and then i took care to keep the people at a distance under a notion that he would bite them i cannot help laughing to think how many fools we made  well as i said being out of danger we sat ourselves down to supper and walmesley told me all his adventures and from that moment  but however that is no matter i had better tell you my own story and let him if ever he should come to make love to you tell his  well being come to bristol i soon found out your brothers rendezvous and walmesley and hewet were entered aboard the brittannia at the same time we went to sea and though your brother is a dear good soul for encouraging every body yet poor hewit was entirely lost and walmesley was all and all to be sure he did all he could to make himself beloved and he succeeded and i will say this there is something in your brother so taking and so noble that it is impossible to know him and not fight through fire and water for him and now i will let you into a secret mrs hannah i had all my life thought that people could not live free without being profligates but your brother convinced me to the contrary for though he drinks and swears and loves a pretty girl as well as any fine fellow that ever lived i dont think there is a bishop in the kingdom has more goodness no damme nor more religion neither  i smiled at this and thought i began to see that one rake had made a convert of another what he uttered of my brother i knew to be truth and indeed so does the reader know it his letter sufficiently proves he was all heart and could disguise nothing but expressed those ideas that were consonant to goodness and susceptibility just as they were conceived and through life this is the fairest criterion of sincerity no man can study to be good it must be in his nature why then study to explain goodness let the ebulition take its course and as nothing is so cheerful as innocence let the eyes glisten with pleasure till they are dimmed by sensibility a tear the result of a smile is a tribute to humanity a smile the result of a tear is a sacrifice to hypocrisy  well continued hewit you know most of what past till after the vigo business walmesley was soon made an officer and when your brother commanded the eagle he was his first lieutenant to be sure in the vigo affair he did behave well i stood by and saw that letter he bid the second lieutenant write to you and to say the truth it was i that first thought of it  now you see i am going to tell you what passed after that time when we had brought home the eagle safe to bristol our next care was to see what could be done for captain higgins the owners did not choose to have any thing to do with it for fear of endangering the safety of the ship for she certainly was very fairly captured at vigo and though they were truly sensible of your brothers gallantry and good conduct they would not let their money stand idle so to make sure of the thing they fitted her out gave a lubberly fellow the command of her and the next news was that she was taken by a french frigate and carried into bourdeaux  they now did not choose to know any thing more about your brother than if they had never seen him so that he might rot in a dungeon and welcome for any thing they cared a choice set of us went aboard a portuguese and sailed for lisbon where to our great satisfaction we found your brother safe and sound walmesley had left the two spanish hostages under the care of the english consul who had given them their parole first pledging his word of honor to walmesley that they should not have their entire liberty till the governor of vigo had released captain higgins which upon his representation they did reserving a right to demand of the owners of the eagle the value of the ship how they will get out of the scrape i cannot say for my part i hope they will be fairly trounced if it be only for serving your brother such a rascally trick  well now mrs hannah there is but little more to tell you but that little is bad enough we had no business to be kicking our heels at lisbon and so we got aboard a portuguese to come home and so making the channel we were prettily knocked about for four days and at last stranded upon the coast of sussex  you see she struck upon a sand bank with the tide at ebb so we did all we could to clear her by the flood but it would not do we found she would not float so at last finding she filled fast we took to the boats with a stiff gale from the land and the devil of a surf we tugged and tugged by and bye we lost sight of the other boat and i suppose she sunk you see your brother and i happened to be in different boats i should have liked to have had a birth with the captain even if i had gone down with him but these things cannot always be as we wish so after we had been at this pretty work i suppose two hours a sudden squall capsized the boat  it happened that i had a clumsy oar in my haud so i laid it across my breast and made it serve me for a pair of corks and by that time i was handsomely tired i began to find that i could touch ground this gave me heart and i trudged lustily on till i was safely landed so telling them at the next town that my name was john hewit and this was my parish they passed me here as a vagrant  you are not certain said i that the boat my brother was in sunk not certain said hewit but i fear it sunk to be sure as the wind blew so strong off the land they might have been driven to sea but that would have been worse for how could such a nutshell live in a rough sea in the channel where the wind and tide were quarreling like the bubbling of a pot  and what became of walmesley said i god knows said john whether he is alive or dead walmesley and hewit parted when the boat went down i will however say this of him that whether dead or alive walmesley was a worthy fellow and however he may be my rival i have a great value for him and so i have often told your brother  he has a droll way of doing things to be sure but his heart ent the worse if he tells you he has been guttling and drinking away all his money and that he had great enjoyment in it he means that he has done so by the mouths of others for the eating and drinking to his mind is the feeding those who want a dinner and his greatest enjoyment is to relieve a fellow creature in distress if ever you see him you will hear him talk of his menu plaisirs and he will give it a turn as if it meant youthful irregularity and faith in one sense so it is for there are very few young men who regularly pity misfortune or receive pleasure by giving comfort to the afflicted  but come mrs hannah said he whether your brother be saved or not whatever may be gone with walmesley i should be glad if you would consider me as a friend i am not the same john hewit i was when i left this place i have smarted for my folly and i mean now to stick to my trade that i may always have something to fly to in case of necessity and if after some time you should find me sober and industrious unless you meet with a better husband in so many words i should be glad to have you  i was very much penetrated with this handsome character he had given of his rival and could not help telling him so he made a suitable reply and we parted at mr smallbrooks door for he saw me home in very good humor with each other as in our way we were necessarily obliged to pass through lovelane i could not refrain from mentioning the circumstance of jenny rhodes and susan wingrove and all the consequences of that business this brought up sourby and binns the first of whom he said he was now too well convinced was an infamous wretch and the latter he was as willing as i was to think well of indeed he concluded with me that villainy had been played off against him in which he said he should not be surprised if my brother the lawyer had some concern in short he said he had yet a very long history to tell me of one sort or other but that he should defer it till we become certain whether my brother was alive or dead because said he it would come more properly from his mouth than mine  chap v a letter a new acquaintance and an old one having retired i began to ruminate on what i had heard hewit had told a round and unvarnished tale as othello says yet there appeared to me something mysterious in it he as well as walmesley had done his utmost to gain my brothers esteem and yet walmesley seemed to have possessed it all i very much feared that there were something to come out if ever i should see my brother that would not tell much to hewits credit one thing was certain however that he now seemed heartily contrite and i yet hoped even though walmesley were to return that i might manage matters so as honorably to think of hewit with my brothers consent  as there was a good deal of prize money due to hewit at bristol his master and mr smallbrook advised him to go there and enquire after it in which advice i heartily joined them in hopes it might be the means of learning what was become of my brother  he had not been gone but two days when as i was copying a portrait of him in enamel which i had taken before he went a person enquired for me who said his name was walmesley i was all in a flutter at this news when to my astonishment and satisfaction he entered and delivered me a letter from my brother  delighted as i was to hear that my brother lived and anxious to read his letter i could not help eying this walmesley from head to foot and i think i never conceived so hearty an averson for any body at first sight in my life he seemed an insignificant whiffling coxcomb but as i am always just and as i knew that my brother would not have had a predelection for any person who was not in some degree worthy his partiality i suspended my judgment and desiring him to sit down read the letter which contained what follows  my dear sister this letter will be handed to you by charles walmesley who will have enough to tell you till i see you myself which i hope will be in a day or two if my crazy timbers will let me proceed sor they have been cursedly shattered by this last squall you must know we were all stranded on the coast of sussex and taking to the boat we were blown out to sea where by good luck we were taken up by a mackeral hoy i call em cats they will live any how  well after kicking about pretty merrily for three days we made the land and as i generally find somebody or other i know i pick up an old shipmate the commander of a trader who i saved from going to prison by retaking him from the french he is now a pilot and i have a notion a bit of a smuggler but that is no business of mine he gave us all a hearty welcome and furnished me with quintibles enough to make your port where i shall expect you properly to rig me out for my wardrobes gone to davy joness locker after that i shall go and call those rascals at bristol to account they have used me very ill hannah but i will tell you more when i see you in the mean time take good care of walmesley i dare say you will like him he is a droll dog does a dancing bear to a nicety so till i join company adieu  your affectionate brother thomas higgins   i understood from walmesley that in his way to me my brother had been taken ill on the road but impatient to let me know he was living he had dispatched his friend with this letter i asked a thousand questions to which i received very singular but not very satisfactory answers in short i found mr walmesley though a harmless character a very conceited selfsufficient sort of a gentleman and though he began to assume the lover and availed himself of my brothers promises in his favor i had very little doubt when we should all come face to face but john hewits pretensions would appear to have a more solid foundation than walmesleys  in the mean time i amused myself with his excentricities and plainly saw he was the very man in a convivial moment to win my brother and as mr smallbrook insisted on his being in the house i must say we found him a very entertaining companion he was full of anecdote and pleasantry and answered fairly to the character that hewit had given of him  the next day after walmesley arrived i wrote to hewit to tell him that my brother was alive and coming to wolverhampton and therefore he had better return and consult with him on the means of obtaining what was due to him at bristol i also told him by way of accelerating his journey that mr walmesley had brought a letter from my brother and was at that time soliciting my hand and heart to this letter i received an answer which convinced me he was a good deal picqued however he said he would set out the next day and had no doubt but he should give a good account of the gentleman when he arrived and that after all if my brother persisted on my marrying walmesley and i should consent it would be his business to submit with patience  my situation seemed now to be a very critical one i had a lover who very warmly besieged me a brother who i expected every hour to second the pretensions of that lover which brother i tenderly loved and who was trebly welcome from having escaped a most dreadful fate and in the mean time was nearly losing from a point of false delicacy the man who really possessed my affections and who truly gave me his  in two days my brother arrived and the next day after arrived hewit my pleasure at seeing my brother will be easier conceived than expressed he informed me of all those particulars which the reader knows relative to the vigo business and some others to which i was a stranger myself and among the rest that my brother the lawyer and sourby had been carrying on a nefarious trade relative to taking up goods and discounting bills that they lived away in a great style in london kept their chariots and mixed in the first company and that their plan was to prevent detection by sacrificing some innocent person on whom by a train of circumstances they contrived suspicion should fall to exonerate themselves he added that he had gathered all this information from a clerk of my brothers who had run away and entered on board a ship for fear of being indicted for perjury for you know said he the old saying hannah the sea and the gallows hey  at a proper opportunity i came to a round explanation with my brother upon the subject of walmesley and hewit he listened to me with more attention than i expected and at last said he only wished that walmesley should have fair play let him said he honestly tell his story and what his pretensions are to your partiality and when he has finished if it should appear that hewit has a superior title in gods name marry hewit hewit is a good fellow to my knowledge  i said i was very willing to put it upon that issue walmesleys pretensions were at best collateral a man who had in so many ways been essentially serviceable in my brothers preservation certainly had every claim upon my gratitude but he had never seen me till within a few days or i him and therefore love was out of the question he acknowledged the justice of my reasoning but begged i would hear walmesley out after which he would leave me at full liberty to decide as i should think proper this of course i agreed to and that very day after dinner walmesley began in form to relate his life and adventures  chap vi walmesleys story you have heard said walmesley of one billy shakespeare a nice fellow billy was and how he said says he all the the worlds a stage and all the men and women in it merely players and never was there a truer thing said  why now i  i ought to know something for i was born in the dressing room suckled in the flies educated in the lobby and brought up in the propertyroom and yet sir shall the veriest hind the stupidest lout the dullest clod overtop me in my profession there is something more than natural in this if philosophy could find it out  so much for exordium now for my history my father  methinks i see my father  you understand me in my minds eye for i never saw him any where else to my knowledge but to the purpose my father that is to say my mothers husband who for a debt of her contracting had been confined at the time of my birth a twelvemonth in the fleet where i am well informed she never paid him a single visit was  i love a long parenthesis  shaver to the house he was a man for a few ounces of phlebotomy the extirpation of a stump the frothing of a lather or the fancy of a caxen  i shall not look upon his like again  so much for my reputed father who my real father was i could never trace as i was cradled in the thunder trunk i have been sometimes tempted in imitation of alexander to believe i sprung from jupiter but being more behind the scences than alexander was and knowing better than he did that gods goddesses and heroes are not only mere but queer mortals when they are undressed i corrected my towering hopes and contented myself with reducing the matter to the most probable conjecture i could form which was that the contention lay between mercury bajazet caliban and a scene shifter  but this secret like many others relative to the origin of great men women and children must rest for ever in oblivion whether my mother ever intended to discover it or whether she could have discovered it if she had intended it i cannot say the mystery certainly never came out for having taken a fancy to wire dancing and embarked for ireland in company with the notorious maddox and the no less notorious the cibber she was sent to tell the fishes that i was the queens son cloten  little walmesley however finding me apt brought me up and treated me as much like a son as if i had been ever so honest madams issue nor did i ill repay his tender care for i soon went on in processions held up trains personated devils and cupids and at length arrived at the envied distinction of representing the little duke of york and being smothered in the tower  were i all my tale to unfold even from my boyish days to the very moment you bid me tell it you would hear of nothing but battles breaches and hair breadth escapes but the battles would be with foils the breaches would be of articles and the hair breadth escapes would be from the bailiffs all this to hear would you my dear miss hewit most seriously incline you would love me for the dangers i had past and i should love you that you did pity them  therefore as brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness its outward limbs and flourishes i will be brief i was soon noticed in the threatre nay not to speak it profanely i was a bit of a savourite in every part of the house i would let puns in the greenroom drink crank in the musicroom or hold a candle in the dressing room with any body of my inches on the boards  these shining qualities soon brought me into great repute with the twentyshilling actors who were obliged like other subalterns to live like gentlemen after deducting threefourths of their pay to find themselves in stage necessaries there was however a collateral consideration in this business five shillings in full weeks and three and sixpence in lent not being an appointment sufficiently splendid to keep up heroic dignity they were now and then under the necessity of applying to little walmesley who having an infinity of business in the caxen way and besides having also just before my mothers departure compounded a crim con affair with a celebrated actor who was afraid of his wife though she by the way had about nine gallants the rogue had become a little craesus  to him therefore they had recource and he on the moderate terms of a crown in the pound would advance perhaps a few pieces for a month to which the rogues would seriously incline and think there was much kindness in the jew  it sometimes however happened for lack of means owing to the importunity of some washerwoman the rapacity of some hussy or the brutality of some landlord they were not quite so punctual in their payments as they ought to have been upon these occasions they never failed to entreat my good offices which were not always administered without effect that is to say upon the advance of the premium many a respite from captivity have i obtained for caged bajazets and dugeoned lusignans samsons have been saved from the philistines by my eloquence nay like another theseus have i rescued virgins from the devouring jaws of that minotaur a bailiff  i became now of great use to little walmesley i had reading and writing which as dogberry says come by nature at my fingers ends whereas the tonsor could only make his mark this being so as so it seems to be he kept his accounts rather lamely indeed in no other way than by marking with a piece of chalk on the inside of an old scrutoire exactly in the manner of a score at an alehouse the different moneys he had advanced to the actors thus frequent mistakes happened to which i gave a helping hand by now and then when he was drunk and had left his bureau open rubbing out a round o with a cross which signified half a crown and putting the half crown in my pocket for my own proper spending  if two men ride upon a horse one must ride behind the little latherer thinking no more than the man that was going to be hanged did of his dying day of the tricks i had played him which by the bye i considered as a fair reimbursement of that money i had earned in my profession after repeated trials of my honesty such as leaving six penny worth of halfpence upon the chimney piece which i must have been a great fool to have touched well knowing why it was placed there he began to let me into all his usurious mysteries and but that i was forbid to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse i could a tale unfold   in short you will be astonished to hear that this muckworm besides notes bonds undertakings and cognovits had amassed together partly in money and partly in valuables eleven hundred pounds nay if i tell you a lie spit in my face and call me a horse i say eleven hundred pounds and then there was scarcely a deposit that did not tell some curious history here lay a diamond hoop that some old enamorato had stolen from the finger of his cara sposa as she lay asleep to purchase the virtue of a theatrical vestal who had three husbands alive and merry there a pair of paste buckles which some old love stricken devotee had purchased with her husbands cash in her way from the tabernacle to win an hours dalliance with her angel of an actor who had just been personating a devil nay there were more of these things than i have thoughts to give them scope or time to tell them in  but the most curious history that came to our knowledge was this one of the bona robas whose husband winked at her intrigues had a very elegant set of jewels given her by a nobleman she had besides an affair of galantry with a figure dancer and it was known that she lavished large sums of money on him which she had received from the same quarter not that she was ungrateful to her husband for he now and then shared her generosity too  after a time the husband being in want of cash for moneys a good soldier and will on he took an opportunity when she was theatrically indisposed and could not sport her jewels of carrying them to a jeweller his request was that the jewels might be imitated for he that is robbed not knowing what is stolen let him not know it he is not robbed at all told the jeweller that over and above the expense he would make him a liberal amends  the jeweller being an honest man ay honest for to be honest as the world goes begged to be excused in short it came out that the jewels had been imitated at the desire of the wife that the figure dancer had received the major part of the money and that the real diamonds had been repurchased by a man of fashion and given as a tour de gallantrie to the lady of the nobleman who had originally given them to the actress  but were i as tedious as a prince i could waste it all upon your worship well my papa the barber and i shaved the people pretty close there was one thing to be sure i could not bear it was almost always our practice to send in a bill and a bailiff now really that hurt me to see a hero or a devil or a ghost after he had strutted and fretted his hour upon the stage and had stuck his fork into a smoking mutton chop at the blueposts torn away in sight of heaven oh it was pityful twas wondrous pityful  in short it was so pityful that i expostulated with old shylockand when he answered me with some sanctified speech told him that the devil could quote scripture for his purpose what do you think happened he gave me some little civil hint about kicking me out of the house a sort of a spiritual shove and because i had made free now and then with our common stock for no other purpose in the world than for the innocent amusement of keeping a girl and a gig he talked of robbery and sending to newgate  i determined from that moment to be up with him but said i to myself remember hermolaus and be hushed false face must hide what the foul heart does know i promised to mend my manners and try if possible to be as great a rascal as himself in the mean time i was like a mole working under ground i tampered with my conspirators met them over a jorum of the righteous at the very witching time of night and when i found them ripe for revolt i told them that i wore a dagger and i could wish it   they understood me in a moment and swore to live and die with bedamer to descend from my stilts  to three of those actors who had been very much fleeced neat fellows lads of spunk though they had arrived no farther in their profession than sir the coach waits or maam your muff and tippet stops the way did i broch my intention i advised them to bring actions against walmesley for usury in which case they would each of them recover three times the money that had been advanced they were tickled with the proposal and promised to fulfill the conditions which were these  as they could never recover without my helping hand and as i must give up the little razor stropper if i lent them a helping hand i insisted upon a positive agreement that my name should not be mentioned in the business till i should give permission and that whatever money might be recovered should be vested in my hands for the purpose of taking a town and opening a country theater of which theater i should be sole and exclusive manager oh glorious thought by heaven i will indulge it though but in fancy  mortified as they were at their ill treatment in town where they said such fellows as garrick and barry ran away with all the applause they looked forward with delight to the time when we should be the admiration of the gaping bumkins one saw the squires daughter ogle him from the boxes another was actually conducting a young lady from a boarding school down a ladder of ropes that like a tackle stair to the high top gallant of his joy  in short they were so big with expectation that we had in idea got a wardrobe scenes decorations and rings and things and fine array but hold said i we count the spoil before the field is won  walmesley still lives in fraud and usery reigns when he comes down then shall we count our gains chap vii continuation of walmesleys story they swore to obey me in every thing and we set our engines to work the actions were commenced and as the nose tweaker had advanced at different times twentyseven pounds to one thirtythree to another and fifty to the third the gross sum of three hundred and thirty pounds was expected to come into the common stock  he laughed at all this and told me not suspecting i was in the secret that he would threaten to do em up with the manager and as to master wiggins the pettifogging attorney who had brought the actions he would scare him with the ghost of his last perjury besides said he charley nothing can be done without thee in the business and it would be hard indeed if father and son could not be true to each other so saying he put five guineas into my hand i answered i should in all my best obey him and he rejoined that it was a loving and fair reply  in the mean time term came on and matters had gone as far as a notice of trial the actors had counteracted every one of his precautions which he looked upon as the cunning of old wiggins who knew all his practices and how to guard against them whereas had i not prompted my actors old wiggins would have thrown them upon their backs for he had inwardly chuckled at being employed expecting in the end to serve his friend walmesley with whom he had had a quarrel  wiggins neither expected the actors would have been equal to the instructions they had given him nor did walmesley think wiggins would have acted so vindictively if there had not been some collateral reason in short these two worthy gentlemen knew so much of each others tricks that they were mutually afraid of coming into court and therefore were both determined to have a private interview which was very easily effected for though they had not spoke together for several months they often met at some alehouse or other near cliffords or serjeants inn where the jew my father often went either to swear to a debt or to attend as a hired bail  upon comparing notes they began to suspect me but this consequence i foresaw and was prepared for it or any other that might follow they might fret me but they could not play upon me the old hairroaster gave me to understand by a strange alteration in his manner what was going forward in his mind after a great deal of humming and haing he asked if matters should come to a trial what sort of evidence i should give  i answered the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth why what the devil said i would you have me lay perjury to my soul no not for venice in short said i if you ask me what i think of the matter you are damned all of one side like an ill roasted egg  well well but said he you know these young fellows dont you think that matters can be accommodated accommodated said i why ay that is a good word it comes from accomodo accommodated is a good word it is as much as to say that when a man is accommodated he is  accommodated  pooh pooh nonsense said old pinching irons will you serve me in it to serve myself good cousin for look you when you have settled it i will claim of you that bracelet the rings and other of those movables of which our good cousins the cozened actresses once stood possessed  at last we came to a right understanding and i was to have fifty pounds if i could settle the matter at any price short of bringing it into court my award as arbitrator was that master barber should refund the original sums allow three months interest upon them and pay all costs which terms with great reluctance were fulfilled after this i told old pulltail that he was queered bamboozled and jockeyed for that i was going with lads fit to seize the world and rule it when twas wildest  being let into the secret nothing could exceed his fury he saw into the whole plan and swore he would indite us for a conspiracy i laughed at his folly and whispered two or three things in his ear that brought him into better temper he could not so far rule himself however but that he swore i should starve hang said i starve or drown twill be in a better cause at last i told him to make himself easy as to me and for him when the trade of usury failed if he behaved himself well i would make him barber to the company  now were our brows bound with victorious wreaths the newspapers teemed with advertisements for young actors and actresses the manager to be seen at the black lion valet de chambres and ladies maids were applied to for clothes to furnish our wardrobe i coaxed away the colourgrinder to the house who had taken umbrage because the manager would not permit him to invent and execute a pantomime with his own hands got hold of a devilish good tumbler a fine fellow a little too bold had like to have broken his neck once by attempting to imitate the fall of niagara got the copies of all the new pieces by bribing the underprompter and now being every way stocked with materials money and merit we dashed off and took the town of stockbridge in hampshire where by beat of drum we proclaimed the play of the suspicious husband  the part of ranger by stockbridge was a horrid place and if it had not been for the officers of two troops of dragoons who treated the farmers daughters and invited us to mum a little at their public treats we should have made a queer thing of it but what was this to lads of fire like us did not the milleners prentice the pretty landlady at the rose and the daughter of farmer fussocks call me the gallant gay lothario in short though we left stockbridge about fifty pounds poorer than we had come into it twas so much pleasure for so much money care killed a cat up tails all and a fig for the hangman and so we laughed it off  after this oh we had such marchings and counter marchings from rumsey to alton from alton to reading from reading to hungerford from hungerford to landsdown fair drums beating trumpets braying but the curse of it was we got poorer and poorer i did pity an unfortunate frenchman who we took as a dancer at reading  the frenchman was to have a share and a benefit i explained to him that the share would be no great matter it might be three and sixpence or perhaps only fourpence and three pieces of candle but that the benefit  ah dat is very well said monsieur mon benefice dat is good to have benefice  when the benefit night came the receipt of the house turned out to be six pounds seventeen shillings next morning the frenchman called upon me to receive the profits of his benefit i will settle it with you directly sir said i the expense of the house is eight pounds and the receipt of the house last night was six pounds seventeen shillings so that if you will pay me one pound three shillings the business will be settled settle settle de devil you must pay me my benefice benefit why dont i tell you that you must pay me one pound three shillings pay you cot tam vere it is then my benefice good god said i you dont understand i understand extremely well  you make your charge a eight pone you make come six pone seventeen shellang i de hosse so i most pay vom pone e tree shellang fell den code sone vere is my benefice  it was in vain that i attempted to convince him by numberless examples that nothing was so common as for performers to lose money at their benefits he could not reconcile such a contradiction as that a benefit might be a loss and all i could get from him was sare you are not honest man you promise benefice i beg you tell me ou est que mon benefice  after a good deal of altercation as i did not like to part with him i told him he should make his own terms when he said that since benefice was malafice he would have two chare and no benefice i told him he might be caught at that and so it turned out for at the next town we shared nothing  chap viii conclusion of walmesleys story thus we actors live continued walmesley we live zounds it is impossible to tell how we live one cursed circumstance was that we were always lighting the candle at both ends always spending as much again as we got so that upon a fair calculation the more we gained the worse we were off why sir in less than a twelvemonth there was not a devil of us but was in debt in five different towns but still we were as jovial as beggars upon straw for except a black eye or so in consequence of a quarrel about some dulcinea who was constant to us all round i must do the company the justice to say there never was a set of more amiable officers  but the fun we took most delight in was what we call bamming and it must be acknowledged this was my peculiar forte whenever we took a town we were sure to find some greenhorn or other whom we presently infected with the spouting mania these soft sirs we used to teach a song or a speech till they have so ranted and so bellowed that you would have thought natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably  i made one excellent benefit at nottingham and another at birmingham by maneuvers of this kind at nottingham i got hold of the mayors son a precious lank haired bit of a noodle i told him he was the young youth in the world to represent great personages for said i some are born great some atchieve greatness and others have greatness thrust upon em icod sir he invited me to drink tea with his mamma this did the business i talked oh gods how i did talk the mayor was quelling a riot among the stocking weavers so you see the mamma being at home not only the mare but the gray mare it was agreed that mrs mayoress should bespeak king richard the third and that little zackery should perform the prince of wales  to clinch the business the mayoress invited all nottingham except the ladies in check aprons to a hop and circulated my tickets round the room i had a glorious house performed richard myself every thing went off nobly the young prince was applauded to the very echo that did applaud again for though he had a gait like a dab chick a voice like an ungreased wheel and a dialect as querulous as three hammers upon an anvil yet every one there being subject to the same infirmities like the hunched backed man who thought the camel the most beautiful object in existence found out a fresh perfection in every speech he uttered and thus he never came out with niow you my loord or the like but we were stunned with the applause  i must give you one instance in the scene where the young prince is shocked at the idea of being lodged at the tower tressel says i hope all will be well this was my heros answer i do whuope zo too but coom to the tiower zin it mun be zo  shall i tell you the birmingham business come i see you wish to know it my flat there was a fine thick headed blacksmith with lungs like a stentor i taught him the early horn and made him sing it so loud that one day he broke a pane of glass in the taproom we frequented with his cadence at last i coaxed him to sing it for my benefit devilish warm fellow put off by agreement three hundred tickets  when he came on the stage before the band struck up he had a mind to pitch his voice so he began ti too tum taw damn your ti too tum taw cried a man in the gallery my friend eying the fellow with ineffable disdain cried out why then damn you damn me if i sing any more so off he went and this was all the audience heard of him or the early horn  but i should have told ye that long before this i had ceased to be a manager occasioned sir by jealousy that green eyed monster to be sure i did keep all the good parts to myself but what is there that a manager will not attempt they told me one day that as our agreement was when we found it a losing game to cut and part the property so it was now high time to take that step while there was any property to part  i expostulated threatened and entreated to no purpose my authority was all gone othellos occupation was no more they said it was every one now for himself and god for us all that they had worked long enough for me i might now work for myself in short i saw it was all over with me i knew well enough their power i certainly had an idle thoughtless way of involving the concern by way of security whenever they would supply me with a little loose cash for my menu plaisirs and thus i had mortgaged over one day perhaps a thunder trunk and a shower of rain another half a dozen ermine coronation robes made out of slannel or else a collection of worsted wigs till in fact the stock was virtually their own  but never count the terms once and a million all my rethoric was thrown away i might as well have bid the lamb preach to the pityless wolf they continued firm to their purpose and finding me determined not to abdicate my throne beckoned to a gentleman standing hard by who touching me on the shoulder informed me i was his prisoner  is it even so said i then i defy you stars sir said i to the bailiff you should be a gentleman keep off the rabble that i may entertain my fate with decency will you said one ask favor of the senate cursed be your senate said i that jemmy twitcher should peach me i own surprises me but it is a plain proof that the world is all alike and that even our gang can no more trust one another than other people  oh said i take example by this ye managers let not the lisp the smile nor the rustlings of silks betray your poor heart to women let not your treasurers accept drafts for you your wardrobekeeper run you up with the tradesmen borrow not your performers money nor mortgage your property above four times over lest your men grow insolent your women indisposed lest instead of your managing the company the company should manage you and in the fury of your remorse you take away what was not yours to give  have you done said one nay said another if you have not to it again well wait your leisure  my pretty geniuses finished by telling me that they had agreed to sell my quondam property now made over to them to the notorious mr linnet who was in treaty with the mayor of winchester for that ancient and learned city that he had promised to engage them all on handsome shares and would include me provided i were inclined to embark in the scheme but that i must not expect to perform capital parts as they had gibbs gawdry and other actors of that description in the company  cromwell said i to little dick douce a monstrous good fellow you remember him hewit at stourbitch i did not think in all my miseries to have shed a tear but lead me in take an inventory of all i have to the last penny it is the companys  to make short of my story after the accounts had been drawn out and the expenses fairly paid i found myself in the possession of the gross sum of seven pounds five shillings and fourpence halfpenny one coat two shirts a pair of stockings and seven wigs at such a time to shut me out i did regret parting from poor douce i asked him to correspond with me i cannot said he how dye mean cannot you can write letters i dont think i can said the poor fellow i have written nothing but orders and promisory notes for these fifteen years  the next freak i took into my head was to be in love i got an engagement at stilton and was fortunate enough to play the principals romeo old philpot and the like a great brewers daughter sent me a billet doux attended the appointment saw her at the window lamenting her hard fortune to the hard apples and pears in the orchard settled the plan of elopement swore to her beauty helen and hero were but hildings and harlots got one of her fathers dray horses this roan said i shall be my throne mounted the chay cart bear me said i bucephalus among the billows off we went bye dad hey for gretna green wounds we had a power of crosses upon the road no putting dobbin into a trot oh said i that i should expect a horse to run away that never did any thing but walk  shall i go on or have i said enough after we had got about three miles in two hours and a half spouting romeo and juliet all the way like two intriguing ducks in a millpond i heard the tread of horsemen and presently received my beaver being up a blow over the pericranium that felled me to the earth oh said i thou cuttest my head off with a golden ax and smilest upon the stroke that murders me  ah dom thee said the old father for it was him and his myrmidons ill murder thee with the devil to thee thus we went on i will read you the scene  papa play acting poaching rascal   walmesley and must i leave thee juliet   papa dom thee hold thy palavering jaw   miss our hearts are twined together   papa i will untwine them with the devil to you   walmesley fathers have flinty hearts   papa flinty hey what to save their girls from ruin   miss stand off or this dagger shall quit my romeos hold   papa dagger john hold her arms tie that fellow hand and foot   walmesley oh cursed cruel fate   away they went bearing off poor juliet no tears could move em next morning i was informed that i had better decamp for the brewer had been with the justice to lay his complaint who was of opinion i might be taken up for horse stealing  at this hint i cannot say i spoke for instead of uttering a syllable i sat off as hard as i could drive when i came to wellingborough i saw a crowd and presently found it was occasioned by a mountebank who had just ascended his stage astonished to see him without a merry andrew i was informed that poor pickle had broke his thigh at the last town vaulting the slack rope but that the doctor had sent for another famous for mummification gesticulation and imitation  well knowing that this was a pretense to bam the multitude and being perfectly capable of answering all the quack slang i called out to make room for me for that i was come the doctor did not know what to make of this at first but being satisfied by a flash intimation or two he welcomed me by the names of pickle drybones screwmuscle and so on i jumped upon the stage and having dressed myself in my predecessors jacket mummed gesticulated and imitated to such a degree that they threw up their shillings for the chance of the silver spoon in great abundance as to the doctor he was so delighted that he offered to take me into partnership upon the spot  i stayed with him however no longer than till his merry andrew had recovered exacting no more than my expenses and a reasonable present to which he generously added which he said might be of service to me several receipts to counterfeit patent quack medicines he also recommended me to his friend the manager of a company of comedians at coventry who shortly after took stourbitch fair at which place i became acquainted as i suppose you have already heard with then my friend now alas my rival john hewit  well miss higgins after we had escaped from the philistines i suppose you are not a stranger to all that happened from the bearbaiting business to our being cast away upon the coast of sussex it was upon the coast of sussex was it not captain you see after hewit and i had escaped in safety from the country boors we determined that the fortune of one should be the fortune of the other marry how tropically so you see mrs hannah i dont know how you can do unless you marry us both  but stay where was i oh when hewit and i parted  parted said i i understood  oh yes cried walmesley it is very easily understood  parted what a stupid fellow i must be but we who are true lovers have strange vagaries i mean met never to part brothers another gemini in short hewit became walmesley and walmesley became hewit for when hewit went to bristol walmesley  no that is not it  walmesley went to bristol and hewit that is to say walmesley no hewit the prince found the fisherman no i am wrong the fisherman found the prince and hewit i mean the fisherman and then walmesley i would say the prince no hewit stay i am wrong walmesley  thus you see the prince and hewit and walmesley and the fisherman and and and now i think i have made the matter perfectly clear  chap ix in which the foregoing aenigma is cleared up and hannah higgins is married to john hewit here my brother and hewit fell into a hearty fit of laughter at walmesleys very curious way of clearing the matter up and told him he never acted better in his life well then if that is the case said he i suppose i may go and undress  with all my heart i am glad my part is done so soon  beginning now to see a little into the business upon my word said i you are a pretty set but dont you think it was rather cruel to amuse yourselves at my expense why i will tell you what hannah said my brother i was determined to be pilot in this business myself young girls in love affairs you see generally go to sea without rudder or compass i had a mind therefore to see how the land lay and this whimsical intermixture of walmesley and hewit having happened i thought it a good opportunity of trying whether you were sailing with a squall that might overset you or a steady breeze likely to bring you into port  i thank you said i for your affection though i could have spared you the trouble of a trial that has intruded on me many disagreeable moments but any thing to convince my brother that his sister shall never prove unworthy of him and now pray clear as mr walmesley has made this history i should be glad to have it a little better elucidated  the business said my brother is no more than this hewit and walmesley finding or rather fancying themselves in danger of being pursued agreed to assume each others name so that from the moment they parted hewit became walmesley and walmesley hewit and the trick was this if hewit should be caught by the name of walmesley he might easily prove he was not the man and so of the other  what then said i to walmesley you did not go to sea oh yes i did said walmesley can none remember yes i know all must  when glory like a dazzling eagle stood perched on my beaver in the grannic flood   why maam as we were riding in latitude ninetytwo gallopping away upon the back of the isle of wight just as the mizen peak was furled to the cat head your brother amidships running out a flying jibboom and i standing abaft the taffarel   i wish you had been with us said my brother with all my soul we should have had ten times more fun than we had but the fact is having taken a liking to john hewit who i entered aboard by the name of walmesley he generously told me every particular of his love for you and said he had certainly rendered himself very unworthy of you but that it should be his study in future to merit your good opinion  this added to the service he did me for you know hannah i love a gallant fellow induced me to promote him but still continued him under the name of walmesley both to try your heart and to avoid any unpleasant explanation with the ships company  and pray said i to hewit was your arm in a sling mr walmesley by reason of a wound you received under the fort of vigo when you sent that letter it certainly was said john but if it had not i should have got somebody else to have written that express for otherwise you would have known my hand writing  then said i i certainly have been very completely deceived but there is one thing more what became of the real mr walmesley under the false name of hewit ever since the bearbaiting business and how came he to bring that letter and where did you find him i am anxious to know all this for now i have no fear of him as a lover i am extremely pleased with him as an acquaintance  why said my brother as i was journeying on to find you here devilish ill to be sure i was and among the rest of my plagues i had as shakespeare calls it a raging tooth this was at saxmundham and asking the landlord whether they had in the neighborhood an operator that could unship it without carrying away any of my upper works he told me there was one doctor hewit in the town who performed miracles in that way that he did eyes cataracts palates and hair lips cut corns gave shocks fumigated and somentated that he was the son of a seventh son that there was not such a dab within a hundred miles at a burstenchild or a hollow tooth and that his turlington and daffey had done wonders but then added the landlord he is mighty soft in other respects all he gets the foolish man gives away to the poor  i was struck with the name and still more with the character on which though he has said nothing of it hewit used very much to enlarge i recollected that when he separated from hewit he determined to set up in this way in consequence of having been supplied with proper instructions by the quack doctor to whom he was merry andrew at wellingborough nothing therefore could get it out of my head but that it was walmesley himself i begged he might be sent for lord we knew one another in two minutes like a couple of freemasons the word said i sweet marjorum said the doctor pass answered i why now upon my soul said he that is very extraordinary there never was but one man in the world that i settled that with i know it said i a namesake of yours his name was john hewit he has betrayed you you remember the circumstance of stealing the horse at stilton now you see that horse has turned out to be a mare  and says sir john the statutes all declare that man must needs be hanged that steals a mare   come come said he you are a good fellow this will do landlord bring some punch how is he i love him the fellow fascinated me put powder in my drink i was planet struck why sir i had almost consented to face the salt sea and hear the deep mouth cannon joves thunders counterfeit oh added he that villainous salt petre should be dug from the harmless bowels of the earth that so many brave fellows have laid low  well but stay how is john i wish this damned fellow would come with the punch here landlord oh he is as tedious as a tired horse come come we have got it at last if you please sir well drink his health here he goes the stupidest fellow for a head and the finest fellow for a heart in the world here is may success attend his plot and hannah higgins be his denonement  higgins continued he what the devil have we got here let me twig your buttons  success to the eagle galley thomas higgins commander have we not hiren here he then told me that he had that morning seen my friend the pilot who had gone upon a little business to saxmundham from whom he learnt not only my story but that hewit was safe and had been passed as a pauper to wolverhampton which latter intelligence was news to me  seeing disguise was totally unnecessary we fairly unbent and as i was taken with a violent fever that very night and unable to proceed i sent walmesley forward with proper instructions i knew perfectly well that hewit had not betrayed me and that the presence of walmesley would properly entangle the plot of our comedy till i should arrive to manage the denouement and wind up the catastrophe this is now done and you have nothing to do by way of perfecting the resemblance of a drama but to give your hand to the hero of the piece  and what am i to do said walmesley i should have lost my sheep said i answering him in his own way if it had not bleated thy fortune shall be my care cried my brother and while i have a guinea you shall freely command a part of it why then my golden dream is out said walmesley and it shall be realized said my brother and i wish my fortune was ample enough to indulge you in your menu plaisirs as you call them no more of that if thou love me hall answered walmesley  having now the sanction of my brothers consent to a marriage with the man i loved though i hope that neither in this instance nor in any other i have ever lost sight of proper feminine delicacy i will not affect to deny that i guaranteed my brothers proposal by giving hewit my hand freely and without reserve  on the following sunday we became man and wife good parson williams performed the ceremony my brother gave me away miss binns and miss williams were the bridemaids the latter of whom wrote an elegant little poem on the occasion by way of epithalamium which walmesley repeated after dinner with good emphasis and good discretion  mr smallbrook and mr gregory were of the party and poor mrs crow superintended the kitchen the little children i had taught on a sunday were all feasted the manufacturers throughout the place either at my instance or at the instance of their employers who had all a respect for me made a jovial day of it and except a sigh to the memory of binns whose health we drank after dinner which both his sister and i accompanied with a tear i truly believe that no occasion be it ever so popular or so interesting could have diffused more general joy among all degrees of persons than did at wolverhampton the union of john hewit and hannah higgins  end of the first volume
