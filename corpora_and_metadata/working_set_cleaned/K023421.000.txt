an essay on acting in which will be considered the mimical behavior of a certain fashionable faulty actor and the laudableness of such unmannerly as well as inhumane proceedings to which will be added a short criticism on his acting macbeth   so have i seen a pygmie strut mouth and rant in a giants robe tom thumb  oh macbeth has murdered g  k shakespeare london printed for w bickerton at the gazette in the temple exchange near the inner temple gate fleet street m dcc xliv price sixpence  an essay on acting etc as i have a long time twenty years or more made the stage and acting my study and entertainment i look upon myself and indeed am thought by my intimates a proper person to animadvert upon or approve the errors and the excellencies of the theater and as there can be no better opportunity offer itself than now when the town is running after their little fashionable actor in a character of which he is properly speaking the anticlimax of or rather the antipode of shakespeare i will endeavor in the following dissection of our puppet hero to convince my dear country men and country women that they are madly following an ignis fatuus or will of the whisp which they take for real substantial light and which i shall prove to be only the rushlight of genius the idol of fashion and an airdrawn favorite of the imagination  how are we degenerated in taste oh how changed how fallen miltons paradise lost that our theater shall be crowded with nobility ladies and gentry to see macbeth burlesqud or be  g  kd which are synonimous when they might read mr theobalds edition of him without throwing away their money mispending their time ruining their taste or running the hazard of catching a violent cold for a mere nonentity however that i may not seem to be prejudiced against mr g  k as i really am not for i admire him for thus boldly daring to deceive and cheat three parts of the nation i shall having now cracked the shell of my spleen against the town come to the kernel of reason and present em this little sweet nut of theirs wormeaten to the sight embittered to their taste and abhorred to their imaginations as shakespeare terms it  in order to do this i shall present my readers with the following short treatise upon acting which will show em what acting ought to be and what the present favorite in question is not  a short treatise upon acting by which the players may be instructed and the town undeceived that i may convince the world that the public good and no private animosity has extracted the following treatise from its author i shall first give an ample and clear definition of acting and make the natural metaphysical and consequential deductions that will immediately elicite the right from the wrong and show my designs are merely scientifical and not subservient to pique and partial prejudice  acting is an entertainment of the stage which by calling in the aid and assistance of articulation corporeal motion and occular expression imitates assumes or puts on the various mental and bodily emotions arising from the various humors virtues and vices incident to human nature  there are two different kinds of exhibitions viz tragedy and comedy the first fixes her empire on the passions and the more exalted contractions and dilations of the heart the last though not inferior quotidem science holds her rule over the less enobled qualities and districts of human nature which are called the humors now in some cases passions are humors and humors passions for the revenges of an alexander and a haberdasher may have the same fountain and differ only in their currents and though the one alexander cannot content himself but with the total subversion of his enemys kingdom and the other the haberdasher is satisfied with rolling his antagonist in the kennel yet still it is revenge the mind of one is equally affected in proportion to the other and all the difference lies in the different ways of satisfying their common passion but now to the application and design in hand if an actor and a favorite actor in assuming these different characters with the same passions shall unskilfully differ only in dress and not in execution and supposing him right in one and of consequence absolutely ridiculous in the other shall this actor i say in spite of reason physics and common observation be caressed applauded admired but to illustrate it more by example  suppose the murder of duncan and the breaking a urinal shall affect the player in the same manner and the only difference is the blue apron and laced coat shall we be chilled at the murderer and roar at the tobacconist fie for shame  as the one must be absolutely the reverse of right i think the public for so gross an imposition should drive both off the stage when drugger becomes macbeth and macbeth drugger i feel for the manes of the immortal shakespeare and inimitable ben i bemoan the taste of my country and i would have the buffoon sacrificed to appease the muses and restore to us a true dramatick taste by such an examplary piece of justice i shall now as relative to my my present subject describe in what manner the two abovementioned characters ought to be mentally and corporeally agitated under the different circumstances of the dagger and urinal and by that shall more fully delineate what is meant by passions and humors when abel drugger has broke the urinal he is mentally absorbed with the different ideas of the invaluable price of the urinal and the punishment that may be inflicted in consequence of a curiosity no way appertaining or belonging to the business he came about now if this as it certainly is the situation of his mind how are the different members of the body to be agitated why thus  his eyes must be reversed from the object he is most intimidated with and by dropping his lip at the some time to the object it throws a trembling languor upon every muscle and by declining the right part of the head toward the urinal it casts the most comic terror and shame over all the upper part of the body that can be imagined and to make the lower part equally ridiculous his toes must be inverted from the heel and by holding his breath he will unavoidably give himself a tremor in the knees and if his fingers at the same time seem convulsed it finishes the compleatest low picture of grotesque terror that can be imagined by a dutch painter  let this be compared with the modern copies and then let the town judge  now to macbeth  when the murder of duncan is committed from an immediate consciousness of the fact his ambition is ingulphd at that instant by the horror of the deed his faculties are intensely rivited to the murder alone without having the least consolation of the consequential advantages to comfort him in that exigency he should at that time be a moving statue or indeed a petrified man his eyes must speak and his tongue be metaphorically silent his ears must be sensible of imaginary noises and deaf to the present and audible voice of his wife his attitudes must be quick and permanent his voice articulately trembling and confusedly intelligible the murderer should be seen in every limb and yet every member at that instant should seem separated from his body and his body from his soul this is the picture of a complete regicide and as at that time the orb below should be hush as death i hope i shall not be thought minutely circumstantial if i should advise a real genius to wear cork heels to his shoes as in this scene he should seem to tread on air and i promise him he will soon discover the great benefit of this however seeming trifling piece of advice  the only way to arrive at great excellency in characters of humor is to be very conversant with human nature that is the noblest and best study by this way you will more accurately discover the workings of spirit or what other physical terms you please to call it upon the different modifications of matter would the painter produce a perfect piece to the world let him copy from the life let nature herself sit to the artist would a player perform equally excellent in his profession let him be introduced into the world be conversant with humors of every kind digest em in his mind let em be cherished by the genial warmth of his conception transplanted into the fair garden of his judgment there let em ripen to perfection and become his own hic labor hoc opus the late celebrated mr dogget before he performed the character of ben in love for love took lodgings in wapping and gathered thence a nosegay for the whole town another comedian now living though not upon the stage it being so replete with greater geniuses has been observed constantly to attend the change for weeks together before he exhibited one of shakespeares most inimitable and difficult characters and so far succeeded by his great attention and observation of the manners dress and behavior of a particular tribe of people that the judgment application and extraordinary pains he took to divert the public rationally was amply returned with crowded theaters and unequalled applauses nay to so great a degree did they show their approbation to this painstaking genius that he is at present more known by the name of the character he performed than by his own  i shall not enter into the reasons why he is at present excluded theater but shall only as an advocate for the public say that i wish for their sake that there were many such actors as him upon both theaters  i have in as concise a manner as possible given my sentiments of acting by example and precept but there will very soon be publish d a more complete and expanded treatise upon acting with an accurate description of each humor and passion their sources and effects by which the players may be taught to renounce their errors and the town its judgment of acting and actors   here ends the essay upon acting some critical observations upon the character of macbeth as it is at present attempted at the theater royal in drury lane the following critque is designed as a supplementary appendix to the foregoing essay on acting and as that was not so full and investigating as my imagination had at first formed it i shall in this short survey of heroism in miniature still have my eye upon the essay on acting and at the same time convince the public that they have insensibly been misguided by fashion and that they have in the dark runaground their reputation on the sandy banks of error but i shall now fix a lanthorn at the poop of their misconceptions they shall see their distress i will set my hand to the pump of conviction clear the vessel from sixteen feet water of antitaste keep it from foundering hoist up the flag of criticism and once more pilot their understandings into the harbor of true judgment but metaphor apart what is the character of macbeth he is an experienced general crowned with conquest innately ambitious and religiously humane spurred on by metaphysical prophecies and the unconquerable pride of his wife to a deed horrid in itself and repugnant to his nature but as it is the ladder to the swelling act of the imperial theme his milk soon becomes gall imbitters his whole disposition and the consequence is the murder of duncan the taking off of banquo and his own coronation thus stands macbeth now to our inferences valor and ambition the two grand characteristicks of macbeth form in the minds eye a person of near six feet high corpulently graceful a round visage a large hazel eye aquiline nose prominent chest and a wellcalvd leg rather inclined to that which is called an irish leg this i say would be the painters choice was he to give us the macbeth of his imagination i mention this only to prove that mr g  k is not formed in the least externally no more than internally for that character and though there are many figures in the world would become it very well though not exactly coincident with my description yet the nearer they approach to it they will the better look ambition heroism and murder mr g  k could he speak the part is well formed for fleance or one of the infant shadows in the cauldron scene but for the manager to impose him upon the town for a macbeth and to refuse taking another comedian into his house is such an example of ignorance and impudence that is not to be paralelled but by his own unparalleled behavior  mr g  ks dress is very faulty too his coat should be banquos and banquos his and for this reason red and gold suits the dignity of macbeth and at the same time implies a more principal and exalted character without derogating or taking from the rank of banquo in red and silver who titularly bears an equal station as commander though militarily bears an inferior proportion as man this distinction is very nice and perhaps may not glare upon common readers as defined here but was this decorum nicely preserved the eyes of all from the critic to the groundling as shakespeare calls em would immediately convey to the mind the several degrees and minute distinctions of the character from the color and trimmings of his apparel  i shall leave it to the consideration of the public whether or no a tie wig is more eligible than a major or a plain hat than a laced one for my own part i say no  so much for dress and figure now i shall proceed to the more difficult and physical parts of the character and shall consider the action speaking and conception of our modern hero  the first words of the part  so foul and fair a day i have not seen in my opinion are spoke wrong mackbeth before his entrance has been in a great storm of rain thunder etc now as the audience have been apprizd of this by the three witches he should very emphatically describe the quick transition from being wet to the skin to being almost instantaneously dried again though i cannot convey in writing the manner how it should be spoke yet every reader may comprehend how it ought to be spoke and know that in the manner it is now spoke the sentiment is languid unintelligible and undescriptive i shall now examine the most remarkable scene in the whole play which is that of the airdrawn dagger this i shall make appear he has mistook from the beginning to the end  macbeth as a preparation for this vision is so prepossessed from his humanity with the horror of the deed which by his more prevailing ambition he is incited to and for the perpetration of which he lies under a promissary injunction to his lady that his mind being torn by these different and confused ideas his senses fail and present that fatal agent of his cruelty  the dagger to him  now in this visionary horror he should not rivet his eyes to an imaginary object as if it really was there but should show an unsettled motion in his eye like one not quite awaked from some disordering dream his hands and fingers should not be immovable but restless and endeavoring to disperse the cloud that over shadows his optic ray and bedims his intellects here would be confusion disorder and agony come let me clutch thee is not to be done by one motion only but by several successive catches at it first with one hand and then with the other preserving the same motion at the same time with his feet like a man who out of his depth and half drowned in his struggles catches at air for substance this would make the spectators blood run cold and he would almost feel the agonies of the murderer himself i have spoke of the scene following the murder in my essay on acting and shall only say that the daggers are near an inch and half too long in proportion to the height of the murderer the nightgown he appears in after the murder ought to be a red damask and not the fripperyflowerd one of a foppington but when taste is wanting in trifles and judgment in essentials how can we hope to see the theater flourish i must make a remark upon him in the banquet scene which is the most glaring absurdity that ever was committed by an actor when banquos ghost gets possession of macbeths chair and the latter frighted at his appearance by words and actions says which of you have done this meaning the murder of banquo here the actor should address himself to the guests and not keep a fixed eye upon the ghost he should turn his head from banquo and say to the lords at supper which of you have done this for to speak to the plural number and look at the singular banquo only is most absurd and ridiculous then at the second appearance of the ghost at the words dare me to the desert with thy sword macbeth should draw his sword and put himself in a posture of defense and when he comes to hence horrid shadow he should make a home thrust at him recover himself upon the ghosts moving and keep passing at him till he has got him quite out of the room the manner it has been done heretofore which is keeping the hand upon the sword and following him out is not so natural and effecting as the way i propose and if any objection is made that macbeth should know that ghosts are not vulnerable i answer macbeths horror confounds him and his actions must denote the non compos here i must take notice of an omission in the part of banquo when he appears at the banquet he ought to rise in a red cloak as he was seen to cross the stage in one immediately before his murder this would throw a great solemnity upon the figure of banquo and preserve the decorum of the stage  i must likewise observe that in shakespeares time the actors wore their own hair and now from the present fashion of wearing wigs some speeches are become absurd such for instance is this of macbeth never shake thy goary locks at me when at the same time the ghost is seen in a tie wig if i might be allowed to propose an alteration with all imaginable deference to the immortal shakespeare in order to avoid this blunder i would have the actor say never shake thy goary tie at me if the word wig is thought more poetical it will be equally good as they are both monosyllables  as i have not yet left the banquet scene i must observe that the attitude g  k stands in at the second appearance of the ghost is absolutely wrong macbeth here should sink into himself or rather if i may be allowed the expression hide himself behind himself or to illustrate it more by example si parvis comporere etc he should imitate the contracting power of a snail preserving at the same time a slow awful manly folding up of his faculties and as his body gathers up gradually at the vision his mind should keep the same time and denote its strong workings and convulsions at his eyes the glass of wine in his hand should not be dashed upon the ground but it should fall gently from him and he should not discover the least consciousness of having such a vehicle in his hand his memory being quite lost in the present guilt and horror of his imagination the banquet itself which is supposed to be a regal one should not be composed of a few apples oranges and such like trash but of hot costly viands and large pyramids of wet sweetmeats and savoy biscuits this would cast an inconceiveable grandeur upon the scene and add greatly to the horror of the ghost  macbeth says to night we hold a solemn supper sir which solemnity should be preserved by having several bishops and inferior clergy at the table and of consequence the supernatural appearance of banquo would strike with double force on the minds of the audience by their spiritual presence i could show that this play is even deficient in every little decoration but this one gross blunder will suffice to give us an idea of all the rest  as my criticisms upon the three first acts of macbeth have been more full and extended than i at first designed em i shall reserve my observations upon the two last for another sixpenny pamphlet to which i shall subjoin a criticism upon colombine courtezan which i shall examine critically scene by scene and lay open the imperfections of that piece discernable to the meanest capacity and shall prove by undeniable conclusions drawn from known postulata that the worst play that ever shakespeare wrote is greatly preferable to the whole performance of colombine courtezan i am very sensible what difficulties and prejudices i have to surmount in such an undertaking but as i have the reputation of my country at heart i am resolved to prosecute my laudable intentions with indefatigable care and unwearied diligence  in short to sum up the whole of my present observations upon this head as i profess the strictest adherence to truth despise flattery and am incapable of fear i will venture to affirm there is not one pleasuregiving scene throughout the whole play of macbeth as it is now acted but as i will ever do justice to merit i must own i felt some pleasure at seeing mr millss green ribbon and star in the character of duncan the unexpected introduction of the scotch order was an agreeable novelty and discovered great fancy in the actor therefore i could not refrain from giving it here a deserved commendation and it shall always meet with my approbation in the theater  i think i cannot better finish a criticism on macbeth than with a succinct description of the talents and capacity of its author shakespeare was a writer not to be confined by rule he had a despotick power over all nature laws would be an infringement of his prerogative his sceptered pen waved control over every passion and humor his royal word was not only absolute but creative ideas language and sentiment were his slaves they were chained to the triumphal car of his genius and when he made his entry into the temple of fame all parnassus rung with acclamations the muses sung his conquests crowned him with neverfading laurels and pronounced him immortal amen  here ends the criticism on macbeth i shall at once convince the world of my impartiality with regard to mr g  k by allowing him all the merit that mimickry can give him which to be sure is very pleasant over a bottle though despicable on the stage  but how his being a good mimick should entitle him to be a great actor i cannot so easily comprehend the punch of a puppet show and the hero of a theater are as different in their characters as the materials they are each composed of but how can he answer it to conscience and his fellow creatures his endeavoring by modulating his organs of speech and action to those of other actors to render them contemptible by such a visible exposure of their infirmities it is wicked it is unjust it is inhumane and the people who are diverted by it and applaud him for it are barbarous uncivilizd and unfeeling a pickpocket is less culpable than a mimick suppose for instance an actor of either theater coming out of the playhouse has his pocket picked of ten or a dozen shillings in the piazza or in catherinestreet care economy and his business makes the loss easy but if the same actor is made ridiculous and looses the means of replenishing his aforesaid pickdpocket the mimick that deprives him of ever having his pocket picked again either in the piazza or catharinestreet is the pickpocket himself i believe mimickry was never thought of before in this light therefore let it be considered let it be condemned besides as a farther confirmation of the unlaudableness of such proceedings i am told the very mimickd actors themselves are not very easy under this treatment and are resolved never to be reconciled to any future analysis of their looks tones or gestures  as i am now obliged for want of room to curb the impetuosity of my pen and stop its critical carears i shall in a very short time lay before the public another pamphlet with some more additional remarks upon the same subject which will be a proper appendix to the essay on acting and called an essay on the common sewers vulgarly styled common shores in which will be considered the use and abuse of bumfodder with some curious observations upon the present state of politics both at home and abroad  finis
