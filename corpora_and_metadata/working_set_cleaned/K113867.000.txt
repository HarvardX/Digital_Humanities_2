two tales  an impossible thing a tale  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane mdccxx  an impossible thing a tale to thee dear dick this tale i send both as a critic and a friend i tell it with some variation not altogether a translation from la fontaine an author dick whose muse would touch thee to the quick the subject is of that same kind to which thy heart seems most inclined how verse may alter it god knows thou love it well i am sure in prose so without preface or pretense to hold thee longer in suspense i shall proceed as i am able to the recital of my fable a goblin of the merry kind more black of hue than cursed of mind to help a lover in distress contrived a charm with such success that in short space the cruel dame relented and returned his flame the dargain made betwixt em both was bound by honor and by oath the lover laid down his salvation and satan staked his reputation the latter promised on his part to serve his friend and show his art that madam should by twelve a clock though hitherto as hard as rock become as gentle as a glove and kiss and coo like any dove in short the woman should be his that is upon condition  viz that he the lover after tasting what one would wish were everlasting should in return for such enjoyment supply the fiend with fresh employment that is all quoth pug my poor request is only never to have rest you thought it is like with reason too that i should have been served not you but what upon my friend impose no  though a devil none of those your business then pray understand me is nothing more but to command me of one thing only let me warn ye which somewhat nearly may concern ye as soon as ever one work is done strait name a new one and so on let each to other quick succeed or else  you know how it is agreed  for if through any hums or haws there haps an intervening pause in which for want of fresh commands your slave obsequious idle stands nor soul nor body ever more shall serve the nymph whom you adore but both be laid at satans feet to be disposed as he thinks meet at once the lover all approves for who can hesitate that loves and thus he argues in his thought why after all i venture naught what mystery is in commanding does that require much understanding indeed were my part to obey he would go the better of the lay but he must do what i think fit  pshaw pshaw young beelzebub is bit thus pleased in mind he calls a chair adjusts and combs and courts the fair the spell takes place and all goes right and happy he employs the night in sweet embraces balmy kisses and riots in the bliss of blisses o joy cried he that have no equal but hold  no raptures  mark the sequel for now when near the mornings dawn the youth began as twere to yawn his eyes a silky slumber seized or would have done if pug had pleased but that officious demon near now buzzed for business in his ear in haste he names a thousand things the goblin plys his wicker wings and in a trice returns to ask another and another task now palaces are built and towers the work of ages in few hours then storms are in an instant raised which the next moment are appeased now showers of gold and gems are rained as if each india had been drained and he in one astonished view sees both golconda and peru these things and stranger things than these were done with equal speed and ease and now to rome poor pug he will send and pug soon reached his journeys end and soon returned with such a pack of bulls and pardons at his back that now the squire who had some hope in holy water and the pope was out of heart and at a stand what next to wish and what command invention flags his brain grows muddy and black despair succeeds brown study in this distress the woeful youth acquaints the nymph with all the truth begging her counsel for whose sake both soul and body were at stake and is this all replys the fair let me alone to cure this care when next your demon shall appear pray give him  look what i hold here and bid him labor soon or late to lay these ringlets lank and strait then something scarcely to be seen her finger and her thumb between she held and sweetly smiling cried your goblins skill shall now be tried she said and gave  what shall i call that thing so shining crisp and small which round his finger strove to twine a tendril of the cyprian vine or sprig from cythereas grove shade of the labyrinth of love with awe he now takes from her hand that fleecelike flower of fairy land less precious whilom was the fleece which drew the argonauts from greece or that which modern ages see the spur and prize of chivalry whose curls of kindred texture grace heroes and kings of spanish race the spark prepared and pug at hand he issues thus his strict command this line thus curve and thus orbicular render direct and perpendicular but so direct that in no sort it ever may in rings retort see me no more till this be done hence to thy task  avaunt be gone away the fiend like lightning flys and all his wit to work applys anvils and presses he employs and dins whole hell with hammring noise in vain he to no terms can bring one twire of that reluctant thing the elastic fiber mocks his pains and it is first spiral form retains new stratagems the sprite coves and down the depths of sea he dives this sprunt its pertness sure will lose when laid said he to soak in ooze poor foolish fiend he little knew whence venus and her garden grew old ocean with paternal waves the child of his own bed receives which often as dipped new force exerts and in more vigorous curls reverts so when to earth alcides flung the huge anteus whence he sprung from every fall fresh strength he gained and with new life the fight maintained the bafled goslin grows perplexed nor knows what slight to practice next the more he trys the more he fails nor charm nor art nor force avails but all concur his shame to show and more exasperate the foe and now he pensive turns and sad and looks like melancholic mad he rolls his eyes now off now on that wonderful phenomenon sometimes he twists and twirls it round then pausing meditates profound no end he sees of his surprise nor what it should be can devise for never yet was wool or feather that could stand buff against all weather and unrelaxd like this resist both wind and rain and snow and mist what stuff or whence or how twas made what spinster witch could spin such thread he nothing knew but to his cost knew all his fame and labor lost subdued abashed he gave it over it is said he blushed it is sure he swore not all the wiles that hell could hatch could conquer that superb mustach defeated thus thus discontent back to the man the demon went i grant quoth he our contract null and give you a discharge in full but tell me now in name of wonder since i so heartily knock under what is this thing where could it grow pray take it  it is in statu quo much good mayt do you for my part i wash my hands often from my heart in truth sir goblin or sir fairy replys the lad youre too soon weary what leave this trifling task undone and think thou this the only one alas were this subdued thou would find millions of more such still behind which might employ even to eternity both you and all your whole fraternity the peasant in search of his heifer a tale after m de la fontaine it so befell a silly swain had sought his heifer long in vain for wanton she had frisking strayed and left the lawn to seek the shade around the plain he rolls his eyes then to the wood in haste he hies where singling out the fairest tree he climbs in hopes to hear or see anon there chanced that way to pass a jolly lad and buxom lass the place was apt the pastime pleasant occasion with her forelock present the girl agog the gallant ready so lightly down he lays my lady but so she turned or so was said that she some certain charms displayed which with such wonder struck his sight with wonder much more with delight that loud he cried in rapture what what see i gods what see i not but nothing named from whence it is guessed twas more than well could be expressed the clown aloft who lent an ear strait stopped him short in mid career and louder cried ho honest friend that of thy seeing see no end do see the heifer that i seek if do pray be so kind to speak finis
