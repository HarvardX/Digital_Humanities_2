years the design of this abstract is to teach a person acquainted with english how to speak and write correctly without entering into all the minutiae of grammar which serve only to perplex and confound the author aims not at teaching his pupil what words are particles what prepositions and so on but merely to avoid false concords and incorrect language and he flatters himself the few following pages will answer all the purposes better than more complete or regular systems he has also added some few rules for reading which if attended to must lead to reading well  abstract of english grammar of the denomination of words the only words necessary to be known grammatically are nouns pronouns adjectives verbs adverbs and participles  a noun is the name of a thing as horse boat knife etc  a pronoun is a substitute for a noun as i he she etc  an adjective expresses the quality of a noun as a sound horse an open boat a sharp knife here sound open and sharp are verbs  a verb implies the action of the noun and an adverb the action of the verb as the horse gallops the boat sails the knife cuts here galloping is the action of the horse sailing the action of the boat and cutting the action of the knife of course gallops sails and cuts are verbs  an adverb expresses the action of the verb thus the horse gallops quick the boat sails briskly the knife cuts badly here quick expresses the action of galloping briskly that of sailing and badly that of cutting of course quick briskly and badly are adverbs that is addition to verbs  a participle partakes of the qualities of both noun and verb and implies acting or being acted on  these are the different parts of speech i would wish my pupil to be acquainted with i will treat of them in their order  of nouns nouns substantives are the general names o things except proper names which are particular ones a horse for example is a general name it may be my horse or yours so is a boat a knife etc but proper names are particular ones as thomas the name of a man jolly the name of a horse etc horse boat knife etc then are nouns  nouns have two numbers the singular and the plural  the singular number expresses an individual as a horse a boat a knife the plural expresses many as horses boats knives etc  in other languages nouns have a variety of cases that is vary in their terminations but in english there are but two these correspond with the genitive and accusative thus instead of the head of a horse we say a horses head not horses which is the plural number of horse but horses which we call the genitive case singular so boats knifes as the boats side the knifes edge  plurals ending in s have no genitive cases we write womens not womens mens not mens and so on  no nouns have accusative cases but pronouns these vary their terminations when they follow or are acted upon by verbs  i preceding a verb is changed to me when following one  we to us thou to thee or you ye to you he to him she to her they to them who to whom thus we say  i love you i here precedes the verb love but i could not follow the same verb with propriety it would be rendered me we should not say you love i but you love me so again  thou love me i love thee thou before the verb thee after it  we love god god loves us and so on  the words who and whom require a little further explanation we say kings are personages whom we revere here though in the present mode of speech whom precedes the verb revere it is nevertheless used in the accusative case being the word which the verb revere governs and acts upon answering to them when we say we revere them so in the following example william was the person who came to me here the pronoun who precedes the verb came and governs it william was the person to whom i spoke here whom though it precedes or is placed before the verb spoke to render it more agreeable to the ear is governed or acted on by it  english nouns are then thus declined none having accusative cases but the pronouns  sing horse genesis horses plur horses sing boat genesis boats plur boats  note the genitive case implies of or belonging to  the word whose is sometimes used as the genitive of which and chiefly in poetry    the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world milton but of which is now most common the matters of which i spoke though whose may be used with propriety when it refers to persons as this is the young woman whose worth i know  the genitive of the other pronouns are as follow  i genesis mine or my thou genesis thine or thy he genesis his she genesis hers we genesis ours or our ye genesis yours or your they genesis theirs or their it genesis its  mine thine ours yours or theirs may be used without a noun annexed but my thy our your their never thus whose book is this the answer may be mine or thine or ours or yours or theirs alone but if we use my thy our your or their we must add the noun book to it a say my book thy book our book your book or their book  when the word own is added to the pronouns my thy his hers our your or their it is to render the expression more emphatical as i live in my own house i did it with my own hand etc  the plural number is formed by adding s at the end of the singular number as in the following  sing plur sing plur house houses table tables walk walks sister sisters stool stools outrage outrages etc lance lances  but there are some exceptions to this general rule as the following irregular plurals will show  sing plur sing plur loaf loaves foot feet calf calves church churches shelf shelves fish fishes half halves box boxes self selves ox oxen sheaf sheaves man men thief thieves sow swine wife wives child children wolf wolves brother brethren knife knives woman women louse lice penny pence mouse mice body bodies die dice mercy mercies goose geese enemy enemies tooth teeth witness witnesses etc and this these that those  the singular and plural of some few words are the same as sheep deer fern hose in which case the singular number is pointed out by a going before them as a sheep a deer  some words also have no singular number as annals arms ashes bellows breeches cresses entrails ides lungs means nones scissars sheers snuffers thanks tongs wages dregs news etc  proper names of men cities rivers countries etc have no plurals this rule however is not without some exceptions we say there were ten williams in company and when speaking of families we say the marlboroughs the cavendishes the howards etc  i can at no better time mention the proper use of the pronouns who which and what as interrogatives or not  who is used only when speaking of persons as  who is that man or that woman which when we speak of things as  which is your cane what when we are speaking of the kind quality or order of persons or things as  what lady is that  what house is this  what or which place do you choose  when who and which are not interrogatives that is do not ask a question they are used with the same distinction that is who for persons and which for things we say william was the person who came to me this is the horse which i bought  now we are upon the subject of nouns it is proper to say something of gender  there are three genders the male female and neuter  the male and female distinguish the two sexes whereas the neuter is applied to things without life as not properly belonging to either of the other as table stne rock etc  when we speak of the male gender we use the pronoun he when of the female gender she when of the neuter it thus the bridegroom he came from the barn the bride she came in from the field the table it fell on the floor   we indeed deem most things that contain any thing within them to be of the female gender as the earth a ship a house etc and in poetry where writers will frequently give slight to their fancy and personify inanimate substances they are deemed o the male or female gender according to the idea of the poet thus death time the sun etc are generally of the male gender faith hope charity etc of the female as being of the softer virtues  but our language in many instances save us the necessity of adding pronouns to express genders for we often distinguish the different sexes by distinct words as for example  male female male female father mother sloven slut husband wife man woman brother sister rake jilt uncle aunt boar sow widower widow buck do master mistress cock hen nephew niece dog bitch wizzard witch drake duck bachelor maid or virgin gander goose horse mare bridegroom bride ram ewe whoremonger whore or strumpet steer heifer boy girl bull cow king queen lad lass lord lady duke duchess milter spawner etc  there are also some few words which distinguish the female sex from the male by the ending male female male female abbot abbess shepherd shepherdess actor actress executor executrix baron baroness administrator aministratrix heir heiress prior prioress etc lion lioness  where there are no words to distinguish the sexes we frequently add one to answer the purpose thus we say a malechild a femalechild a hegoat a shegoat a man servant a maidservant a cocksparrow a hensparrow or the like  of adjectives adjectives are words which cannot stand alone but are added to nouns to express their quality as black white wise foolish round square etc thus we say a black dog a wise man a round table  there are three degrees of adjectives called degrees of comparison the positive comparative and superlative    the positive degree is the quality itself simply as black white wise etc   the comparative expresses more of any one thing than another and is formed by adding er to the positive as blacker whiter wiser sometimes instead of saying blacker we say more black for white more white for wiser more wise etc   the superlative degree implies the highest and is formed y the termination es or the  most before the positive thus blackest  black whitest or most white wisest or mo  some superlatives are formed by adding  most as a termination thus nether  outer outermost under undermost upper uppermost in inner innermost etc  many adjectives do not admit of comparison by terminations but are only compared by more and most as benevolent more benevolent most benevolent some authors have used shadiest virtuousest famousest mortalest naturallest powerfullest inventivest triflingest etc but these are liberties which every one cannot take and are inelegant after all  some again are irregularly compared as  positive compar superl good better best bad worse worst little less least near nearer nearest much more most late later last  indeed the comparison of adjectives is very uncertain and being much regulated by the ear or agreeableness of sounds cannot well be reduced to rules  when a noun is substituted for an adjective and added to another noun by hyphen  such two words are called compound words as turkeyleather mountainwine manservant seafish etc  of verbs verbs as i observed express the action of nouns  a verb is said to have several moods and tenses we shall have occasion only to name the infinitive mood which is known by the word to preceding it as to love to hate etc and two of the tenses the present and the past these two are expressed by terminations the other tenses are expressed  the auxiliary verbs shall will and have precedin them of course it is not necessary to mention ther as we have nothing to do but with the right use words themselves  the present time or tense is expressed by the ve itself as burn love hate the past time by the termination ed as burned loved hated  a verb has also three persons  st  d and   and like nouns two numbers singular and plur  the three persons in the singular of verbs are thou and he or she in the plural we ye a they thus persons present tense singular   i love   thou love   he or she loves or love plural   we love   ye love   they love past time singular   i loved   thou lovedst   he or she loved plural   we loved   ye loved   they loved infinitive mood to love participle present loving  past loved  there are two sorts of verbs active and passive  love is a verb active to be loved a verb passive  still according to my first definition of a verb  love or be loved implies the action of the person ving  the passive verb is formed by the addition of the xiliary or assisting verb to be thus in the prent tense or time sing i am thou art he or she is plur we are or be ye are or be they are or be past tense or time sing i was thou wast or was he or she was plur we were ye were they were participle present being  past having been infinitive mood to be  now by adding the word love to each it will  thus i am loved thou wast loved he was loved etc and so through the whole   the other auxiliary verbs are have shall will  may can have being the principal we will  through the tenses of this  present tense or time sing i have thou have he or she has or has plur we have ye have they have past tense sing i had thou had he or she had plur we had ye had they had participle present having  past had infinitive mood to have  there is still another form of english ver in which the sign of the infinitive mood to added to the verb do which it is necessary to learn  present tense sing i do thou do he or she does plur we do ye do they do past tense sing i did thou did he or she did plur we did ye did they did  in the subsequent tenses did is changed to do i have done i had done etc  infinitive mood to do or to have done participle present doing  past done  by rapid utterance or poetical contraction love is often used for loved snatched for snatch dwelt for dwelled smelt for smelled and so on  but not to multiply rules and burden the learners memory with terms the following list of regular verbs in their present and past tenses w be sufficient to instruct these he should well member  present time past participle awake awoke awoke abide abode abode be been being been bend bent bent bear bore bare borne begin began begun present time past participle bereave bereft bereft beseech besought besought beat beat beaten beat bind bound bound bite bit bitten bleed bled blooded bled blow blew blown break broke broken breed bred bred bring brought brought buy bought bought catch caught catched caught chide chid chidden

thought thrive throve thriven throw threw thrown tread trod trodden weep wept wept win won won wind wound wound wear wore worn weave wove woven write wrote writ written writ work worked wrought wrought wring wrung wrung  these rules premised the great art in writing and speaking correctly is to avoid false concords that is the singular number must never be coupled with the plural etc also   the noun or pronoun and the verb following it must be of the same number and person we must not say i were i being the first person were the second but i am both in the first person neither should we say thou were thou being singular and were plural but thou were both singular   we must take care to use the proper word to express the right time whether it be present or past in the irregular verbs the foregoing list will point out the word in the regular ones the termination ed will always express the past time thus for example we must not say he breaked the bowl but broke it not he come home but came   in the use of the words this and that which in the plural number are these and those we must take care that they agree with the number of he word they refer to we must not say this men or that men the one being singular the other plural but this or that man these or those men but where a noun has no singular number we may add this or that to the plural of such words thus we may say with propriety by this or that means so nouns wanting a singular number are sometimes joined to a verb singular but inelegantly as the news is stae your wages is small   two or more names or things in the singular number require the verb to be in the plural thus william and john are not is good lads the sun and wind overcame not overcome me   names of a multitude may have either a singular or a plural verb thus we may say the parliament is or are sitting   when two or more nouns of different numbers follow each other with the word or or nor between them and are equally related to a common verb the verb should agree with the noun next it for example either the husband the wife or their children are in the house neither the husband the children nor the wife is in the house   two negatives make an affirmative i was not good for nothing implies it was good so something i cannot eat no more means can eat more   the participle present is frequently substituted for the ininitive mood of a verb and with elegance thus instead of i like to work we may say i like working for he delights to walk we may say he delights in walking   after the auxiliary verb have it would be improper to put the past time the participle should always follow thus it would be ingrammatica to say i have saw or i have wrote it should be i have seen or i have written  0 when the leading adverbs are whether o either or must follow in the same sentence where the leading adverb is neither nor must follow thus whether you or i shall go is not yet determined either your or i must ride neither you nor i must speak    all repetitions of the same word nay of words which express the same thing are carefully to voided except when the sense would be otherwise obscure or when it is to excite the attention for example a repetition of the word from in the following sentence is allowable the passage would not be clear without it it proceeds not from stupidity or a slothful neglect but from a generous liberality of soul when it is to excite attention a repetition is beautiful every action nay every attention every design of man is known to the almighty    with respect to adjectives none should be used but such as are necessary to explain the subject more fully to say burning or shining fire is inelegant because the first idea of fire is that it burns and shines but if necessary we may employ adjectives to express its other qualities as consuming sparkling brisk etc   in short the words of a sentence ought generally to be as different from one another both in sense and sound as the nature of the subject and the harmony of the period will admit on this the beauty of a sentence depends the sound being as it were an echo to the sense and independent of this on the smoothness of the words the choice of adjectives and the easy flow of its diction and in general the shorter the period the more nervous and emphatical it is  an observation or two on writing and reading in writing never use capital letters to begin a word unless it be a proper name or at the beginning of a sentence note a full stop or note of admiration  or interrogation  always ends a sentence  if you quote an author in his own words always begin the quotation with a capital letter  the word i or oh should be always written with a capital every word you wish to mark as emphatic should begin with a capital and have a line drawn under it thus mark  in order to read well   every one should read in an easy familiar tone as if he were speaking expect it be a prayer in which case a degree of solemnity is required and should adapt his voice to the subject matter he is reading   when reading cast your eye forwards to the words following that you may have seen them before you are to pronounce them this will prevent stammering or a disagreeable pause   attend to the stops and pause at a comma  whilst you can count one at a semicolon  two at a colon  three and at a full stop  four notes of interrogation  and admiration  are full stops a line thus  intimates a longer pause than that of full stop and at every fresh paragraph we are to pause longer still   never fetch or draw the breath where there is no stop nor pass a stop without a pause pause proportionably at every stop utter each word distinctly sound the last letter of every word read slow and you will read very intelligibly   in reading a sentence the voice should be gently raised until you get to the middle and the middle of a sentence is generally marked with a colon and then should gradually fall to the end of it but take care that at the end of a sentence you drop not the voice too low so as not to be well heard to the last word   in questions and passages of admiration the voice should not fall as at a full stop but be kept up higher and higher to the end   to give spirit and energy to a sentence the leading or principal word should be pronounced emphatically to find out which is the emphatical word consider the chief design of the writer and that word which shows such design most is the word to be uttered emphatically   when a noun is the emphatical word and attended with an adjective the stroke of the voice should be on the noun and the adjective be only swelled unless it appears that the stress is to be laid on the adjective the emphatic words in the following passage are printed in italics  hail source of beings universal soul of heaven and earth essential presence hail but where two words are set in opposition to each other and one is pronounced emphatically the other should be so too as in the sentence if they attack we will attack for our cause is as good as theirs  the emphasis is of such importance in reading and speaking that wrong placing it may alter the sense materially the following line is an old example upon this subject  will you ride to town today  by laying the emphasis on will the answer may be yes or no  by laying it on you the answer may be  no but my son will  by laying it on ride the answer may be i intend to walk  by placing it on the word town the answer may be no i shall ride to my farm  and laying it on today the answer may be not until tomorrow  last of all lay no emphasis on words where there should none be laid for this is as great a mark of ignorance as not laying it where it should be laid  rules for reading english verse  the general rule is to pronounce it as if it were prose but with more deliberation to observe the stops with great exactness placing the accent whe it ought to be placed as will be shown hereafter and the emphasis upon the proper words on each line though there should be no stop at the end of the line the reader should pause whilst he can count one merely to give notice to the hearer that the line is ended and if the last word will bear two sounds as words ending in y will give it tha which chymes best with its sister line i mean that line with which it is designed to rhyme  for example  were i but once from bondage free i would never sell my liberty here ty in liberty is sounded as tee but in the following line it should be sounded as ti  my soul ascends above the sky and triumphs in her liberty however whether pronounced as tee or ti the last syllable should be so feebly uttered as not to fix any stop or accent upon it  if verse be read with the above attention and still sound harsh upon the ear the fault is not in the reader but the poet for those verses are not well penned that cannot be read gracefully by the common rules of pronunciation  in verses of three syllables the accent is to be placed on the  st and  d thus here we may think and pray ere that death stops our breath   in verses of four syllables the accent is to be placed on the  d and  th thus with ravished ears the monarch hears dryden  in verses of six syllables on every other syllable thus though in the utmost peak awhile we do remain amongst the mountains bleak exposed to sleet or rain no sport nor hours shall break to exercise our vein drayton  in verses of seven syllables in the  st  d  th and  th thus fairest piece of wellformd earth urge not thus your haughty birth   in those of eight which is the usual measure of short poems on the  d  th  th and  th thus and may at last my weary age find out the peaceful hermitage milton  in those of ten which is heroic or tragic poetry on the  d  th  th  th and  0th thus confused and chiding like the hollow roar of tides receding from the insulted shore dryden  in those of twelve syllables on every other syllable beginning with the  d  of all the cambrian shires their heads that bea so high and farthst survey their soils with an ambitiou eye mervinia for her hills as for their matchles crowds the nearest that are said to kiss the wandering clouds especial audience craves offended with the throng that she of all the rest neglected was so long drayton in those of fourteen as in those of twelve thus and as the mind of such a man that has a long way gone and either knows not his way or else would let alone his purposed journey is distract chapman the verse of fourteen syllables is now broken inalternate lines of eight and six thus when all shall praise and every lay devote a wreath to thee that day for come it will that day shall i lament to see   the alexandrine verse of twelve syllables is now  used to diversify heroic lines of ten thus waller was smooth but dryden taught to join the varying verse the fullresounding line the long majestic march  and energy divine   in pronouncing this line of twelve syllables the ce must pause at the end of the sixth  in verses of quick measure the words are acted as below  may i govern my passions with absolute sway and grow wiser and better as lise wears away so again diogenes surly and proud i think not of iris nor iris of me   so in verses with double rhymes they neither added nor confounded they neither wanted nor abounded twas when the seas were roaring with hollow blasts of wind
