mr whistons letter of thanks to the right reverend the lord bishop of london for his late letter to his clergy against the use of new forms of doxology etc  london printed for j senex at the globe in salisburycourt and w tailor at the ship in paternoster row and are to be sold by j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane       the first clause of a letter from the lord bishop of london to the incumbents of all churches and chapels in his diocese concerning their not using any new forms of doxology etc reverend brethren there is an instance of your care and duty which i conceive my self at this time highly obliged to offer and you to regard as necessary for the preservation of the very foundations of our faith some persons seduced i fear by the strong delusions of pride and selfconceit have lately published new forms of doxology entirely agreeable to those of some ancient heretics who impiously denied a trinity of persons in the unity of the godhead i do therefore warn and charge it upon your souls as you hope to obtain mercy from god the father through the merits of jesus christ our lord and by the sanctification of the holy ghost three persons and one god blessed for ever that you employ your best endeavors to prevail with your several flocks to have a great abhorrence for the above mentioned new forms and particularly that you do not suffer the same to be used either in your churches or in any schools where you are able to prevent that most pernicious abuse etc  mr whistons letter of thanks etc my lord although i have not the honor of being one of those incumbents in your lordships diocese to whom you immediately direct your late letter against the use of new forms of doxology etc yet because i generally frequent one of your parish churches where a new form of doxology is every day used vid historical pref edit   p         where yet according to your lordships laudable admonition i dissent from that new form of doxology and use an old one because i several years ago at cambridge opposed that new and therefore by the same excellent rule unjustifiable form of doxology i cannot but think it very fit for me to own the great pleasure your lordships caution against new forms of doxology has given me and in my own name and in the name of many other good christians who with me reject all such new forms of doxology whatsoever i return your lordship this public thanks for your so open approbation of our conduct in this matter  i take it here for granted my lord that your lordship is in earnest in this letter that by new forms of doxology therein disapproved without any particular mention of the forms themselves you truly mean such as arose long since the beginning of the gospel that also by new forms of doxology entirely agreeable to those of some ancient heretics your lordship particularly means those new forms which were introduced by certain heretics in the fourth century though your lordship seems indeed unhappily to have mistaken their name and character  i take it also for granted my lord that it is impossible for a christian and a protestant bishop both which your lordship is known to be to call the ancient and sacred doxologies of st paul st peter st john st jude etc with those of the rest of the most primitive christians new forms of doxology entirely agreeable to those of some ancient heretics and upon this reasonable supposition i do again return your lordship my most hearty thanks for so seasonable and christian a caution against the modern gross and notorious corruption of this kind  now that this solemn caution of your lordships against all new forms of doxology may have the greater regard paid to it by all the clergy of your diocese i shall beg leave to supply what seems wanting in your lordships letter and shall produce here all the certainly genuine forms of doxology that upon a former diligent enquiry i met with in the apostolic age or a little later and that your lordship may be secure that none of them shall be liable to the lea suspicion of favoring any dangerous opinions that arose in the fourth century your lordship will there find that the latest of them is near two hundred years older than the rise of either the arian or athanasian heresies and i hope this account may be farther useful to your lordships clergy as affording them for practice sure original positive rules or forms of doxology free from all suspicion of heretical pravity which also your lordship has entirely omitted to give them in your letter  the primitive doxologies romans i    more

are as i understand them all directed immediately to the father or to the father through the son of the three in peter two are directed as those in paul to the father or to the father through the son and the other is expressly and only directed to jesus christ himself the single one in jude is directed only to the father of the six in the apocalypse of john three are directed to the father alone one to the son alone and the other two to the father and to the son jointly so that in the sacred writing owned to be canonical the holy ghost  never mentioned in doxologies at all an the son not often any otherwise than as the mediator clements eight and the apostl six doxologies also in clements epistle an former six books of the constitutions ar exactly like those of paul entirely directe to the father or to the father through the son without any mention of the holy ghost the public doxologies of the jewish and gentile liturgies contained in the seventh an eighth books of the constitutions are directed sometimes to the father alone sometimes to the father through the son and the re that we have reason to believe incorrupt to the father and the son in the holy ghost especially in the celebration of the sacramen of the lords supper when the church di rather more solemnly mention the holy ghost than upon any other occasion the certain one in polycarps prayer before his martyrdom is in eusebiuss copy which is the best to the father through and with the son in the holy ghost see primitive christianity revived vol iv append p    nb here a common mistake is to b rectified as if in those doxologies whera the supreme god the father had been mentioned or worshipped through jesus christ t whom glory is immediately ascribed in the usual form of doxologies that to whom related to jesus christ and not to god the father as if upon an occasional mention of the mediator by whom our devotions are offered he great object of them were immediately o be forgotten by us and all the glory conind to the mediator alone this seems to me a gross mistake yet is it i doubt a very ommon one the first doxology in peter before inserted when well considered will help to cure this error among christians  vid ubi supr p     and now after these really ancient and chritian doxologies give me leave my lord to present you and your clergy with the doxologies of athanasius

council of nice and not a few afterward also were the same that has so long been called arian i mean that of in and not to or with the holy spirit and that athanasius sometimes afterward used the one way of speaking as well as the other just as basil did also and as the present copies of the liturgy in the eighth book of the constitutions do still exhibit it to us while it appears by other evidence and by basils own accounts that no other than that esteemed the arian form of in the holy spirit can lay sure claim to any public original or sacred authority in the church  note   that basil has a full and remarkable de spiritu sancto ad amphilochium discourse upon this subject a short summary of which only because of its length i shall here give the reader as highly worthy of his serious consideration upon this occasion  basil then was accused by those that disliked the late notions and practices brought into the church that he had ventured to alter the old christian doxology as to the particle in which used to be given to the holy ghost and that he often made use of and or with instead of it as if glory and honor and adoration were to be not only ascribed to the father and to the son in the holy ghost or by his assistance but also directly to the holy ghost himself as to a proper object of christian adoration or doxology in answer to which he owns that the form in the holy ghost is indeed certainly the ancient and undoubted christian form of doxology and that he will sometimes make use of it still accordingly that however the other forms and or with if they be not really genuine and original in doxologies which yet he would willingly insinuate they have however been used upon other occasions indifferently that even in doxologies he is not the first that has used those particles concerning the holy ghost but that several great men had done the like before him at least since the beginning of the third century as he proves by particular instances and that he therefore looks upon it as a piece of arian or heretical inclination to be so scrupulous of keeping to this one old particle in out of opposition to those that would show their orthodoxy by the use of the other particles and or with the holy ghost this is the purport of basils reasoning in this case and i own that if prudentials must govern and christians are at liberty to make themselves a new object of direct invocation or doxology from remote inferences of their own and out of compliance with a prevailing party basil may be in the right as well as those that follow him in these matters but if divine worship is only to be given in such a manner and to such objects as divine institution ordains he and all the athanasians run a great hazard in such matters and must have a heavy account to give of this their rash and unjustifiable and unchristian procedure at the great day vid collection of monuments p         the former doxologies my lord and many of the latter also are for certain the old the christian the apostolical doxologies some centuries before arius or arthanasius were known in the world by which men gave glory and praise to god the father the fountain and origin of all beings whatsoever together with or through the mediation of jesus christ his onlybegotten son and by the aid and assistance of his holy spirit  and that your lordship does fully approve of this ancient way of worship and doxology is plain by your own excellent and remarkable words to the very same purpose which indeed describe exactly the manner of christian worship in the three first centuries i do warn and charge it upon your souls says your lordship to your clergy as you hope to obtain mercy from god the father through the merits of jesus christ our lord and by the sanctification of the holy ghost  i omit the strange clause that is added  this till hereafter but the words before  are so truly christian so very primitive  perfectly apostolical that i heartily wish you lordship may ever remember them and a your clergy may never forget them  but then my lord that form which ascrib glory and praise equal glory and praise not  the son only but also to the holy spirit is for certain a new form of doxology such as you lordship justly condems wholly unknow to the apostles and all the first christian for a long time and never properly settl or submitted to till those dangerous innovtors in christianity athanasius and his adhrents were become of greater authority tha st paul and his fellow apostles and till indeed at length our lords own grand fundamental joh xvii   this is life eternal to know thee t only true god and jesus christ whom thou ha sent was obliged to give place to the contrary fundamental of even a counterfeit athnasius that athanasian creed we must worship one god in trinty and trinity in unity where none is supposed before or after other none to be great or less than another but the whole three persons are asserted to be coeternal together and cequal where this author also solemnly affirm that this strange and new doctrine is the ctholick faith which except a man believe faitfully he cannot be saved  but now my lord does it not evident appear on the comparison of the form doxologies with the later that they we neither the arians nor eusebians but the athanasians that introduced a new form  doxology into the church both athanas and basil as we have seen bear frequent teimony to the undoubted forms of more priitive antiquity and particularly that they en glorified the father by or with the son and always in or by the holy ghost while at e same time the athanasians also ventured oldly against the very nature of the christi religion and worship to introduce this oxology directly to the holy spirit which orm can hardly be traced with certainty any higher than that fourth century basil eserves to be particularly taken notice of  this point who had not dared ever to ll the holy ghost god for fear as nazianz op p    nazianen assures us in his funeral oration that ose who sought to catch this plain word out of is mouth concerning the holy ghost that he  god might procure his and his theological ongues banishment out of the city nay who was so hard set in his innovations that he was once obliged to say what is now esteemd by our law next to blaspemy that basil op tom i p    he as not god but the spirit of god and yet was at last affrighted with the dread of committing the unpardonable sin if he did not upport this new form of doxology tom ii p    to the holy ghost  but now my lord amidst my thanks for your lordships caution against new forms of doxology and my joy for your excellent clause agreeing with the old ones i must expostulate with you about your surprising and unaccountable addition to that excellent cllause where after the mention of god the father of jesus christ our lord and of the holy ghost you add three persons and one god blessed for ever it is i say to me in a christian bishop at this time of day a surprising and unaccountable addition i had indeed in my younger years been by the custom of modern writers betrayed into such a fatal mistake my self as if the three divine persons were one god or the one go of the christian religion but as soon as ever i had searched the scriptures and the ancient christian creeds and writers i wa fully convinced of the grossness of that mistake and have hardly been able to believe since that examination that any who have carefully read the new testament the ol creeds and other books of our religion before the days of athanasius can now seriouly use or justify such language and her my lord it may not be improper to repea to your lordship the offer which i formerl made to dr sacheverell when at his famou trial he had ranked me among the blaphemers the irreligious and the heretic because among other things i had in a erratum desired that such an expression  mine as your lordship here uses might b blotted out which offer i give your lordship as well as dr sacheverell full right  call me to justify in any fair and open wa whatsoever my words there are these  since i have thoroughly enquired into it  am so fully satisfied that the father alone  the one god of the christian religion tha i must now own that when once i deny  doubt of that doctrine i must deny or doub of our common christianity there being n one article more plain or more universall acknowledged in all the first ages of the church than that was and here i ventu solemnly to challenge dr sacheverell himself and all his more learned friends to prduce one single direct testimony of any christian and catholic writer excepting one or two expressions of tertullian contrary even to his own usual way of speaking if yet he can be called a catholic writer who said these three persons were one god or the one god before the days of athanasius in the fourth century while i am ready to produce above an hundred plain testimonies on the other side that this one god is no other than god the father which indeed was the first doctrine which the catechumens learned and the grand foundation of our whole religion  historical preface p     this my lord is the plain old form of peaking as to the father that he is alone he one true god of the christian religion which makes it strange that a christian bihop who is against new forms of doxology and must be supposed to know christian aniquity well should use the other new form of speaking that the three persons are one god without a single authority in all the bible or almost in any truly ancient christian writer whomsoever  but now my lord though i have hitherto gone upon the favorable hypothesis and have returned your lordship thanks on the supposition that your lordship really means what you say and are by consequence thro against the common new form of doxoogy which seems to be designed to give equal glory to the father to the son and to the holy ghost yet i cannot conceal the shrewd suspicion not a few of your readers have entertained that although your lordship declares against new forms of doxology yet you are or perhaps one of the newest forms of doxology in the world which is the common one they suspect that you look on the old form made use of by st paul st peter st john s jude etc to be superannuated to be ver mean and imperfect if not in some degre heretical that you apprehend if any incumbents in your diocese should use none bu such doxologies as the apostles used the foundations of our faith would be in danger nay if any incumbents should desire to folow the apostles doxologies only in the singing psalms established by no law of the state nor canon of the church and where by consequence such forms seem hitherto tolerated you fear they are seduced by the stron delusions of pride and selfconceit and tha you esteem such forms themselves entirely greeable to those of some ancient heretics tha you warn your clergy and charge it upon the souls that they employ their best endeavou to prevail with their several flocks to have  great abhorrence of such new forms and n to suffer them to be used either in churches  schools which is they say here styled a mo pernicious abuse  now in answer to these suspicious person my lord i can only allege how prodigously absurd it is once to imagine this to b your lordships meaning because it is in  manner to suppose you thus speaking to you clergy  my brethren have a great care of bibl presidents new testament language apostolic prayers and scripture doxologies they will lead you at length into the mo pernicious heresies the bible indeed sti calls god the father and him alone the on true god of the christian religion in distinction from his son and his spirit the new testament still directs the solemn and supreme christian worship to the same one true god the father through the mediation of the son and by the assistance of the holy spirit the apostles tell us that christ himself said joh xiv    the father was greater than he and that matt xxiv    mar xiii    he did not know the day and hour of the future judgment while he was on earth till it was revealed to him by the father afterward and that the apoc i   v   father alone then knew it and they never once call the holy spirit god never once mention any invocation to him the known scripture doxologies never say one word concerning the holy ghost nor do the apostles other records appear ever to make him a distinct object of such doxology this is all true to a demonstration and undeniable in all christian antiquity but have the greatest care possible my brethren of following such examples heretics always pretend to scripture and they that keep closest to it are usually the most inclined to heresy such doctrines and practices as i have just now mentioned were at first more innocent before athanasius improved christianity and basil with several others gave good reasons for those improvements you are now to do as the church bids you and call the three persons jointly the one true god you are to adore the son equally with the father you must believe that the father is not greater than the son and that the son ever knew the day and hour of the future judgment you must expressly call the holy ghost god as well as the father and invocate him equally with the father and the son you must give glory to the father and t the son and to the holy ghost as being al three consubstantial coeternal and coequal the church indeed does think fit t tolerate or rather to excuse different language notions and practices in the apostles and the first christians because of their primitive simplicity and because she ha not then made any other laws about those matters but now the case is quite otherwise latet anguis in herba and what was excusabl in st paul will be plainly heretical in suc as dr c or mr w i conjure you therefore my brethren by all that is sacred that you avoid and reject such antiquate doctrines and practices those perniciou new forms of doxology in particular which the apostles used and which the forementioned dangerous persons would revive among us you have the glorious example of   00 or   00 years even ever since popery began for your encouragement and you need not scruple to charge those doxologies with novelty that can plead for themselves no more than the doctrine and practice of the apostles and their companions and of the three or four first and simplest ages of christianity  this my lord seems to be the plain purport of the principal branch of your lordships letter to your clergy in the opinion of these suspicious persons and this sets the matter in so clear a light that i hope i will be impossible to mistake it and equally impossible to suspect that to be your lordships meaning without supposing you to acknowledge before all the world that the church has an authority far superior to that of he apostles of our lord christ which cerainly is beyond the length of moderate poery it self however many of your lordhips friends will certainly be in great pain ill they hear farther from your lordship and indeed till they find that it will not be nsafe for christians in your lordships dioese to imitate the apostles and that if st paul st peter st john and st jude were ere and insisted upon the use of their old doxologies they would not by your lordship be discouraged or at least would not be enyd what we also hope will not be denied is that follow their example i mean an oen toleration in this matter  i freely own my lord the great dignity of your lordships episcopal office and can never be suspected by those that know me and my opinions of any wilful or criminal disrespect thereto i also heartily acknowledge the great regard that is justly due to the pastoral instructions of christian bishops when they enforce any parts of christian duty upon their clergy or their flocks in which case i should greatly rejoice to be any way instrumental in forwarding the same but if stead thereof the sacred episcopal character and authority be used to discourage any duties of christianity i and all sober christians must constantly act iv    hearken to god more than to men must   timothy i    hold fast the apostolical form of sound words and the jude ver   faith once delivered to the saints against all worldly solicitations threats authorities and terrors whatsoever for the apostle paul assures us that even such as he   cor xiii   could do nothing against the truth but for the truth that x   xiii  0 their power was for edification and not for destruction that   cor l    they had no dominion over the faith  christians and that gal i     if they or even an ang from heaven preached any other than christ own gospel they were to be accursed i am m lord so far as the christian religion permit  your lordships most humble and obedient servant william whistor jan          ps if your lordship insists on the common form of doxology glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost you cannon possibly avoid altering the usual response  it was in the beginning is now and ever shall b world without end because it will not then b consistent with truth for how much soev the church may pretend to a power of alteri and improving the old christian religion an christian doxologies yet did she never i da say pretend to a power of altering the natu of things and rendering an ancient fact tru which was certainly false so that she cannon possibly oblige men to say that in using the doxology they give glory as it was in the bginning of the gospel since it is evident tha from the beginning it was not so nor ough those good christians who in gods due tim hope for a reformation of all such noveltie be obliged to affirm every day in their devotions in the presence of god and men tha such a form of doxology ever shall be used i the church world without end  finis
