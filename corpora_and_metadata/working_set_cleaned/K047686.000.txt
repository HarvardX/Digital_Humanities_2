zingis a tragedy  price one shilling and sixpence  zingis a tragedy as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  by alexander dow  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt in the strand m dcc lxix  advertisement to those who are not conversant in the history of the asiatic nations it may not be improper to give in brief the story upon which the tragedy of zingis is founded as it is taken from the tarich mogulistan or history of the mogul tartars written in the persian language  in the twelfth century most of the tartar ordas or tribes though governed by their own chiefs paid tribute to the king of the orda of the keraits who held his court under the title of the grand chan in the city of caracorum well known since by the name of ordabalich the famous zingis chan who afterward conquered all the countries from the sea of canton in china to the nile was prince of the niron tribe of tartars and from his early youth served in the armies of aunac the grand chan and at last rose to the command of all his forces zemouca chief of the siogarates supplanted zingis in aunacs favor zingis was disgraced he retired to his orda which was in some measure independent of the grand chan aunac pursued zingis with a small force and was defeated in the ensuing year aunac was in a pitched battle totally routed by zingis zangon the prince royal was slain and the only daughter of aunac ovisa lugin fell into the conquerors hands zingis having determined to give ovisa in marriage to his favorite son octar who afterward succeeded him in the empire of all asia occasioned an insurrection under timur another of his sons who was in love with the princess timur fell in his rebellion ovisa died of grief and the unfortunate monarch aunac was killed in his flight from an action in which he was defeated by a part of the army of zingis  zingis chan whether we regard him as a conqueror or legislator was perhaps the greatest prince that ever appeared in history he not only secured the empire of all asia to his posterity for some ages but even to this day twothirds of that immense continent remains in the possession of princes of his blood so fortunate was he in his children and descendents that many of them did not yield in abilities to him and they would perhaps have equalled him in fame had his sword left them more to conquer  the emperor of china the mogul of india the great chan of tartary and the princes of the krim tartars derive their blood from zingis and it is remarkable that at one period there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in asia

seems to wander over the east  the storms that long have shook the desert now are passed away and altays stream retards the war no more here zingis forms the nirons of the west and royal aunac on the farther shore marshals the naimans and demands his throne  enter nevian nevian the emperor of tartary commands thy presence cubla   cubla zingis should have clothed his haughty message in less odious terms does he presume to hope that i will join his rebel sword against his ancient lord though near allied to zingis  though i own his parts unequaled  his desert in arms  nevian my soul approves not of the means by which he seized the scepter of the east and drove great aunac from the tartar throne  nevian it is less a vassals duty to approve than to obey his sovereigns high commands  cubla a vassal by that honor which descends from a long line of ancestors to cubla my soul rejects the thought  what though my tribe in aunacs wide dominions formed a state and my brave fathers listened to the voice that issued from the throne and rose in arms when war was in the field  shall i become the property of treason  be transferred the mean appendage of a crown usurped  nevian beware of treason  cubla can thy tribe bold as thou art and confident in war contend with him who rules the eastern world zingis is king  and now that homage claims which thou did pay to the imperial throne   cubla presumptuous man  does he prescribe to cubla or talk of homage  he who broke all ties that bind the faith of subjects to their kings whence is his right derived  nevian he has been wronged   cubla wronged did thou say  what wrongs can justify his usurpation  should the world permit private ambition thus to seize on crowns each daring villain that dispises life would be the king or tyrant of mankind  nevian rashly thou do condemn  does cubla know the cause and progress of this bloody war  cubla from the chill bosom of the stormy north from coreas distant clime where i have long employed my sword against my countrys foes last night arrived amidst domestic broils i know not aught but that my kings dethroned  nevian the prince of soigara  the bold zemouca was the first mover of this civil war he jealous of the fame and deeds of zingis and that high confidence his rival held with aunac  to the royal ear conveyed malicious falsehoods and intended treason at length the monarch listening to his voice divested zingis of his high command the chief retired and darkly passed along to his own native tribe  the hardy nirons  they thought him wronged  they started to their arms determined to defend him from his foes  zemouca came  his host was rolled away the king advanced in tanguts bloody field the valiant zingis triumphed over his lord amidst his ruined armies in the fight the son of aunac graceful zangon fell whilst over his mangled corse his father fled and left his capital and throne to zingis  cubla zemouca was to blame  twas dangerous to drive a hero to the last extreme the very coward when bereft of hope turns on the lifted sword that threatens death but now let zingis grant his sovereign peace and give the nations back to aunacs sway fame will applaud the deed he hopes in vain the aid of cubla to support his crimes but since my sister was his favorite spouse and gave to him a son  the princely timur for timurs sake i will not join his foes  nevian it is not enough inflexible  severe tenacious of his power and like a god decisive in his councils  he declares himself the foe of temporizing friends consult thy safety  know the naiman prince betrays his sovereign and sollicits peace  cubla betrays the king to zingis  tell your lord should he imbrue his hand in aunacs blood cubla must be his foe  my safety rests upon my sword  this day i would confer with zingis  quickly i will join his camp haste and convey this answer to your chief  nevian it grieves me to behold my former friend thus rushing headlong into certain ruin cubla let me conjure thee  guard thy words and talk not thus of zingis  he is stern  i will bear a milder answer to the king  exit nev enter zena zena hail prince of eluth  cubla noble zena whence  zena straight from the tents of zingis   cubla zingis knows already cublas mind  has zenas sword with fortune turned against his ancient king  zena blame not thy friend though the event of war has made me vassal to successful zingis my soul is faithful to unhappy aunac i mean to serve him  cubla darkened is his fate   zena though few his friends since fortune left his side though scarce his strength his armor can sustain still unsubdud in soul to altays banks he leads the poor remains of former fields and strives to raise his hoary head above the cloud of his misfortunes on thy aid he rests his latter hopes  cubla the faithless naiman betrays his king   zena that cubla may prevent   cubla explain thy words   zena zemouca will protect his aged king  nay more will raise him high  again restore him to the tartar throne he plans a daring purpose in his soul he near this place is striding through the night like the dark genius of devoted zingis it is thine to point his thunder to the mark and rouse dishonored timur   cubla ha dishonored  were timurs backward steps beheld in war did timur fly  zena untarnishd is his fame  cubla whence then is this unmeritted disgrace that hangs so darkly on my sisters son  zena when with his ruined armies aunac fled from tanguts bloody field young timur pressed upon the rear and seized the hapless king as faint and wounded by a brook he lay his gray head leaning on his daughters breast his only child the beautiful ovisa the hero saw  he pitied and he loved  brought the fair captive to the niron camp but gave her fathers freedom to her tears she in return bestowed on him her heart for this fierce zingis from his presence drove his generous son  the exiled aunac heard of his fair daughters love  her choice approved and by an embassy proposed to yield the bright ovisa to young timurs arms to name him heir of tartary should zingis consent to end with peace this civil war  cubla yet still the tyrant keeps his sword unsheathed   zena he does  nay more  tomorrow octar comes his favorite son though by a second bed to wed the weeping captive  to derive from her a title to the tartar throne but ever tomorrow should thou join thy sword to bold zemouca  aunac still might reign and name young timur heir to all his realms  cubla but what intends zemouca  zena with the king to cross the altay when the night returns with terrible assault to rush on zingis amidst his armies  by a great exploit to win the east or lose his noble life he sent me hither  bade me to entreat his sisters husband  his own former friend  if yet the memory of what aunac was  if pity for a failing line of kings who ruled mankind with justice touch thy breast   cubla go  bid the chief approach  this great design becomes the spirit of the bold zemouca  exit zen the injustice done to timur  the disgrace thrown on my line  the partial favor shown to octar sit not easy on my mind the voice of aunac too  the dying voice of ruined majesty is ecchoing here  i will support him enter mila partner of my life what anxious cares send mila from her tent at this dull hour of darkness when the world sleeps in the skirts of the retiring night  mila why did thou leave me cubla is there aught unfriendly from the niron  cubla no  retire   mila to meditate alone bespeaks a mind not well at ease let mila share the grief that labors in thy bosom  cubla by our loves i know no cause of grief determined minds brood not upon misfortunes they forget the accidents of life when this base world shall throw disgrace upon them forth they rush swift as the lightnings flash that wings the storm and right themselves  mila has zena then informed   cubla yes mila all i know how cubla stands with that presumptuous man he has disgraced me in my nephew timur yet expects my aid in battle  mila he commands it cubla nay threatens disobedience with those frowns that lords assume to vassals when they fail in duty to the throne this hour ovisa by private message to my ears conveyed his gloomy purpose  cubla what can he intend  mila to treat thee as a foe should thou delay to pass beneath his standard with the morn this tedious march from coreas distant realms he construes into treason but the cause lies in his policy thou art the lord of eluths warlike tribe a chief of power and dangerous in the state the king himself the allsubduing zingis marked the path which leads to empire and he fears that cubla may do with him what he has done to aunac  cubla i am beset with perils  yet this state suits well the active tenor of my soul which loves to dwell in storms i have resolved to stretch my hand to aunac and support that ruin of a king noise within but hark what noise swells in the camp of zingis  go my love  regain the tent  i must explore the cause from whence this tumult rose  by dawn of day i will meet thy brother to concert the plan of deeds more daring than were ever achieved exit mila it is done  but still my fears   enter zemouca zemouca my sisters voice   mila my lord zemouca welcome to my soul o chief of the soigara  from what a world of troubles art thou come   zemouca yes  i have strove with some disasters mila since the niron led his rebellious tribe to tanguts field and triumphed over his lord had loyalty been less my choice  had ease been more my care than selfapproving honor and that pride which loved to stand alone when tartary fell in the stream of conquest to a chief i once scarce owned my equal i might use the day to visit mila and have thrown this cloud i borrow from the night away  mila how fares it with the king  zemouca not such his state as when in ordubalas splendid halls he ruled the nations  on the farther side of altays foaming course my tribe surrounds the king of tartars  narrow is the camp of him who covered asia with his hosts but still this sun which moves behind a storm may issue forth and show his evening beams before he sets in night  mila should naimas prince prevail in battle   zemouca may heavens lightning blast his armies and himself perfidious man he treats with zingis  mila tartary is lost  the house of aunac trembles to its base and in its ruins will involve zemouca why do thou stand against a world in arms with unavailing valor  zemouca hear me mila ere next the night shall from these fields retire aunac shall reign over asia i have formed a plot with zena in the niron camp cubia will join us with his warlike tribe at the dead midnight hour we mean to rush on zingis in his tent  mila to rush on zingis the deed is desperate  zemouca we claim thine aid to forward our design to thee is known the love of timur and his late disgrace for the escape of aunac through their tribes the nirons murmur for their gallant prince who led them often to the fields of fame go to ovisa let her arm the son of haughty zingis in her fathers cause thus shall she wrest from tyranny the world and rule the nations with the man she loves  mila and does my brother then resign ovisa  zemouca no  mila no  she beams upon me still through all this tempest which involves my soul the queen of asia  but i must be calm the softer passions suit not with a state so desperate as mine zemouca first must stretch his hand to zingis the event may lead thy brother to his souls desire why mila why in tears  mila i will bear my lord thy message to ovisa but my mind forbodes i never shall behold thee more  zemouca that heaven alone can tell  my sister stay  perhaps thou wilt never behold me  and thy lord treads too a dangerous path let not our foes in thee extend their triumph to our dust take this  giving a dagger it is thy thy brothers gift  our house was never dishonored  mila son of daring tangor our house was never dishonored nor shall mila stain the unclouded glories of her line i know the purpose of this present  here putting it in her bosom this friend shall rest i will call it to my aid when thou can not defend me from my foes exit cubla entering with caredi cubla caredi hasten call the chiefs to arms rouse my brave eluths  i will join them straight i like not this confusion this uproar that zingis raises round him in his camp he may perhaps intend  my lord zemouca embraces him how fares it with my brother and my friend i fear our zeal for aged aunacs cause shall not avail  zemouca has cubla learned from whence this tumult rose  cubla all night the high divan sat in the tent of zingis and gave ear to proffered terms from naimas perjured prince it is said they were axcepted but the voice of war resounds through all the niron camp the nations start with ardor to their arms some daring enterprise is formed by zingis against deserted aunac  zemouca fear not that  though zingis loves to move through bloody fields he tries not force where policy avails if naima promised with her sovereigns blood to end this contest zingis will delay to cross the altay  when the night descends i will remove the king  at once prevent the naimans treachery and rid the world of the usurper  cubla but that eagle sits too watchful on his rock  we must not trust much to the foes neglect for zingis owes to fortune less his greatness than to skill in wars extensive art  we are too few to reach him through his armies we must raise some other swords to penetrate those lines the niron draws around him  zemouca our success depends not on our numbers we command a hardy race the tartars of the north whose souls partake the nature of the storms that rush across their climate they delight in the abrupt decision of the sword and love a deed of danger nor on them rest all our hopes the fair ovisa arms dishonored timur in her fathers cause his late disgrace ambition love revenge shall urge him on and should the chief prefer a tame submission to the will of zingis to aunacs daughter and the tartar throne our glory must be greater and our fame arise proportioned to the perils round us  cubla friend of the hapless aunac  in thy voice speaks forth the hero and thy noble fire falls on my soul and kindles it to flame ere next the light which now bursts from the east shall gleam on altays streams the tartar tribes shall own another lord myself will rouse the lion timur if that spirit dwells in him which animates the eluthian line dishonor sits not lightly on his mind but where zemouca shall my tribe receive the king to night  zemouca upon that narrow point thou see a lonely oak  the morning star looks through its wavering branches  there the rock stretching into the altay breaks the stream and forms a peaceful eddy in that place shall aunac land when the wan moon descends behind the western hills  cubla i will attend today the court of zingis and disguise for once a soul that scorns to hide its hate i will exhibit every mark of zeal to blot suspicion from his jealous mind and turn the keeness of his eye from cubla but leave this camp the dawn already gleams along the field go  in that shower retire that darkly rushes over the altays course exit zemouca whilst this blunt warrior void of all design can thus encounter perils unconcerned shall i whose eye is fixed upon a crown and on the brightest star that ever rose upon the eastern world  the fair ovisa  shall i shrink back  shall i encourage doubt to shake my resolution  hence  away  all further fear of death already he has stalked around me in each hideous form  but yet this stubborness of heart  this pride which bore me up against this prosperous man has quite fatigued my soul  i will stray no more through asia  every foe i raise to zingis he adds unto his vassals  on this plot i rest my latter hopes and should i fail i will wrap me in my courage and retire from this base world amidst the storms i raise exit end of the first act act ii scene ovisas tent enter ovisa from her tent ovisa if ere the spirit of a warrior slain journeyd in storms across the troubled sky last night my brother zangon passed this place and called ovisa hence the voice was deep as when high arol shaking all his woods speaks to the passing thunder  through my soul a pleasing horror runs perhaps not long ovisa tarries here the silent tomb is not the house of sorrow  airy form of him who is no more where do thou dwell rejoicest thou on goldenskirted clouds or is thy murmur in the hollow wind where ere thou art mine ear with awful joy shall listen to thy voice  descend with night if thou must shun the day  o stray not far from the remains of aunacs failing line  enter mila mila hail bright sultana let a faithful friend kneeling thus pay the homage which she owes a race who ruled so long nations  ovisa mila rise  beloved companion of my better days why do thou at this melancholy hour intrude upon the sorrows of ovisa  mila to chase the cloud that hangs upon thy soul i come the messenger of aunacs friends they sent me to disclose   ovisa i know it all octar is come  mila far other news i bring are we alone  ovisia from mortal ears removed  mila the sat of royal aunac now depends upon ovisa  should she lend her aid the king might reign   ovisa then he already sits upon the tartar throne why do thou think so poorly of ovisa haste explain this mystery  for doubts begin to blast then sudden joy that lightened over my soul  mila a plot is forming in the niron camp by omrahs of renown whom cubla joins with all his eluths by the midnight hour the king thy father with zemouca comes to head the bold conspiracy and rush on zingis midst his armies  ovisa it is a deed of desperate daring  did thou say to night assist them heaven but what avails the aid of desolate ovisa  mila much  thy hands already hold the balance of the east ten thousand swords obedient to thy call may be unsheathed for aunac in this camp the tartars murmur through their martial lines for the disgrace of timur arm the prince against his father  ovisa ha i will hear no more  to recommend a crime my soul abhors to make a parricide of him i love suits not the feelings of ovisas mind by private stratagem by open war by any means let cruel zingis fall but let him fall by foes  the fame of timur must not be tarnishd  nor shall i advise a deed of such complexion mila know i may be wretched  but must not be base  mila then let ovisa triumph in a heart that feels for nirons did the cruel race once melt at the misfortunes of her house or spare the line that ruled the eastern world by him thy brother fell  by him the throne of aunac was usurped  thy father driven a feeble exile through the tartar tribes thyself a captive  but ovisa feels  heavens is it any crime to rid the world of him who riots in the blood of nations and makes a pastime of dethroning kings his guilt ovisa   ovisa it is more than common and heaven some signal vengeance has prepared for him who widows asia with his sword but let us not in punishing give birth to greater crimes than his  mila unhappy maid thou know not half the horrors of thy state to day dishonored timur must retire a lonely exile from the niron camp tomorrow octor comes with brutal lust to force thee to his arms to night thy father   ovisa mila proceed   mila must welter in his blood the price is fixed for aunacs sacred head a peace to naima soon as night returns perfidious tajan will surround the king  ovisa no more  i know the rest  misfortunes crowd too much upon me what should i resolve hemmed in on every side i will urge the prince and yet he must abhor me  mila timur comes as if by heaven directed to our aid this is the time  remember thy condition exit ovisa he comes  with undiminishd pomp he moves behind his cloud  as when the sun through mist rolls on his faded orb he greater seems though lost to half his beams and shall i plunge this god in parricide  enter timur timur i did resolve  but cannot speak the tumult of my soul  queen of the east  ovisa that title ill becomes a state like mine  this instant leave me timur if thou regardst thy peace  timur what means ovisa where dwells the peace of timur but with her who reigns within his soul  ovisa have we not prince  the house of aunac  have we not involved thee in misfortunes pinioned down thy fame that spread to heaven covered thee with shame and thrown disgrace upon the first of men we made thee no return  for kings dethroned no savuors can bestow ovisa gave twas all she had to give  her heart to timur  timur twas all that timur wished thou matchless maid  but whence is this distress  this sudden grief that labors in thy bosom tell me all my soul is up in arms against those ills that press upon thee  ovisa timur would not choose to hate ovisa  timur no   ovisa then let him not enquire into her griefs she may propose a dreadful task o leave me to myself my soul is young in mischief and demands some time to harden ere it can resolve on what my state requires  timur speak but the word thou bright divinity that rulst my soul and then i will  what will not timur do i will  i know not what  but something more than ever mortal did  ovisa take heed young prince be not too rash to promise  timurs word is like a gods irrevocably fixed  but were my suit once known twere criminal not to refuse it  daring son of zingis  i know thy lionheart delights in perils when honor leads thee to her bloody fields yet what i would propose would throw a damp on all thy courage in ovisas cause there is more than danger  guilt  thou shrinkest back i thought it would offend  my soul approves the noble horror that invades his mind i leave him to his virtue going timur stay  by heavens  thou must not thus depart  ovisa  speak speak all thy wishes and they shall be done  propose the peril  guilt can never dwell in such a cause as thine  ovisa then know my state uncommon in its horrors now demands the sword of timur  zingis shuts the door of hope against thee  octar comes tomorrow  what shall i do  timur i will defend   ovisa alas  who shall ward off the hand of death from aunac tonight he falls  the cruel zingis gives a peace to naima for her sovereigns head a midst the ruins of a falling line ovisa stands alone  timur i know thy soul and quickly will resolve   ovisa no  timur  no recall the thought and be thyself again ovisa loves thy virtues not thy crimes and should thou stain thine honor who can tell what she would think of thee exit timur the light is gone and left me darkened on a stormy sea of various passions tossed  what should i do to hide me in the cloud of my disgrace and leave ovisa and the world to octar death dwells upon the thought but to ascend a throne besmeared with blood  a fathers blood and reign a horrid parricide in asia suits not a soul like mine   enter cubla cubla while others watch the motions of the foe marshal their tribes or furbish up their steel for battle timur whiles his time away before the shrine of beauty  blush young man these are not arts in which our race excelled nor these the means by which they rose to fame  timur is cubla like the world whose censure falls not on the guilty but unfortunate as if success could recommend each crime we only call the prosperous villain great  let cubla judge of timur by himself by the high spirit which descends to both from eluths line of kings and he may know disgrace unmerited can never damp the vigor of my soul  cubla yet still thou bear with tameness which but ill becomes our race this weight of infamy by zingis thrown upon thee in his wrath  timur could timur break through honor and his duty he might raise a flame the billowy caspian should not quench but though my soul undaunted in the field swells at the growth of danger and demands more than my share of battle there are things which make me shudder cubla and betray a womans weakness dark conspiracies frauds covered over with art  those devious paths that lead the villains of the world to power please not the open spirit of my mind i hate preeminence that springs from guilt and never but through honor would be great  cubla timur farewell  a man that can submit to such indignities as thou have borne deserves not my attention  hence  away  involve thee in obscurity  it suits the tame morality of timurs mind go  leave the throne to octar  to his arms give up ovisa  timur ha that strikes me home say what do thou advise  cubla to draw thy sword against thy father  zingis  that proud man  that tyrant of the east  thou startest timur his crimes indeed may shock a soul like thine  he who without remorse has trod on kings has broke all sacred ties that bind mankind  has ruined nations to be reckoned great and is unjust not only to his foes but to his son   timur my heart with horror shrinks from such a deed   cubla so feels the feeble mind that trembles at the thought of arduous deeds and would impose its fears upon the world as the effects of virtue  go  weak boy i did advise thee  nay  i dare do more go tell thy father cubla is his foe this very night in concert with his friends he means to prove it but his friends are such as shudder not at danger  timur he who doubts my courage should prepare to rest his hand upon his sword  no mortal man but cubla durst thus  but i am too warm  thou said to night  my soul is dark and secret as the tomb unfold thy purpose  cubla yes  to night i meant but thy officious virtue interferes to raise thee high in asia  to thy arms to give ovisa  place thee next to him who ought to rule the east  to make thee heir to aunacs vast dominions do thou still harbor a doubt what darkness travels over thy thoughtful features is the fair ovisa indifferent to timur  timur cubla  stay i must consider  cubla time is on the wing we must resolve  but ruined are my hopes there nevian comes and he must not perceive that we confer long practiced in the arts of policy and guile  from every word and motion of the eye he draws conclusions i will soon return exit enter nevian nevian hail gallant son of zingis i come not sobbing like thy other friends with sad condolance and a woeful face to teaze thee with my pity  no i bring thy pardon timur  timur pardon did thou say  nevian yes full forgiveness from the king thy father i thought it would surprise   timur it does indeed   nevian i did it all  inexorable long on my address the lord of nations frowned but still i urged  at length he heard my suit and bade me call young timur to his presence a fair occasion offers to retrieve the honor thou have lost  thy injured fame he now restores thee to thy former rank and sends thee forth with half his warlike tribes to give the final blow to exiled aunac the troops already marshaled in the camp with shouts await thy orders  timur let them shout  timur shall wait his time  nevian what do i hear is this the impetuous timur he whose soul rushed on before him to the fields of fame and does he hesitate  timur begone old man least in my rage   nevian what means the son of zingis this is the very frenzy of the mind i am the friend of timur  timur hence  away  i will follow soon  nevian his late disgrace disturbs his reason when the angry lion roars there is no safety near him to the tribes i will bear the welcome news of thy return exit timur was ever mind so agitated torn with such contending passions as assail at once the soul of timur to reject the proffered service puts immediate end to all my hopes the king can not escape  should i decline another foe will rise against ill fated aunac  here she comes distraction  let me fly  she bade me shield her ruined father from the hand of death and i in my humanity assume the office of his murderer  enter ovisa ovisa he starts is then the presence of the lost ovisa hateful to timur prince i do not come to make thee deviate from the splendid path thy soul delights to follow going timur by the light that from thy beauties beams upon thy soul  thou must not leave me  but thou must  away  denounce thy curses on me  in thy words of softness dwells unutterable pain o turn from timur these indulgent eyes that shed soft pity from their lucid orbs  for i do not deserve it  false to thee  false to my word  a traitor to my love  thy fathers murderer  ovisa what means the prince he is not dead  timur but he must die ovisa and by these hands the cruel zingis grants my pardon and commands me to the war to lead the nirons over the altays stream to rush upon thy father in his camp and end this contest that inflames the world shout hark  the impatient troops proclaim their joy to see their prince restored and shout for battle i come  ovisa   ovisa timur leave me  go  and on the ruins of our falling race rear to thyself a monument of fame think not i seize thy skirts to keep thee here think not i weep these eyes are only dim think not i breath a sigh  timur should guilty souls feel all my pangs  a moment of their woe might expiate the crimes of half a world but nevian comes  i must away  my love can thou forgive me  no  ovisa  no  let not thy tenderness of soul extend to such a wretch as timur  yet his fate is most to blame  ovisa then hear me son of zingis as love cannot detain thee  on my knees once more i beg an aged parents life o spare him timur touch not his gray hairs let him escape  for zingis will not long in aunac have a rival to his power the king my father worn with grief and years already hastens to the silent tomb  timur by him that reigns above he shall not die exit ovisa he is gone and left me lonely to my woes  hasten thy journey sun  and gracious night receive me to the bosom of thy gloom the rustling wind that whistles through thy trees the solemn serious melancholy notes of thy own bird are music to mine ear and please the dreary horrors of my soul enter mila mila thy tears will flow in vain  my grief admits not of thy comfort  mila did my power equal my wishes soon the light of joy would brighten on thy forehead but my voice must now be like the ravens to thine ear the van of octars army from the hill is seen to pour along in clouds of dust edged round with gleaming

end epilogue by mr garrick spoken by mrs abington i am sent good folks to speak the epilogue but it is so dull  i will cheat the scribbling rogue among ourselves your loss will be but small  youre to

and save this piece what shall our stage receive this tartar race each whiskerd hero with a copper face i hate the tartars  hate their vile religion  we have no souls forsooth  that is their decision these brutes some horrid prejudice controuls speak english husbands  have your wives no souls then for our persons  still more shameful work a hundred women wed a single turk again ye english husbands what say you a hundred wives you would not wish for two romans and greeks for me  o that dear sparta their women had a noble magna charta there a young hero had he won fair fame might from her husband ask a lovely dame the happy husband of the honor vain gave her with joy took her with joy again the chosen dame no struggles had within for to refuse had been a public sin  and to their honor all historians say no spartan lady ever sinned that way  ye fair who have not yet thrown out your bait to tangle captives in the marriage state take heed i warn you where your snares you set o let not infidels come near your net let hand in hand with prudence go your wishes men are in general the strangest fishes do not for misery your beauty barter and o take heed  you do not catch a tartar
