an explanation of the figure of anatomy wherein the circulation of the blood is made visible through glass veins and arteries with the actions of the heart and lungs as also the course of the blood from the mother to the child and from the child to the mother by which means any person though unskilled in the knowledge of anatomy may at one view be acquainted with the circulation of the blood and in what manner it is performed in our living bodies  adorned with a copperplate wherein the structure of the heart is designed and the glass vessels exactly represented in their order as they are in the figure to which they are to be referred  london printed in the year       animadversion as this figure is chiefly calculated to demonstrate the circulation of the blood with the actions of the heart and lungs and the nourishment of the child while in the womb it was absolutely necessary that it should represent a woman supposed to be opened when alive because these are all vital functions which are not exercised in a body when dead therefore it is to be hoped that nobody will make objection to this representation which would carry with it an idea of the highest barbarity and cruelty had it ever been put in practice upon any humane body  description of the figure this figure represents a woman gone eight months with child chained down upon a table supposed to be opened alive of which the two principal cavities are laid open viz the breast and the lower belly which are divided from each other by the diaphragm or midriff in the breast the heart which is placed to move for carrying on the circulation is seen between the two lobes of the lungs which likewise move as in breathing from the heart are seen going out the two principal arteries of the body made of glass the one leading to the lungs and the other toward every part of the body viz toward the head and arms whilst the trunk is continued on the back bones through the breast and passing the diaphragm into the lower belly divides itself to all its parts and then goes to the legs the same number of veins made of glass accompany the arteries join in one trunk and open into the heart again through the arteries a red liquor in imitation of blood is seen to move from the heart to every part of the body and by the veins returning from every part of the body to the heart again in the lower belly in a cavity called the pelvis or basin the child is seen in the womb with the afterbirth and navelstring made of glass consisting of two arteries and one vein arising from the afterbirth by many branches which terminate in one of a considerable length and enter the navel of the child through which the blood is seen to pass from the mother for its nourishment the two arteries are likewise seen to arise out of the navel of the child twisted round the vein in its course toward the afterbirth where it divides itself into a great number of branches in the same manner as the vein through these arteries the blood is likewise seen to return from the child to the mother after nourishment  of the structure of the heart and lungs and of the circulation of the blood in order to have a right understanding of the circulation of the blood it is first necessary to be acquainted with the structure of the heart and lungs because they are the organs immediately concerned in carrying on that important function  of the heart the heart is a selfmoving muscle of a pyramidal figure suspended in the middle of the breast between the two lobes of the lungs by its principal vessels being connected to no other part for the convenience of its motions of the heart we may consider the two extremities the one is uppermost and broad called the base the other is lowermost and contracting itself narrow becomes a little sharp and is called its point this more so in brutes the situation of the heart in man is resting on the diaphragm slanting much toward the left side so that the greatest part of it is placed under the left breast  it consists chiefly of four principal cavities two of which are called auricles or ears from their figure placed on the right and left sides of the base of the heart the two other are the ventricles which are cavities formed immediately in the substance of the heart the one is the right ventricle and the other the left the right ear opens into the right ventricle and the left ear into the left ventricle the heart like all other muscles is made up of a great number of fibers or fleshy threads disposed in a particular manner on the inside of the ears where they form a kind of irregular network and in the ventricles besides this network leveral considerable eminences called pillars the right ear opens into the right ventricle and the left into the left ventricle at the entrance of the right ear into the right ventricle there are placed three valves which open from the right ear into the right ventricle but close the return from that ventricle into that ear from the left ear into the left ventricle there are placed two more in the same manner as in the right ventricle  there are four principal vessels which come into and go out of the heart two veins and two arteries the two veins are the vena cava or hollow vein which is made from the union of all the veins of the body and the pulmonary vein made from the union of all the veins of the luags the vena cava opens into the right ear and the pulmonary vein into the left the two arteries are the pulmonary artery which divides itself into every part of the lungs and the aorta magna or great artery which divides itself into every part of the body the pulmonary artery arises out of the right ventricle at the beginning of which there are placed three valves in the figure of a half moon which open from the ventricle into this artery but close from the artery into the ventricle the aorta magna or great artery arises out of the left ventricle at the entrance of which there are placed three other valves of the half moon form disposed in the same manner as those in the pulmonary artery besides these principal vessels there are two arteries and a vein appropriated to the use of the heart the arteries are called coronary they arise from the great artery at its going out of the heart and are distributed throughout the whole substance of the heart for its nourishment and the veins bear the same name which return the blood into the right ear  of the lungs the lungs are two in number situate on each side of the heart of an elastick spungy texture they are connected to the vessels of the heart and windpipe of which they are chiefly composed the windpipe is the passage for air into the lungs only its upper part is made up of fine small cartilages or gristles four of which form its entrance which is at the root of the tongue before the entrance of the gullet and is the passage for the aliments the fifth is a cartilaginous valve placed at the entrance of the windpipe which is pressed down at the time the aliments are passing into the gullet the windpipe is composed of many cartilaginous rings loosely connected to each other in such a manner that they may draw one in another it is placed in the forepart of the neck and after its entrance into the breast divides itself into two branches whereof the one enters the right lobe of the lungs and the other the left these branches divide themselves throughout the whole structure of the lungs and every where terminate in small vesicles or bladders which are all tied together by a number of small productions from the common covering of the lungs the next vessels are the pulmonary arteries and veins the pulmonary artery divides itself above the heart into two branches the one to the right and the other to the left lobe of the lungs where they follow all the divisions of the branches of the windpipe laying on the sides of them and continuing their course till they have attained to the small vesicles where they spread themselves over them in a number of small capillary vessels from these small capillary arteries on the vesicles arise the capillarypulmonary veins which uniting themselves from small branches into large on the sides of the branches of the windpipe form one trunk in the left ear as these considerable vessels conduce nothing to the nourishment of the substance of the lungs as will more particularly be treated of in describing the circulation of the blood in the child while in the womb there is a particular artery for that use called the bronchal artery and a vein to return the blood  of the circulation of the blood and its use from what has been said of the structure of the heart and the disposition of its vessels and valves placed at the coming in of the ventricles from the ears as well as of those placed at the going out of the ventricles into the arteries if the action of the heart be rightly considered its use may be easily understood for the ears and ventricles have both of them the power of contracting and dilating themselves but neither of these two actions can happen at the same time both in the ears and ventricles but the dilatation of the one must succeed the contraction of the other for reasons now to be mentioned for the blood is always flowing from the vena cava into the right ear and from the pulmonary vein into the left the one from every part of the body and the other from the lungs so that the ears if rightly considered are two little reservoirs always ready to supply the ventricles with a mensurated quantity of blood lest its motion should be suffocated by the weight of too much blood at one time as to the ventricles they are to receive the blood from the ears in given quantities in order to force it our of their cavities into the arteries by the force of the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery into the lungs and by the left through the great artery into every part of the body when the ears contract the ventricles dilate because that the ventricles at that time are receiving the blood from them and when the ventricles contract the ears dilate because at that time the blood endeavoring to return into the auricles from the ventricles presses against the valves and closes them during which time the auricles are filling and kept dilated the blood in the ventricles which cannot return into the auricles is forced over the half moon valves into the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle as well as over those from the left ventricle into the great artery by which means the arteries are dilated and filled with blood so that the dilatation of the arteries succeeds the contraction of the ventricles for no blood can possibly return from the arteries into the ventricles because the half moon valves shut up the mouths of those arteries whenever the blood endeavors to return and this is the reason of the pulsation of the arteries hence it plainly appears that the use of the heart is to carry on two circulations of the whole mass of blood at one and the same time the one from the right ventricle through the lungs to the left ear and the other from the left ventricle through every part of the body to the the right ear the manner in which these circulations are carried on is the next thing to be considered and first of that through the lungs  the lungs perform two actions that of inspiration and that of expiration the first is when the air is taken into the lungs and the other is when it is thrust out  the first action is performed by the means of many muscles which raise the ribs and widen the breast during which time the midriff from a unequal surface toward the breast becomes plane and at the same time the outward air being pressed rushes in at the nose and mouth and passes through all the branches of the windpipe which lead to the small vesicles by which they are blown up the rings which compose the branches of the windpipe which before were contracted one within another are now extended the one from the other the branches of the pulmonary artery and vein laying on the sides of the branches of the windpipe must of necessity be coequally extended with them which before lay in folds gives now to the blood a free opportunity to pass from the right ventricle of the heart through all the ramifications of the pulmonary artery and fill their capillaries which are distributed on the vesicles by this time the elevation of the ribs ceases and the antagonist muscles pull them down assisted by the weight of the external air which presses on their surface drives the air violently out of the vesicles through all the branches of the windpipe and their sides being brought together the blood contained in the capillary arteries by this great pressure is broken and its globules grown so small as to be able to pass in the capillary veins which are he pulmonary veins from whence it is propelled by the contiual contraction of the lungs into the left auricle of the heart  hence we find the great necessity of respiration for by  the blood in its passage through the lungs undergoes a iolent trituration breaking the texture of its globules to eparate its parts by which means they become dissimilar to ach other and prepare a sufficient quantity of different parcles for the nourishment of the different parts of the body which is carried on by the second circulation from the left vencle of the heart through the aorta magna or great artery  the left ventricle of the heart has its sides about four mes as thick as the right and necessary it was it should be so a greater force being required to drive the blood through the great artery into every part of the body than through the lungs only which is the use of the right ventricle  the aorta magna or great artery is an elastick cartilaginous tube arising out of the left ventricle of the heart and divides itself to every part of the body the branches of which continue their division till they become so small as to be as fine as a hair and are called capillaries from these small capillary arteries arise another kind of small vessels which are called veins which frequently unite into larger branches from every part of the body till they have formed one common great trunk called the vena cava or great hollow vein which opens itself into the right ear of the heart the blood which has been sufficiently ground and subtillized by the action of the lungs as was now mentioned is brought into the left ear by the pulmonary veins the cavity of each ear is capable of containing one ounce of blood so that whenever the left ear contracts the great artery must receive one ounce of blood because the left ventricle can throw no more blood into the great artery than what it receives from its ear during the time the great artery is receiving this quantity of blood from the contracting ventricle it is much dilated or stretched but as its substance is induced with a great spring as soon as the resistance is taken off which is when the left ventricle dilates to receive a fresh quantity of blood from the left ear then the artery contracts itself by which means the blood is crowded into its cavity and closely embraced and pressed against its sides the blood at the same time equally resisting every way presses against the half moon valves and prevents its return into the left ventricle and thus is obliged to pass on through all the ramifications of this artery into every part of the body  during the time that the artery is contracting to propel the the blood into every part of the body the left ventricle is dilating to receive another quantity of blood from the left ear in order to throw it into the great artery again by the time that the contraction of its sides are over  thus by the alternate dilatation and contraction of the left auricle and left ventricle the blood which returns from the lungs where it has been attenuated and rendered fit for the nourishment of the different parts of the body is sent by the great artery to be distributed to them whilst the excrementitious parts are strained off by particular glands and carried out of the body by sweat and other evacuations the remaining part of the blood which has not been sufficiently ground by the action of the lungs is taken up by the veins and brought back to the cava to be poured by the right auricle into the right ventricle in order to be forced through the lungs again and there to undergo another trituration and afterward to be distributed to every part of the body again in the manner it has already been described  of the nourishment of the child in the womb during the time that the child is in the womb it is nourished with blood only brought to it from the placenta or afterbirth through the navel by the umbilical rope or navelstring but as there is always more blood conveyed to it than is necessary for its nourishment there is a constant return of this blood through the navelstring to the afterbirth again  therefore to have a right understanding in what manner this reciprocal circulation is carried on it is necessary to consider the child during the time it is in the womb to be precluded from all communication with the outward air and cannot breathe all the vesicles or little bladders of its lungs being closely pressed together and the extremities of the pulmonary arteries and veins equally pressed with them so that the course of the blood through the lungs is entirely stopped till birth and notwithstanding that the circulation of the blood may be conveniently carried on there are particular passages left open without ever passing through the lungs  the first of these passages is called foramen ovale which is an oval hole opening from the right ear of the heart into the left where there is a valve shutting from the left ear into the right the second is a canal of communication called ductus arteriosus which from the trunk of the pulmonary artery opens into the trunk of the aorta magna or great artery  the placenta or afterbirth is a large mass of blood vessels like a cake composed of arteries and veins by the extremities of which it is fastened to the inward surface of the womb so that the extremities of the arteries of the womb are joined to those of the veins of the placenta and the extremities of the arteries of the placenta to those of the veins the womb by which means the maternal blood by the arteries of the womb is transmitted into the veins of the placenta which veins unite into one considerable one in the middle of the placenta about an ell long which enters the navel of the child passing through the fissure of the liver and opens in the vena cava to bring the blood in the right ear one part of this blood passes through the foramen ovale or oval hole into the left ear the two ears contracting themselves force the blood in the right and left ventricle of the heart so that the blood contained in the left ventricle is forced up the great artery and that in the right up the pulmonary this blood finding no passage through the lungs passes the canal of communication and mixes itself with the blood of the left ventricle in the great artery by which it is sent to every part of the body of the child for its nourishment the remaining quantity of blood which is not employed in nourishing the child returns by two arteries which come out at the navel of the child and are convoluted about the vein which three vessels compose the navelstring the arteries having reached the afterbirth divide into an infinite number of ramifications whose smallest branches unload themselves of their blood into the veins of the womb of the mother thus the child is continually nourished during the time that it is contained in the womb and the circulation carried on without ever passing through the lungs  but after the child is born the air finding a passage into its lungs blows up all the vesicles by which means the pressure is taken off from the blood vessels at which time the blood in the right ventricle finding a free passage through the pulmonary artery into the lungs passes no more through the duct of communication but returns by the pulmonary vein into the left and beating against the valve of the foramen ovale for ever closes it up  depiction of the heart and surrounding arteries  explanation
