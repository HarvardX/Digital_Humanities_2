the poetical calendar vol i for january  the poetical calendar  containing a collection of scarce and valuable pieces of poetrywith variety of originals and translations by the most eminent hands intended as a supplement to mr dodsleys collection  written and selected by francis fawkes ma and william woty  in twelve volumes  london printed by dryden leach for j coote at the kings arms in paternoster row mdcclxiii  advertisement as none of the liberal sciences can afford a nobler entertainment to the human mind than poetry so it is presumed that a judicious collection of agreeable and instructive poems can never be unseasonable music ravishes the ear and affects the soul but its sweet enchantment is of short duration a fine piece of painting if carefully preserved will mellow into perfection and perhaps continue the admiration of mankind for some centuries but the works of the poet live for ever we must however except those pieces which though intrinsically of the highest merit yet being published in a loose careless or inelegant manner must of course in a short time perish in the wreck of oblivion to preserve some of these spirited productions which have been thus unfortunately neglected is one part of the design of this publication but it will be proper briefly to inform the reader of the nature of our plan first then we propose once a month for one year only to publish a small volume of poems printed in an elegant manner each of which will take its title from the month at the conclusion of which it is published and be introduced with some original poems particularly descriptive of its proper month afterward will be added variety of pieces that are either amusing or instructive and at the same time not immoral which though of real merit have passed through the world unnoticed full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air   though it must be confessed that our plan is of an extensive nature yet we do not in the least despair of bringing it to a considerable degree of perfection as we have laid in a very large fund of scarce and valuable poems are possessed of many original pieces and have the promise of assistance from gentlemen of the most celebrated names the most acknowledged taste and the most distinguished genius  francis fawkes william woty  dec         contents ode to january page   winter an

the nile to recompense the last years spoil it is he the twofacd janus comes in view wild hyacinths his robe adorn and snowdrops rivals of the morn he spurns the goat aside but smiles upon the new emerging year with pride and now unlocks with agat key the ruby gates of orient day mars and bellona now suspend the war their red hoofd steeds with battle worn to their long vacant stalls return in

sequestered seat and trace the vestige of her feet may each impassioned thought meet a safe harbor there deem the low world as naught and freed from follys magic chain to wisdoms lore return again winter an ode no more the morn with tepid rays unfolds the flowers of various hue noon spreads no more the genial blaze nor gentle eve distills the dew the lingering hours prolong the night usurping darkness shares the day her mists restrain the force of light and phoebus holds a doubtful sway by gloomy twilight half revealed with sighs we view the hoary hill the leafless wood the naked field the snowtopt cot the frozen rill no music warbles through the grove no vivid colors paint the plain no more with devious steps i rove through verdant paths now sought in vain aloud the driving tempest roars congealed impetuous showers descend haste close the window bar the doors fate leaves me stella and a friend in natures aid let art supply with light and heat my little sphere rouse rouse the fire and pile it high light up a constellation here let music sound the voice of joy or mirth repeat the jocund tale let love his wanton wiles employ and over the season wine prevail yet time lifes dreary winter brings when mirths gay tale shall please no more nor music charm though stella sings nor love nor wine the spring restore catch then o catch the transient hour improve each moment as it flies lifes a short summer man a flower he dies alas how soon he dies winter a pastoral ballad felices ter and amplius quos irrupta tenet copula hor when the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen and the meadows their beauty have lost when natures disrobed of her mantle of green and the streams are fast bound with the frost while the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold as bleak the winds northerly blow and the innocent flocks run for ease to the fold with their fleeces besprinkled with snow in the yard when the cattle are fodderd with straw and they send forth their breath like a steam and the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw flakes of ice that she finds in the cream when the sweet country maiden as fresh as a rose as she carelessly trips often slides and the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shows all the charms that her modesty hides when the lads and the lasses for company joined in a crowd round the embers are met talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind and of ghosts till they are all in a sweat heaven grant in this season it may be my lot with the nymph whom i love and admire while the icicles hang from the eves of my cot i may thither in safety retire where in neatness and quiet and free from surprise we may live and no hardships endure nor feel any turbulent passions arise but such as each other may cure a description of winter by mr ambrose philips to the earl of dorset copenhagen march        from frozen climes and endless tracks of snow from streams which northern winds forbid to flow what present shall the muse to dorset bring or how so near the pole attempt to sing all pleasing objects which to verse invite the hoary winter here conceals from sight the hills and dales and the delightful woods the flowery plains and silverstreaming floods by snow disguised in bright confusion lie and with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye no gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring no birds within this desert region sing the ships unmoved the boisterous winds defy while rattling chariots over the ocean fly the vast leviathan wants room to play and spout his waters in the face of day the starving wolves along the main sea prowl and to the moon in icy valleys howl over many a shining league the level main here spreads itself into a glassy plain there solid billows of enormous size alps of green ice in wild disorder rise and yet but lately have i seen even here the winter in a lovely dress appear ere yet the clouds let fall the treasured snow or winds began through hazy skies to blow at evening a keen eastern breeze arose and the descending rain unsullied froze soon as the silent shades of night withdrew the ruddy morn disclosed at once to view the face of nature in a rich disguise and brightened every object to my eyes for every shrub and every blade of grass and every pointed thorn seemed wrought in glass in pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show while through the ice the crimson berries glow the thicksprung reeds which watery marshes yield seemed polished lances in a hostile field the stag in limpid currents with surprise sees crystal branches on his forehead rise the spreading oak the beech and towering pine glazed over in the freezing ether shine the frighted birds the rattling branches shun which wave and glitter in the distant sun when if a sudden gust of wind arise the brittle forest into atoms flies the crackling wood beneath the tempest bends and in a spangled shower the prospect ends or if a southern gale the region warm and by degrees unbind the wintery charm the traveller a miry country sees and journies sad beneath the dropping trees like some deluded peasant merlin leads through fragrant bowers and through delicious meads while here enchanted gardens to him rise and airy fabrics there attract his eyes his wandering feet the magic paths pursue and while he thinks the fair illusion true the trackless scenes disperse in fluid air and woods and wilds and thorny ways appear a tedious road the weary wretch returns and as he goes the transient vision mourns on captain forresters traveling to the highlands of scotland in winter anno      incog over caledonias ruder alps while forrester pursued his way the mountains veiled their rugged scalps and wrapped in snow and wonder lay each sylvan god each rural power peeped out to see the rareeshow and all confessed that till that hour they never had seen so bright a beau nay yet and more i dare advance the story true as aught in print all nature round in complaisance and imitation took the hint the fields that whilome only bore wild heath or clad at best with oats despised these humble weeds and wore rich spangled doublets and laced coats the hills were perriwiggd with snow pigtails of ice hung on each tree the winds turned powderpuffs and lo on every shrub a sharp toupee with silver clocks the river gods appeared and some will take their oath or lay at least a thousand odds the clouds saliving spit white froth the youth abashed thus to survey so rude a scene himself outdo his sprightly genius to display resolved on something odd and new all things he found were grown genteel which made him deem it apropo to be alone in dishabile a forrester and not a beau on the winter solstice mdccxl by dr akenside the radiant ruler of the year at length his wintry goal attains soon to reverse the long career and northward bend his golden reins prone on potosis haughty brow his fiery streams incessant flow ripening the silvers ductile stores while in the caverns horrid shade the panting indian hides his head and often the approach of eve explores but lo on this deserted coast how faint the light how thick the air lo armed with whirlwind hail and frost fierce winter desolates the year the fields resign their cheerful bloom no more the breezes waft perfume no more the warbling waters roll deserts of snow fatigue the eye black storms involve the louring sky and gloomy damps oppress the soul now through the town promiscuous throngs urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire harmonious dances festive songs to charm the midnight hours conspire while mute and shrinking with her fears each blast the cottagematron hears as over the hearth she sits alone at morn her bridegroom went abroad the night is dark and deep the road she sighs and wishes him at home but thou my lyre awake arise and hail the suns remotest ray now now he climbs the northern skies tomorrow nearer than today then louder howl the stormy waste be land and ocean worse defaced yet brighter hours are on the wing and fancy through the wintry glooms all fresh with dews and opening blooms already hails the emerging spring o fountain of the golden day could mortal vows but urge thy speed how soon before thy vernal ray should each unkindly damp recede how soon each hovering tempest fly that now fermenting loads the sky prompt on our heads to burst amain to rend the forest from the steep or thundering over the baltic deep to whelm the merchants hopes of gain but let not mans unequal views presume on nature and her laws it is his with grateful joy to use the indulgence of the sovereign cause secure that health and beauty springs through this majestic frame of things beyond what he can reach to know and that heavens allsubduing will with good the progeny of ill attempers every state below how pleasing wears the wintry night spent with the old illustrious dead while by the tapers trembling light i seem those awful courts to tread where chiefs and legislators lie whose triumphs move before my eye with every laurel fresh displayed while charmed i taste the ionian song or bend to platos godlike tongue resounding through the olive shade but if the gay wellnaturd friend bids leave the studious page awhile then easier joys the soul unbend and teach the brow a softer smile then while the genial glass is paid by each to her that fairest maid whose radiant eyes his hopes obey what lucky vows his bosom warm while absence heightens every charm and love invokes returning may may thou delight of heaven and earth when will thy happy morn arise when the dear place which gave her birth restore lucinda to my eyes there while she walks the wonted grove the seat of music and of love bright as the one primaeval fair thither ye silversounding lyres thither gay smiles and young desires chaste hope and mutual faith repair and if believing love can read the wonted softness in her eye then shall my fears o charming maid and every pain of absence die then ofter to thy name attund and rising to diviner sound i will wake the free horatian song old tyne shall listen to my tale and echo down the bordering vale the liquid melody prolong the winters walk behold my fair wherever we rove what dreary prospects round us rise the naked hills the leafless grove the hoary ground the frowning skies nor only through the wasted plain stern winter is thy force confessed still wider spreads thy horrid reign i feel thy power usurp my breast enlivening hope and fond desire resign the heart to spleen and care scarce frighted love maintains her fire and rapture saddens to despair in groundless hope and causeless fear unhappy man behold thy doom still changing with the changeful year the slave of sunshine and of gloom tired with vain joys and false alarms with mental

song soft as corelli and as virgil strong from words so sweet new grace the notes receive and music borrows helps she used to give thy style has matched what ancient romans knew thy flowing numbers far excel the new their cadence in such easy sound conveyed that height of thought may seem superfluous aid yet in such charms the noble thoughts abound that needless seem the sweets of easy sound landscapes how gay the bowery grotto yields which thought creates and lavish fancy builds what art can trace the visionary scenes the flowery groves and everlasting greens the babbling sounds that mimic echo plays the fairy shade and its eternal maze nature and art in all their charms combined and all elysium to one view combined no farther could imagination roam till vanbrugh framed and

view thy rosamond with henrys eyes to mr addison on his tragedy of cato by the same too long has love engrossed britannias stage and sunk to softness all our tragic rage by that alone did empires fall or rise and fate depended on a fair ones eyes the sweet infection mixed with dangerous art debased our manhood while it soothed the heart thou scornst to raise a grief thyself must blame nor from our weakness steal a vulgar fame a patriots fall may justly melt the mind and tears flow nobly shed for all mankind how do our souls with generous pleasure glow our hearts exulting while our eyes overflow when thy firm hero stands beneath the weight of all his sufferings venerably great romes poor remains still sheltering by his side with conscious virtue and becoming pride the aged oak thus rears his head in air his sap exhausted and his branches bare midst storms and earthquakes he maintains his state fixed deep in earth and fastened by his weight his naked boughs still lend the shepherds aid and his old trunk projects an awful shade amidst the joys triumphant peace bestows our patiots sadden at his glorious woes a while they let the worlds great business wait anxious for rome and sigh for

rules of art for him the songsters in unmeasured odes debased alcides and dethroned the gods in golden chains the kings of india led or rent the turban from the sultans head one in old fables and the pagan strain with nymphs and tritons wafts him over the main another draws fierce lucifer in arms and fills the infernal region with alarms a third awakes some druid to foretell each future triumph

shining march describe in faithful lays content to paint him nor presume to praise their charms if charms they have the truth supplies and from the theme unlabored beauties rise by longing nations for the throne designed and called to guard the rights of humankind with secret grief his godlike soul repines and britains crown with joyless luster shines while prayers and tears his destined progress stay and crowds of mourners choke their sovereigns way not so he marched when hostile squadrons stood in scenes of death and fired his generous blood when his hot courser pawd the hungarian plain and adverse legions stood the shock in vain his frontiers past the belgian bounds he views and cross the level fields his march pursues here pleased the land of freedom to survey he greatly scorns the thirst of boundless sway over the thin soil with silent joy he spies transplanted woods and borrowed verdure rise where every meadow won with toil and blood from haughty tyrants and the raging flood with fruits and flowers the careful hind supplies and clothes the marshes in a rich disguise such wealth for frugal hands does heaven decree and such thy gifts celestial liberty through stately towns and many a fertile plain the pomp advances to the neighboring main whole nations crowd around with joyful cries and view the hero with insatiate eyes in hagas towers he waits till eastern gales propitious rise to swell the british sails hither the fame of englands monarch brings the vows and friendships of the neighboring kings mature in wisdom his extensive mind takes in the blended interests of mankind the worlds great patriot calm thy anxious breast secure in him o europe take thy rest henceforth thy kingdoms shall remain confined by rocks or streams the mounds which heaven designed the alps their newmade monarch shall restrain nor shall thy hills pirene rise in vain but see to britains isle the squadrons stand and leave the sinking towers and lessening land the royal bark bounds over the floating plain breaks through the billows and divides the main over the vast deep great monarch dart thine eyes a watery prospect bounded by the skies ten thousand vessels from ten thousand shores bring gums and gold and either indias stores behold the tributes hastening to thy throne and see the wide horizon all thy own still is it thine though now the cheerful crew hail albions cliffs just whitening to the view before the wind with swelling sails they ride till thames receives them in his opening tide the monarch hears the thundering peals around from trembling woods and echoing hills rebound nor misses yet amid the deafening train the roarings of the hoarse resounding main as in the flood he sails from either side he views his kingdom in its rural pride a various scene the wide spread landscape yields over rich enclosures and luxuriant fields a lowing herd each fertile pasture fills and distant flocks stray over a thousand hills fair greenwich hid in woods with new delight shade above shade now rises to the sight his woods ordained to visit every shore and guard the island which they graced before the sun now rolling down the western way a blaze of fires renews the fading day unnumberd barks the regal barge infold brightening the twilight with its beamy gold less thick the finny shoals a countless fry before the whale or kingly dolphin fly in one vast shout he seeks the crowded strand and in a peal of thunder gains the land welcome great stranger to our longing eyes oh king desired adopted albion cries for thee the east breathed out a prosperous breeze bright were the suns and gently swelled the seas thy presence did each doubtful heart compose and factions wondered that they once were foes that joyful day they lost each hostile name the same their aspect and their voice the same so two fair twins whose features were designed at one soft moment in the mothers mind show each the other with reflected grace and the same beauties bloom in either face the puzzled strangers which is which enquire delusion grateful to the smiling sire from that fair mr flamsteads house hill where hoary sages boast to name the stars and count the heavenly host by the next dawn does great augusta rise proud town the noblest scene beneath the skies over thames her thousand spires their luster shed and a vast navy hides his ample bed a floating forest from the distant strand a line of golden carrs strikes over the land britannias peers in pomp and rich array before their king triumphant lead the way far as the eye can reach the gaudy train a bright procession shines along the plain so happily through the heavens wide pathless ways a comet draws a long extended blaze from east to west burns through the ethereal frame and half heavens unequal glitters with the flame now to the regal towers securely brought he plans britannias glories in his thought resumes the delegated power he gave rewards the faithful and restores the brave whom shall the muse from out the shining throng select to heighten and adorn her song thee hallifax to thy capacious mind o man approved is britains wealth consigned her coin while nassau fought debased and rude by thee in beauty and in truth renewed an arduous work again thy charge we see and thy own care once more returns to thee o formed in every scene to awe and please mix wit with pomp and dignity with ease though called to shine aloft thou will not scorn to smile on arts thyself did once adorn for this thy name succeeding time shall praise and envy less thy garter than thy bays the muse if fired with thy enlivening beams perhaps shall aim at more exalted themes record our monarch in a nobler strain and sing the opening wonders of his reign bright carolinas heavenly beauties

maese and distant rhine nor ebro let thy single rage with half the warring world engage oh call to mind thy thousands slain and almanaras fatal plain while yet the gallic terrors sleep nor britain thunders from the deep prologue to the university of oxford by the same what kings henceforth shall reign what states be free is fixed at length by annas just decree whose brows the muses sacred wreath shall fit is left to you the arbiters of wit with beating hearts the rival poets wait till you athenians shall decide their fate secure when to these learned seats they come of equal judgment and impartial doom poor is the players fame whose whole renown is but the praise of a capricious town while with mockmajesty and fancied power he struts in robes the monarch of an hour often wide of nature must he act a part make love in tropes in bombast break his heart in turn and simile resign his breath and rhyme and quibble in the pangs of death we blush when plays like these receive applause and laugh in secret at the tears we cause with honest scorn our own success disdain a worthless honor and inglorious gain no trifling scenes at oxford shall appear well what we blush to act may you to hear to you our famed our standard plays we bring the work of poets whom you taught to sing though crowned with fame they dare not think it due nor take the laurel till bestowed by you great catos self the glory of the stage who charms corrects exalts and fires the age begs here he may be tried by roman laws to you o fathers he submits his cause he rests not in the peoples general voice till you the senate have confirmed his choice fine is the secret delicate the art to wind the passions and command the heart for fancied ills to force our tears to flow and make the generous soul in love with woe to raise the shades of heroes to our view rebuild fallen empires and old time renew how hard the task how rare the godlike rage none should presume to dictate for the stage but such as boast a great extensive mind enriched by nature and by art refined who from the ancient stores their knowledge bring and tasted early of the muses spring may none pretend upon her throne to sit but such as sprung from you are born to wit chose by the mob their lawless claim we slight yours is the old hereditary right thoughts occasioned by the sight of an original picture of king charles i taken at the time of his trial inscribed to george clarke esquire by the same can this be he could charles the good the great be sunk by heaven to such a dismal state how meagre pale neglected worn with care what steady sadness and august despair in those sunk eyes the grief of years i trace and sorrow seems acquainted with that face tears which his heart disdained from me overflow thus to survey gods substitute below in solemn anguish and majestic woe when spoiled of empire by unhallowed hands sold by his slaves and held in impious bands rent from what often had sweetened anxious life his helpless children and his bosom wife doomed for the faith plebeian rage to stand and fall a victim for the guilty land then thus was seen abandoned and forlorn the king the father and the saint to mourn  how could thou artist then thy skill display thy steady hands thy savage heart betray near thy bold work the stunned spectators faint nor see unmoved what thou unmoved could paint what brings to mind each various scene of woe the insulting judge the solemnmocking show the horrid sentence and accursed blow where then just heaven was thy unactive hand thy idle thunder and thy lingering brand thy adamantine shield thy angel wings and the great genii of anointed kings treason and fraud shall thus the stars regard and injured virtue meet this sad reward so sad none like can times old records tell though pompey bled and poor darius fell all names but one too low  that one too high all parallels are wrongs or blasphemy o power supreme how secret are thy ways yet man vain man would trace the mystic maze with foolish wisdom arguing charge his god his balance hold and guide his angry rod newmould the spheres and mend the skys design and sound the immense with his short scanty line do thou my soul the destined period wait when god shall solve the dark decrees of fate his now unequal dispensations clear and make all wise and beautiful appear when suffering saints aloft in beams shall glow and prosperous traitors gnash their teeth below such boding thoughts did guilty conscience dart a pledge of hell to dying cromwells heart then this pale image seemed to invade his room gazed him to stone and warned him to the tomb while thunders roll and nimble lightnings play and the storm wings his spotted soul away a blast more bounteous never did heaven command to scatter blessings over the british land not that more kind which dashed the pride of spain and whirled her crushed armada round the main not those more kind which guide our floating towers waft gums and gold and made far india ours that only kinder which to britains shore did mitres crowns and stuarts race restore renewed the church reversed the kingdoms doom and brought with charles an anna yet to come o clarke to whom a stuart trusts her reign over albions fleets and delegates the main dear as the faith thy loyal heart has sworn transmit this piece to ages yet unborn this sight shall damp the raging russians breast the poison spill and halfdrawn sword arrest to soft compassion stubborn traitors bend and one destroyed a thousand kings defend to apollo making love from monsieur fontenelle by the same i am cried apollo when daphne he wooed and panting for breath the coy virgin pursued when his wisdom in manner most ample expressed the long list of the graces his godship possessed i am the god of sweet song and inspirer of lays nor for lays nor sweet song the fair fugitive stays i am the god of the harp  stop my fairest  in vain nor the harp nor the harper could fetch her again every plant every flower and their virtues i know god of light i am above and of physic below at the dreadful word physic the nymph fled more fast at the fatal word physic she doubled her haste thou fond god of wisdom then alter thy phrase bid her view thy young bloom and thy ravishing rays tell her less of thy knowledge and more of thy charms and my life for it the damsel shall fly to thy arms the fatal curiosity by the same much had i heard of fair francelias name the lavish praises of the babbler fame i thought them such and went prepared to pry and trace the charmer with a critics eye resolved to find some fault before unspyd and disappointed if but satisfied love pierced the vassal heart that durst rebel and where a judge was meant a victim fell on those dear eyes with sweet perdition gay i gazed at once my pride and soul away all over i felt the luscious poison run and in a look the hasty conquest won thus the fond moth around the taper plays and sports and flutters near the treacherous blaze

tale more strange never graced the poets art nor ever did fiction play so wild a part each fabled charm in matchless caelia meets the heavenly colors and ambrosial sweets her virgin bosom chaster fires supplies and beams more piercing guard her kindred eyes overflowing wit the imagined wonder drew but fertile fancy never can reach the true now buds your youth your cheeks their bloom disclose the untainted lilly and unfolding rose ease in your mein and sweetness in your face you speak a siren and you move a grace nor time shall urge these beauties to decay while virtue gives what years shall steal away the fair whose youth can boast the worth of age in age shall with the charms of youth engage in every change still lovely still the same a fairer phoenix in a purer flame a description of the phoenix from claudian by the same in utmost ocean lies a lovely isle where spring still blooms and greens for ever smile which sees the sun put on his first array and hears his panting steeds bring on the day when from the deep they rush with rapid force and whirl aloft to run their glorious course when first appear the ruddy streaks of light and glimmering beams dispel the parting night in these soft shades unprest by human feet the happy phoenix keeps his balmy seat far from the world disjoined he reigns alone alike the empire and its king unknown a godlike bird whose

plain road of sacred wisdom miss led by this constant this unerring guide through flowery paths mans life would smoothly glide but urged by passion heedless we pursue the first mad pleasures that invite the view some avarice and sordid taste inspire ambition some and fames ungoverned fire soft luxury some and cyprian charms delight while all rush forward to the heaven in sight but thou who

sense i lay dust of my parent earth thy breath informed the sleeping clay and called me into birth from thee my parts their fashion took and ere my life begun within the volume of thy book were written one by one thy eye beheld in open view the yet unfinished plan the shadowy lines thy pencil drew and formed the future man o may this frame that rising grew beneath thy plastic hands be studious ever to pursue whatever thy will commands the soul that moves this earthly load thy semblance let it bear nor lose the traces of the god that stamped his image there a sacred lyric on being waked in the night by a violent storm of thunder and lightening locked in the arms of balmy sleep from every care of day as silent as the folded sheep and as secure i lay sudden tremendous thunders

groans for natures end grant me to bear with equal mind these terrors of the sky for ever as thou will resigned alike to live or die if waked by thy vindictive hand this mighty tempest stirs that peal

amidst this time of dread thy suppliants voice to hear o shield from harm each friendly head and all my soul holds dear let it not kill where riot foul pours forth the drunken jest nor where the guiltenvenomd soul starts wild from troubled rest a while o spare those sinful breasts whose deeds the night deform nor strike where smiling virtue rests unconscious of the storm succor the couch where beauty lies all pale with tender fear where sickness lifts its languid eyes o pour thy comforts there nor useless waste this moral night like common hours away but glow with wisdoms sacred light more fair than orient day warned by each flash may virtue rise and with its glories spread while every blasted bud of vice shrinks in new terrors dead so on that awful judgment day whose image shakes the soul though keenest lightenings shoot their ray and loudest thunders roll well pleased o lord each eye shall see those final thunders hurled and mark with joy for love of thee that flash which melts the world a hymn occasioned by the sixtyfifth psalm by js let praise to that almighty sovereign rise who fixed the mountains and who spread the skies who over his works extends paternal care whose kind protection all the nations share from the glad climes whence morn in beauty dressed forth goes rejoicing to the farthest west on him alone their whole dependence lies and his rich mercy every want supplies o thou great author of the extended whole revolving seasons praise thee as they roll by thee spring summer autumn winter rise thou givst the frowning thou the smiling skies by thy command the softening shower distills till genial warmth the teeming furrow fills then favoring sunshine over the clime extends and blessed by thee the verdant blade ascends next springs gay products cloth the flowery hills and joy the wood and joy the valley fills then soon thy bounty swells the golden ear and bids the harvest crown the fruitful year thus all thy works conspicuous worship raise and natures face proclaims her makers praise hymn from psalm viii by the same almighty power amazing are thy ways above our knowledge and above our praise how all thy works thy excellence display how fair how great how wonderful are they thy hand yon wideextended heaven upraisd yon wideextended heaven with stars emblazd where each bright orb since time his course begun has rolled a mighty world or shined a sun stupendous thought how sinks all human race a point an atom in the field of space yet even to us o lord thy care extends thy bounty feeds us and thy power defends yet even to us as delegates of thee thou givst dominion over land and sea whatever or walks on earth or flits in air whatever of life the watery regions bear all these are ours and for the extensive claim we owe due homage to thy sacred name almighty power how wondrous are thy ways how far above our knowledge and our praise trust in god a poem by peter pinnell ma why art thou so full of heaviness o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me   put thy trust in god ps xlii     why droops the head why languishes the eye what mean the flowing tear and frequent sigh where are the lenient medicines to impart their balmy virtue to a bleeding heart fruitless are all attempts for kind relief to mix her cordial and allay my grief so strong my anguish so severe my pain weak is philosophy and reason vain such rules like fuel make my passion glow quicken each pang and point the sting of woe imagination labors but in vain while darkening clouds intoxicate the brain fancy no sweet ideas can suggest to lull the raging tumult in my breast in vain or mirth invites or friendship calls wit dies a jest and conversation palls nature and art supply fresh springs of care and each obtruding thought creates despair no scenes amuse me that amused before and what delighted once delights no more though all creation beautiful appears and natures aspect a rich verdure wears yet still her bloom with sickening eyes i see and all her luxury is lost on me the budding plants of variegated hue the blossoms opening with the morning dew the vernal breeze that gently fans the bowers the laughing meadows and enlivening showers the enameled garden where the works of art give strength to nature and fresh charms impart where gaudy pinks and blushing roses bloom rich in array and pregnant with perfume where flora smiling sees her offspring vie to spread their beauties and regale the eye all all in vain with charms united glow to deck the scene or gild the face of woe so when the morning lark ascending sings while joy attunes his voice and mounts his wings though to his cheerful notes the hills reply and warbling music gladdens all the sky still in his strains no pleasing charms i find no sweet enchantment to compose my mind in vain the sun his gaudy pride displays no genial warmth attends his brightest rays and when his absent light the moon supplies or planets glitter to enrich the skies no gleam of comfort from their luster flows no harbinger of peace or calm repose but gloomy vapors over the night prevail and pestilence is spread in every gale thus weakened by a gradual decay lifes bitter cup i drink without allay nor taste the blessing of one cheerful day come then kind death thy sharpest steel prepare here point the dart and snatch me from despair but stop o man thy plaintive strains suppress with christian patience learn to acquiesce the instructive voice of reason calmly hear and let religion check the flowing tear whatever the will of providence assigns it is infidelity alone repines but those who trust in god disdain to grieve and what our father sends with joy receive whose sharp corrections testify his love and certain blessings in the end will prove who sees how man would err without control afflicts the body to improve the soul and by chastizing part preserves the whole hence though darklowering skies and angry gales conspire to raise the storm and rend the sails yet if calm reason at the helm preside my little bark will stem both wind and tide and adverse currents shall at last convey the shattered vessel to the realms of day thus taught by faith how rash it is and vain for man mere dust and ashes to complain my soul with sad disquietude oppressed directs her flight to heaven in search of rest and refuge takes which peace at last will bring beneath the shadow of the almightys wing on him i fix my mind and place my trust a being infinitely wise and just and should his providence new beams create to brighten the complexion of my fate a cheerful tribute to his throne i will raise and stamp my song with gratitude and praise but should indulgence suit not his designs who evil into happiness refines let due submission make my burden

waters swim over all that through light either skim nay more i gave a loving wife to be the solace of his life a fair one too jove swears and vows he would gladly club for such a spouse for jove we know would now and then by way of frolic act like men the very being of a state consists of small as well as great from first to last there must be ranks mans blessed in all yet gives no thanks to

knighted and then aloud how fame will blab that he is dubbed sir broomstick crab favor at court i have often read intoxicates the wisest head if so ye courtiers by your leave how must a simpleton behave sir crab now hopes to be his grace since he supplies the sceptres place for if a sceptres really good be it of silver gold or wood it is not the matter which we prize in merit all the difference lies merit i have no doubt or why should this great king on me rely last night his generals around him had left him all just as they found him but with my help the godlike man of future

plan and fix the limits  if we can but who shall check our bold career ambition knows of no barrier not rapid ganges deep and wide its bordering kingdoms can divide if so these kingdoms all shall

darkness shuts the sense of sight where sparkles now that florid grace that sat enthroned on natures face that golden flood of glory where that streamed its luster through the air that private

head to every sense of comfort dead with pain reflects attempts to pray and yearns to see the glimpse of day not so the steady tranquil man who acts by reasons virtuous plan no wild fantastic thoughts control the settled firmness of his soul for through the gloomy veil of night he sees a constant sacred light that beams its unremitting ray and changes darkness into day ww  january an ode on yon
