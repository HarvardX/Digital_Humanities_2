the cure of the miliary fever  the cure of the miliary fever  to which is annexed advice to the apothecaries  by charles hales surgeon  you whosoever you are insignizd or not insignizd with the degree of doctor master or bachelor whether skilful in art or by some other privilege promoted pause a while and hear what i have here to say i will show you the truth without any mixture of falsity i will make you understand who proceeds rightly and who unadvisedly  you apothecaries you i say who hitherto have been blind suffer a collyrium to be poured into your eyes and permit them to be anointed with balsam that the most thick skin of blindness may fall from your sight and you behold the truth as in a most clear glass  basil valentine the second edition  london printed for c say in newgatestreet  mdccliv  the preface the miliary fever either in its simple or compound state is the most frequent disease that happens to men women and children of all degrees and almost all ages throughout all seasons of the year in childbed women it is rare to meet with any other fever of consequence notwithstanding hitherto it has been less taken notice of by authors in general is less known by the physicians and apothecaries and its right method of cure less understood than any other acute distemper that afflicts mankind  how to account for this general but unpardonable ignorance i am much at a loss except the prevailing opinion of some physicians that this fever is a creature of our own making and that the eruption is brought forth by the use of too hot medicines i say except that prevailing opinion has run through the whole college and from thence the dangerous infection been conveyed to the apothecaries of whom the greatest part are indeed so very inconsiderate and negligent and so little inquisitive into the nature of distempers that they must of consequence be great strangers to observation and experience the most faithful guides to a right practice of physic i would not romance or speak with malice but can assert with great confidence that i have had an opportunity of discoursing with some physicians and many apothecaries concerning the nature and treatment of this distemper but good god how great their ignorance how unaccountable their stupidity and obstinacy i can hardly forbear blushing when i think of it and yet all the assurance i could give them of my success by word of mouth had no effect they still resolutely persisting in their destructive treatment though half of their patients fell under their hands till i had an opportunity of convincing them by ocular demonstration with how much safety ease and expedition i cured those who were under my own care and almost with as much certainty as intermittents by the bark not more than one in twenty dying except i have been called in at the last stage of the distemper when i found their mittimus already signed during several of my younger years i had an opportunity of attending one of these gentlemen very eminent in his profession and in great practice but all the time i was with him i only once heard mentioned the words miliary fever and those in so slight a manner as not sufficiently to attract my attention but knew nothing of the nature of the distemper or the miliary eruption having not seen one patient who it was said had them although this gentleman had been in the profession twenty years  monstrum horrendum inform ingens cui lumen ademptum  virg and that it is a fever sui generis and altogether as different from other fevers as the measles from the smallpox is with me out of dispute and that it existed long before my time is sufficiently recorded by the testimonies of sir richard blackmore and sir david hamilton the last of whom dr cheyne mentions with great reverence and respect and here i am obliged by many ties to do justice to that very worthy and skilful gentleman sir david hamilton physician lately deceased who in our conjunct attendance on a person of quality in this last distemper the miliary fever did to my great satisfaction so readily foretell every succeeding change and so aptly furnish out a remedy for every accident as did abundantly show it familiar to him and justify the history and method of cure published by him of this tedious and dangerous disease the miliary fever a disease though less common this is a mistake of the doctors through want of observation yet as various and as nice and much more tedious than the smallpox itself cheyne   that the eruption is caused by the use of too hot medicines and regimen i absolutely deny although such method i know will prolong the cure if it does not soon kill the patient for i have often attended poor men women and children who have scarcely had clothes to cover them and have taken no medicines but drank cold water or smallbeer four or five days or longer before i have been called to them and yet this fever according to the best account i could collect has gone through its various symptoms but in a terrible manner even to a very plentiful eruption of the crystalline pustles but by the use of too cold a regimen then almost ready to expire for want of other assistance such as cordial and diaphoretic medicines to conduct them safely through the last stage of the disease which was by such means very soon and surprisingly effected  in the year      this fever in its worst degree was more epidemical than ever i have found it within my time and swept away great numbers of people of all degrees and ages under fifty for few above that age were then seized with it insomuch that the bills of mortality amounted weekly to twelve or fifteen hundred for a considerable time in the beginning of this constitution patients were treated by other practisers as well as myself with bleeding and vomiting indiscriminately blistering early and without mercy sal nitri or saline draughts with or without sal vol c c which were continued four or five days without real advantage and were then changed for conf raleigh which doing no more service than the former was again changed in three or four days more for sal c c pulv serp etc which then brought on delirium and subsultus tendinum symptoms which introduced a succession of blistering plasters from head to foot which were not likely to relieve the patient in any degree so long as the causes of all this mischief too hot medicines were daily repeated till the scene closed in death but which did not frequently happen till the   th  0th or sometimes the   th day with this satisfaction only to their surviving relations and friends that they had as they thought done all that could be done for the deceased although to speak the truth they could not take a more effectual method to remove them out of the world this shocking success which made me almost weary of my profession as i could not avoid thinking that we all treated this fever after a wrong manner obliged me often to think seriously upon the matter and examine many of the best authors who had wrote of fevers i could find nothing in them that suited my purpose and but very few that even mentioned such a fever till dipping into allens synopsis i found that sir david hamiltons treatise upon that subject was my chief dependence i did not know that sir richard blackmore had wrote upon that subject till very lately i accidentally read his discourse of the plague wherein i found a previous account of the miliary fever this i procured and after reading it over and over again with great attention determined to follow the same method in that case with all the patients who should happen afterward to fall under my sole management as i religiously observed the speculative as well as the practical part so did i ever after as happily conduct my patients through every stage of the disease for as before not more than five out of ten lived so now not one in ten died and those only who had some other disease in conjunction with this fever with this inconvenience only that the cure though almost certain was very tedious even  0    or  0 days but happy was i that i had met with even a tedious cure nothing now remained for me to do but farther to consider if it was not practicable to contract the cure within a shorter compass by more powerful medicines and yet such as would by no means aggravate the symptoms whilst i was thus pondering i recollected that my author observed as a favorable prognostic that the drowsier patients are the happier they recover a physician may as certainly take the curative indications from the smallest circumstances of the disease as he does the diagnostic from them sydenham  reasoning with myself upon this principle i luckily hit upon a speedier method which from time to time with the greatest care and attention i altered till i had reduced the cure of this devouring fever to as great certainty as almost any we can boast of in the practice of physic thus i fixed the rule of my practice for the future and which i have continued from that time to this with so much success that for seven years past i confidently affirm i have not lost above four patients out of a hundred of that fever in its simple state nay furthermore for one patient that i have had under my care fifteen days ten have perfectly recovered in two thirds of the time and even in many all dangerous symptoms have been absolutely removed before the eruption appeared which although it may seem strange to most of our profession is nevertheless no more strange than true as they themselves may prove if they diligently observe the nature of the disease and exactly follow the method of cure as i have done before them  for the present purpose i have abstracted from sir david hamilton and sir richard blackmore all that i judge necessary in relation to the description and nature of this fever to which i have added occasional remarks and my own method of cure which by repeated trials and diligent observation i have proved to be more easy speedy and safe than even theirs or any other that i know of if any body shall hereafter publish a better i shall receive the same with as much satisfaction as i communicate mine having nothing more at heart than the service of my profession and the use of all possible means for the public welfare i have taken the liberty to give advice to the apothecaries in general which how much soever i may be censured for it i am sure they stand much in need of at this time of day as their own consciences must undoubtedly tell them for it is not the physicians attendance and prescriptions on which they so much rely that will alone cure diseases there are many other requisites absolutely necessary which of consequence fall to the medicasters share  of the miliary fever by the late learned sir david hamilton fellow of the royal college of physicians and of the royal society as likewise physician in ordinary to her late excellent majesty queen anne the preface i have chosen to describe before all other diseases the nature and method of curing a miliary fever because i know of none who have hitherto treated of this fever as of a different sort at least in any satisfactory way when notwithstanding i have known it in several to turn either into a chronical distemper or in a short time to prove fatal for this sometimes comes to pass in a mild beginning of this distemper from a neglect of themselves or through an impatience of the sick at its long continuance and sometimes also from the ignorance of the physicians being deluded with its fallacious symptoms or lastly through an unreasonable fear the patient will be in no danger on that account now for that sort of fear has been long since banished of being thought greedy of gain they omit continuing their necessary visits wherefore i have thought it a work worthy of my time if by these my observations being diligently collected from the daily inspection or attendance upon sick persons i might afford some light to young practitioners and by these means stir up the more skilful to publish their own and the reader may assuredly believe that i have acted with great veracity  of the miliary fever of the name kind and sorts of this distemper a miliary fever take its name from the pustles or vesicles in some sort resembling the form of gromwel seeds appearing chiefly about the upper parts yet i think it ought rather to be called a vesicular fever because the pustles are vesicles or little blisters filled at first with a limpid serum and afterward with a whitish not unlike to the color of pearls  there are some who think that only the pestilential and spotted fevers ought to be reckoned amongst the malign kind but i am of opinion that there are likewise others of a different species which may very well be referred to the malign class    what kind of fevers soever which are acquired by contact or breathing vapor or any other manner of infection    also those sorts of fevers which immediately from the beginning are accompanied with a violent pain and fixed to some part as to the head or region of the guts or kidneys or even to the limbs like as if the patient should be affected with a pain of the head or a cholic or a nephritic or a gouty or a rheumatic pain or even with the pains like those of childbirth as if the same was an original distemper when notwithstanding such sort are the symptoms of a miliary fever they will not give way to remedies which are wont to be of service when the diseases so named are primary    also in whom the animal spirits are suddenly oppressed and eclipsed and where the aforesaid symptoms seem to depend on no evident cause but on a certain latent poison called by the ancients an occult quality and by the moderns vapors  or lastly where sudden death arises from a cause which seems to be void of danger all which as they denote a malignity so also have i observed the same to happen in a miliary fever  and it is worthy of remark that this fever rages with the same malignity as the petechial or spotted fever in the indies  this kind of fever is twofold simple and compound i call it simple as often as no pustles besides the miliary appear whereof i am going to discourse but compound when red papillary pustules are interspersed with the miliary and which when they are solitary are commonly called a rash and it is farther to be observed that miliary pustules are sometimes intermixed with the smallpox and while the smallpox rises up those gradually wither away but remain standing after the papillary are dried up  a description of the miliary fever that i may the better describe the history of a miliary fever i shall reckon up the antecedents concomitants and consequences  the antecedents are a weak constitution of body whether the same be natural or adventitious caused by immoderate evacuations or too spare diet a serous or watery blood a weak and timorous mind and easily annoyed by external accidents as in women and effeminate men much and deep study or thoughtfulness or sorrow an obstruction or ulcer in any part attended with pain whence those persons who have been long afflicted with a cholic pain gout or stone or an ulcer of the kidneys are more obnoxious to this fever also an inward heat in women with or without thirst and especially about the time of their delivery whereby also the pains of childbearing are less severe than usual and the spirits without any evident cause are very much depressed with an oppression of the breast causing sighs wherein as in all other fevers here also generally happens an external coldness  the concomitants or symptoms accompanying this fever are oftentimes a pain resembling that of the cholic stone of the kidneys pleurisy rheumatism or that of childbirth likewise an oppression of the breast with a sinking of the spirits and two or three days after the said pain is gone off there comes on a shivering of the whole body and then a coldness and an heat alternately arise yet this heat is milder than in a common continual fever and comes nearer to that of natural the palms of the hands are affected with a more intense heat while the backpart is much cooler the pulse also is frequent but weak the spirits often flag very much and the breast being oppressed as it were with a great weight causes sighings the sleep stealing on is suddenly interrupted the most inseparable token of all the symptoms for the patients are often without sleep for many days and nights together this symptom will scarcely or ever be met with if the fever be treated in the manner as hereafter directed without a delirium or a pain of the head and generally much longer than in other fevers i met with a very singular example of this case in a certain lady who was under the care of the learned dr bernard she was a whole month in this fever without sleep yet free of a delirium or any pain in the head  the tongue is sometimes covered over with white aphthoe or a thrush and sometimes like that of persons in health the urine is one while as pale as common water at others of a natural color which symptoms deceiving young physicians make them frequently attribute this effect to the vapors as they term it they who are seized with this fever are some times afflicted with a sickness at stomach especially after sleep and sometimes with a soreness either by their own negligence or a bad practice to wit while heating medicines usual in hysteric paroxysms are prescribed without diaphoretics whence in lieu of a mild procedure of nature expelling the morbific matter by a gentle sweating a rapid fermentation throws down the same into the guts the belly is sometimes bound and sometimes loose with a sickness at the stomach and pains of the bowels one while they are thirsty at others very little sometimes the hands and tongue being stretched out to the physician tremble and the patient speaks in a trembling manner they are also often molested with convulsive motions a delirium and a difficult respiration the exacerbations of which symptoms return like the paroxysms of an intermitting fever an oppression of the breast with sighing or a greater sinking of the spirits without manifest cause watchings and a commotion of the spirits commonly called a hurry in the head as often as the sick compose themselves to sleep as likewise a frequent and weak pulse being conjoined with certain other symptoms are always the forerunners of the miliary pustles at hand and they are all wont to continue till the miliary pustles break out and then the patients are freed from most of them  these pustles generally appear in the breast neck and interstices of the fingers sometimes also in the whole body and after a daily and gradual increase they at last vanish away leaving the skin rough in the seats of the pustles they sometimes itch especially in a complex miliary fever that is where red papillary pustles are mixed with the miliary and it is to be observed that by how much simpler this fever is by so much slighter are the symptoms and which for this very reason frequently creates a neglect both in the unwary physicians and in the patients whereby this fever either becomes more perilous or another disease often arises for by taking less care at first than ought to have been used it sometimes begins with more grievous symptoms as with a sickness of the stomach loss of appetite an inward heat an oppression of the breast sinking of the spirits sighing and irregular returns of heat and cold watchings and the like in the declination of this fever the upper part of the hands are often moistened with a cold sweat  it is very difficult to observe whether the miliary pustles are wont to appear on a certain day seeing the first appearance of this distemper and the patients account of the same are so uncertain but as far as i can learn i take them mostly to appear about the tenth or eleventh day from the beginning if so be the fever have a regular progress and are dried up about the eighteenth or where there is plenty of morbific matter about the twentyfirst or twentysecond day  i have chiefly endeavored to observe the time of the eruption in those women to whom i have been called on the third day after their delivery and have heard them complaining of a shivering or coldness followed with an heat for when i found in looking upon their breast and neck the miliary pustles there i concluded that they had been seized many days before with a miliary fever and upon a strict scrutiny made even from the beginning of the distemper i understood that they had perceived either a preternatural heat or a pain of some part with or without thirst and a vehement oppression of the breast with sighings and a sinking of the spirits before they were brought tobed which symptoms being supposed to depend on the approaching birth they hoped all would be well when it was over moreover although they have the pains of childbirth milder than usual yet the great oppression of the breast in such with the sighing and deficiency of spirits called by the midwives fear and vapors and the quick and weak pulse are sure prognostics of the approaching miliary pustles to whose eruption in childbed women a way is made by their composing in bed to sweat therefore i commonly reckon eleven days from the first inward heat or pain before the birth to the eruption after the birth but the ignorance and preposterous relation the patients give of their own state do for the most part so confound the physicians prognostic that even the most curious cannot find out the very day  the consequences of a miliary fever as far as my observation reaches are a swelling of the thighs legs and feet not always free from pain a swelling and abscess of the breasts an immoderate flux of the lochia and of urine hypocondriac or hystericlike affects an inward heat joined with a weakness faintness and loss of appetite one or other of these i say are generally the consequences as often as this fever either by reason of its own ill nature or bad treatment of the physician makes an unhappy ending the symptoms of the miliary fever in the year      were these shivering or coldness and heat alternately a pain of the head limbs back like the stone in the kidneys belly like the cholic sickness bilious vomiting looseness sinking of the spirits oppression at the breast a moist tongue little thirst the urine of an amber color like that of a person in health a strong full quick pulse at the beginning but three or four days afterward weak low and swift delirium subsultus tendinum difficult respiration the heat milder than in other continual fevers the appearance of the eruption which was chiefly of the crystalline kind did not happen till the   th   th or   th days which i have now reason to believe would have appeared sooner if it had not been retarded by the bad conduct of the patient or nurse or imprudent treatment of the physician     of the prognostic signs in this fever a prognostic is thus to be made in this fever if the sick has not observed a due regimen in the beginning or the physician prescribed heating medicines not raising a sweat although the symptoms were milder from the beginning yet the distemper often turns to the worse and threatens either death or a lingering illness  if some part should be pained from the beginning or the patient grow hot without pain or be sick at the stomach and afterward should have irregular returns of hot and cold fits and a sinking of the spirits and an oppression of the breast with sighings attended with a free breathing and the pustles come out at last with a gentle and continued sweating the case is generally hopeful if a delirium convulsive motions a convulsion or an apoplexy should accompany the pathognomonic signs of the fever that is a great oppression of the breast with sighing and sinking of the spirits and they should happen in the beginning they yield more easily to a regular and diligent practice but in a more advanced state of the distemper and in the declination where the sick is weaker and the miliary pustles either by catching cold or perhaps by an irregular management do not appear a deadly translation is made upon the brain and nerves and death the speedy consequence of it  a yellow color of the urine which suddenly turns pale warns the physician that a translation is to be feared  a looseness in childbed women seized with this fever is a dangerous symptom for it not only hinders the eruption of the pustles but also the flowing of the lochia  a difficult breathing an intercepted speech and a trembling of the tongue are to be ranked amongst the perilous symptoms especially a nervous dyspnaea or difficulty of breathing  the drowsier the patients are the happier they recover  those who are of a milder nature escape more easily than the furious and wrathful tempers do  if nature and the physician concur together the sick immediately recovers strength after the drying up of the pustles unless by reason of the abundance of morbific matter the relics be thrown upon some certain part  if in a scarlet fever miliary pustles should arise dying away with a red color they promise safety  of the miliary fever by sir richard blackmore m d of the miliary fever the miliary fever so called from the small red eruptions that resemble milletseed is the most frequent in this country of all the malignant kind  the patient often seems to himself at first only somewhat faint and indisposed his strength and appetite diminished and his sleep interrupted and his dreams disorderly and tumultuous while he goes abroad and applies to his usual business and hopes his indisposition will soon wear off not suspecting that he nourishes a malignant fever in his bosom at length after about seven or eight days when he has taken to his bed by means of copious and profuse sweats the miliary eruptions before mentioned appear in the temples the neck and breast and sometimes spread over the whole body if the quantity be not great as in the distinct kind of the smallpox they generally presage a happy event but if they are very numerous and cover the whole surface of the skin then like the smallpox of the confluent kind they are often fatal and always dangerous and they are in this too like that sort of smallpox that as i have seen in their ripening they sometimes flow or run into each other there are notwithstanding physicians who to this day ignorantly presage the happiest event from the greatest quantity of pustles of which i have often been an earwitness   these little red eruptions grow by degrees to maturity acquire white heads full of matter and then grow dry and die away which course in the more kindly sort is generally accomplished in seven days but in the worst sort the time is much farther protracted and this happens also in the worst sort of smallpox and it is very remarkable that it sometimes falls out that in this sort of fevers after one eruption of a more malignant kind has completed its course and the skin is cleared of its putrid crop yet a swift troubled pulse great drought and want of spirits shall continue and the physician may be assured that either death or another eruption i a second fever and eruption i likewise know often succeed the first but that is only when the patient has been illtreated or when the continuance of proper medicines for a sufficient time has been obstinately refused like the first is at hand to carry off the matter of the fever which the first was unable wholly to perform and this i have seen repeated the third time and even after that the patient has recovered which but rarely happens  the great and profuse sweats that precede the miliary eruption are by no means such as critically discharge the putrefaction that causes the disease but they arise from the violent conflict and agitation of the blood while the sound and active parts exert their force to digest and expel the matter of the disease and therefore they do not relieve oppressed nature but sink and weaken the spirits by an excessive evacuation this brings to my mind the case of a female patient who at my first visit i found drowning if i may so say in those sweats with an interrupted pulse and the feet and hands growing cold at which i presaged death in a short time the apothecary being told upon enquiry my opinion said he could not see any thing which had that appearance for that she was in a fine breathing sweat and a most sweet sleep but fine and sweet as they were she died in twentyfour hours afterward  which however is necessary that the putrid parts may be excluded from the blood by the miliary eruptions that follow in which consists the critical separation by which nature is delivered and the blood recovers its healthful state as it does by casting out the matter of the smallpox at first complicated and entangled with the mass of blood  some physicians too fond of the cool method in the management of fevers from their observation of the usefulness of that conduct in inflammatory distempers such as the smallpox rheumatisms pleurisies quinsies and st anthonys fire have injudiciously extended it to the cure of malignant cases in which a considerable quantity of the blood is putrefied or perished by the dissolution or separation of the parts as before described but they seem not to act under the guidance of reason but in a mechanical way of practice apply the same method of cure to all sorts of fevers though their nature be ever so much distinguished and hence it is that these gentlemen will not allow that the miliary eruptions are a regular discharge of the feverish matter from the blood but say they they are the effect of an unskilful conduct in using remedies of too hot a nature by which the blood is put into too great a hurry and agitation but this assertion affronts all reason and observation they may as well affirm that the smallpox measles and scarlet suffusions boils and blanes would never appear on the skin were they not produced and excluded by the administration of too warm and active remedies i have often seen those eruptions break out in great abundance where the cool method has been exactly observed and of this every practiser may be soon convinced if he carefully attends to the growth and progress of this distemper in this as in the diseases abovenamed the hurtful matter admitted into the blood is by natures determination to be first concocted and then separated by the strainers of the skin where being entangled and not suffered to perspire it produces a miliary harvest and a physician being but a servant of nature ought to follow her steps promote her intentions and not to turn her from her path and oppose her operations when the opposite practice is made use of by mistake it is manifestly preductive of great evils as when for example the miliary fever is taken for an intermittent saline draughts succeeded by the bark are then not only confidently prescribed but the practiser without hesitation declares the danger entirely over not knowing that he is at once giving a fatal stab to his own reputation and his patients life for death most assuredly and to the surprise of the doctor as well as all about the poor sufferer must soon close the tragedy as when likewise that fever is taken for a cholic the stone in the kidneys or the rheumatism the same fatal issue must be the consequence with this difference only that in these latter cases death makes his approach more slow but more terrible for it is then not uncommon for an abscess to be formed in the breast or belly or other lingering disorders to follow which together with an hectic fever at length finish life  some eminent and worthy physicians of my acquaintance know what i say to be true because they must be sensible how much they have suffered in their reputations by these fatal mistakes particularly by the maladministration of their adored cortex  i could relate many histories of these tragical events but i think these hints are alone sufficient to mark out the dangerous rocks which lie in the way to a safe harbor     when a patient has long struggled with a fever accompanied with putrefaction and after twelve days no miliary breakings out are observed it is usual that small watery bladders from their transparency called crystalline appear in the temples neck and breast which often gradually ripen and become full of matter these perform the office of the former eruptions by freeing the blood of the noxious ferment that disturbs it but not so safely and effectually i must confess that it is a matter of doubt with me whether these bladders do not rather only portend the gangrenous state of some part of the fluids than that they are a critical discharge of the noxious matter any more than the vesications which are usual in gangrenes of the solids free the diseased subject from the impending danger which of consequence threatens the loss of the limb life or both   it is to be observed that there is a fever which i call hypochondriacal or hysteric though it be not ranged in the classes of that disease by any authors as far as i know that by its similitude to the malignant kind often imposes on physicians and induces them to believe that it is of that sort and this is the only true fever of the spirits and which i have often seen it imitates closely the malignant sort in the greatest parts of its symptoms but it differs in this that the exercise of their reason is not interrupted or suspended during its whole course which runs out sometimes to more than twenty days whereas most commonly the head is much if not chiefly affected and the faculties of reason and memory are greatly disturbed and broken in malignant fevers another distinction is that in the first sort the patient is not troubled with looseness or thrush nor do there ever appear in the skin any miliary eruptions or spots of any sort whatsoever but on the contrary in the last kind some putrefied matter is always excluded from the blood and determined to the skin or ought to be so if sufficient force remains in the blood to effect it or if the intention of nature be not reversed by malpractice  it is true that in simple fevers where no parts of the blood are corrupted there needs no critical separation but by sweats and transpiration which cool the feverish flame carry off the offensive matter from the blood and restore nature to its regular constitution but when many parts of the blood are actually mortified how can nature ordinarily be restored to a healthful state without expelling them to the skin can a gangrene in the solid parts be healed till the sound flesh be freed from the mortified fibers no more can the mass of blood be cured till it is cleared and purged from its putrid and perished portions which usually must be done by excluding them from its bosom by friendly sweats or lodging them in the surface of the body i said usually because sometimes this putrid matter may be discharged by the glands or strainers of the guts though that does not often happen for frequently the looseness that at the latter end attends malignant fevers if the patient recovers is taken up by a thrush or sore mouth and hence it appears that the hypochondriacal fever mentioned before has not the essential properties of the malignant and therefore does not arise from putrefaction though it is certain that the malignant kind have at their beginning such a conformity of symptoms and appearances to hypochondriacal passions that it is difficult to discern whether the patient be attacked by a putrid fever or an hysteric disorder or perturbation of the spirits for instance chilness shiverings and rigorous great inquietude vomitings dejection of appetite anxiety sickness and immoderate sweats wakefulness a low weak pulse faintness and great diminution of strength are symptoms common to both and therefore for several days a malignant fever has so near a resemblance to one that is only hysteric that many physicians and standersby i am apt to believe mistake the first for the last and look upon a great and dangerous disease to be only the spleen or a fit of the vapors to the great hazard of the patient  of the cure of the miliary fever by charles hales surgeon of the cure of the simple miliary fever when i am sent for to a patient in a fever i attentively listen to the account he gives of himself without interruption and then carefully examine into the progress of every symptom for by what more compendious or other way can the curative indications or the morbific causes we are to oppose be searched for than by a certain and distinct perception of peculiar symptoms sydenham   from the first seizure i mean from the first hour that he found himself in the least disordered in order to find out with as much certainty as possible the nature of the fever for on that depend the hopes of an expeditious cure although for the most part i can certainly foretell whether or not it will prove of the miliary kind from the pulse alone the moment i touch it which in this case discovers itself to me in a more extraordinary and distinguishing manner than in any other i have ever met with for although in the beginning of the fever in a robust constitution it is sometimes frequent full and vigorous yet it seldoms fails in three or four days to become remarkably swift weak and depressed which also happens in most people at the beginning but these nice distinctions are not to be acquired without long observation and experience arising from constant and unwearied attendance in a multiplicity of practice so that the young practitioner must not only content himself with forming a judgment from the general indications but be particularly careful not to hazard his patients his life of his own own reputation by mistaking the case for an inflammatory nervous or intermittent fever which may easily happen to the unexperienced and unwary for there are found diseases which are reduced under the same genus and name and as to symptoms are like one another yet they are different in their natures and require a different way of cure  the cure whereof had not been now to seek if writers in communicating their experiments and observations had not took one disease for another sydenham    nay to my certain knowledge has often so happened even to many old but very eminent in the profession physicians as well as apothecaries to the destruction of numbers who might otherwise have been now living monuments of their knowledge and success i would therefore by all means advise the young practitioners to stand upon their guard to study nature for the sagacious man hippocrates percei that nature cures diseases and does all being helped by a few simple forms of remedies and sometimes without any sydenham    and pursue her to her most intricate recesses to search out diligently the nature and properties of medicines and to attend indefatigably the poor as well as the rich which will not only teach them to ward off the furious attacks of a most potent enemy but may one time or other prevent themselves and families from falling victims to their own ignorance  from what i have said if any body expects to see a copious and pompous form of remedies he will be much disappointed for i delight in simplicity of medicine for the cure of acute diseases as much as in simple diet for the preservation of health and long life  in my preface i have objected to the method of practice in      for that the sal nitri and saline draughts are too cold and sal vol c c conf raleigh etc are of too hot a nature and quite inconsistent with that moderately cordial and diaphoretic quality necessary in this case therefore cannot by any means he admitted into the rank of remedies for a miliary fever without manifest hazard of prolonging the distemper with dire symptoms it often happens that the face of the disease varies according to the various processes of healing and some symptoms rather proceed from the physician than the disease  sydenham  or death itself what a preposterous fashion have some of our modern physicians crept into a sudden transition from cold to hot or hot to cold either of which not having sufficient efficacy to produce the desired end they agree in consultation the dernier resort to

killing all that he cannot cure it must however be acknowledged that some unable physicians of little sagacity and judgment of a cloudy imagination and whose weak reason is continually puzzled as well as other bold and rash practisers do often increase the distemper and make it more dangerous by an injudicious method and improper remedies and if the patient recovers and nature prevails against the

air observing a proper diet and taking a bolus with some of the julep night and morning for a week longer i have often found but three or four crystalline pustles which however prove the nature and degree of the disease but if any considerable errors have been committed by the sick or those about him then will no eruption appear till about the sixteenth day and that generally of the crystalline kind alone often in great quantity and very large i have seen thousands as big as the largest pins head i have lately seen a child two years of age afflicted with that fever and breeding the teeth

sometimes added five grains of camphire to every bolus with good effect  this method without alteration must be continued till death or a recovery turns the scale if death should take place i know of no better method whereby to prevent it but a recovery will most commonly ensue if all things in this stage of the disease also are faithfully and rightly managed and then security from a relapse depends as i said before in keeping the room proper diet and a continuance of the bolusses and julep night and morning for a week longer when the fever is gone off  if in any stage of the disease a pain of the head becomes very troublesome the application of six or eight leeches to the temples will be not only absolutely necessary but greatly advantageous and so it will also be of consequence at

toast and grated nutmeg in it but no juice of orange or lemon in any drink  if profuse sweats render the linen disagreeable i allow a clean cap shirt and sheets well dried and warmed but then for this purpose the sick must be wrapped up in a warm blanket and carefully laid on another bed in the same room for i am well assured that less mischief will accrue from this change than from the cold air rushing into the bed when all is wet and while they tumble to and fro with great restlessness these sweats being only symptomatical  the plasters upon the feet which i design for continuing blisters

snipping the bladders without tearing off the skin the sores may be dressed every day with a cerate of wax and oil and a little yellow basilicum i used to order equal parts of the plasters but since the college have increased the quantity of flies in the emp vesicat i have been obliged to diminish the quantity of that plaster for my intention is thereby to raise blisters very gradually so that sometimes the plasters may lie on a week with proper effect and without great uneasiness  women and children in general may be treated in the same manner i have directed for men with this difference only that as they are the weaker vessels and of a more delicate texture less doses of medicine with little or no loss of blood except by leeches will best answer the purpose which any practiser who has but a grain of sense may i think judge of and proportionate according to the various symptoms and degrees of the disease and circumstances of the patient without my directions which for every individual would render this account too prolix and tedious and serve only to puzzle and confound the reader and so much for the cure of the simple miliary fever i will now proceed to that called compound  of the cure of the compound miliary fever i call this fever compound when it attacks women with child or in childbed when it is consequent to children breeding their teeth or having a convulsive cough when joined with the confluent smallpox measles scarlet fever an asthma acute rhumatism or the gout or when it is rendered so by a wrong method of cure or imprudent management on one side or the other  when it attacks a woman with child bleeding according to the time of her pregnancy is absolutely necessary in the beginning then the method i have prescribed in general with the

blisters and increased doses of medicine may take place some practitioners think that opiates suppress or retard the lochia but i have always found it otherwise  children breeding their teeth must

to be done in the presence of the fever when that is gone off leaving the rest to be managed by the skilful practitioner as he shall think fit and here as an apology for myself i cannot help quoting a passage from the judicious sydenham one of the worthiest and best men that ever lived  if any one should here object that others that are as much conversant in practice as i are not of my mind it does not concern me to enquire what others think but to propose faithfully my own observations in doing which i beg the readers patience not his favor for the thing itself will shortly show whether i have acted sincerely or whether i have been a manslayer  only i beg pardon for that i have not regarded a pure diction or an elegant style being not at all heedful of nice matters if i only write so as to be clearly understood  advice to the apothecaries i do not take upon me here to give advice to all for i know there are many of you undoubtedly honest generous and judicious who scorn to be guilty of a mean or base action either in public or private but a much greater number in city and country of the opposite character are vilely industrious ignorant and penurious to a sin who set no value upon lives and study nothing so much as amassing money at any rate there is another species of you gentlemen who are men of good natural parts and genteel education have been brought up regularly in pharmacy and by your easy address and engaging behavior attract esteem and command employment in a great number of families but are on the other hand so strangely attached to taverns and public diversions that you have neither time or inclination to make a right progress into the knowledge of diseases or their remedies it is to you of these two last opposite characters that i present my address therefore first of all let me entreat you to be particularly careful in the choice of the best drugs and exact in the composition of your galenicals and chymicals otherwise you hazard your reputation deceive the physician and either kill your patients or prolong the disease till nature at length forcibly gets the better how many people suffer from bad bark rhubarb ipecacoanha jalap castor saffron etc the dead are past telling the tale but you yourselves must be conscious of it or else confess your great ignorance of medicine many of you as i said before are too generous to act so base a part but a great number are penurious to such an excessive degree that although your exorbitant profits exceed those of any other trade or employment in the whole world you would not privately advance a shilling extraordinary to save the life of the most valuable man in the kingdom how many periodical cases bring on chronic diseases and enslave poor mortals to a miserable life by the use of bad bark how do the vital liquids run off in diarhoeas and dysenteries from the use of the worst rhubarb ipecacoanha diascordium etc how much deceived is the physician when the apothecary substitutes a cheaper medicine for a dearer although the price of the dearest would not amount to sixpence a dose lastly how many perish in fevers and linger on with other diseases only for want of good drugs galenicals and chymicals for gods sake gentlemen ye surveyorsgeneral i speak to now who by authority search the apothecaries shops search them narrowly from stem to stern and where you see cause give a severe reprimand though you should forfeit the six shillings which are usually given you like bolusses to ease the pain of your stomachs  the wholesale apothecaries and chemists are often the sources of these terrible disasters who basely sophisticate for the sake of a little profit medicines which circulate not only through this kingdom but many foreign countries and destroy five times more people than would die of distempers in a natural way and the druggists whose principles are little better for vending bad drugs excuse themselves by saying if they buy the devil they must sell the devil but if the apothecaries did not purchase him from time to time they would soon be tired with exposing him to sale  when you have got good medicines i must then beseech you to learn the use of them but hold you must first learn the nature of diseases and know well how to distinguish one from another i speak chiefly to you young ones though the old ones many of them would not do amiss to take my advice for this purpose search out the best authors which will enrich your senses read them over and over again till their most remarkable precepts are strongly impressed on your minds but in the mean time abstain from wine and other strong liquors lest they drown all your reasonable reflections and hurt your memory attend diligently the sick poor as well as the rich for though the latter may best suit your pockets the former will serve you for experimental knowledge which in the end if you have natural good principles will bring you more satisfaction than the mines of mexico but be especially careful in your experiments that you do no harm for that shoud always be your first principle in practice whenever you venture out of the beaten track or even follow the old one go on with caution in giving small doses of a doubtful remedy and be frequent in your visits to see the effect of it then proceed gradually step by step and never quit the disease or the remedy till you are master of both when a physician attends your patients which you too often recommend from i am afraid a just sense of your own inabilities or to swell your bill to a greater bulk dont think that your business is then done for it more nearly concerns you now to attend with diligence as you have a greater work set before you now your timorous mind is set at liberty to inspect narrowly into the nature of the disease the remedies prescribed by the physician and to compare the effects of them with your own practice in the like cases the exorbitant fees of the doctor will seldom admit of more than one visit a day and that at a time when in acute distempers the frightful but informing symptoms of the night are either going or chiefly gone off therefore it is your duty if you have any fellowfeeling for your patient or regard for yourself to be constant in your eveningattendance that thereby you may be ready the next day to give a just account of the patients welfare or sufferings from the disease and the remedy as well as to establish yourself firm in that opinion of the sick by your diligence which coud not be brought about by your judgment alone this will never fail from time to time to advance your reputation till your age and success fix you on a more solid foundation but now presents the dismal scene to do all this you must leave your darling pleasures taverns and bottle companions play houses gaminghouses and other public diversions to advance happily and successfully in your profession and to arrive at the pinnacle of universal good character and esteem you must forego all jovial appointments for the sake sometimes of one patient only and even that a poor one to whom you must perhaps give your advice and medicines gratis who notwithstanding that has a life at stake as valuable in his station as that of an emperor for his family are his loving subjects and his cottage is his kingdom which must all droop and fall to decay after the demise of their only king therefore you must absolutely attend him as diligently as the rich lest by a surmise of neglect you lose more reputation in one day than you will be able to recover by the greatest diligence in many months especially too if you are but just tenterd into life do but succeed though nature does all you will have all the glory but if you miscarry shame and confusion will be your attendants till by time and constant rubbing you are sufficiently burnished to stand the fire of a censorious age this is a long lesson a hard task but be assured from me that you will not have it in your power to make any considerable figure in your profession according to the old phrase till you have no teeth to eat your bread without you pursue the course i have laid down except indeed as sometimes happens you have the luck to have the bread put into your mouths by some well established practitioners who take you into partnership in an early age this is the good fortune of some remarkable boobies who from not being able to get shoes and stockings if they were set on their own legs barefoot begin soon to get an estate while others of merit knowledge and success are obliged to trudge early and late only for the sake of a genteel support  now i have explained the duty which more immediately concerns the apothecary i will give you farther instructions for the benefit of your patients which will not altogether be useless to yourselves  be sure to keep a watchful eye over the sleepy senseless nurses suffer no error or neglect in their conduct to pass unregarded as many of you do to gain their esteem and thence their commendation or otherwise to avoid their weak and low aspersions and ungrounded prejudices pay the same deference also to the mighty knowing midwives who are only a better sort of locusts that will take the bread out of your mouths if you do not smother their errors and proclaim their qualifications but mind this you must be thoroughpacd in your profession and have given repeated proofs of your judgment before you make this hazardous attempt nothing less than a forlorn hope for women are by a sort of infatuation so excessive fond of this sort of creatures who from thence take such liberties that sometimes even in desperate cases they will with an uncommon stock of impudence tell you to your face in their language that sure they have not been so many years nurses or midwives but that they know what belongs to the cure of such and such an ailment better than a young apothecary this you must irresistibly oppose and never leave them till you have fairly proved that they are fools and liars otherwise in return they will much to your disadvantage prove you to be a very ignorant fellow which will soon spread amongst the neighboring women your body guards but then i say you must be conscious that you certainly know how to vanquish the disorder which has set you at variance or must come to a parley upon worse terms but leaving this digression condescend to examine the several liquid foods you have ordered for your patients subsistence be not content with one or two sorts only but have plenty where it can be admitted that the constant supply which is necessary not only for the disease but from the quality of the medicines may not nauseate the stomach and rob you of part of your dependence in the cure of the patient and indeed nothing contributes more to the ease and satisfaction of the sick than choice of liquors properly made for weak stomachs are soon disgusted  as the physician is often discharged so soon as the danger is over the future conduct of the patient lies wholly upon your care therefore now is the time to bestir yourself to procure a perfect recovery by continuing the medicines ordered by the physician for at your peril do not alter them lest by any accident the patient shoud grow worse and you incur the blame i say continue the medicines as long they are absolutely necessary but no longer and take upon you with becoming authority to order the necessary diet from time to time and strictly scrutinize into the execution of your orders which will not only always gain the attention and esteem of the whole family but convince them of your upright intention to prevent a relapse  one thing more i must add and that is this revere the profession to which you belong and treat every member of it who shall deserve it with the utmost marks of sincerity and respect be not reserved but with an engaging air and freedom in your mutual correspondence communicate every thing you know for the public welfare let no good thing be buried in the grave the seat of oblivion be courteous and affable to all mankind especially the sick poor who in their great distress have little else to alleviate their sorrows than your sympathizing nature mild deportment and benevolent hand in short always endeavor to act the part of the real gentleman which if you do not gain riches will generally procure you a contented mind the next step to a happy life  these are the requisites which i have told you in my preface must be joined with the physician and his prescriptions in order to a happy and successful practice but what with the pride inability and selfconceit of many physicians the negligence ignorance and penury of many apothecaries sophistication and villainy of many chemists and druggists i must upon the whole conclude that we are in general in no proper condition to make many great advances or improvements in physic  finis errata preface page vi last line read eruptions p
