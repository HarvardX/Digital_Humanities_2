the citizen of the world or letters from a chinese philosopher residing in london to his friends in the east  volume the first  dublin printed for george and alex ewing mdcclxii  the editors preface the schoolmen had formerly a very exact way of computing the abilities of their saints or authors escobar for instance was said to have learning as five genius as four and gravity as seven caramuel was greater than he his learning was as eight his genius as six and his gravity as thirteen were i to estimate the merits of our chinese philosopher by the same scale i would not hesitate to state his genius still higher but as to his learning and gravity these i think might safely be marked as nine hundred and ninety nine within one degree of absolute frigidity  yet upon his first appearance here many were angry not to find him as ignorant as a tripoline ambassador or an envoy from mujac they were surprised to find a man born so far from london that school of prudence and wisdom endued even with a moderate capacity they expressed the same surprise at hisknowledge that the chinese do at ours le comte vol  p   0 how comes it said they that the europeans so remote from china think with so much justice and precision they have never read our books they scarcely know even our letters and yet they talk and reason just as we do the truth is the chinese and we are pretty much alike different degrees of resinement and not of distance mark the distinctions among mankind savages of the most opposite climates have all but one character of improvidence and apacity and tutored nations however separate make use of the very same methods to procure refined enjoyment  the distinctions of polite nations are few but such as are peculiar to the chinese appear in every page of the following correspondence the metaphors and allusions are all drawn from the east their formality our author carefully preserves many of their favorite tenets in morals are illustrated the chinese are always concise so is he simple so is he the chinese are grave and sententious so is he but in one particular the resemblance is peculiarly striking the chinese are often dull and so is he nor has my assistance been wanting we are told in an old romance of a certain knight errant and his horse who contracted an intimate friendship the horse most usually bore the knight but in cases of extraordinary dispatch the knight returned the favor and carried his horse thus in the intimacy between my author and me he has usually given me a lift of his eastern sublimity and i have sometimes given him a return of my colloquial ease  yet it appears strange in this season of panegyric when scarce an author passes unpraised either by his friends or himself that such merit as our philosophers should be forgotten while the epithets of ingenious copious elaborate and refined are lavished among the mob like medals at a coronation the lucky prizes fall on every side but not one on him i could on this occasion make myself melancholy by considering the capriciousness of public taste or the mutability of fortune but during this fit of morality lest my reader should sleep i will take a nap myself and when i awake tell him my dream  i imagined the thames was frozen over and i stood by its side several booths were erected upon the ice and i was told by one of the spectators that fashion fair was going to begin he added that every author who would carry his works there might probably find a very good reception i was resolved however to observe the humors of the place in safety from the shore sensible that ice was at best precarious and having been always a little cowardly in my sleep  several of my acquaintance seemed much more hardy than i and went over the ice with intrepidity some carried their works to the fair on sledges some on carts and those which were more voluminous were conveyed in wagons their temerity astonished me i knew their cargoes were heavy and expected every moment they would have gone to the bottom they all entered the fair however in safety and each soon after returned to my great surprise highly satisfied with his entertainment and the bargains he had brought away  the success of such numbers at last began to operate upon me if these cried i meet with favor and safety some luck may perhaps for once attend the unfortunate i am resolved to make a new adventure the furniture frippery and fireworks of china have long been fashionably bought up i will try the fair with a small cargoe of chinese morality if the chinese have contributed to vitiate our taste i will try how far they can help to improve our understanding but as others have driven into the market in wagons i will cautiously begin by venturing with a wheelbarrow thus resolved i baled up my goods and fairly ventured when upon just entering the fair i fancied the ice that had supported an hundred wagons before cracked under me and wheelbarrow and all went to the bottom  upon awaking from my reverie with the fright i cannot help wishing that the pains taken in giving this correspondence an english dress had been employed in contriving new political systems or new plots for farces i might then have taken my station in the world either as a poet or a philosopher and made one in those little societies where men club to raise each others reputation but at present i belong to no particular class i remember one of those solitary animals that has been forced from its forest to gratify human curiosity my earliest wish was to escape unheeded through life but i have been set up for halfpence to fret and scamper at the end of my chain though none are injured by my rage i am naturally too savage to court any friends by fawning too obstinate to be taught new tricks and too improvident to mind what may happen i am appeased though not contented too indolent for iatrigue and too timid to push favor i am  but what signifies what i am    fortune and hope adieu i see my port too long your dpe be others now your sport letters from a citizen of the world to his friends in the east letter i to mr  merchant in london amsterdam sir yours of the   th instant

frequently conversing with english there he has learned the language though entirely a stranger to their manners and customs i am told he is a philosopher i am sure he is an honest man that to you will be his best recommendation next to the consideration of his being the friend of sir  yours etc  letter ii land from lien cbi altangi to  merchant in amsterdam friend of my heart may the wings of peace rest upon thy dwelling and the shield of conscience preserve thee from vice and misery for all thy favors accept my gratitude and esteem the only tributes a poor philosophic wanderer can return sure fortune is resolved to make me unhappy when she gives others a power of testifying their friendship by actions and leaves me only words to express the sincerity of mine  i am perfectly sensible of the delicacy by which you endeavor to lessen your own merit and my obligations by calling your late instances of friendship only a return  former favors you would induce me to impute to your justice what i owe to your generosity  the services i did you at canton justice humanity and my office bade me perform those you have done me since my arrival at amsterdam no laws obliged you to no justice required even half your favors would have been greater than my most sanguine expectations  the sum of money therefore which you privately conveyed into my baggage when i was leaving holland and which i was ignorant of till my arrival in london i must beg leave to return you have been bred a merchant and l a scholar you consequently love money better than i you can find pleasure in superfluity i am perfectly contented with what is sufficient take therefore what is yours it may give you some pleasure even though you have no occasion to use it my happiness it cannot improve for i have already all that i want  my passage by sea from rotterdam to england was more painful to me than all the journies i ever made on land i have traversed the immeasurable wilds of mogul tartary felt all the rigours of siberian skies i have had my repose an hundred times disturbed by invading savages and have seen without shrinking the desert sands rise like a troubled ocean all around me against these calamities i was armed with resolution but in my passage to england though nothing occurred that gave the mariners any uneasiness yet to one who was never at sea before all was a subject of astonishment and terror to find the land disappear to see our ship mount the waves quick as an arrow from the tartar bow to hear the wind howling through the cordage to feel a sickness which depresses even the spirits of the brave these were unexpected distresses and consequently assaulted me unprepared to receive them  you men of europe think nothing of a voyage by sea with us of china a man who has been from sight of land is regarded upon his return with admiration i have known some provinces where there is not even a name for the ocean what a strange people therefore am i got amongst who have founded an empire on this unstable element who build cities upon billows that rise higher than the mountains of tipartala and make the deep more formidable than the wildest tempest  such accounts as these i must confess were my first motives for seeing england these induced me to undertake a journey of seven hundred painful days in order to examine into opulence buildings sciences arts and manufactures on the spot judge then how great is my disappointment on entering london to see no signs of that opulence so much talked of abroad wherever i turn i am presented with a gloomy solemnity in the houses the streets and the inhabitants none of that beautiful gilding which makes a priacipal ornament in chinese architecture the streets of nankin are sometimes strewed with goldleaf very different are those of london in the midst of their pavements a great lazy puddle moves muddily along heavy laden machines with wheels of unweildy thickness crowd up every passage so that a stranger instead of finding time for observation is often happy if he has time to escape from being crushed to pieces  the houses borrow very few ornaments from architecture their chief decoration seems to be a paltry piece of painting hung out at the doors or windows at once a proof of their indigence and vanity their vanity in each having one of those pictures exposed to public view and their indigence in being unable to get them better painted in this respect the fancy of their painters is also deplorable could you believe it i have seen five black lions and three blue boars in less than a circuit of half a mile and yet you know that animals of these colors are no where to be found except in the wild imaginations of europe  from these circumstances in their buildings and from the dismal look of the inhabitants i am induced to conclude that the nation is actually poor and that like the persians they make a splendid figure every where but at home the proverb of xixofou is that a mans riches may be seen in his eyes if we judge of the english by this rule there is not a poorer nation under the sun  i have been here but two day so will not be hasty in my decisions such letters as i shall write to fipsihi in moscow i beg you will endeavor to forward with all diligence i shall send them open in order that you may take copies or translations as you are equally versed in the dutch and chinese languages dear friend think of my absence with regret as i sincerely regret yours even while i write i lament our separation  farewell letter iii from lien chi altangi to the care of fipsihi resident in moscow to be forwarded by the russian caravan to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial academy at pekin in china think not o thou guide of my youth that absence can impair my respect or interposing trackless deserts blot your reverend figure from my memory the farther i travel i feel the pain of separation with stronger force those ties that bind me to my native country and you are still unbroken by every remove i only drag a greater length of chain  could i find aught worth transmitting from so remote a region as this to which i have wandered i should gladly send it but instead of this you must be contented with a renewal of my former professions and an imperfect account of a people with whom i am as yet but superficially acquainted the remarks of a man who has been but three days in the country can only be those obvious circumstances which force themselves upon the imagination i consider myself here as a newly created being introduced into a new world every object strikes with wonder and surprise the imagination still unsated seems the only active principle of the mind the most trifling occurrences give pleasure till the gloss of novelty is worn away when i have ceased to wonder i may possibly grow wise i may then call the reasoning principle to my aid and compare those objects with each other which were before examined without reflection  behold me then in london gazing at the strangers and they at me it seems they find somewhat absurd in my figure and had i been never from home it is possible i might find an infinite fund of ridicule in theirs but by long traveling i am taught to laugh at folly alone and to find nothing truly ridiculous but villainy and vice  when i had just quitted my native country and crossed the chinese wall i fancied every deviation from the customs and manners of china was a departing from nature i smiled at the blue lips and red foreheads of the tonguese and could hardly contain when i saw the daures dress their heads with horns the ostiacs powdered with red earth and the calmuck beauties tricked out in all the finery of sheepskin appeared highly ridiculous but i soon perceived that the ridicule lay not in them but in me that i falsely condemned others of absurdity because they happened to differ from a standard originally founded in prejudice or partiality  i find no pleasure therefore in taxing the english with departing from nature in their external appearance which is all i yet know of their character it is possible they only endeavor to improve her simple plan since every extravagance in dress proceeds from a desire of becoming more beautiful than nature made us and this is so harmless a vanity that i not only pardon but approve it a desire to be more excellent than others is what actually makes us so and as thousands find a livelihood in society by such appetites none but the gnorant inveigh against them  you are not insensible most reverend fum hoam what numberless trades even among the chinese subsist by the harmless pride of each other your noseborers feet swathers toothstainers eyebrow pluckers would all want bread should their neighbors want vanity these vanities however employ much fewer hands in china than in england and a fine gentleman or a fine lady here dressed up in the fashion seems scarcely to have a single limb that does not suffer some distortions from art  to make a fine gentleman several trades are required but chiefly a barber you have undoubtedly heard of the jewish champion whose strength lay in his hair one would think that the english were for placing all wisdom there to appear wise nothing more is requisite here than for a man to borrow hair from the heads of all his neighbors and clap it like a bush on his own the distributors of law and physic stick on such quantities that it is almost impossible even in idea to distinguish between the head and the hair  those whom i have now been describing affect the gravity of the lion those i am going to describe more resemble the pert vivacity of smaller animals the barber who is still master of the ceremonies cuts their hair close to the crown and then with a composition of meal and hogs lard plasters the whole in such a manner as to make it impossible to distinguish whether the patient wears a cap or a plaster but to make the picture more perfectly striking conceive the tail of some beast a greyhounds tail or a pigs tail for instance appended to the back of the head and reaching down to that place where tails in other animals are generally seen to begin thus betailed and bepowdered the man of taste fancies he improves in beauty dresses up his hardfeatured face in smiles and attempts to look hideously tender thus equipped he is qualified to make love and hopes for success more from the powder on the outside of his head than the sentiments within  yet when i consider what sort of a creature the fine lady is to whom he is supposed to pay his addresses it is not strange to find him thus equipped in order to please she is herself every whit as ond of powder and ils and hogs lard as he to speak my secret sentiments most reverend fum the ladies here are horridly ugly i can hardly endure the sight of them they no way resemble the beauties of china the europeans have a quite different idea of beauty from us when i reflect on the small footed perfections of an eastern beauty how is it possible i should have eye for a woman whose feet are ten inches long i shall never forget the beauties of my native city of nangfew how very broad their faces how very short their noses how very little their eyes how very thin their lips how very black their teeth the snow on the tops of bao is not fairer than their cheeks and their eyebrows are small as the line by the pencil of quamsi here a lady with such perfections would be frightful dutch and chinese beauties indeed have some resemblance but english women are entirely different red cheeks big eyes and teeth of a most odious whiteness are not only seen here but wished for and then they have such masculine feet as actually serve some for walking  yet uncivil as nature has been they seem resolved to outdo her in unkindness they use white powder blue powder and black powder for their hair and a red powder for the face on some particular occasions  they like to have the face of various colors as among the tartars of koreki frequently sticking on with spittle little black patches on every part of it except on the tip of the nose which i have never seen with a patch you will have a better idea of their manner of placing these spots when i have finished a map of an english face patched up to the fashion which shall shortly be sent to increase your curious collection of paintings medals and monsters  but what surprises more than all the rest is what i have just now been credibly informed by one of this country most ladies here says he have two faces one face to sleep in and another to show in company the first is generally reserved for the husband and family at home the other put on to please strangers abroad the family face is often indifferent enough but the outdoor one looks omething better this is always made at the toilet where the lookingglass and toadeater sit in council and settle the complexion of the day  i cannot ascertain the truth of this remark however it is actually certain that they wear more clothes within doors than without and i have seen a lady who seemed to shudder at a breeze in her own appartment appear half naked in the streets  farewell letter iv to the same the english seem as silent as the japonese yet vainer than the inhabitants of siam upon my arrival i attributed that reserve to modesty which i now find has its origin in pride condescend to address them first and you are sure of their acquaintance stoop to flattery and you conciliate their friendship and esteem they bear hunger cold fatigue and all the miseries of life without shrinking danger only calls forth their fortitude they even exult in calamity but contempt is what they cannot bear an englishman fears contempt more than death he often flies to death as a refuge from its pressure and dies when he fancies the world has ceased to esteem him  pride seems the source not only of their national vices but of their national virtues also an englishman is taught to love his king as his friend but to acknowledge no other master than the laws which himself has contributed to enact he despises those nations who that one may be free are all content to be slaves who first lift a tyrant into terror and then shrink under his power as if delegated from heaven liberty is ecchoed in all their assemblies and thousands might be found ready to offer up their lives for the sound though perhaps not one of all the number understands its meaning the lowest mechanic however looks upon it as his duty to be a watchful guardian of his countrys freedom and often uses a language that might seem haughty even in the mouth of the great emperor who traces his ancestry to the moon  a few days ago passing by one of their prisons i could not avoid stopping in order to listen to a dialogue which i thought might afford me some entertainment the conversation was carried on between a debtor through the grate of his prison a porter who had stopped to rest his burden and a soldier at the window the subject was upon a threatened invasion from france and each seemed extremely anxious to rescue his country from the impending danger  for my part cries the prisoner the greatest of my apprehensions is for our freedom if the french should conquer what would become of english liberty my dear friends liberty is the englishmans prerogative we must preserve that at the expense of our lives of that the french shall never deprive us it is not to be expected that men who are slaves themselves would preserve our freedom should they happen to conquer ay slaves cries the porter they are all slaves fit only to carry burdens every one of them before i would stoop to slavery may this be my poison and he held the goblet in his hand may this be my poison  but i would sooner list for a soldier  the soldier taking the goblet from his friend with much awe servently cried out it is not so much our liberties as our religion that would suffer by such a change ay our religion my lads may the devil sink me into flames such was the solemnity of his adjuration if the french should come over but our religion would be utterly undone so saying instead of a libation he applied the goblet to his lips and confirmed his sentiments with a ceremony of the most persevering devotion  in short every man here pretends to be a politician even the fair sex are sometimes found to mix the severity of national altercation with the blandishments of love and often become conquerors by more weapons of destruction than their eyes  this universal passion for politics is gratified by daily gazettes as with us at china but as in ours the emperor endeavors to instruct his people in theirs the people endeavor to instruct the administration you must not however imagine that they who compile these papers have any actual knowledge of the politics or the government of a state they only collect their materials from the oracle of some coffeehouse which oracle has himself gathered them the night before from a beau at a gaming table who has pillaged his knowledge from a great mans porter who has had his information from the great mans gentleman who has invented the whole story for his own amusement the night preceding  the english in general seem fonder of gaining the esteem than the love of those they converse with this gives a formality to their amusements their gayest conversations have something too wise for innocent relaxation though in company you are seldom disgusted with the absurdity of a fool you are seldom lifted into rapture by those strokes of vivacity which give instant though not permanent pleasure  what they want however in gaiety they make up in politeness you smile at hearing me praise the english for their politeness you who have heard very different accounts from the missionaries at pekin who have seen such a different behavior in their merchants and seamen at home but i must still repeat it the english seem more polite than any of their neighbors their great art in this respect lies in endeavoring while they oblige to lessen the force of the favor other countries are ond of obliging a stranger but seem desirous that he should be sensible of the obligation the english confer their kindness with an appearance of indifference and give away benefits with an air as if they despised them  walking a few days ago between an english and a frenchman into the suburbs of the city we were overtaken by a heavy shower of rain i was unprepared but they had each large coats which defended them from what seemed to me a perfect inundation the englishman seeing me shrink from the weather accosted me thus  psha man what do shrink at here take this coat i dont want it i find it no way useful to me i had as lief be without it the frenchman began to show his politeness in turn  my dear friend cries he  why went you oblige me by making use of my coat you see how well it defends me from the rain i should not choose to part with it to others but to such a friend as you i could even part with my skin to do him service  from such minute instances as these most reverend fum hoam i am sensible your sagacity will collect instruction the volume of nature is the book of knowledge and he becomes most wise who makes the most judicious selection  farewell letter v to the same i have already informed you of the singular passion of this nation for politics an englishman not satisfied with finding by his own prosperity the contending powers of europe properly balanced desires also to know the precise value of every weight in either scale to gratify this curiosity a leaf of political instruction is served up every morning with tea when our politician has feasted upon this he repairs to a coffeehouse in order to ruminate upon what he has read and increase his collection from thence he proceeds to the ordinary enquires what news and treasuring up every acquisition there hunts about all the evening in quest of more and carefully adds it to the rest thus at night he retires home full of the important advices of the day when lo awaking next morning he finds the instructions of yesterday a collection of absurdity or palpable falsehood this one would think a mortifying repulse in the pursuit of wisdom yet our politician no way discouraged hunts on in order to collect fresh materials and in order to be again disappointed  i have often admired the commercial spirit which prevails over europe have been surprised to see them carry on a traffic with productions that an asiatic stranger would deem entirely useless it is a proverb in china that an european suffers not even his spittle to be lost the maxim however is not sufficiently strong since they ell even their lies to great advantage every nation drives a considerable trade in this commodity with their neighbors  an english dealer in this way for instance has only to ascend to his workhouse and manufacture a turbulent speech averred to be spoken in the senate or a report supposed to be dropped at court a piece of scandal that strikes at a popular mandarine or a secret treaty between two neighboring powers when finished these goods are baled up and consigned to a factor abroad who sends in return two battles three sieges and a shrewd letter filled with dashes  blanks  and stars  of great importance  thus you perceive that a single gazette is the joint manufacture of europe and he who would peruse it with a philosophical eye might perceive in every paragraph something characteristick of the nation to which it belongs a map does not exhibit a more distinct view of the boundaries and situation of every country than its news does a picture of the genius and the morals of its inhabitants the superstition and erroneous delicacy of italy the formality of spain the cruelty of portugal the fears of austria the confidence of prussia the levity of france the avarice of holland the pride of england the absurdity of ireland and the national partiality of scotland are all conspicuous in every page  but perhaps you may find more satisfaction in a real news paper than in my description of one i therefore send a specimen which may serve to exhibit the manner of their being written and distinguish the characters of the various nations which are united in its composition  naples we have lately dug up here a curious etruscan monument broke in two in the raising the characters are scarce visible but nugosi the learned antiquary supposes it to have been erected in honor of picus a latin king as one of the lines may be plainly distinguished to begin with a p it is hoped this discovery will produce something valuable as the literati of our twelve academies are deeply engaged in the disquisition  pisa since father fudgi prior of st gilberts has gone to reside at rome no miracles have been performed at the shrine of st gilbert the devout begin to grow uneasy and some begin actually to fear that st gilbert has forsaken them with the reverend father  lucca the administrators of our serene republic have frequent conferences upon the part they shall take in the present commotions of europe some are for sending a body of their troops consisting of one company of foot and six horsemen to make a diversion in favor of the empressqueen others are as strenuous assertors of the prussian interest what turn these debates may take time only can discover however certain it is we shall be able to bring into the field at the opening of the next campaign seventyfive armed men a commander in chief and two drummers of great experience  spain yesterday the new king showed himself to his subjects and after having staid half an hour in his balcony retired to the royal apartment the night concluded on this extraordinary occasion with illuminations and other demonstrations of joy  the queen is more beautiful than the rising sun and reckoned one of the first wits in europe she had a glorious opportunity of displaying the readiness of her invention and her skill in repartee lately at court the duke of lerma coming up to her with a low bow and a smile and presenting a nosegay set with diamonds madam cries he i am your most obedient humble servant oh sir replies the queen without any prompter or the least hesitation i am very proud of the very great honor you do me upon which she made a very low curtesy and all the courtiers fell a laughing at the readiness and the smartness of her reply  lisbon yesterday we had an auto da fe at which were burned three young women accused of heresy one of them of exquisite beauty two jews and an old woman convicted of being a witch one of the friars who attended this last reports that he saw the devil fly out of her at the stake in the shape of a flame of fire the populace behaved on this occasion with great good humor joy and sincere devotion  our merciful sovereign has been for some time past recovered of his fright though so attrocious an attempt deserved to exterminate half the nation yet he has been graciously pleased to spare the lives of his subjects and not above five hundred have been broke

them all to flight and took the rest prisoners of war  berlin we have received certain advices that a party of twenty thousand prussians having attacked a much superior body of austrians put them to flight and took a great number of prisoners with their military chest cannon and baggage  though we have not succeeded this campaign to our wishes yet when we think of him who commands us we rest in

kobi or giving lessons of politeness to the savage inhabitants of europe in whatever country whatever climate and whatever circumstances all hail may tien the universal soul take you under his protection and inspire you with a superior portion of himself  how long my friend shall an enthusiasm for knowledge continue to obstruct your happiness and tear you from all the connexions that make life pleasing how long will you continue to rove from climate to climate circled by thousands and yet without a friend feeling all the inconveniences of a crowd and all the anxiety of being alone  i know you will reply that the refined pleasure of growing every day wiser is a sufficient recompense for every inconvenience i know you will talk of the vulgar satisfaction of soliciting happiness from sensual enjoyment only and probably enlarge upon the exquisite raptures of sentimental bliss yet believe me friend you are deceived all our pleasures though seemingly never so remote from sense derive their origin from some one of the senses the most exquisite demonstration in mathematics or the most pleasing disquisition in metaphysics if it does not ultimately tend to increase some sensual satisfaction is delightful only to fools or to men who have by long habit contracted a false idea of pleasure and he who separates sensual and sentimental enjoyments seeking happiness from mind alone is in fact as wretched as the naked inhabitant of the forest who places all happiness in the first regardless of the latter there are two extremes in this respect the savage who swallows down the draught of pleasure without staying to reflect on his happiness and the sage who passes the cup while he reflects on the conveniences of drinking  it is with an heart full of sorrow my dear altangi that i must inform you that what the world calls happiness must now be yours no longer our great emperors displeasure at your leaving china contrary to the rules of our government and the immemorial custom of the empire has produced the most terrible effects your wife daughter and the rest of your family have been seized by his order and appropriated to his use all except your son are now the peculiar property of him who possesses all him i have hidden from the officers employed forthis purpose and even at the hazard of my life i have concealed him the youth seems obstinately bent on finding you out wherever you are he is determined to face every danger that opposes his pursuit though yet but fifteen all his fathers virtues and obstinacy sparkle in his eyes and mark him as one destined to no mediocrity of fortune  you see my dearest friend what imprudence has brought thee to from opulence a tender family surrounding friends and your masters esteem it has reduced thee to want persecution and still worse to our mighty monarchs displeasure want of prudence is too frequently the want of virtue nor is there on earth a more powerful advocate for vice than poverty as i shall endeavor to guard thee from the one so guard thyself from the other and still think of me with affection and esteem  farewell letter vii from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial academy at pekin in china the editor thinks proper to acquaint the reader that the greatest part of the following letter seems to him to be little more than a rhapsody of sentences borrowed from confucius the chinese philosopher  a wife a daughter carried into captivity to expiate my offense a son scarce yet arrived at maturity resolving to encounter every danger in the pious pursuit of one who has undone him these indeed are circumstances of distress though my tears were more precious than the gem of golconda yet would they fall upon such an occasion  but i submit to the stroke of heaven i hold the volume of confucius in my hand and as i read grow humble and patient and wise we should eel sorrow says he but not sink under its oppression the heart of a wise man should resemble a mirror which reflects every object without being sullied by any the wheel of fortune turns incessantly round and who can say within himself i shall to day be uppermost we should hold the immutable mean that lies between insensibility and anguish our attempts should be not to extinguish nature but to repress it not to stand unmoved at distress but endeavor to turn every disaster to our own advantage our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising every time we fall  i fancy myself at present o thou reverend disciple of tao more than a match for all that can happen the chief business of my life has been to procure wisdom and the chief object of that wisdom was to be happy my attendance on your lectures my conferences with the missionaries of europe and all my subsequent adventures upon quitting china were calculated to increase the sphere of my happiness not my curiosity let european travelers cross seas and deserts merely to measure the height of a mountain to describe the cataract of a river or tell the commodities which every country may produce merchants or geographers perhaps may find profit by such discoveries but what advantage can accrue to a philosopher from such accounts who is desirous of understanding the human heart who seeks to know the men of every country who desires to discover those differences which result from climate religion education prejudice and partiality  i should think my time very ill bestowed were the only fruits of my adventures to consist in being able to tell that a tradesman of london lives in a house three times as high as that of our great emperor that the ladies wear longer clothes than the men that the priests are dressed in colors which we are taught to detest and that their soldiers wear scarlet which is with us the symbol of peace and innocence how many travelers are there who confine their relations to such minute and useless particulars for one who enters into the genius of those nations with whom he has conversed who discloses their morals their opinions the ideas which they entertain of religious worship the intrigues of their ministers and their skill in sciences there are twenty who only mention some idle particulars which can be of no real use to a true philosopher all their remarks tend neither to make themselves nor others more happy they no way contribute to control their passions to bear adversity to inspire true virtue or  a detestation of vice  men may be very learned and yet very miserable it is easy to be a deep geometrician or a sublime astronomer but very difficult to be a good man i esteem therefore the traveller who instructs the heart but despise him who only indulges the imagination a man who leaves home to mend himself and others is a philosopher but he who goes from country to country guided by the blind impulse of curiosity is only a vagabond from zerdusht down to him of tyanea i honor all those great names who endeavored to unite the world by their travels such men grew wiser as well as better the farther they departed from home and seemed like rivers whose streams are not only increased but refined as they travel from their source  for my own part my greatest glory is that traveling has not more steeled my constitution against all the vicissitudes of climate and all the depressions of fatigue than it has my mind against the accidents of fortune or the accesses of despair  farewell letter viii from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial acdemy at pekin in china how insupportable oh thou possessor of heavenly wisdom would be this separation this immeasurable distance from my friends were i not able thus to delineate my heart upon paper and to send thee daily a map of my mind  i am every day better reconciled to the people among whom i reside and begin to fancy that in time i shall find them more opulent more charitable and more hospitable than i at first imagined i begin to learn somewhat of their manners and customs and to see reasons for several deviations which they make from us from whom all other nations derive their politeness as well as their original  in spite of taste in spite of prejudice i now begin to thnk their women tolerable i can now look on a languishing blue eye without disgust and pardon a set of teeth even though whiter than ivory i now begin to fancy there is no universal standard for beauty the truth is the manners of the ladies in this city are so very open and so vastly engaging that i am inclined to pass over the more glaring defects of their persons since compensated by the more solid yet latent beauties of the mind what though they want black teeth or are deprived of the allurements of feet no bigger than their thumbs yet still they have souls my friend such souls so free so pressing so hospitable and so engaging  i have received more invitations in the streets of london from the sex in one night than i have met with at pekin in twelve revolutions of the moon  every evening as i return home from my usual solitary excursions i am met by several of those well disposed daughters of hospitality at different times and in different streets richly dressed and with minds not less noble than their appearance you know that nature has indulged me with a person by no means agreeable yet are they too generous to object to my homely appearance they feel no repugnance at my broad face and flat nose they perceive me to be a stranger and that alone is a sufficient recommendation they even seem to think it their duty to do the honors of the country by every act of complaisance in their power one takes me under the arm and in a manner forces me along another catches me round the neck and desires to partake in this office of hospitality while a third kinder still invites me to refresh my spirits with wine wine is in england reserved only for the rich yet here even wine is given away to the stranger  a few nights ago one of those generous creatures dressed all in white and flaunting like a meteor by my side forcibly attended me home to my own apartment she seemed charmed with the elegance of the furniture and the convenience of my situation and well indeed she might for i have hired an apartment for not less than two shillings of their money every week but her civility did not rest here for at parting being desirous to know the hour and perceiving my watch out of order she kindly took it to be repaired by a relation of her own which you may imagine will save some expense and she assures me that it will cost her nothing i shall have it back in a few days when mended and am preparing a proper speech expressive of my gratitude on the occasion celestial excellence i intend to say happy i am in having found out after many painful adventures a land of innocence and a people of humanity i may rove into other climes and converse with nations yet unknown but where shall i meet a soul of such purity as that which resides in thy breast sure thou have been nurtured by the bill of the shin shin or sucked the breasts of the provident gin hiung the melody of thy voice could rob the chong fou of her whelps or inveigle the  that lives in the midst of the waters thy servant shall ever retain a sense of thy favors and one day boast of thy virtue sincerity and truth among the daughters of china  adieu letter ix to the same i have been deceived she whom i fancied a daughter of paradise has proved to be one of the infamous disciples of han i have lost a trifle i have gained the consolation of having discovered a deceiver i once more therefore relax into my former indifference with regard to the english ladies they once more begin to appear disagreeable in my eyes thus is my whole time passed in forming conclusions which the next minutes experience may probably destroy the present moment becomes a comment on the past and i improve rather in humility than wisdom  their laws and religion forbid the english to keep more than one woman i therefore concluded that prostitutes were banished from society i was deceived every man here keeps as many wives as he can maintain the laws are cemented with blood praised and disregarded the very chinese whose religion allows him two wives takes not half the liberties of the english in this particular their laws may be compared to the books of the sybils they are held in great veneration but seldom read or seldomer understood even those who pretend to be their guardians dispute about the meaning of many of them and confess their ignorance of others the law therefore which commands them to have but one wife is strictly observed only by those for whom one is more than sufficient or by such as have not money to buy two as for the rest they violate it publicly and some glory in its violation they seem to think like the persians that they give evident marks of manhood by increasing their seraglio a mandarine therefore here generally keeps four wives a gentleman three and a stage player two as for the magistrates the country justices and squires they are employed first in debauching young virgins and then punishing the transgression  from such a picture you will be apt to conclude that he who employs four ladies for his amusement has four times as much constitution to spare as he who is contented with one that a mandarine is much cleverer than a gentleman and a gentleman than a player and yet it is quite the reverse a mandarine is frequently supported on spindle shanks appears emaciated by iuxury and is obliged to have recourse to variety merely from the weakness not the vigor of his constitution the number of his wives being the most equivocal symptom of his virility  beside the country squire there is also another set of men whose whole employment consists in corrupting beauty these the silly part of the fair sex call amiable the more sensible part of them however give them the title of abominable you will probably demand what are the talents of a man thus caressed by the majority of the opposite sex what talents or what beauty is he possessed of superior to the rest of his fellows to answer you directly he has neither talents nor beauty but then he is possessed of impudence and assiduity with assiduity and impudence men of all ages and all figures may commence admirers i have even been told of some who made professions of expiring for love when all the world could perceive they were going to die of old age and what is more surprising still such battered beaus are generally most infamously successful  a fellow of this kind employs three hours every morning in dressing his head by which is understood only his hair  he is a professed admirer not of any particular lady but of the whole sex  he is to suppose every lady has caught cold every night which gives him an opportunity of calling to see how she does the next morning  he is upon all occasions to show himself in very great pain for the ladies if a lady drops even a pin he is to fly in order to present it  he never speaks to a lady without advancing his mouth to her ear by which he frequently addresses more senses than one  upon proper occasions he looks excessively tender this is performed by laying his hand upon his heart shutting his eyes and showing his teeth  he is excessively fond of dancing a minuet with the ladies by which is only meant walking round the floor eight or ten times with his hat on affecting great gravity and sometimes looking tenderly on his partner  he never affronts any man himself and never resents an affront from another  he has an infinite variety of small talk upon all occasions and laughs when he has nothing more to say  such is the killing creature who prostrates himself to the sex till he has undone them all whose submissions are the effects of design and who to please the ladies almost becomes himself a lady  letter x to the same i have hitherto given you no account of my journey from china to europe of my travels through countries where nature sports in primeval udeness where she pours forth her wonders in solitude countries from whence the rigorous climate the sweeping inundation the drifted desert the howling forest and mountains of immeasureable height banish the husbandman and spread extensive desolation countries where the brown tartar wanders for a precarious subsistence with an heart that never felt pity himself more hideous than the wilderness he makes  you will easily conceive the fatigue of crossing vast tracts of land either desolate or still more dangerous by its inhabitants the retreat of men who seem driven from society in order to make war upon all the human race nominally professing a subjection to moscovy or china but without any resemblance to the countries on which they depend  after i had crossed the great wail the first objects that presented were the remains of desolated cities and all the magnificence of venerable ruin there were to be seen temples of beautiful structure statues wrought by the hand of a master and around a country of luxuriant plenty but not one single inhabitant to reap the bounties of nature these were prospects that might humble the pride of kings and repress human vanity i asked my guide the cause of such desolation these countries says he were once the dominions of a tartar prince and these ruins the seat of arts elegance and ease this prince waged an unsuccessful war with one of the emperors of china he was conquered his cities plundered and all his subjects carried into captivity such are the effects of the ambition of kings ten dervises say the indian proverb shall sleep in peace upon a single carpet while two kings shall quarrel though they have kingdoms to divide them sure my friend the cruelty and the pride of man have made more deserts than nature ever made she is kind but man is ungrateful  proceeding in my journey through this pensive scene of desolated beauty in a few days i arrived among the daures a nation still dependant on china xaixigar is their principal city which compared with those of europe scarely deserves the name the governors and other officers who are sent yearly from pekin abuse their authority and often take the wives and daughters of the inhabitants to themselves the daures accustomed to base submission feel no resentment at those injuries or stifle what they feel custom and necessity teach even barbarians the same art of dissimulation that ambition and intrigue inspire in the breasts of the polite upon beholding such unlicensed stretches of power alas thought i how little does our wise and good emperor know of those intolerable exactions these provinces are too distant for complaint and too insignificant to expect redress the more distant the government the honester should be the governor to whom it is entrusted for hope of impunity is a strong inducement to violation  the religion of the daures is more absurd than even that of the sectaries of fohi how would you be surprised o sage disciple and follower of confucius you who believe one eternal intelligent cause of all should you be present at the barbarous ceremonies of this infatuated people how would you deplore the blindness and folly of mankind his boasted reason seems only to light him astray and brutal instinct more regularly points out the path to happiness could you think it they adore a wicked divinity they fear him and they worship him they imagine him a malicious being ready to injure and ready to be appeased the men and women assemble at midnight in a hut which serves for a temple a priest stretches himself on the ground and all the people pour forth the most horrid cries while drums and timbrels swell the infernal concert after this dissonance miscalled music has continued about two hours the priest rises from the ground assumes an air of inspiration grows big with the inspiring demon and pretends to a skill in futurity  in every country my friend the bonzes the drachmans and the priests deceive the people all reformations begin from the laity the priests point us out the way to heaven with their fingers but stand still themselves nor seem to travel toward the country in view  the customs of this people correspond to their religion they keep their dead for three days on the same bed where the person died after which they bury him in a grave moderately deep but with the head still uncovered here for several days they present him different sorts of meats which when they perceive he does not consume they fill up the grave and desist from desiring him to eat for the future how how can mankind be guilty of such strange absurdity to entreat a dead body already putrid to partake of the banquet where i again repeat it is human reason not only some men but whole nations seem divested of its illumination here we observe a whole country adoring a divinity through fear and attempting to feed the dead these are their most serious and religious occupations are these men rational or are not the apes of borneo more wise  certain i am o thou instructor of my youth that without philosophers without some few virtuous men who seem to be of a different nature from the rest of mankind without such as these the worship of a wicked divinity would surely be established over every part of the earth fear guides more to their duty than gratitude for one man who is virtuous from the love of virtue from the obligation which he thinks he lies under to the giver of all there are ten thousand who are good only from their apprehensions of punishment could these last be persuaded as the epicureans were that heaven had no thunders in store for the villain they would no longer continue to acknowledge subordination or thank that being who gave them existence  adieu letter xi to the same from such a picture of nature in primeval simplicity tell me my much respected friend are you in love with fatigue and solitude do you sigh for the severe frugality of the wandering tartar or regret being born amidst the luxury and dissumulation of the polite rather tell me has not every kind of life vices peculiarly its own is it not a truth that refined countries have more vices but those not so terrible barbarous nations few and they of the most hideous complexion perfidy and fraud are the vices of civilized nations credulity and violence those of the inhabitants of the desert does the luxury of the one produce half the evils of the inhumanity of the other certainly those philosophers who declaim against luxury have but little understood its benefits they seem insensible that to luxury we owe not only the greatest part of our knowledge but even of our virtues  it may sound fine in the mouth of a declaimer when he talks of subduing our appetites of teaching every sense to be content with a bare sufficiency and of supplying only the wants of nature but is there no more satisfaction in indulging those appetites if with innocence and safety than in restraining them am not i better pleased in enjoyment than in the sullen satisfaction of thinking that i can live without enjoyment the more various our artificial necessities the wider is our circle of pleasure for all pleasure consists in obviating necessities as they rise luxury therefore as it increases our wants increases our capacity for happiness  examine the history of any country remarkable for opulence and wisdom you will find they would never have been wise had they not been first luxurious you will find poets philosophers and even patriots marching in luxurys train the reason is obvious we then only are curious after knowledge when we find it connected with sensual happiness the senses ever point out the way and reflection comments upon the discovery inform a native of the desert of kobi of the exact measure of the parallax of the moon he finds no satisfaction at all in the information he wonders how any could take such pains and lay out such treasures in order to solve so useless a difficulty but connect it with his happiness by showing that it improves navigation that by such an investigation he may have a warmer coat a better gun or a finer knife and he is instantly in raptures at so great an improvement in short we only desire to know what we desire to possess and whatever we may talk against it luxury adds the spur to curiosity and gives us a desire of becoming more wise  but not our knowledge only but our virtues are improved by luxury observe the brown savage of thibet to whom the fruits of the spreading pomegranate supply food and its branches an habitation such a character has few vices i grant but those he has are of the most hideous nature rapine and cruelty are scarce crimes in his eye neither pity nor tenderness which enoble every virtue have any place in his heart he hates his enemies and kills those he subdues on the other hand the polite chinese and civilized european seem even to love their enemies i have just now seen an instance where the english have succored those enemies whom their own countrymen have actually refused to relieve  the greater the luxuries of every country the more closely politically speaking is that country united luxury is the child of society alone the luxurious man stands in need of a thousand different artists to furnish out his happiness it is more likely therefore that he should be a good citizen who is connected by motives of selfinterest with so many than the abstemious man who is united to none  in whatsoever light therefore we consider luxury whether as employing a number of hands naturally too feeble for more laborious employment as finding a variety of occupation for others who might be totally idle or as furnishing out new inlets to happiness without encroaching on mutual property in whatever light we regard it we shall have reason to stand up in its defense and the sentiment of confucius still remains unshaken that we should enjoy as many of the luxuries of life as are consistent with our own safety and the prosperity of others and that be who finds out a new pleasure is one of the most useful members of society  letter xii to the same from the funeral solemnities of the daures who think themselves the politest people in the world i must make a transition to the funeral solemnities of the english who think themselves as polite as they the numberless ceremonies which are used here when a person is sick appear to me so many evident marks of fear and apprehension ask an englishman however whether he is afraid of death and he boldly answers in the negative but observe his behavior in circumstances of approaching sickness and you will find his actions give his assertions the lie  the chinese are very sincere in this respect they hate to die and they confess their terrors a great part of their life is spent in preparing things proper for their funeral a poor artizan shall spend half his income in providing himself a romb twenty years before he wants it and denies himself the necessaries of life that he may be amply provided for when he shall want them no more  but people of distinction in england really deserve pity for they die in circumstances of the most extreme distress it is an established rule never to let a man know that he is dying physicians are sent for the clergy are called and every thing passes in silent solemnity round the sick bed the patient is in agonies looks round for pity yet not a single creature will say that he is dying if he is possessed of fortune his relations entreat him to make his will as it may restore the tranquillity of his mind he is desired to undergo the rites of the church for decency requires it his friends take their leave only because they dont care to see him in pain in short an hundred stratagems are used to make him do what he might have been induced to perform only by being told sir you are past all hopes and had as good think decently of dying  besides all this the chamber is darkened the whole house echoes to the cries of the wife the lamentations of the children the grief of the servants and the sighs of friends the bed is surrounded with priests and doctors in black and only flambeaux emit a yellow gloom where is the man how intrepid soever that would not shrink at such a hideous solemnity for fear of affrighting their expiring friends the english practice all that can fill them with terror strange effect of human prejudice thus to torture merely from mistaken tenderness  you see my friend what contradictions there are in the tempers of those islanders when prompted by ambition revenge or dissappointment they meet death with the utmost resolution the very man who in his bed would have trembled at the aspect of a doctor shall go with intrepidity to attack a bastion or deliberately noose himself up in his garters  the passion of the europeans for magnificent interments is equally strong with that of the chinese when a tradesman dies his frightful face is painted up by an undertaker and placed in a proper situation to receive company this is called lying in state to this disagreeable spectacle all the idlers in town flock and learn to loath the wretch dead whom they despised when living in this manner you see some who would have refused a shilling to save the life of their dearest friend bestow thousands on adorning their putrid corpse i have been told of a fellow who grown rich by the price of blood left it in his will that he should lie in state and thus unknowingly gibbeted himself into infamy when he might have otherwise quietly retired into oblivion  when the person is buried the next care is to make his epitaph they are generally reckoned best which flatter most such relations therefore as have received most benefits from the defunct discharge this friendly office and generally flatter in proportion to their joy when we read those monumental histories of the dead it may be justly said that all men are equal in the dust for they all appear equally remarkable for being the most sincere christians the most benevolent neighbors and the honestest men of their time to go through an european cemetery one would be apt to wonder how mankind could have so basely degenerated from such excellent ancestors every tomb pretends to claim your reverence and regret some are praised for piety in those inscriptions who never entered the temple until they were dead some are praised for being excellent poets who were never mentioned except for their dullness when living others for sublime orators who were never noted except for their impudence and others still for military achievements who were never in any other skirmishes but with the watch some even make epitaphs for themselves and bespeak the readers good will it were indeed to be wished that every man would early learn in this manner to make his own that he would draw it up in terms as flattering as possible and that he would make it the employment of his whole life to deserve it  i have not yet been in a place called westminster abbey but soon intend to visit it there i am told i shall see justice done to deceased merit none i am told are permitted to be buried there but such as have adorned as well as improved mankind there no intruders by the influence of friends or fortune presume to mix their unhallowed ashes with philosophers heroes and poets nothing but true merit has a place in that awful sanctuary the guardianship of the tombs is continued to several reverend priests who are never guilty for a superior reward of taking down the names of good men to make room for others of equivocal character nor ever profane the sacred walls with pageants that posterity cannot know or shall blush to own  i always was of opinion that sepulchral honors of this kind should be considered as a national concern and not trusted to the care of the priests of any country how respectable soever but from the conduct of the reverend personages whose disinterested patriotism i shall shortly be able to discover i am taught to retract my former sentiments it is true the spartans and the persians made a fine political use of sepulchral vanity they permitted none to be thus interred who had not fallen in the vindication of their country a monument thus became a real mark of distinction it nerved the heros arm with tenfold vigor and he fought without fear who only fought for a grave  farewell letter xiii from the same i am just returned from westminsterabbey the place of sepulture for the philosophers heroes and kings of england what a gloom do monumental inscriptions and all the venerable remains of deceased merit inspire imagine a temple marked with the hand of antiquity solemn as religious awe adorned with all the magnificence of barbarous profusion dim windows fretted pillars long colonades and dark ceilings think then what were my sensations at being introduced to such a scene i stood in the midst of the temple and threw my eyes round on the walls filled with the statues the inscriptions and the monuments of the dead  alas i said to myself how does pride attend the puny child of dust even to the grave even humble as i am i possess more consequence in the present scene than the greatest hero of them all they have toiled for an hour to gain a transient immortality and are at length retired to the grave where they have no attendant but the worm none to flatter but the epitaph  as i was indulging such reflections a gentleman dressed in black perceiving me to be a stranger came up entered into conversation and politely offered to be my instructor and guide through the temple if any monument said he should particularly excite your curiosity i shall endeavor to satisfy your demands i accepted with thanks the gentlemans offer adding that i was come to observe the policy the wisdom and the justice of the english in conferring rewards upon deceased merit if adulation like this continued i be properly conducted as it can no ways injure those who are flattered so it may be a glorious incentive to those who are now capable of enjoying it it is the duty of every good government to turn this monumental pride to its own advantage to become strong in the aggregate from the weakness of the individual if none but the truly great have a place in this awful repository a temple like this will give the finest lessons of morality and be a strong incentive to true ambition i am told that none have a place here but characters of the most distinguished merit the man in black seemed impatient at my observations so i discontinued my remarks and we walked on together to take a view of every particular monument in order as it lay  as the eye is naturally caught by the finest objects i could not avoid being particularly curious about one monument which appeared more beautiful than the rest that said i to my guide i take to be the tomb of some very great man by the peculiar excellence of the workmanship and the magnificence of the design this must be a trophy raised to the memory of some king who has saved his country from ruin or lawgiver who has reduced his fellowcitizens from anarchy into just subjection  it is not requisite replied my companion smiling to have such qualifications in order to have a very fine monument here more humble abilities will suffice what i suppose then the gaining two or three battles or the taking half a score towns is thought a sufficient qualification gaining battles or taking towns replied the man in black may be of service but a gentleman may have a very fine monument here without ever seeing a battle or a siege this then is the monument of some poet i presume of one whose wit has gained him immortality no sir replied my guide the gentleman who lies here never made verses and as for wit he despised it in others because he had none himself pray tell me then in a word said i peevishly what is the great man who lies here particularly remarkable for remarkable sir said my companion why sir the gentleman that lies here is remarkable very remarkable  for a tomb in westminsterabbey but head of my ancestors how has be got here i fancy he could never bribe the guardians of the temple to give him a place should he not be ashamed to be seen among company where even moderate merit would look like infamy i suppose replied the man in black the gentleman was rich and his friends as is usual in such a case told him he was great he readily believed them the guardians of the temple as they got by the selfdelusion were ready to believe him too so he paid his money for a fine monument and the workman a you see has made him one of the most beautiful think not however that this gentleman is singular in his desire of being buried among the great there are several others in the temple who hated and shunned by the great while alive have come here fully resolved to keep them company now they are dead  as we walked along to a particular part of the temple there says the gentleman pointing with his finger that is the poets corner there you see the monuments of shakespeare and milton and prior and drayton drayton i replied i never heard of him before but i have been told of one pope is he there it is time enough replied my guide these hundred years he is not long dead people have not done hating him yet strange cried i can any be found to hate a man whose life was wholly spent in entertaining and instructing his fellow creatures yes says my guide they hate him for that very reason there are a set of men called answerers of books who take upon them to watch the republic of letters and distribute reputation by the sheet they somewhat resemble the eunuchs in a seraglio who are incapable of giving pleasure themselves and hinder those that would these answerers have no other employment but to cry out dunce and scribbler to praise the dead and revile the living to grant a man of confessed abilities some small share of merit to applaud twenty blockheads in order to gain the reputation of candor and to revile the moral character of the man whose writings they cannot injure such wretches are kept in pay by some mercenary bookseller or more frequently the bookseller himself takes this dirty work off their hands as all that is requi is to be very abusive and very dull every poet of any genius is sure to find such enemies he feels though he seems to despise their malice they make him miserable here and in the pursuit of empty fame at last he gains solid anxiety  has this been the case with every poet i see here cried i  yes with every mothers son of them replied he except he happened to be born a mandarine if he has much money he may buy reputation from your book answerers as well as a monument from the guardians of the temple  but are there not some men of distinguished taste as in china who are willing to patronize men of merit and soften the rancour of malevolent dullness  i own there are many replied the man in black but alas sir the book answerers crowd about them and call themselves the writers of books and the patron is too indolent to distinguish thus poets are kept at a distance while their enemies eat up all their rewards at the mandarines table  leaving this part of the temple we made up to an iron gate through which my companion told me we were to pass in order to see the monuments of the kings accordingly i marched up without further ceremony and was going to enter when a person who held the gate in his hand told me i must pay first i was surprised at such a demand and asked the man whether the people of england kept a show whether the paltry sum he demanded was not a national reproach whether it was not more to the honor of the country to let their magnificence or their antiquities be openly seen than thus meanly to tax a curiosity which tended to their own honor as for your questions replied the gatekeeper to be sure they may be very right because i dont understand them but as for that there threepence i farm it from one who rents it from another who hires it from a third who leases it from the guardians of the temple and we all must live i expected upon paying here to see something extraordinary since what i had seen for nothing filled me with so much surprise but in this i was disappointed there was little more within than black coffins rusty armor tattered standards and some few slovenly figures in wax i was sorry i had paid but i comforted myself by considering it would be my last payment a person attended us who without once blushing told an hundred lies he talked of a lady who died by pricking her finger of a king with a golden head and twenty such pieces of absurdity look ye there gentlemen says he pointing to an old oak chair there is a curiosity for ye in that chair the kings of england were crowned you see also a stone underneath and that stone is jacobs pillow i could see no curiosity either in the oak chair or the stone could i indeed behold one of the old kings of england seated in this or jacobs head laid upon the other there might be something curious in the sight but in the present case there was no more reason for my surprise than if i should pick a stone from their streets and call it a curiosity merely because one of their kings happened to tread upon it as he passed in a procession  from hence our conductor led us through several dark walks and winding ways uttering lies talking to himself and flourishing a wand which he held in his hand he reminded me of the black magicians of kobi after we had been almost fatigued with a variety of objects he at last desired me to consider attentively a certain suit of armor which seemed to show nothing remarkable this armor said he belonged to general monk very surprising that a general should wear armor and pray added he observe this cap this is general monks cap very strange indeed very strange that a general should have a cap also pray friend what might this cap have cost originally that sir says he i dont know but this cap is all the wages i have for my trouble a very small recompense truly said i not so very small replied he for every gentleman puts some money into it and i spend the money what more money still more money every gentleman gives something sir i will give thee nothing returned i the guardians of the temple should pay you your wages friend and not permit you to squeeze thus from every spectator when we pay our money at the door to see a show we never give more as we are going out sure the guardians of the temple can never think they get enough show me the gate if i stay longer i may probably meet with more of those ecclesiastical beggars  thus leaving the temple precipitately i returned to my lodgings in order to ruminate over what was great and to despise what was mean in the occurrences of the day  letter xiv from the same i was some days ago agreeably surprised by a message from a lady of distinction who sent me word that she most passionately desired the pleasure of my acquaintance and with the utmost impatience expected an interview i will not deny my dear fum hoam but that my vanity was raised at such an invitation i flattered myself that she had seen me in some public place and had conceived an affection for my person which thus induced her to deviate from the usual decorums of the sex my imagination painted her in all the bloom of youth and beauty i fancied her attended by the loves and graces and i set out with the most pleasing expectations of seeing the conquest i had made  when i was introduced into her apartment my expectations were quickly at an end i perceived a little shrivelled figure indolently reclined on a sofa who nodded by way of approbation at my approach this as i was afterward informed was the lady herself a woman equally distinguished for rank politeness taste and understanding as i was dressed after the fashion of europe she had taken me for an englishman and consequently saluted me in her ordinary manner but when the footman informed her grace that i was the gentleman from china she instantly lifted herself from the couch while her eyes sparkled with unusual vivacity bless me can this be the gentleman that was born so far from home what an unusual share of somethingness in his whole appearance lord how i am charmed with the outlandish cut of his face how bewitching the exotic breadth of his forehead i would give the world to see him in his own country dress pray turn about sir and let me see you behind there there is a traveled air for you you that attend there bring up a plate of beef cut into small pieces i have a violent passion to see him eat pray sir have you got your chop sticks about you it will be so pretty to see the meat carried to the mouth with a jerk pray speak a little chinese i have learned some of the language myself lord have you nothing pretty from china about you something that one does not know what to do with i have got twenty things from china that are of no use in the world look at those jars they are of the right pea green these are the furniture dear madam said i those though they may appear fine in your eyes are but paltry to a chinese but as they are useful utensils it is proper they should have a place in every apartment useful sir replied the lady sure you mistake they are of no use in the world what are they not filled with an infusion of tea as in china replied i quite empty and useless upon my honor sir then they are the most cumbrous and clumsy furniture in the world as nothing is truly elegant but what unites use with beauty i protest says the lady i shall begin to suspect thee of being an actual barbarian i suppose also you hold my two beautiful pagods in contempt what cried i has fohi spread his gross superstitions here also pagods of all kinds are my aversion a chinese a traveller and want taste it surprises me pray sir examine the beauties of that chinese temple which you see at the end of the garden is there any thing in china more beautiful where i stand i see nothing madam at the end of the garden that may not as well be called an egyptian pyramid as a chinese temple for that little building in view is as like the one as other what sir is not that a chinese temple you must surely be mistaken mr freeze who designed it calls it one and nobody disputes his pretensions to taste i now found it vain to contradict the lady in any thing she thought fit to advance so was resolved rather to act the disciple than the instructor she took me through several rooms all furnished as she told me in the chinese manner sprawling dragons squatting pagods and clumsy mandarines were stuck upon every shelf in turning round one must have used caution not to demolish a part of the precarious furniture  in a house like this thought i one must live continually upon the watch the inhabitant must resemble a knight in an enchanted castle who expects to meet an adventure at every turning but madam said i do no accidents ever happen to all this finery man sir repiled the lady is born to misfortunes and it is but fit i should have a share three weeks ago a careless servant snappd off the head of a favorite mandarine i had scarce done grieving for that when a monkey broke a beautiful jar this i took the more to heart as the injury was done me by a friend however i survived the calamity when yesterday crash went half a dozen dragons upon the marble hearth stone and yet i live i survive it all you cannot conceive what comfort i find under afflictions from philosophy there is seneca and bolingbroke and some others who guide me through life and teach me to support its calamities  i could not but smile at a woman who makes her own misfortunes and then deplores the miseries of her situation wherefore tired of acting with dissimulation and willing to indulge my meditations in solitude i took leave just as the servant was bringing in a plate of beef pursuant to the directions of his mistress  adieu letter xv from the same the better sort here pretend to the utmost compassion for animals of every kind to hear them speak a stranger would be apt to imagine they could hardly hurt the gnat that stung em they seem so tender and so full of pity that one would take them for the harmless friends of the whole creation the protectors of the meanest insect or reptile that was privileged with existence and yet would you believe it i have seen the very men who have thus boasted of their tenderness at the same time devouring the flesh of six different animals tossed up in a fricassee strange contrariety of conduct they pity and they eat the objects of their compassion the lion roars with terror over its captive the tiger sends forth its hideous shriek to intimidate its prey no creature shows any fondness for its shortlived prisoner except a man and a cat  man was born to live with innocence and simplicity but he has deviated from nature he was born to share the bounties of heaven but he has monopolized them he was born to govern the brute creation but he is become their tyrant if an epicure now should happen to surfeit on his last nights feast twenty animals the next day are to undergo the most exquisite tortures in order to provoke his appetite to another guilty meal hail o ye simple honest bramins of the east ye inoffensive friends of all that were born to happiness as well as you you never sought a shortlived pleasure from the miseries of other creatures you never studied the tormenting arts of ingenious refinement you never surfeited upon a guilty meal how much more purified and refined are all your sensations than ours you distinguish every element with the utmost precision a stream untasted before is new luxury a change of air is a new banquet too refined for western imaginations to conceive  though the europeans do not hold the transmigration of souls yet one of their doctors has with great force of argument and great plausibility of reasoning endeavored to prove that the bodies of animals are the habitations of demons and wicked spirits which are obliged to reside in these prisons till the resurrection pronounces their everlasting punishment but are previously condemned to suffer all the pains and hardships inflicted upon them by man or by each other here if this be the case it may frequently happen that while we whip pigs to death or boil live lobsters we are putting some old acquaintance some near relation to excruciating tortures and are serving him up to the very same table where he was once the most welcome companion  kabul says the zendavesta was born on the rushy banks of the river mawra his possessions were great and his luxuries kept pace with the affluence of his fortune he hated the harmless bramins and despised their holy religion every day his table was decked out with the flesh of an hundred different animals and his cooks had an hundred different ways of dressing it to solicit even satiety  notwithstanding all his eating he did not arrive at old age he died of a surfeit caused by intemperance upon this his soul was carried off in order to take its trial before a select assembly of the souls of those animals which his gluttony had caused to be slain and who were now appointed his judges  he trembled before a tribunal to every member of which he had formerly acted as an unmerciful tyrant he sought for pity but found none disposed to grant it does he not remember cries the angry boar to what agonies i was put not to satisfy his hunger but his vanity i was first hunted to death and my flesh scarce thought worthy of coming once to his table were my advice followed he should do penance in the shape of an hog which in life he most resembled  i am rather cries a sheep upon the bench for having him suffer under the appearance of a lamb we may then send him through four or five transmigrations in the space of a month were my voice of any weight in the assembly cries a calf he should rather assume such a form as mine i was bled every day in order to make my flesh white and at last killed without mercy would it not be wiser cries a hen to cram him in the shape of a fowl and then smother him in his own blood as i was served the majority of the assembly were pleased with this punishment and were going to condemn him without further delay when the ox rose up to give his opinion i am informed says this counselor that the prisoner at the bar has left a wife with child behind him by my knowledge in divination i foresee that this child will be a son decrepid feeble sickly a plague to himself and all about him what say you then my companions if we condemn the father to animate the body of his own son and by this means make him feel in himself those miseries his intemperance must otherwise have entailed upon his posterity the whole court applauded the ingenuity of his torture they thanked him for his advice kabul was driven once more to revisit the earth and his soul in the body of his own son passed a period of thirty years loaded with misery anxiety and disease    letter xvi from the same i know not whether i am more obliged to the chinese missionaries for the instruction i have received from them or prejudiced by the falsehoods they have made me believe by them i was told that the pope was universally allowed to be a man and placed at the head of the church in england however they plainly prove him to be an whore in mans clothes and often burn him in effigy as an impostor a thousand books have been written on either side of the question priests are eternally disputing against each other and those mouths that want argument are filled with abuse which party must i believe or shall i give credit to neither when i survey the absurdities and falsehoods with which the books of the europeans are filled i thank heaven for having been born in china and that i have sagacity enough to detect imposture  the europeans reproach us with false history and fabulous chronology how should they blush to see their own books many of which are written by the doctors of their religion filled with the most monstrous fables and attested with the utmost solemnity the bounds of a letter do not permit me to mention all the absurdities of this kind which in my reading i have met with i shall confine myself to the accounts which some of their lettered men give of the persons of ome of the inhabitants on our globe and not satisfied with the most solemn asseverations they sometimes pretend to have been eye witnesses of what they describe  a christian doctor in one of his principal performances augustine de civit dei b xvi p     says that it was not impossible for a whole nation to have but one eye in the middle of the forehead he is not satisfied with leaving it in doubt but in another work id ad fratres in eremo serrm xxxvii assures us that the fact was certain and that he himself was an eyewitness of it when says he i took a journey into ethiopia in company with several other servants of christ in order to preach the gospel there i bebeld in the southern provinces of that country a nation which had only one eye in the midst of their foreheads  you will no doubt be surprised reverend fum with this authors effrontery but alas he is not alone in this story he has only borrowed it from several others who wrote before him solinus creates another nation of cyclops the arimaspians who inhabit those countries that border on the caspian sea this author goes on to tell us of a people of india who have but one eg and one eye and yet are extremely active run with great swiftness and live by hunting these people we scarce know how to pity or admire but the men whom pliny calls cynamolci who have got the heads of dogs really deserve your compassion instead of language they express their sentiments by barking solinus confirms what pliny mentions and simon mayole a french bishop talks of them as of particular and familiar acquaintances after passing the deserts of egypt says he we meet with the kunokephaloi who inhabit those regions that border on ethiopia they live by hunting they cannot speak but whistle their chins resemble a serpents head their hands are armed with long sharp claws their breast resembles that of a greyhound and they excel in swiftness and agility would you think it my friend that these odd kind of people are notwithstanding their figure excessively delicate not even an aldermans wife or chinese mandarine can excel them in this particular these people continues our faithful bishop never refuse wine love roast and boiled meat they are particularly curious in having their meat well dressed and spurn at it if in the least tainted when the ptolemies reigned in egypt says he a little farther on those men with dogs heads taught grammar and music for men who had no voices to teach music and who could not speak to teach grammar is i confess a little extraordinary did ever the disciples of fohi broach any thing more ridiculous  hitherto we have seen men with heads strangely deformed and with dogs heads but what would you say if you heard of men without any heads at all pomponius mela solinus and aulus gellius describe them to our hand the blemiae have a nose eyes and mouth on their breasts or as others will have it placed on their shoulders  one would think that these authors had an antipathy to the human form and were resolved to make a new figure of their own but let us do them justice though they sometimes deprive us of a leg an arm an head or some such trifling part of the body they often as liberally bestow upon us something that we wanted before simon mayole seems our particular friend in this respect if he has denied heads to one part of mankind he has given tails to another he describes many of the english of his time which is not more than an hundred years ago as having tails his own words are as follow in england there are some families which have tails as a punishment for deriding an augustine friar sent by st gregory and who preached in dorsetshire they sewed the tails of different animals to his clothes but soon they found those tails entailed on them and their posterity for ever it is certain the author had some ground for this description many of the english wear tails to their wigs to this very day as a mark i suppose of the antiquity of their families and perhaps as a symbol of those tails with which they were formerly distinguished by nature  you see my friend there is nothing so ridiculous that has not at some time been said by some philosopher the writers of books in europe seem to think themselves authorized to say what they please and an ingenious philosopher among them fontenelle has openly asserted that he would undertake to persuade the whole republic of readers to believe that the sun was neither the cause of light nor heat if he could only get six philosophers on his side  farewell letter xvii from the same were an asiatic politician to read the treaties of peace and friendship that have been annually making for more than an hundred years among the inhabitants of europe he would probably be surpised how it should ever happen that christian princes could quarrel among each other their compacts for peace are drawn up with the utmost precision and ratified with the greatest solemnity to these each party promises a sincere and inviolable obedience and all wears the appearance of open friendship and unreserved reconciliation  yet notwithstanding those treaties the people of europe are almost continually at war there is nothing more easy than to break a treaty ratified in all the usual forms and yet neither party be the aggressor one side for instance breaks a trifling article by mistake the opposite party upon this makes a small but premeditated reprisal this brings on a return of greater from the other both sides complain of injuries and infractions war is declared they beat are beaten some two or three hundred thousand men are killed they grow tired leave off just where they began and so sit cooly down to make new treaties  the english and french seem to place themselves foremost among the champion states of europe though parted by a narrow sea yet are they entirely of opposite characters and from their vicinity are taught to fear and admire each other they are at present engaged in a very destructive war have already spilled much blood are excessively irritated and all upon account of one sides desiring to wear greater quantities of furs than the other  the pretext of the war is about some lands a thousand leagues off a country cold desolate and hideous a country belonging to a people who were in possession for time immemorial the savages of canada claim a property in the country in dispute they have all the pretensions which long possession can confer here they had reigned for ages without rivals in dominion and knew no enemies but the prowling bear or insidious tiger their native forests produced all the necessaries of life and they found ample luxury in the enjoyment in this manner they might have continued to live to eternity had not the english been informed that those countries produced furs in great abundance from that moment the country became an object of desire it was found that furs were things very much wanted in england the ladies edged some of their clothes with furs and muffs were worn both by gentlemen and ladies in short furs were found indispensably necessary for the happiness of the state and the king was consequently petitioned to grant not only the country of canada but all the savages belonging to it to the subjects of england in order to have the people supplied with proper quantities of this necessary commodity  so very reasonable a request was immediately complied with and large colonies were sent abroad to procure furs and take possession the french who were equally in want of furs for they were as fond of muffs and tippets as the english made the very same request to their monarch and met with the same gracious reception from their king who generously granted what was not his to give wherever the french landed they called the country their own and the english took possession wherever they came upon the same equitable pretensions the harmless savages made no opposition and could the intruders have agreed together they might peaceably have shared this desolate country between them but they quarrelled about the boundaries of their settlements about grounds and rivers to which neither side could show any other right than that of power and which neither could occupy but by usurpation such is the contest that no honest man can heartily wish success to either party  the war has continued for some time with various success at first the french seemed victorious but the english have of late dispossessed them of the whole country in dispute think not however that success on one side is the harbinger of peace on the contrary both parties must be heartily tired to effect even a temporary reconciliation it should seem the business of the victorious party to offer terms of peace but there are many in england who encouraged by success are still for protracting the war  the best english politicians however are sensible that to keep their present conquests would be rather a burden than an advantage to them rather a diminution of their strength than an increase of power it is in the politic as in the human constitution if the limbs grow too large for the body their size instead of improving will diminish the vigor of the whole the colonies should always bear an exact proportion to the mother country when they grow populous they grow powerful and by becoming powerful they become independent also thus subordination is destroyed and a country swallowed up in the extent of its own dominions the turkish empire would be more formidable were it less extensive were it not for those countries which it can neither command nor give entirely away which it is obliged to protect but from which it has no power to exact obedience  yet obvious as these truths are there are many englishmen who are for transplanting new colonies into this late acquisition for peopling the deserts of america with the refuse of their countrymen and as they express it with the waste of an exuberant nation but who are those unhappy creatures who are to be thus drained away not the sickly for they are unwelcome guests abroad as well as at home nor the idle for they would starve as well behind the appalachian mountains as in the streets of london this refuse is composed of the laborious and enterprising of such men as can be serviceable to their country at home of men who ought to be regarded as the sinews of the people and cherished with every degree of political indulgence and what are the commodities which this colony when established are to produce in return why raw silk hemp and tobacco england therefore must make an exchange of her best and bravest subjects for raw silk hemp and tobacco her hardy veterans and honest tradesmen must be truckd for a box of snuff or a silk petticoat strange absurdity sure the politics of the daures are not more strange who sell their religion their wives and their liberty for a glass bead or a paltry penknife  farewell letter xviii from the same the english love their wives with much passion the hollanders with much prudence the english when they give their hands frequently give their hearts the dutch give the hand but keep the heart wisely in their own possession the english love with violence and expect violent love in return the dutch are satisfied with the slightest acknowledgments for they give little away the english expend many of the matrimonial comforts in the first year the dutch frugally husband out their pleasures and are always constant because they are always indifferent  there seems very little difference between a dutch bridegroom and a dutch husband both are equally possessed of the same cool unexpecting serenity they can see neither elysium nor paradise behind the curtain and yiffrow is not more a goddess on the wedding night than after twenty years matrimonial acquaintance on the other hand many of the english marry in order to have one happy month in their lives they seem incapable of looking beyond that period they unite in hopes of finding rapture and disappointed in that disdain ever to accept of happiness from hence we see open hatred ensue or what is worse concealed disgust under the appearance of fulsome endearment much formality great civility and studied compliments are exhibited in public cross looks sulky silence or open recrimination fill up their hours of private entertainment  hence i am taught whenever i see a new married couple more than ordinarily sond before faces to consider them as attempting to impose upon the company or themselves either hating each other heartily or consuming that stock of love in the beginning of their course which should serve them through their whole journey neither side should expect those instances of kindness which are inconsistent with true freedom or happiness to bestow love when founded in the heart will show itself in a thousand unpremeditated sallies of fondness but every cool deliberate exhibition of the passion only argues little understanding or great insincerity  choang was the fondest husband and hansi the most endearing wife in all the kingdom of korea they were a pattern of conjugal bliss the inhabitants of the country around saw and envied their felicity wherever choang came hansi was sure to follow and in all the pleasures of hansi choang was admitted a partner they walked hand in hand wherever they appeared showing every mark of mutual satisfaction embracing kissing their mouths were for ever joined and to speak in the language of anatomy it was with them one perpetual anastomosis  their love was so great that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace when an accident happened which in some measure diminished the husbands assurance of his wifes fidelity for love so refined as his was subject to a thousand little disquietudes  happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at some distance from his house he there perceived a lady dressed in the deepest mourning being clothed all over in white fanning the wet clay that was raised over one of the graves with a large fan which she held in her hand choang who had early been taught wisdom in the school of lao was unable to assign a cause for her present employment and coming up civilly demanded the reason alas replied the lady her eyes bathed in tears how is it possible to survive the loss of my husband who lies buried in this grave he was the best of men the tenderest of husbands with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave should be dry and here you see me steadily resolving to obey his will and endeavoring to dry it with my fan i have employed two whole days in fulfilling his commands and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed even though his grave should take up four days in drying  choang who was struck with the widows beauty could not however avoid smiling at her haste to be married but concealing the cause of his mirth civilly invited her home adding that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her some consolation as soon as he and his guest were returned he imparted to hansi in private what he had seen and could not avoid expressing his uneasiness that such might be his own case if his dearest wife should one day happen to survive him  it is impossible to describe hansis resentment at so unkind a suspicion as her passion for him was not only great but extremely delicate she employed tears anger frowns and exclamations to chide his suspicions the widow herself was inveighed against and hansi declared she was resolved never to sleep under the same roof with a wretch who like her could be guilty of such barefaced inconstancy the night was cold and stormy however the stranger was obliged to seek another lodging for choang was not disposed to resist and hansi would have her way  the widow had scarce been gone an hour when an old disciple of choangs whom he had not seen for many years came to pay him a visit he was received with the utmost ceremony placed in the most honorable seat at supper and the wine began to circulate with great freedom choang and hansi exhibited open marks of mutual tenderness and unfeigned reconciliation nothing could equal their apparent happiness so fond an husband so obedient a wife few could behold without regretting their own infelicity when lo their happiness was at once disturbed by a most fatal accident choang fell lifeless in an apoplectic fit upon the floor every method was used but in vain for his recovery hansi was at first inconsolable for his death after some hours however she found spirits to read his last will the ensuing day she began to moralize and talk wisdom the next day she was able to comfort the young disciple and on the third to shorten a long story they both agreed to be married  there was now no longer mourning in the apartments the body of choang was now thrust into an old coffin and placed in one of the meanest rooms there to lie unattended until the time prescribed by law for his interment in the mean time hansi and the young disciple were arrayed in the most magnificent habits the bride wore in her nose a jewel of immense price and her lover was dressed in all the finery of his former master together with a pair of artificial whiskers that reached down to his toes the hour of their nuptials was arrived the whole family sympathized with their approaching happiness the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffused the most exquisite perfume and a luster more bright than noon day the lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment with impatience when his servant approaching with terror in his countenance informed her that his master was fallen into a fit which would certainly be mortal unless the heart of a man lately dead could be obtained and applied to his breast she scarce waited to hear the end of his story when tucking up her clothes she ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin where choang lay resolving to apply the heart of her dead husband as a cure for the living she therefore struck the lid with the utmost violence in a few blows the coffin flew open when the body which to all appearance had been dead began to move terrified at the sight hansi dropped the mattock and choang walked out astonished at his own situation his wifes unusual magnificence and her more amazing surprise he went among the apartments unable to conceive the cause of so much splendour he was not long in suspense before his domestics informed him of every transaction since he first became insensible he could scarce believe what they told him and went in pursuit of hansi herself in order to receive more certain information or to reproach her infidelity but she prevented his reproaches he found her weltering in blood for she had stabbed herself to the heart being unable to survive her shame and disappointment  choang being a philosopher was too wise to make any loud lamentations he thought it best to bear his loss with serenity so mending up the old coffin where he had lain himself he placed his faithless spouse in his room and unwilling that so many nuptial preparations should be expended in vain he the same night married the widow with the large fan  as they both were apprised of the foibles of each other before hand they knew how to excuse them after marriage they lived together for many years in great tranquillity and not expecting rapture made a shift to find contentment  farewell letter xix to the same the gentleman dressed in black who was my companion through westminster abbey came yesterday to pay me a visit and after drinking tea we both resolved to take a walk together in order to enjoy the freshness of the country which now begins to resume its verdure before we got out of the suburbs however we were stopped in one of the streets by a crowd of people gathered in a circle round a man and his wife who seemed too loud and too angry to be understood the people were highly pleased with the dispute which upon enquiry we found to be between dr cacafogo an apothecary and his wife the doctor it seems coming unexpectedly into his wifes apartment found a gentleman there in circumstances not in the least equivocal  the doctor who was a person of nice honor resolving to revenge the flagrant insult immediately flew to the chimneypiece and taking down a rusty blunderbuss drew the trigger upon the defiler of his bed the delinquent would certainly have been shot through the head but that the piece had not been charged for many years the gallant made a shift to escape through the window but the lady still remained and as she well knew her husbands temper undertook to manage the quarrel without a second he was furious and she loud their noise had gathered all the mob who charitably assembled on the occasion not to prevent but to enjoy the quarrel  alas said i to my companion what will become of this unhappy creature thus caught in adultery believe me i pity her from my heart her husband i suppose will show her no mercy will they burn her as in india or behead her as in persia will they load her with stripes as in turkey or keep her in perpetual imprisonment as with us in china prithee what is the wifes punishment in england for such offenses when a lady is thus caught tripping replied my companion they never punish her but the husband you surely jest interrupted i i am a foreigner and you would abuse my ignorance i am really serious returned he dr cacafogo has caught his wife in the act but as he had no witnesses his small testimony goes for nothing the consequence therefore of his discovery will be that she may be packed off to live among her relations and the doctor must be obliged to allow her a separate maintenance amazing cried i is it not enough that she is permitted to live separate from the object she detests but must he give her money to keep her in spirits too that he must says my guide and be called a cuckold by all his neighbors into the bargain the men will laugh at him the ladies will pity him and all that his warmest friends can say in his favor will be that the poor good soul has never had any harm in him i want patience interrupted i what are there no private chastisements for the wife no schools of penitence to show her her folly no rods for such delinquents psha man replied he smiling if every delinquent among us were to be treated in your manner one half of the kingdom would flog the other  i must confess my dear fum that if i were an english husband of all things i would take care not to be jealous nor busily pry into these secrets my wife was pleased to keep from me should i detect her infidelity what is the consequence if i calmly pocket the abuse i am laughed at by her and her gallant if i talk my griefs aloud like a tragedy hero i am laughed at by the whole world the course then i would take would be whenever i went out to tell my wife where i was going lest i should unexpectedly meet her abroad in company with some dear deceiver whenever i returned i would use a peculiar rap at the door and give four loud hems as i walked deliberately up the staircase i would never inquisitively peep under her bed or look behind the curtains and even though i knew the captain was there i would calmly take a dish of my wifes cool tea and talk of the army with reverence  of all nations the russians seem to me to behave most wisely in such circumstances the wife promises her husband never to let him see her transgressions of this nature and he as punctually promises whenever she is so detected without the least anger to beat her without mercy so they both know what each has to expect the lady transgresses is beaten taken again into favor and all goes on as before  when a russian young lady therefore is to be married her father with a cudgel in his hand asks the bridegroom whether he chooses this virgin for his bride to which the other replies in the affirmative upon this the father turning the lady three times round and giving her three strokes with his cudgel on the back my dear cries he these are the last blows you are ever to receive from your tender father i resign my authority and my cudgel to your husband he knows better than me the use of either the bridegroom knows decorums too well to accept of the cudgel abruptly he assures the father that the lady will never want it and that he would not for the world make any use of it but the father who knows what the lady may want better than he insists upon his acceptance upon this there follows a scene of russian politeness while one refuses and the other offers the cudgel the whole however ends with the bridegrooms taking it upon which the lady drops a courtesy in token of obedience and the ceremony proceeds as usual  there is something excessively fair and open in this method of courtship by this both sides are prepared for all the matrimonial adventures that are to follow marriage has been compared to a game of skill for life it is generous thus in both parties to declare they are sharpers in the beginning in england i am told both sides use every art to conceal their defects from each other before marriage and the rest of their lives may be regarded as doing penance for their former dissimulation  farewell letter xx from the same the republic of letters is a very common expression among the europeans and yet when applied to the learned of europe is the most absurd that can be imagined since nothing is more unlike a republic than the society which goes by that name from this expression one would be apt to imagine that the learned were united into a single body joining their interests and concurring in the same design from this one might be apt to compare them to our literary societies in china where each acknowledges a just subordination and all contribute to build the temple of science without attempting from ignorance or envy to obstruct each other  but very different is the state of learning here every member of this fancied republic is desirous of governing and none willing to obey each looks upon his fellow as a rival not an assistant in the same pursuit they calumniate they injure they despise they ridicule each other if one man writes a book that pleases others shall write books to show that he might have given still greater pleasure or should not have pleased if one happens to hit upon something new there are numbers ready to assure the public that all this was no novelty to them or the learned that cardanus or brunus or some other author too dull to be generally read had anticipated the discovery thus instead of uniting like the members of a commonwealth they are divided into almost as many factions as there are men and their jarring constitution instead of being styled a republic of letters should be entitled an anarchy of literature  it is true there are some of superior abilities who reverence and esteem each other but their mutual admiration is not sufficient to shield off the contempt of the crowd the wise are but few and they praise with a feeble voice the vulgar are many and roar in reproaches the truly great seldom unite in societies have few meetings no cabals the dunces hunt in full cry till they have run down a reputation and then snarl and fight with each other about dividing the spoil here you may see the compilers and the bookanswerers of every month when they have cut up some respectable name most frequently reproaching each other with stupidity and dullness resembling the wolves of the russian sorest who prey upon venison or horseflesh when they can get it but in cases of necessity lying in wait to devour each other while they have new books to cut up they make a hearty meal but if this resource should unhappily fail then it is that critics eat up critics and compilers rob from compilations  confucius observes that it is the duty of the learned to unite society more closely and to persuade men to become citizens of the world but the authors i refer to are not only for disuniting society but kingdoms also if the english are at war with france the dunces of france think it their duty to be at war with those of england thus freron one of their first rate scriblers thinks proper to characterise all the english writers in the gross their whole merit says he consists in exaggeration and often in extravagance correct their pieces as you please there still remains a leaven which corrupts the whole they sometimes discover genius but not the smallest share of taste england is not a soil for the plants of genius to thrive in this is open enough with not the least adulation in the picture but hear what a frenchman of acknowledged abilities says upon the same subject i am at a loss to determine in what we excel the english or where they excel us when i compare the merits of both in any one species of literary composition so many reputable and pleasing writers present themselves from either country that my judgment rests in suspense i am pleased with the disquisition without finding the object of my enquiry but lest you should think the french alone are faulty in this respect hear how an english journalist delivers his sentiments of them we are amazed says he to find so many works translated from the french while we have such numbers neglected of our own in our opinion notwithstanding their same throughout the rest of europe the french are the most contemptible reasoners we had almost said writers that can be imagined however nevertheless excepting etc another english writer shaftsbury if i remember on the contrary says that the french authors are pleasing and judicious more clear more methodical and entertaining than those of his own country  from these opposite pictures you perceive that the good authors of either country praise and the bad revile each other and yet perhaps you will be surprised that indifferent writers should thus be the most apt to censure as they have the most to apprehend from recrimination you may perhaps imagine that such as are possessed of same themselves should be most ready to declare their opinions since what they say might pass for decision but the truth happens to be that the great are solicitous only of raising their own reputations while the opposite class alas are solicitous of bringing every reputation down to a level with their own  but let us acquit them of malice and envy a critic is often guided by the same motives that direct his author the author endeavors to persuade us that he has written a good book the critic is equally solicitous to show that he could write a better had he thought proper a critic is a being possessed of all the vanity but not the genius of a scholar incapable from his native weakness of lifting himself from the ground he applies to contiguous merit for support makes the sportive sallies of anothers imagination his serious employment pretends to take our feelings under his care teaches where to condemn where to lay the emphasis of praise and may with as much justice be called a man of taste as the chinese who measures his wisdom by the length of his nails  if then a book spirited or humourous happens to appear in the republic of letters several critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a single line of it for themselves had read it and they know what is most proper to excite laughter other critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal call them all spiders and assure the public that they ought to laugh without restraint another set are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book intended to show the particular passages to be laughed at when these are out others still there are who write notes upon notes thus a single new book employs not only the papermakers the printers the pressmen the bookbinders the hawkers but twenty critics and as many compilers in short the body of the learned may be compared to a persian army where there are many pioneers several sutlers numberless servants women and children in abundance and but few soldiers  adieu letter xxi to the same the english are as fond of seeing plays acted as the chinese but there is a vast difference in the manner of conducting them we play our pieces in the open air the english theirs under cover we act by daylight they by the blaze of torches one of our plays continues eight or ten days successively an english piece seldom takes up above four hours in the representation  my companion in black with whom i am now beginning to contract an intimacy introduced me a few nights ago to the playhouse where we placed ourselves conveniently at the foot of the stage as the curtain was not drawn before my arrival i had an opportunity of observing the behavior of the spectators and indulging those reflections which novelty generally inspires  the rich in general were placed in the lowest seats and the poor rose above them in degrees proportioned to their poverty the order of precedence seemed here inverted those who were undermost all the day now enjoyed a temporary eminence and became masters of the ceremonies it was they who called for the music indulging every noisy freedom and testifying all the insolence of beggary in exaltation  they who held the middle region seemed not so riotous as those above them nor yet so tame as those below to judge by their looks many of them seemed strangers there as well as myself they were chiefly employed during this period of expectation in eating oranges reading the story of the play or making assignations  those who sat in the lowest rows which are called the pit seemed to consider themselves as judges of the merit of the poet and the performers they were assembled partly to be amused and partly to show their taste appearing to labor under that restraint which an affectation of superior discernment generally produces my companion however informed me that not one in an hundred of them knew even the first principles of criticism that they assumed the right of being censors because there was none to contradict their pretensions and that every man who now called himself a connoisseur became such to all intents and purposes  those who sat in the boxes appeared in the most unhappy situation of all the rest of the audience came merely for their own amusement these rather to furnish out a part of the entertainment themselves i could not avoid considering them as acting parts in dumb show not a curtesy or nod that was not the result of art not a look nor a smile that was not designed for murder gentlemen and ladies ogled each other through spectacles for my companion observed that blindness was of late become fashionable all affected indifference and ease while their hearts at the same time burned for conquest upon the whole the lights the music the ladies in their gayest dresses the men with cheerfulness and expectation in their looks all conspired to make a most agreeable picture and to fill an heart that sympathises at human happiness with inexpressible serenity  the expected time for the play to begin at last arrived the curtain was drawn and the actors came on a woman who personated a queen came in curtesying to the audience who clapped their hands upon her appearance clapping of hands is it seems the manner of applauding in england the manner is absurd but every country you know has its peculiar absurdities i was equally surprised however at the submission of the actress who should have considered herself as a queen as at the little discernment of the audience who gave her such marks of applause before she attempted to deserve them preliminaries between her and the audience being thus adjusted the dialogue was supported between her and a most hopeful youth who acted the part of her confidant they both appeared in extreme distress for it seems the queen had lost a child some fifteen years before and still kept its dear resemblance next her heart while her kind companion bore a part in her sorrows  her lamentations grew loud comfort is offered but she detests the very sound she bids them preach comfort to the winds upon this her husband comes in who seeing the queen so much afflicted can himself hardly refrain from tears or avoid partaking in the soft distress after thus grieving through three scenes the curtain dropped for the first act  truly said i to my companion these kings and queens are very much disturbed at no very great misfortune certain i am were people of humbler stations to act in this manner they would be thought divested of common sense i had scarce finished this observation when the curtain rose and the king came on in a violent passion his wife had it seems refused his proffered tenderness had spurned his royal embrace and he seemed resolved not to survive her fierce disdain after he had thus fretted and the queen had fretted through the second act the curtain was let down once more  now says my companion you perceive the king to be a man of spirit he feels at every pore one of your phlegmatic sons of clay would have given the queen her own way and let her come to herself by degrees but the king is for immediate tenderness or instant death death and tenderness are leading passions of every modern buskined hero this moment they embrace and the next stab mixing daggers and kisses in every period  i was going to second his remarks when my attention was engrossed by a new object a man came in balancing a straw upon his nose and the audience were clapping their hands in all the raptures of applause to what purpose cried i does this unmeaning figure make his appearance is he a part of the plot unmeaning do you call him replied my friend in black this is one of the most important characters of the whole play nothing pleases the people more than the seeing a straw balanced there is a great deal of meaning in the straw there is something suited to every apprehension in the sight and a fellow possessed of talents like these is sure of making his fortune  the third act now began with an actor who came to inform us that he was the villain of the play and intended to show strange things before all was over he was joined by another who seemed as much disposed for mischief as he their intrigues continued through this whole division if that be a villain said i he must be a very stupid one to tell his secrets without being asked such soliloquies of late are never admitted in china  the noise of clapping interrupted me once more a child of six years old was learning to dance on the stage which gave the ladies and mandarines infinite satisfaction i am sorry said i to see the pretty creature so early learning so very bad a trade dancing being i presume as contemptible here as it is in china quite the reverse interrupted my companion dancing is a very reputable and genteel employment here men have a greater chance for encouragement from the merit of their heels than their heads one who jumps up and flourishes his toes three times before he comes to the ground may have three hundred a year he who flourishes them four times gets four hundred but he who arrives at five is inestimable and may demand what salary he thinks proper the female dancers too are valued for this sort of jumping and crossing and it is a cant word among them that she deserves most who shows highest but the fourth act is begun let us be attentive  in the fourth act the queen finds her long lost child now grown up into a youth of smart parts and great qualifications wherefore she wisely considers that the crown will fit his head better than that of her husband whom she knows to be a driveler the king discovers her design and here comes on the deep distress he loves the queen and he loves the kingdom he resolves therefore in order to possess both that her son must die the queen exclaims at his barbarity is frantic with rage and at length overcome with sorrow falls into a fit upon which the curtain drops and the act is concluded  observe the art of the poet cries my companion when the queen can say no more she falls into a fit while thus her eyes are shut while she is supported in the arms of abigail what horrors do we not fancy we feel it in every nerve take my word for it that fits are the true aposiopesis of modern tragedy  the fifth act began and a busy piece it was scenes shifting trumpets sounding mobs hallooing carpets spreading guards bustling from one door to another gods demons daggers racks and ratsbane but whether the king was killed or the queen was drowned or the son was poisoned i have absolutely forgotten  when the play was over i could not avoid observing that the persons of the drama appeared in as much distress in the first act as the last how is it possible said i to sympathize with them through five long acts pity is but a shortlived passion i hate to hear an actor mouthing trifles neither startings strainings nor attitudes affect me unless there be cause after i have been once or twice deceived by those unmeaning alarms my heart sleeps in peace probably unaffected by the principal distress there should be one great passion aimed at by the actor as well as the poet all the rest should be subordinate and only contribute to make that the greater if the actor therefore exclaims upon every occasion in the tones of despair he attempts to move us too soon he anticipates the blow he ceases to affect though he gains our applause  i scarce perceived that the audience were almost all departed wherefore mixing with the crowd my companion and i got into the street where essaying an hundred obstacles from coach wheels and palanquin poles like birds in their flight through the branches of a forest after various turnings we both at length got home in safety  adieu letter xxii from the same the letter which came by the way of smyrna and which you sent me unopened was from my son as i have permitted you to take copies of all those i send to china you might have made no ceremony in opening those directed to me either in joy or sorrow my friend should participate in my feelings it would give pleasure to see a good man pleased at my success it would give almost equal pleasure to see him simpathise at my disappointment  every account i receive from the east seems to come loaded with some new affliction my wife and daughter were taken from me and yet i sustained the loss with intrepidity my son is made a slave among barbarians which was the only blow that could have reached my heart yes i will indulge the transports of nature for a little in order to show i can overcome them in the end true magnanimity consists not in never falling but in rising every time we fall  when our mighty emperor had published his displeasure at my departure and seized upon all that was mine my son was privately secreted from his resentment under the protection and guardianship of fum hoam the best and the wisest of all the inhabitants of china he was for some time instructed in the learning of the missionaries and the wisdom of the east but hearing of my adventures and incited by filial piety he was resolved to follow my fortunes and share my distress  he passed the confines of china in disguise hired himself as a cameldriver to a caravan that was crossing the deserts of thibet and was within one days journey of the river laur which divides that country from india when a body of wandering tartars falling unexpectedly upon the caravan plundered it and made those who escaped their first fury slaves by those he was led into the extensive and desolate regions that border on the shores of the aral lake  here he lived by hunting and was obliged to supply every day a certain proportion of the spoil to regale his savage masters his learning his virtues and even his beauty were qualifications that no way served to recommend him they knew no merit but that of providing large quantities of milk and raw flesh and were sensible of no happiness but that of rioting on the undressed meal  some merchants from mesched however coming to trade with the tartars for slaves he was sold among the number and led into the kingdom of persia where he is now detained he is there obliged to watch the looks of a voluptuous and cruel master a man fond of pleasure yet incapable of refinement whom many years service in war has taught pride but not bravery  that treasure which i still kept within my bosom my child my all that was left to me is now a slave this whole apostrophe seems most literally translted from ambulaaohamed the arabian poet good heavens why was this why have i been introduced into this mortal apartment to be a spectator of my own misfortunes and the misfortunes of my fellow creatures wherever i turn what a labyrinth of doubt error and disappointment appears why was i brought into being for what purposes made from whence have i come whither strayed or to what regions am i hastening reason cannot resolve it lends a ray to show the horrors of my prison but not a light to guide me to escape them ye boasted revelations of the earth how little do you aid the enquiry  how am i surprised at the inconsistency of the magi their two principles of good and evil affright me the indian who bathes his visage in urine and calls it piety strikes me with astonishment the christian who believes in three gods is highly absurd the jews who pretend that deity is pleased with the effusion of blood are not less displeasing i am equally surprised that rational beings can come from the extremities of the earth in order to kiss a stone or scatter pebbles how contrary to reason are those and yet all pretend to teach me to be happy  surely all men are blind and ignorant of truth mankind wanders unknowing his way from morning till the evening where shall we turn after happiness or is it wisest to desist from the pursuit like reptiles in a corner of some stupendous palace we peep from our holes look about us wonder at all we see but are ignorant of the great architects design o for a revelation of himself for a plan of his universal system o for the reasons of our creation or why we were created to be thus unhappy if we are to experience no other felicity but what this life affords then are we miserable indeed if we are born only to look about us repine and die then has heaven been guilty of injustice if this life terminates my existence i despise the blessings of providence and the wisdom of the giver if this life be my all let the following epitaph be written on the tomb of altangi by my fathers crimes i received this by my own crimes i bequeath it to posterity  letter xxiii to the same yet while i sometimes lament the cause of humanity and the depravity of human nature there now and then appear gleams of greatness that serve to relieve the eye oppressed with the hideous prospect and resemble those cultivated spots that are sometimes found in the midst of an asiatic wilderness i see many superior excellencies among the english which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide i see virtues which in other countries are known only to a few practiced here by every rank of people  i know not whether it proceeds from their superior opulence that the english are more charitable than the rest of mankind whether by being possessed of all the conveniences of life themselves they have more leisure to perceive the uneasy situation of the distressed whatever be the motive they are not only the most charitable of any other nation but most judicious in distinguishing the properest objects of compassion  in other counties the giver is generally influenced by the immediate impulse of pity his generosity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneasy sensations as to comfort the object in distress in england benefactions are of a more general nature some men of fortune and universal benevolence propose the proper objects the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvassed by the people neither passion nor pity find a place in the cool discussion and charity is then only exerted when it has received the approbation of reason  a late instance of this finely directed benevolence forces itself so strongly on my imagination that it in a manner reconciles me to pleasure and once more makes me the universal friend of man  the english and french have not only political reasons to induce them to mutual hatred but often the more prevailing motive of private interest to widen the breach a war between other countries is carried on collectively army fights against army and a mans own private resentment is lost in that of the community but in england and france the individuals of each country plunder each other at sea without redress and consequently feel that animosity against each other which passengers do at a robber they have for some time carried on an expensive war and several captives have been taken on both sides those made prisoners by the french have been used with cruelty and guarded with unnecessary caution those taken by the english being much more numerous were confined in the ordinary manner and not being released by their countrymen began to feel all the inconveniences which arise from want of covering and long confinement  their countrymen were informed of their deplorable situation but they more intent on annoying their enemies than relieving their friends refused the least assistance the english now saw thousands of their fellow creatures starving in every prison forsaken by those whose duty it was to protect them laboring with disease and without clothes to keep off the severity of the season national benevolence prevailed over national animosity their prisoners were indeed enemies but they were enemies in distress they ceased to be hateful when they no longer continued to be formidable forgetting therefore their national hatred the men who were brave enough to conquer were generous enough to forgive and they whom all the world seemed to have disclaimed at last found pity and redress from those they attempted to subdue a subscription was opened ample charities collected proper necessaries procured and the poor gay sons of a merry nation were once more taught to resume their former gaiety  when i cast my eye over the list of those who contributed on this occasion i find the names almost entirely english scarce one foreigner appears a mong the number it was for englishmen alone to be capable of such exalted virtue i own i cannot look over this catalogue of good men and philosophers without thinking better of myself because it makes me entertain a more favorable opinion of mankind i am particularly struck with one who writes these words upon the paper that enclosed his benefaction the mite of an englishman a citizen of the world to frenchmen prisoners of war and naked i only wish that he may find as much pleasure from his virtues as i have done in reflecting upon them that alone will amply reward him such a one my friend is an honor to human nature he makes no private distinctions of party all that are stamped with the divine image of their creator are friends to him he is a native of the world and the emperor of china may be proud that he has such a countryman  to rejoice at the destruction of our enemies is a foible ingrafted upon human nature and we must be permitted to indulge it the true way of atoning for such an ill founded pleasure is thus to turn our triumph into an act of benevolence and to testify our own joy by endeavoring to banish anxiety from others  hamti the best and wisest emperor that ever filled the throne after having gained three signal victories over the tartars who had invaded his dominions returned to nankin in order to enjoy the glory of his conquest after he had rested for some days the people who are naturally fond of processions impatiently expected the triumphal entry which emperors upon such occasions were accustomed to make their murmurs came to the emperors ear he loved his people and was willing to do all in his power to satisfy their just desires he therefore assured them that he intended upon the next feast of the lanthorns to exhibit one of the most glorious triumphs that had ever been seen in china  the people were in raptures at his condescension and on the appointed day assembled at the gates of the palace with the most eager expectations here they waited for some time without seeing any of those preparations which usually precede a pageant the lanthorn with ten thousand tapers was not yet brought forth the fireworks which usually covered the city walls were not yet lighted the people once more began to murmur at this delay when in the midst of their impatience the palace gates flew open and the emperor himself appeared not in splendour or magnificence but in an ordinary habit followed by the blind the maimed and the strangers of the city all in new clothes and each carrying in his hand money enough to supply his necessities for the year the people were at first amazed but soon perceived the wisdom of their king who taught them that to make one man happy was more truly great than having ten thousand captives groaning at the wheels of his chariot  adieu letter xxiv to the same whatever may be the merits of the english in other sciences they seem peculiarly excellent in the art of healing there is scarcely a disorder incident to humanity against which they are not possessed with a most infallible antidote the professors of other arts confess the inevitable intricacy of things talk with doubt and decide with hesitation but doubting is entirely unknown in medicine the advertising professors here delight in cases of difficulty be the disorder never so desperate or radical you will find numbers in every street who by levelling a pill at the part affected promise a certain cure without loss of time knowledge of a bedfellow or hindrance of business  when i consider the assiduity of this profession their benevolence amazes me they not only in general give their medicines for half value but use the most persuasive remonstrances to induce the sick to come and be cured sure there must be something strangely obstinate in an english patient who refuses so much health upon such easy terms does he take a pride in being bloated with a dropsy does he find pleasure in the alternations of an intermittent fever or feel as much satisfaction in nursing up his gout as he found pleasure in acquiring it he must otherwise he would never reject such repeated assurances of instant relief what can be more convincing than the manner in which the sick are invited to be well the doctor first begs the most earnest attention of the public to what he is going to propose he solemnly affirms the pill was never found to want success he produces a list of those who have been rescued from the grave by taking it yet notwithstanding all this there are many here who now and then think proper to be sick only sick did i say there are some who even think proper to die yes by the head of confucius they die though they might have purchased the healthrestoring specific for half a crown at every corner  i am amazed my dear fum hoam that these doctors who know what an obstinate set of people they have to deal with have never thought of attempting to revive the dead when the living are found to reject their prescriptions they ought in conscience to apply to the dead from whom they can expect no such mortifying repulses they would find in the dead the most complying patients imaginable and what gratitude might they not expect from the patients son now no longer an heir and his wife now no longer a widow  think not my friend that there is any thing chimerical in such an attempt they already perform cures equally strange what can be more truly astonishing than to see old age restored to youth and vigor to the most feeble constitutions yet this is performed here every day a simple electuary effects these wonders even without the bungling ceremonies of having the patient boiled up in a kettle or ground down in a mill  few physicians here go through the ordinary courses of education but receive all their knowledge of medicine by immediate inspiration from heaven some are thus inspired even in the womb and what is very remarkable understand their profession as well at three years old as at threescore others have spent a great part of their lives unconscious of any latent excellence til a bankruptcy or a residence in goal have called their miraculous powers into exertion and others still there are indebted to their superlative ignorance alone for success the more ignorant the practitioner the less capable is he thought of deceiving the people here judge as they do in the east where it is thought absolutely requisite that a man should be an idiot before he pretend to be either a conjurer or a doctor  when a physician by inspiration is sent for he never perplexes the patient by previous examination he asks very few questions and those only for form sake he knows every disorder by intuition he administers the pill or drop for every distemper nor is more inquisitive than the farrier while he drenches an horse if the patient lives then has he one more to add to the surviving list if he dies then it may be justly said of the patients disorder that as it was not cured the disorder was incurable  letter xxv from the same i was some days ago in company with a politician who very pathetically declaimed upon the miserable situation of his country he assured me that the whole political machine was moving in a wrong track and that scarce ever abilities like his own could ever set it right again what have we said he to do with the wars on the continent we are a commercial nation we have only to cultivate commerce like our neighbors the dutch it is our business to increase trade by settling new colonies riches are the strength of a nation and for the rest our ships our ships alone will protect us i found it vain to oppose my feeble arguments to those of a man who thought himself wise enough to direct even the ministry i fancied however that i saw with more certainty because i reasoned without prejudice i therefore begged leave instead of argument to relate a short history he gave me a smile at once of condescension and contempt and i proceeded as follows to describe the rise and declension of the kingdom of lao  northward of china and in one of the doublings of the great wall the fruitful province of lao enjoyed its liberty and a peculiar government of its own as the inhabitants were on all sides surrounded by the wall they feared no sudden invasion from the tartars and being each possessed of property they were zealous in its defense  the natural consequences of security and affluence in any country is a love of pleasure when the wants of nature are supplied we seek after the conveniences when possessed of these we desire the luxuries of life and when every luxury is provided it is then ambition takes up the man and leaves him still something to wish for the inhabitants of the country from primitive simplicity soon began to aim at elegance and from elegance proceeded to refinement it was now found absolutely requisite for the good of the state that the people should be divided formerly the same hand that was employed in tilling the ground or in dressing up the manufactures was also in time of need a soldier but the custom was now changed for it was perceived that a man bred up from childhood to the arts either of peace or war became more eminent by this means in his respective profession the inhabitants were therefore now distinguished into artizans and soldiers and while those improved the luxuries of life these watched for the security of the people  a country possessed of freedom has always two sorts of enemies to fear foreign foes who attack its existence from without and internal miscreants who betray its liberties within the inhabitants of lao were to guard against both a country of artizans were most likely to preserve internal liberty and a nation of soldiers were fittest to repel a foreign invasion hence naturally arose a division of opinion between the artizans and the soldiers of the kingdom the artizans ever complaining that freedom was threatened by an armed internal force were for disbanding the soldiers and insisted that their walls their walls alone were sufficient to repel the most formidable invasion the warriors on the contrary represented the power of the neighboring kings the combinations formed against their state and the weakness of the wall which every earthquake might overturn while this altercation continued the kingdom might be justly said to enjoy its greatest share of vigor every order in the state by being watchful over each other contributed to diffuse happiness equally and balanced the state the arts of peace flourished nor were those of war neglected the neighboring powers who had nothing to apprehend from the ambition of men whom they only saw solicitous not for riches but freedom were contented to traffic with them they sent their goods to be manufactured in lao and paid a large price for them upon their return  by these means this people at length became moderately rich and their opulence naturally invited the invader a tartar prince led an immense army against them and they as bravely stood up in their own defense they were still inspired with a love of their country they fought the barbarous enemy with fortitude and gained a complete victory  from this moment which they regarded as the completion of their glory historians date their downfall they had risen in strength by a love of their country and fell by indulging ambition the country possessed by the invading tartars seemed to them a prize that would not only render them more formidable for the future but which would increase their opulence for the present it was unanimously resolved therefore both by soldiers and artizans that those desolate regions should be peopled by colonies from lao when a trading nation begins to act the conqueror it is then perfectly undone it subsists in some measure by the support of its neighbors while they continue to regard it without envy or apprehension trade may flourish but when once it presumes to assert as its right what it only enjoyed as a favor each country reclaims that part of commerce which it has power to take back and turns it into some other channel more honorable though perhaps less convenient  every neighbor now began to regard with jealous eyes this ambitious commonwealth and forbade their subjects any future intercourse with them the inhabitants of lao however still pursued the same ambitious maxims it was from their colonies alone they expected riches and riches said they are strength and strength is security numberless were the migrations of the desperate and enterprizing of this country to people the desolate dominions lately possessed by the tartar between these colonies and the mother country a very advantageous traffic was at first carried on the republic sent their colonies large quantities of the manufactures of the country and they in return provided the republic with an equivalent in ivory and ginseng by this means the inhabitants became immensely rich and this produced an equal degree of voluptuousness for men who have much money will always find some fantastical modes of enjoyment how shall i mark the steps by which they declined every colony in process of time spreads over the whole country where it first was planted as it grows more populous it becomes more polite and those manufactures for which it was in the beginning obliged to others it learns to dress up itself such was the case with the colonies of lao they in less than a century became a powerful and a polite people and the more polite they grew the less advantageous was the commerce which still subsisted between them and others by this means the mother country being abridged in its commerce grew poorer but not less luxurious their former wealth had introduced luxury and wherever luxury once fixes no art can either lessen or remove it their commerce with their neighbors was totally destroyed and that with their colonies was every day naturally and necessarily declining they still however preserved the insolence of wealth without a power to support it and persevered in being luxurious while contemptible from poverty in short the state resembled one of those bodies bloated with disease whose bulk is only a symptom of its wretchedness their former opulence only rendered them more impotent as those individuals who are reduced from riches to poverty are of all men the most unfortunate and helpless they had imagined because their colonies tended to make them rich upon the first acquisition they would still continue to do so they now found however that on themselves alone they should have depended for support that colonies ever afford but temporary affluence and when cultivated and polite are no longer useful from such a concurrence of circumstances they soon became contemptible the emperor honti invaded them with a powerful army historians do not say whether their colonies were too remote to lend assistance or else were desirous of shaking off their dependence but certain it is they scarce made any resistance their walls were now found but a weak defense and they at length were obliged to acknowledge subjection to the empire of china  happy very happy might they have been had they known when to bound their riches and their glory had they known that extending empire is often diminishing power that countries are ever strongest which are internally powerful that colonies by draining away the brave and enterprizing leave the country in the hands of the timid and the avaritious that walls give little protection unless manned with resolution that too much commerce may injure a nation as well as too little and that there is a wide difference between a conquering and a flourishing empire  adieu letter xxv from the same though fond of many acquaintances i desire an intimacy only with a few the man in black whom i have often mentioned is one whose friendship i could wish to acquire because he possesses my esteem his manners it is true are tinctured with some strange inconsistencies and he may be justly termed an humourist in a nation of humourists though he is generous even to profusion he affects to be thought a prodigy of parsimony and prudence though his conversation be replete with the most sordid and selfish maxims his heart is dilated with the most unbounded love i have known him profess himself a manhater while his cheek was glowing with compassion and while his looks were softened into pity i have heard him use the language of the most unbounded ill nature some affect humanity and tenderness others boast of having such dispositions from nature but he is the only man i ever knew who seemed ashamed of his natural benevolence he takes as much pains to hide his feelings as any hypocrite would to conceal his indifference but on every unguarded moment the mask drops off and reveals him to the most superficial observer  in one of our late excursions into the country happening to discourse upon the provision that was made for the poor in england he seemed amazed how any of his countrymen could be so foolishly weak as to relieve occasional objects of charity when the laws had made such ample provision for their support in every parish house says he the poor are supplied with food clothes fire and a bed to lie on they want no more i desire no more myself yet still they seem discontented i am surprised at the inactivity of our magistrates in not taking up such vagrants who are only a weight upon the industrious i am surprised that the people are ound to relieve them when they must be at the same time sensible that it in some measure encourages idleness extravagance and imposture were i to advise any man for whom i had the least regard i would caution him by all means not to be imposed upon by their false pretenses let me assure you sir they are impostors every one of them and rather merit a prison than relief  he was procceeding in this strain earnestly to dissuade me from an imprudence of which i am seldom guilty when an old man who still had about him the remnants of tattered finery implored our compassion he assured us that he was no common beggar but forced into the shameful profession to support a dying wife and five hungry children being prepossessed against such falsehoods his story had not the least influence upon me but it was quite otherwise with the man in black i could see it visibly operate upon his countenance and effectually interrupt his harangue i could easily perceive that his heart burned to relieve the five starving children but he seemed ashamed to discover his weakness to me while he thus hesitated between compassion and pride i pretended to look another way and he seized this opportunity of giving the poor petitioner a piece of silver bidding him at the same time in order that i should hear go work for his bread and not teize passengers with such impertinent falsehoods for the future  as he had fancied himself quite unperceived he continued as we proceeded to rail against beggars with as much animosity as before he threw in some episodes on his own amazing prudence and economy with his profound skill in discovering impostors he explained the manner in which he would deal with beggars were he a magistrate hinted at enlarging some of the prisons for their reception and told two stories of ladies that were robbed by beggarmen he was beginning a third to the same purpose when a sailor with a wooden leg once more crossed our walks desiring our pity and blessing our limbs i was for going on without taking any notice but my friend looking wishfully upon the poor petitioner bid me stop and he would show me with how much ease he could at any time detect an impostor  he now therefore assumed a look of importance and in an angry tone began to examine the sailor demanding in what engagement he was thus disabled and rendered unfit for service the sailor replied in a tone as angrily as he that he had been an officer on board a private ship of war and that he had lost his leg abroad in defense of those who did nothing at home at this reply all my friends importance vanished in a moment he had not a single question more to ask he now only studied what method he should take to relieve him unobserved he had however no easy part to act as he was obliged to preserve the appearance of ill nature before me and yet relieve himself by relieving the sailor casting therefore a furious look upon some bundles of chips which the fellow carried in a string at his back my friend demanded how he sold his matches but not waiting for a reply desired in a surly tone to have a shillings worth the sailor seemed at first surprised at his demand but soon recollecting himself and presenting his whole bundle here master says he take all my cargo and a blessing into the bargain  it is impossible to describe with what an air of triumph my friend marched off with his new purchase he assured me that he was firmly of opinion that those fellows must have stolen their goods who could thus afford to sell them for half value he informed me of several different uses to which those chips might be applied he expatiated largely upon the savings that would result from lighting candles with a match instead of thrusting them into the fire he averred that he would as soon have parted with a tooth as his money to those vagabonds unless for some valuable consideration i cannot tell how long this panegyric upon frugality and matches might have continued had not his attention been called off by another object more distressful than either of the former a woman in rags with one child in her arms and another on her back was attempting to sing ballads but with such a mournful voice that it was difficult to determine whether she was singing or crying a wretch who in the deepest distress still aimed at good humor was an object my friend was by no means capable of withstanding his vivacity and his discourse were instantly interrupted upon this occasion his very dissimulation had forsaken him even in my presence he immediately applied his hands to his pockets in order to relieve her but guess his confusion when he found he had already given away all the money he carried about him to former objects the misery painted in the womans visage was not half so strongly expressed as the agony in his he continued to search for some time but to no purpose till at length recollecting himself with a face of ineffable good nature as he had no money he put into her hands his shillings worth of matches  letter xxvi to the same as there appeared something reluctantly good in the character of my companion i must own it surprised me what could be his motives for thus concealing virtues which others take such pains to display i was unable to repress my desire of knowing the history of a man who thus seemed to act under continual restraint and whose benevolence was rather the effect of appetite than reason  it was not however till after repeated solicitations he thought proper to gratify my curiosity if you are fond says he of hearing hair breadthscapes my history must certainly please for i have been for twenty years upon the very verge of starving without ever being starved  my father the younger son of a good family was possessed of a small living in the church his education was above his fortune and his generosity greater than his education poor as he was he had his flatterers still poorer than himself for every dinner he gave them they returned him an equivalent in praise and this was all he wanted the same ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army influenced my father at the head of his table he told the story of the ivytree and that was laughed at he repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches and the company laughed at that but the story of taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar thus his pleasure increased in proportion to the pleasure he gave he loved all the world and he fancied all the world loved him  as his fortune was but small he lived up to the very extent of it he had no intentions of leaving his children money for that was dross he was resolved they should have learning for learning he used to observe was better than silver or gold for this purpose he undertook to instruct us himself and took as much pains to form our morals as to improve our understanding we were told that universal benevolence was what first cemented society we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as our own to regard the human face divine with affection and esteem he wound us up to be mere machines of pity and rendered us incapable of withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious distress in a word we were perfectly instructed in the art of giving away thousands before we were taught the more necessary qualifications of getting a farthing  i cannot avoid imagining that thus refined by his lessons out of all my suspicion and divested of even all the little cunning which nature had given me i resembled upon my first entrance into the busy and insidious world one of those gladiators who were exposed without armor in the amphitheatre at rome my father however who had only seen the world on one side seemed to triumph in my superior discernment though my whole stock of wisdom consisted in being able to talk like himself upon subjects that once were useful because they were then topics of the busy world but that now were utterly useless because connected with the busy world no longer  the first opportunity he had of finding his expectations disappointed was at the very middling figure i made in the university he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation but was mortified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown his disappointment might have been partly ascribed to his having overrated my talents and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time when my imagination and memory yet unsatisfied were more eager after new objects than desirous of reasoning upon those i knew this did not however please my tutors who observed indeed that i was a little dull but at the same time allowed that i seemed to be very good natured and had no harm in me  after i had resided at college seven years my father died and left me  his blessing thus shoved from shore without ill nature to protect or cunning to guide or proper stores to subsist me in so dangerous a voyage i was obliged to embark in the wide world at twentyone but in order to settle in life my friends advised for they always advise when they begin to despise us they advised me i say to go into orders  to be obliged to wear a long wig when i liked a short one or a black coat when i generally dressed in brown i thought was such a restraint upon my liberty that i absolutely rejected the proposal a priest in england is not the same mortified creature with a bonze in china with us not he that fasts best but eats best is reckoned the best liver yet i rejected a life of luxury indolence and ease from no other consideration but that boyish one of dress so that my friends were now perfectly satisfied i was undone and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the least harm in him and was so very good natured  poverty naturally begets dependence and i was admitted as flatterer to a great man at first i was surprised that the situation of a flatterer at a great mans table could be thought disagreeable there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke and laughing when he looked round for applause this even good manners might have obliged me to perform i found however too soon that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end i now rather aimed at setting him right than at receiving his absurdities with submission to flatter those we do not know is an easy task but to flatter our intimate acquaintances all whose foibles are strongly in our eye is drudgery insupportable every time i now opened my lips in praise my falsehood went to my conscience his lordship soon perceived me to be unfit for service i was therefore discharged my patron at the same time being graciously pleased to observe that he believed i was tolerably goodnatured and had not the least harm in me  disappointed in ambition i had recourse to love a young lady who lived with her aunt and was possessed of a very pretty fortune in her own disposal had given me as i fancied some reasons to expect success the symptoms by which i was guided were striking she had always laughed with me at her awkward acquaintance and at her aunt among the number she always observed that a man of sense would make a better husband than a fool and i as constantly applied the observation in my own favor she continually talked in my company of friendship and the beauties of the mind and spoke of mr shrimp my rivals highheeld shoes with detestation these were circumstances which i thought strongly in my favor so after resolving and reresolving i had courage enough to tell her my mind miss heard my proposal with serenity seeming at the same time to study the figures of her fan out at last it came there was but one small objection to complete our happiness which was no more than  that she was married three months before to mr shrimp with highheeled shoes by way of consolation however she observed that though i was disappointed in her my addresses to her aunt would probably kindle her into sensibility as the old lady always allowed me to be very good natured and not to have the least share of harm in me  yet still i had friends numerous friends and to them i was resolved to apply o friendship thou fond soother of the human breast to thee we fly in every calamity to thee the wretched seek for succor on thee the care tired son of misery fondly relies from thy kind assistance the unfortunate always hopes relief and may be ever sure of  disappointment my first application was to a city scrivener who had frequently offered to lend me money when he knew i did not want it i informed him that now was the time to put his friendship to the test that i wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occasion and was resolved to take it up from him and pray sir cried my friend do you want all this money indeed i never wanted it more returned i i am sorry for that cries the scrivener with all my heart for they who want money when they come to borrow will always want money when they should come to pay  from him i flew with indignation to one of the best friends i had in the world and made the same request indeed mr drybone cries my friend i always thought it would come to this you know sir i would not advise you but for your own good but your conduct has hitherto been ridiculous in the highest degree and some of your acquaintance always thought you a very silly fellow let me see you want two hundred pounds do you want only two hundred sir exactly to confess a truth returned i i shall want three hundred but then i have another friend from whom i can borrow the rest why then replied my friend if you would take my advice and you know i should not presume to advise you but for your own good i would recommend it to you to borrow the whole sum from that other friend and then one note will serve for all you know  poverty now began to come fast upon me yet instead of growing more provident or cautious as i grew poor i became every day more indolent and simple a friend was arrested for fifty pounds i was unable to extricate him except by becoming his bail when at liberty he fled from his creditors and left me to take his place in prison i expected greater satisfactions than i had enjoyed at large i hoped to converse with men in this new world simple and believing like myself but i found them as cunning and as cautious as those in the world i had left behind they spunged upon my money whilst it lasted borrowed my coals and never paid them and cheated me when i played at cribbage all this was done because they believed me to be very goodnatured and knew that i had no harm in me  upon my first entrance into this mansion which is to some the abode of despair i felt no sensations different from these i experienced abroad i was now on one side the door and those who were unconfined were on the other this was all the difference between us at first indeed i felt some uneasiness in considering how i should be able to provide this week for the wants of the week ensuing but after some time if i found myself sure of eating one day i never troubled my head how i was to be supplied another i seized every precarious meal with the utmost good humor indulged no rants of spleen at my situation never called down heaven and all the stars to behold me dining upon an halfpennyworth of radishes my very companions were taught to believe that i liked sallad better than mutton i contented myself with thinking that all my life i should either eat white bread or brown considered that all that happened was best laughed when i was not in pain took the world  it went and read tacitus often for want of more books and company  how long i might have continued in this torpid state of simplicity i cannot tell had i not been rouzed by seeing an old acquaintance whom i knew to be a prudent blockhead preferred to a place in the government i now found that i had pursued a wrong track and that the true way of being able to relieve others was first to aim at independence myself my immediate care therefore was to leave my present habitation and make an entire reformation in my conduct and behavior for a free open undesigning deportment i put on that of closeness prudence and economy one of the most heroic actions i ever performed and for which i shall praise myself as long as i live was the refusing half a crown to an old acquaintance at the time when he wanted it and i had it to spare for this alone i deserve to be decreed an ovation  i now therefore pursued a course of uninterrupted frugality seldom wanted a dinner and was consequently invited to twenty i soon began to get the character of a saving hunks that had money and insensibly grew into esteem neighbors have asked my advice in the disposal of their daughters and i have always taken care not to give any i have contracted a friendship with an alderman only by observing that if we take a farthing from a thousand pound it will be a thousand pound no longer i have been invited to a pawnbrokers table by pretending to hate gravy and am now actually upon treaty of marriage with a rich widow for only having observed that the bread was rising if ever i am asked a question whether i know it or not instead of answering i only smile and look wise if a charity is proposed i go about with the hat but put nothing in myself if a wretch solicits my pity i observe that the world is filled with impostors and take a certain method of not being deceived by never relieving in short i now find the truest way of finding esteem even from the indigent is to give away nothing and thus have much in our power to give  letter xxvii to the same lately in company with my friend in black whose conversation is now both my amusement and instruction i could not avoid observing the great numbers of old bachelors and maiden ladies with which this city seems to be overrun sure marriage said i is not sufficiently encouraged or we should never behold such crowds of battered beaux and decayed coquets still attempting to drive a trade they have been so long unfit for and swarming upon the gaiety of the age i behold an old bachelor in the most contemptible light as an animal that lives upon the common stock without contributing his share he is a beast of prey and the laws should make use of as many stratagems and as much force to drive the reluctant savage into the toils as the indians when they hunt the hyena or the rhinoceros the mob should be permitted to halloo after him boys might play tricks on him with impunity every wellbred company should laugh at him and if when turned of sixty he offered to make love his mistress might spit in his face or what would be perhaps a greater punishment should fairly grant him the favor  as for old maids continued i they should not be treated with so much severity because i suppose none would be so if they could no lady in her senses would choose to make a subordinate figure at christenings and lyingsin when she might be the principal herself nor curry favor with a sisterinlaw when she might command an husband nor toil in preparing custards when she might lie a bed and give directions how they ought to be made nor stifle all her sensations in demure formality when she might with matrimonial freedom shake her acquaintance by the hand and wink at a double entendre no lady could be so very silly as to live single if she could help it i consider an unmarried lady declining into the vale of years as one of those charming countries bordering on china that lies waste for want of proper inhabitants we are not to accuse the country but the ignorance of its neighbors who are insensible of its beauties though at liberty to enter and cultivate the soil  indeed sir replied my companion you are very little acquainted with the english ladies to think they are old maids against their will i dare venture to affirm that you can hardly select one of them all but has had frequent offers of marriage which either pride or avarice has not made her reject instead of thinking it a disgrace they take every occasion to boast of their former cruelty a soldier does not exult more when he counts over the wounds he has received than a female veteran when she relates the wounds she has formerly given exhaustless when she begins a narrative of the former deathdealing power of her eyes she tells of the knight in gold lace who died with a single frown and never rose again till  he was married to his maid of the squire who being cruelly denied fell in a rage flew to the window and lifting up the sash threw himself in an agony  into his arm chair of the parson who crossed in love resolutely swallowed opium which banished the stings of despised love by  making him sleep in short she talks over her former losses with pleasure and like some tradesmen finds consolation in the many bankruptcies she has suffered  for this reason whenever i see a superannuated beauty still unmarried i tacitly accuse her either of pride avarice coquetry or affectation there is miss jenny tinderbox i once remember her to have had some beauty and a moderate fortune her elder sister happened to marry a man of quality and this seemed as a statute of virginity against poor jane because there was one lucky hit in the family she was resolved not to disgrace it by introducing a tradesman by thus rejecting her equals and neglected or despised by her superiors she now acts in the capacity of tutoress to her sisters children and undergoes the drudgery of three servants without receiving the wages of one  miss squeeze was a pawnbrokers daughter her father had early taught her that money was a very good thing and left her a moderate fortune at his death she was so perfectly sensible of the value of what she had got that she was resolved never to part with a farthing without an equality on the part of her suitor she thus refused several offers made her by people who wanted to better themselves as the saying is and grew old and illnatured without ever considering that she should have made an abatement in her pretensions from her face being pale and marked with the smallpox  lady betty tempest on the contrary had beauty with fortune and family but fond of conquest she passed from triumph to triumph she had read plays and romances and there had learned that a plain man of common sense was no better than a fool such she refused and sighed only for the gay giddy inconstant and thoughtless after she had thus rejected hundreds who liked her and sighed for hundreds who despised her she found herself insensibly deserted at present she is company only for her aunts and cousins and sometimes makes one in a countrydance with only one of the chairs for a partner casts off round a jointstool and sets to a corner cupboard in a word she is treated with civil contempt from every quarter and placed like a piece of old fashioned lumber merely to fill up a corner  but sophronia the sagacious sophronia how shall i mention her she was taught to love greek and hate the men from her very infancy she has rejected fine gentlemen because they were not pedants and pedants because they were not fine gentlemen her exquisite sensibility has taught her to discover every fault in every lover and her inflexible justice has prevented her pardoning them thus she rejected several offers till the wrinkles of age had overtaken her and now without one good feature in her face she talks incessantly of the beauties of the mind  farewell letter xxviii from the same were we to estimate the learning of the english by the number of books that are every day published among them perhaps no country not even china itself could equal them in this particular i have reckoned not less than twentythree new books published in one day which upon computation makes eight thousand three hundred and ninetyfive in one year most of these are not confined to one single science but embrace the whole circle history politics poetry mathematics metaphysics and the philosophy of nature are all comprised in a manual not larger than that in which our children are taught the letters if then we suppose the learned of england to read but an eighth part of the works which daily come from the press and sure none can pretend to learning upon less easy terms at this rate every scholar will read a thousand books in one year from such a calculation you may conjecture what an amazing fund of literature a man must be possessed of who thus reads three new books every day not one of which but contains all the good things that ever were said or written  and yet i know not how it happens but the english are not in reality so learned as would seem from this calculation we meet but few who know all arts and sciences to perfection whether it is that the generality are incapable of such extensive knowledge or that the authors of those books are not adequate instructors in china the emperor himself takes cognizance of all the doctors in the kingdom who profess authorship in england every man may be an author that can write for they have by law a liberty not only of saying what they please but of being also as dull as they please  yesterday i testified my surprise to the man in black where writers could be found in sufficient number to throw off the books i daily saw crowding from the press i at first imagined that their learned seminaries might take this method of instructing the world but to obviate this objection my companion assured me that the doctors of colleges never wrote and that some of them had actually forgot their reading but if you desire continued he to see a collection of authors i fancy i can introduce you this evening to a club which assembles every saturday at seven at the sign of the broom near islington to talk over the business of the last and the entertainment of the week ensuing i accepted his invitation we walked together and entered the house some time before the usual hour for the company assembling  my friend took this opportunity of letting me into the characters of the principal members of the club not even the host excepted who it seems was once an author himself but preferred by a bookseller to this situation as a reward for his former services  the first person said he of our society is doctor nonentity a metaphysician most people think him a profound scholar but as he seldom speaks i cannot be positive in that particular he generally spreads himself before the fire sucks his pipe talks little drinks much and is reckoned very good company i am told he writes indexes to perfection he makes essays on the origin of evil philosophical enquiries upon any subject and draws up an answer to any book upon twentyfour hours warning you may distinguish him from the rest of the company by his long gray wig and the blue handkerchief round his neck  the next to him in merit and esteem is tim syllabub a drole creature he sometimes shines as a star of the first magnitude among the choice spirits of the age he is reckoned equally excellent at a rebus a riddle a baudy song and an hymn for the tabernacle you will know him by his shabby finery his powdered wig dirty shirt and broken silk stockings  after him succeeds mr tibs a very useful hand he writes receipts for the bite of a mad dog and throws off an eastern tale to perfection he understands the business of an author as well as any man for no bookseller alive can cheat him you may distinguish him by the peculiar clumsiness of his figure and the coarseness of his coat however though it be coarse as he frequently tells the company he has paid for it  lawyer squint is the politician of the society he makes speeches for parliament writes addresses to his fellow subjects and letters to noble commanders he gives the history of every new play and finds seasonable thoughts upon every occasion  my companion was proceeding in his description when the host came running in with terror on his countenance to tell us that the door was beset with bailiffs if that be the case then says my companion we had as good be going for i am positive we shall not see one of the company this night wherefore disappointed we were both obliged to return home he to enjoy the oddities which compose his character alone and i to write as usual to my friend the occurrences of the day  adieu letter xxix from the same by my last advices from moscow i find the caravan has not yet departed for china i still continue to write expecting that you may receive a large number of my letters at once in them you will find rather a minute detail of english peculiarities than a general picture of their manners or disposition happy it were for mankind if all travelers would thus instead of characterising a people in general terms lead us into a detail of those minute circumstances which first influenced their opinion the genius of a country should be investigated with a kind of experimental enquiry by this means we should have more precise and just notions of foreign nations and detect travelers themselves when they happened to form wrong conclusions  my friend and i repeated our visit to the club of authors where upon our entrance we found the members all assembled and engaged in a loud debate  the poet in shabby finery holding a manuscript in his hand was earnestly endeavoring to persuade the company to hear him read the first book of an heroic poem which he had composed the day before but against this all the members very warmly objected they knew no reason why any member of the club should be indulged with a particular hearing when many of them had published whole volumes which had never been looked in they insisted that the law should be observed where reading in company was expressly noticed it was in vain that the plaintiff pleaded the peculiar merit of his piece he spoke to an assembly insensible to all his remonstrances the book of laws was opened and read by the secretary where it was expressly enacted that whatsoever poet speechmaker citic or historian should presume to engage the company by reading his own works he was to lay down sixpence previous to opening the manuscript and should be charged one shilling an hour while he continued reading the said shilling to be equally distributed among the company as a recompense for their trouble  our poet seemed at first to shrink at the penalty hesitating for some time whether he should deposit the fine or shut up the poem but looking round and perceiving two strangers in the room his love of fame outweighed his prudence and laying down the sum by law established he insisted on his prerogative  a profound silence ensuing he began by explaining his design gentlemen says he the present piece is not one of your common epic poems which come from the press like paper kites in summer there are none of your turnuses or didos in it it is an heroical description of nature i only beg you will endeavor to make your souls in unison with mine and hear with the same enthusiasm with which i have written the poem begins with the description of an authors bedchamber the picture was sketched in my own apartment for you must know gentlemen that i am myself the hero then putting himself into the attitude of an orator with all the emphasis of voice and action he proceeded   where the red lion flaring over the way invites each passing stranger that can pay where calverts butt and parsons black champaign regale the drabs and bloods of drury lane there in a lonely room from bailiffs snug the muse found scroggen stretched beneath a rug a window patched with paper lent a ray that dimly showed the state in which he lay the sanded floor that grits beneath the tread the humid wall with paltry pictures spread the royal game of goose was there in view and the twelve rules the royal martyr drew the seasons framed with listing found a place and brave prince william showed his lampblack face the morn was cold he views with keen desire the rusty grate unconscious of a fire with beer and milk arrears the freize was scord and five cracked teacups dressed the chimney board a nightcap decked his brows instead of bay a cap by night  a stocking all the day with this last line he seemed so much elated that he was unable to proceed there gentlemen cries he there is a description for you rabelaiss bedchamber is but a fool to it a cap by night  a stocking all the day there is sound and sense and truth and nature in the trifling compass of ten little syllables  he was too much employed in selfadmiration to observe the company who by nods winks shrugs and stifled laughter testified every mark of contempt he turned severally to each for their opinion and found all however ready to applaud one swore it was inimitable another said it was damned fine and a third cried out in rapture carissimo at last addressing himself to the president and pray mr squint says he let us have your opinion mine answered the president taking the manuscript out of the authors hands may this glass suffocate me but i think it equal to any thing i have seen and i fancy continued he doubling up the poem and forcing it into the authors pocket that you will get great honor when it comes out so i shall beg leave to put it in we will not intrude upon your goodnature in desiring to hear more of it at present ex ungue herculem we are satisfied perfectly satisfied the author made two or three attempts to pull it out a second time and the president made as many to prevent him thus though with reluctance he was at last obliged to sit down contented with the commendations for which he had paid  when this tempest of poetry and praise was blown over one of the company changed the subject by wondering how any man could be so dull as to write poetry at present since prose itself would hardly pay would you think it gentlemen continued he i have actually written last week sixteen prayers twelve bawdy jests and three sermons all at the rate of sixpence apiece and what is still more extraordinary the bookseller has lost by the bargain such sermons would once have gained me a prebends stall but now alas we have neither piety taste nor humor among us positively if this season does not turn out better than it has begun unless the ministry commit some blunders to furnish us with a new topic of abuse i shall resume my old business of working at the press instead of finding it employment  the whole club seemed to join in condemning the season as one of the worst that had come for some time a gentleman particularly observed that the nobility were never known to subscribe worse than at present i know not how it happens said he though i follow them up as close as possible yet i can hardly get a single subscription in a week the houses of the great are as inaccessible as a frontier garrison at midnight i never see a noblemans door half opened that some surly porter or footman does not stand full in the breach i was yesterday to wait with a subscription proposal upon my lord squash the creolian i had posted myself at his door the whole morning and just as he was getting into his coach thrust my proposal snugg into his hand folded up in the form of a letter from myself he just glanced  the superscription and not knowing the hand consigned it to his valet de chamber this respectable personage treated it as his master and put it into the hands of the porter the porter grasped my proposal frowning and measuring my figure from top to toe put it back into my own hands unopened  to the devil i pitch all the nobility cries a little man in a peculiar accent i am sure they have of late used me most scurvily you must know gentlemen some time ago upon the arrival of a certain noble duke from his travels i set myself down and vamped up a fine flaunting poetical panegyric which i had written in such a strain that i fancied it would have even wheedled milk from a mouse in this i represented the whole kingdom welcoming his grace to his native soil not forgetting the loss france and italy would sustain in their arts by his departure i expected to touch for a bank bill at least so folding up my verses in gilt paper i gave my last half crown to a genteel servant to be the bearer my letter was safely conveyed to his grace and the servant after four hours absence during which time i led the life of a fiend returned with a letter four times as big as mine guess my ecstasy at the prospect of so fine a return i eagerly took the packet into my hands that trembled to receive it i kept it some time unopened before me brooding over the expected treasure it contained when opening it as i hope to be saved gentlemen his grace had sent me in payment for my poem no bank bills but six copies of verse each longer than mine addressed to him upon the same occasion  a nobleman cries a member who had hitherto been silent is created as much for the confusion of us authors as the catchpole i will tell you a story gentlemen which is as true as that this pipe is made of clay when i was delivered of my first book i owed my tailor for a suit of clothes but that is nothing new you know and may be any mans case as well as mine well owing him for a suit of clothes and hearing that my book took very well he sent for his money and insisted upon being paid immediately though i was at that time rich in fame for my book run like wild fire yet i was very short in money and being unable to satisfy his demand prudently resolved to keep my chamber preferring a p ison of my own choosing at home to one of my taylors choosing abroad in vain the bailiffs used all their arts to decoy me from my citadel in vain they sent to let me know that a gentleman wanted to speak with me at the next tavern in vain they came with an urgent message from my aunt in the country in vain i was told that a particular friend was at the point of death and desired to take his last farewell i was deaf insensible rock adamant the bailiffs could make no impression on my hard heart for i effectually kept my liberty by never stirring out of the room  this was very well for a fortnight when one morning i received a most splendid message from the earl of doomsday importing that he had read my book and was in raptures with every line of it he impatiently longed to see the author and had some designs which might turn out greatly to my advantage i paused upon the contents of this message and found there could be no deceit for the card was gilt at the edges and the bearer i was told had quite the looks of a gentleman witness ye powers how my heart triumphed at my own importance i saw a long perspective of felicity before me i applauded the taste of the times which never saw genius forsaken i had prepared a set introductory speech for the occasion five glaring compliments for his lordship and two more modest for myself the next morning therefore in order to be punctual to my appointment i took coach and ordered the fellow to drive to the street and house mentioned in his lordships address i had the precaution to pull up the windows as i went along to keep off the busy part of mankind and big with expectation fancied the coach never went fast enough at length however the wished for moment of its stopping arrived this for some time i impatiently expected and letting down the door in a transport in order to take a previous view of his lordships magnificent palace and situation i found  poison to my sight i found myself not in an elegant street but a paltry lane not at a noblemans door but the door of a spunginghouse i found the coachman had all this while been driving me to jail and i saw the bailiff with a devils face coming out to secure me  to a philosopher no circumstance however trifling is too minute he finds instruction and entertainment in occurrences which are passed over by the rest of mankind as low trite and indifferent it is from the number of these particulars which to many appear insignificant that he is at last enabled to form general conclusions this therefore must be my excuse for sending so far as china accounts of manners and follies which though minute in their own nature serve more truly to characterise this people than histories of their public treaties courts ministers negotiations and ambassadors  adieu letter xxx from the same the english have not yet brought the art of gardening to the same perfection with the chinese but have lately begun to imitate them nature is now followed with greater assiduity than formerly the trees are suffered to shoot out into the utmost luxuriance the streams no longer forced from their native beds are permitted to wind along the valleys spontaneous flowers take place of the finished parterre and the enamelled meadow of the shaven green  yet still the english are far behind us in this charming art their designers have not yet attained a power of uniting instruction with beauty an european will scarcely conceive my meaning when i say that there is scarce a garden in china which does not contain some fine moral couched under the general design where one is not taught wisdom as he walks and feels the force of some noble truth or delicate precept resulting from the disposition of the groves streams or grottos permit me to illustrate what i mean by a description of my gardens at quamsi my heart still hovers round those scenes of former happiness with pleasure and i find satisfaction in enjoying them at this distance though but in imagination  you descended from the house between two groves of trees planted in such a manner that they were impenetrable to the eye while on each hand the way was adorned with all that was beautiful in porcelaine statuary and painting this passage from the house opened into an area surrounded with rocks flowers trees and shrubs but all so disposed as if each was the spontaneous production of nature as you proceeded forward on this lawn to your right and left hand were two gates opposite each other of very different architecture and design and before you lay a temple built rather with minute elegance than ostentation  the right hand gate was planned with the utmost simplicity or rather rudeness ivy clasped round the pillars the baleful cypress hung over it time seemed to have destroyed all the smoothness and regularity of the stone two champions with lifted clubs appeared in the act of guarding its access dragons and serpents were seen in the most hideous attitudes to deter the spectator from approaching and the perspective view that lay behind seemed dark and gloomy to the last degree the stranger was tempted to enter only from the motto pervia virtuti  the opposite gate was formed in a very different manner the architecture was light elegant and inviting flowers hung in wreaths round the pillars all was finished in the most exact and masterly manner the very stone of which it was built still preserved its polish nymphs wrought by the hand of a master in the most alluring attitudes beckoned the stranger to approach while all that lay behind as far as the eye could reach seemed gay luxuriant and capable of affording endless pleasure the motto itself contributed to invite him for over the gate was written these words facilis descensus  by this time i fancy you begin to perceive that the gloomy gate was designed to represent the road to virtue the opposite the more agreeable passage to vice it is but natural to suppose that the spectator was always tempted to enter by the gate which offered him so many allurements i always in these cases left him to his choice but generally found that he took to the left which promised most entertainment  immediately upon his entering the gate of vice the trees and flowers were disposed in such a manner as to make the most pleasing impression but as he walked farther on he insensibly found the garden assume the air of a wilderness the landskips began to darken the paths grew more intricate he appeared to go downwards frightful rocks seemed to hang over his head gloomy caverns unexpected precipices awful ruins heaps of unburied bones and terrifying sounds caused by unseen waters began to take place of what at first appeared so lovely it was in vain to attempt returning the labyrinth was too much perplexed for any but myself to find the way back in short when sufficiently impressed with the horrors of what he saw and the imprudence of his choice i brought him by an hidden door a shorter way back into the area from whence at first he had strayed  the gloomy gate now presented itself before the stranger and though there seemed little in its appearance to tempt his curiosity yet encouraged by the motto he generally proceeded the darkness of the entrance the frightful figures that seemed to obstruct his way the trees of a mournful green conspired at first to disgust him as he went forward however all began to open and wear a more pleasing appearance beautiful cascades beds of flowers trees loaded with fruit or blossoms and unexpected brooks improved the scene he now found that he was ascending and as he proceeded all nature grew more beautiful the prospect widened as he went higher even the air itself seemed to become more pure thus pleased and happy from unexpected beauties i at last led him to an arbor from whence he could view the garden and the whole country around and where he might own that the road to virtue terminated in happiness  though from this description you may imagine that a vast tract of ground was necessary to exhibit such a pleasing variety in yet be assured that i have seen several gardens in england take up ten times the space which mine did without half the beauty a very small extent of ground is enough for an elegant taste the greater room is required if magnificence is in view there is no spot though ever so little which a skilful designer might not thus improve so as to convey a delicate allegory and impress the mind with truths the most useful and necessary  adieu letter xxxi from the same in a late excursion with my friend into the country a gentleman with a blue ribbon tied round his shoulder and in a chariot drawn by six horses passed swiftly by us attended with a numerous train of captains lacquies and coaches filled with women when we were recovered from the dust raised by his cavalcade and could continue our discourse without danger of suffocation i observed to my companion that all this state and equipage which he seemed to despise would in china be regarded with the utmost reverence because such distinctions were always the reward of merit the greatness of a mandarines retinue being a most certain mark of the superiority of his abilities or virtue  the gentleman who has now passed us replied my companion has no claims from his own merit to distinction he is possessed neither of abilities nor virtue it is enough for him that one of his ancestors was possessed of these qualities two hundred years before him there was a time indeed when his family deserved their titles but they are long since degenerated and his ancestors for more than a century have been more and more solicitous to keep up the breed of their dogs and horses than that of their children this very nobleman simple as he seems is descended from a race of statesmen and heroes but unluckily his great grandfather marrying a cook maid and she having a trifling passion for his lordships groom they somehow crossed the strain and produced an heir who took after his mother in his great love to good eating and his father in a violent affection for horse flesh these passions have for some generations passed on from father to son and are now become the characteristics of the family his present lordship being equally remarkable for his kitchen and stable  but such a nobleman cried i deserves our pity thus placed in so high a sphere of life which only the more exposes to contempt a king may confer titles but it is personal merit alone that insures respect i suppose added i that such men who are so very unfit to fill up their dignity are despised by their equals neglected by their inferiors and condemned to live among involuntary dependants in irksome solitude  you are still under a mistake replied my companion for though this nobleman is a stranger to generosity though he takes twenty opportunities in a day of letting his guests know how much he despises them though he is possessed neither of taste wit nor wisdom though incapable of improving others by his conversation and never known to enrich any by his bounty yet for all this his company is eagerly sought after he is a lord and that is as much as most people desire in a companion quality and title have such allurements that hundreds are ready to give up all their own importance to cringe to flatter to look little and to pall every pleasure in constraint merely to be among the great though without the least hopes of improving their understanding or sharing their generosity they might be happy among th equals but those are despised for company where they are despised in turn you saw what a crowd of humble cousins cardruined beaus and captains on half pay were willing to make up this great mans retinue down to his country seat not one of all these that could not lead a more comfortable life at home in their little lodging of three shillings a week with their lukewarm dinner served up between two pewter plates from a cooks shop yet poor devils they are willing to undergo the impertinence and pride of their entertainer merely to be thought to live among the great they are willing to pass the summer in bondage though conscious they are taken down only to approve his lordships taste upon every occasion to tag all his stupid observations with a very true to praise his stable and descant upon his claret and cookery  the pitiful humiliations of the gentlemen you are now describing said i puts me in mind of a custom among the tartars of koreki not entirely dissimilar to this we are now considering van stralenberg a writer of credit gives the same account of this people vid an historico geographical description of the north eastern parts of europe and asia p      the russians who trade with them carry thither a kind of mushrooms which they exchange for furrs of squirrels ermins sables and foxes these mushrooms the rich tartars lay up in large quantities for the winter and when a nobleman makes a mushroom feast all the neighbors around are invited the mushrooms are prepared by boiling by which the water acquires an intoxicating quality and is a sort of drink which the tartars prize beyond all other when the nobility and ladies are assembled and the ceremonies usual between people of distinction over the mushroom broth goes freely round they laugh talk double entendre grow fuddled and become excellent company the poorer sort who love mushroom broth to distraction as well as the rich but cannot afford it at the first hand post themselves on these occasions round the huts of the rich and watch the opportunities of the ladies and gentlemen as they come down to pass their liquor and holding a wooden bowl catch the delicious fluid very little altered by filtration being still strongly tinctured with the intoxicating quality of this they drink with the utmost satisfaction and thus they get as drunk and as jovial as their betters  happy nobility cries my companion who can fear no diminution of respect unless by being seized with a strangury and who when most drunk are most useful though we have not this custom among us i foresee that if it were introduced we might have many a toadeater in england ready to drink from the wooden bowl on these occasions and to praise the flavor of his lordships liquor as we have different classes of gentry who knows but we might see a lord holding the bowl to a minister a knight holding it to his lordship and a simple squire drinking it doubled distilled from the loins of knighthood for my part i shall never for the future hear a great mans flatterers haranguing in his praise that i shall not fancy i behold the wooden bowl for i can see no reason why a man who can live easily and happily at home should bear the drudgery of decorum and the impertinence of his entertainer unless intoxicated with a passion for all that was quality unless he thought that whatever came from the great was delicious and had the tincture of the mushroom in it  adieu letter xxxii from the same i am disgusted o fum hoam even to sickness disgusted is it possible to bear the presumption of those islanders when they pretend to instruct me in the ceremonies of china they lay it down as a maxim that every person who comes from thence must express himself in metaphor swear by alla rail against wine and behave and talk and write like a turk or persian they make no distinction between our elegant manners and the voluptuous barbarities of our eastern neighbors wherever i come i raise either diffidence or astonishment some fancy me no chinese because i am formed more like a man than a monster and others wonder to find one born five thousand miles from england endued with common sense strange say they that a man who has received his education at such a distance from london should have common sense to be born out of england and yet have common sense impossible he must be some englishman in disguise his very visage has nothing of the true exotic barbarity  i yesterday received an invitation from a lady of distinction who it seems had collected all her knowledge of eastern manners from fictions every day propagated here under the titles of eastern tales and oriental histories she received me very politely but seemed to wonder that i neglected bringing opium and a tobaccobox when chairs were drawn for the rest of the company i was assigned my place on a cushion on the floor it was in vain that i protested the chinese used chairs as in europe she understood decorums too well to entertain me with the ordinary civilities  i had scarce been seated according to her directions when the footman was ordered to pin a napkin under my chin this i protested against as being no way chinese however the whole company who it seems were a club of connoisseurs gave it unanimously against me and the napkin was pinned accordingly  it was impossible to be angry with people who seemed to err only from an excess of politeness and i sat contented expecting their importunities were now at an end but as soon as ever dinner was served the lady demanded whether i was for a plate of bears claws or a slice of birds nests as these were dishes with which i was utterly unacquainted i was desirous of eating only what i knew and therefore begged to be helped from a piece of beef that lay on the side table my request at once disconcerted the whole company a chinese eat beef that could never be there was no local propriety in chinese beef whatever there might be in chinese pheasant sir said my entertainer i think i have some reasons to fancy myself a judge of these matters in short the chinese never eat beef so that i must be permitted to recommend the pilaw there was never better dressed at pekin the saffron and rice are well boiled and the spices in perfection  i had no sooner begun to eat what was laid before me than i found the whole company as much astonished as before it seems i made no use of my chopsticks a grave gentleman whom i take to be an author harangued very learnedly as the company seemed to think upon the use which was made of them in china he entered into a long argument with himself about their first introduction without once appealing to me who might be supposed best capable of silencing the enquiry as the gentleman therefore took my silence for a mark of his own superior sagacity he was resolved to pursue the triumph he talked of our cities mountains and animals as familiarly as if he had been born in quamsi but as erroneously as if a native of the moon he attempted to prove that i had nothing of the true chinese cut in my visage showed that my cheek bones should have been higher and my forehead broader in short he almost reasoned me out of my country and effectually persuaded the rest of the company to be of his opinion  i was going to expose his mistakes when it was insisted that i had nothing of the true eastern manner in my delivery this gentlemans conversation says one of the ladies who was a great reader is like our own mere chit chat and common sense there is nothing like sense in the true eastern style where nothing more is required but sublimity oh for an history of aboulfaouris the grand voyager of genii magicians rocks bags of bullets giants and enchanters where all is great obscure magnificent and unintelligible i have written many a sheet of eastern tale myself interrupts the author and i defy the severest critic to say but that i have stuck close to the true manner i have compared a ladys chin to the snow upon the mountains of bomek a soldiers sword to the clouds that obscure the face of heaven if riches are mentioned i compare them to the flocks that graze the verdant tefflis if poverty to the mists that veil the brow of mount baku i have used thee and thou upon all occasions i have described fallen stars and splitting mountains not forgetting the little houries who make a very pretty figure in every description but you shall hear how i generally begin ebenbenbolo who was the son of ban was born on the foggy summits of benderabassi his beard was whiter than the feathers which veil the breast of the penguin his eyes were like the eyes of doves when washed by the dews of the morning his hair which hung like the willow weeping over the glassy stream was so beautiful that it seemed to reflect its own brightness and his feet were as the feet of a wild deer which flees to the tops of the mountains there there is the true eastern taste for you every advance made toward sense is only a deviation from sound eastern tales should always be sonorous lofty musical and unmeaning  i could not avoid smiling to hear a native of england attempt to instruct me in the true eastern idiom and after he had looked round some time for applause i presumed to ask him whether he had ever traveled into the east to which he replied in the negative i demanded whether he understood chinese or arabic to which also he answered as before then how sir said i can you pretend to determine upon the eastern style who are entirely unacquainted with the eastern writings take sir the word of one who is professedly a chinese and who is actually acquainted with the arabian writers that what is palmd upon you daily for an imitation of eastern writing no ways resembles their manner either in sentiment or diction in the east similes are seldom used and metaphors almost wholly unknown but in china particularly the very reverse of what you allude to takes place a cool phlegmatic method of writing prevails there the writers of that country ever more assiduous to instruct than to please address rather the judgment than the fancy unlike many authors of europe who have no consideration of the readers time they generally leave more to be understood than they express  besides sir you must not expect from an inhabitant of china the same ignorance the same unlettered simplicity that you find in a turk persian or native of peru the chinese are versed in the sciences as well as you and are masters of several arts unknown to the people of europe many of them are instructed not only in their own national learning but are perfectly well acquainted with the languages and learning of the west if my word in such a case is not to be taken consult your own travelers on this head who affirm that the scholars of pekin and siam sustain theological theses in latin the college of masprend which is but a league from siam says one of your travelers journal ou suite du voyage de siam en form de lettres familieres fait en      and      par m l d c page     edit amstelod      came in a body to salute our ambassador nothing gave me more sincere pleasure than to behold a number of priests venerable both from age and modesty followed by a number of youths of all nations chinese japonese tonquinese of cochin china pegu and siam all willing to pay their respects in the most polite manner imaginable a cochin chinese made an excellent latin oration upon this occasion he was succeeded and even outdone by a student of tonquin who was as well skilled in the western learning as any scholar of paris now sir if youths who never stirred from home are so perfectly skilled in your laws and learning surely more must be expected from one like me who have traveled so many thousand miles who have conversed familiarly for several years with the english factors established at canton and the missionaries sent us from every part of europe the unaffected of every country nearly resemble each other and a page of our confucius and your tillotson have scarce any material difference paltry affectation strained allusions and disgusting finery are easily attained by those who choose to wear them they are but too frequently the badges of ignorance or of stupidity whenever it would endeavor to please  i was proceeding in my discourse when looking round i perceived the company no way attentive to what i attempted with so much earnestness to enforce one lady was whispering her that sat next another was studying the merits of a fan a third began to yawn and the author himself fell fast asleep i thought it therefore high time to make a retreat nor did the company seem to show any regret at my preparations for departure even the lady who had invited me with the most mortifying insensibility saw me seize my hat and rise from my cushion nor was i invited to repeat my visit because it was found that i aimed at appearing rather a reasonable creature than an outlandish idiot  adieu letter xxxiii to the same the polite arts are in this country subject to as many revolutions as its laws or politics not only the objects of fancy and dress but even of delicacy and taste are directed by the capricious influence of fashion i am told there has been a time when poetry was universally encouraged by the great when men of the first rank not only patronized the poet but produced the finest models for his imitation it was then that the english sent forth those glowing rhapsodies which we have so often read over together with rapture poems big with all the sublimity of mentius and supported by reasoning as strong as that of zimpo  the nobility are ever fond of wisdom but they also are fond of having it without study to read poetry required thought and the english nobility were not fond of thinking they soon therefore placed their affections upon music because in this they might indulge an happy vacancy and yet still have pretensions to delicacy and taste as before they soon brought their numerous dependents into an approbation of their pleasures who in turn led their thousand imitators to feel or feign a similitude of passion colonies of singers were now imported from abroad at a vast expense and it was expected the english would soon be able to set examples to europe all these expectations however were soon dissipated in spite of the zeal which fired the great the ignorant vulgar refused to be taught to sing and refused to undergo the ceremonies which were to initiate them in the singing fraternity thus the colony from abroad dwindled by degrees for they were of themselves unfortunately incapable of propagating the breed  music having thus lost its splendor painting is now become the sole object of fashionable care the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable society a well timed shrug an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favor even some of the young nobility are themselves early instructed in handling the pencil while their happy parents big with expectation foresee the walls of every apartment covered with the manufactures of their posterity  but many of the english are not content with giving all their time to this art at home some young men of distinction are found to travel through europe with no other intent than that of understanding and collecting pictures studying seals and describing statues on they travel from this cabinet of curiosities to that gallery of pictures waste the prime of life in wonder skilful in pictures ignorant in men yet impossible to be reclaimed because their follies take shelter under the names of delicacy and taste  it is true painting should have due encouragement as the painter can undoubtedly fit up our apartments in a much more elegant manner than the upholsterer but i should think a man of fashion makes but an indifferent exchange who lays out all that time in furnishing his house which he should have employed in the furniture of his head a person who shows no other symptoms of taste than his cabinet or gallery might as well boast to me of the furniture of his kitchen  i know no other motive but vanity that induces the great to testify such an inordinate passion for pictures after the piece is bought and gazed at eight or ten days successively the purchasers pleasure must surely be over all the satisfaction he can then have is to show it to others he may be considered as the guardian of a treasure of which he makes no manner of use his gallery is furnished not for himself but the connoisseur who is generally some humble flatterer ready to feign a rapture he does not feel and as necessary to the happiness of a picturebuyer as gazers are to the magnificence of an asiatic procession  i have enclosed a letter from a youth of distinction on his travels to his father in england in which he appears addicted to no vice seems obedient to his governor of a good natural disposition and fond of improvement but at the same time early taught to regard cabinets and galleries as the only proper schools of improvement and to consider a skill in pictures as the properest knowledge for a man of quality  my lord we have been but two days at antwerp wherefore i have sat down as soon as possible to give you some account of what we have seen since our arrival desirous of letting no opportunity pass without writing to so good a father immediately upon alighting from our rotterdam machine my governor who is immoderately fond of paintings and at the same time an excellent judge would let no time pass till we paid our respects to the church of the virgin mother which contains treasure beyond estimation we took an infinity of pains in knowing its exact dimensions and differed half a foot in our calculation so i leave that to some succeeding information i really believe my governor and i could have lived and died there there is scarce a pillar in the whole church that is not adorned by a reubens a vander meuylen a vandyke or a woverman what attitudes carnation and draperies i am almost induced to pity the english who have none of those exquisite pieces among them as we were willing to let slip no opportunity of doing business we immediately after went to wait on mr hogendorp whom you have so frequently commended for his judicious collection his cameos are indeed beyond price his intaglios not so good he showed us one of an officiating flamen which he thought to be an antique but my governor who is not to be deceived in these particulars soon found it to be an arrant cinque cento i could not however sufficiently admire the genius of mr hogendorp who has been able to collect from all parts of the world a thousand things which no body knows the use of except your lordship and my governor i do not know any body i admire so much he is indeed a surprising genius the next morning early as we were resolved to take the whole day before us we sent our compliments to mr van sporkcken desiring to see his gallery which request he very politely complied with his gallery measures fifty feet by twenty and is well filled but what surprised me most of all was to see an holy family just like your lordships which this ingenious gentleman assures me is the true original i own this gave me inexpressible uneasiness and i fear it will to your lordship as i had flattered myself that the only original was in your lordships possession i would advise you however to take yours down till its merit can be ascertained my governor assuring me that he intends to write a long differtation to prove its originality one might study in this city for ages and still find something new we went from this to view the cardinals statues which are really very fine there were three spintria executed in a very masterly manner all arm in arm the torse which i heard you talk so much of is at last discovered to be a hercules spinning and not a cleopatra bathing as your lordship had conjectured there has been a treatise written to prove it  my lord firmly is certainly a goth a vandal no taste in the world for painting i wonder how any call him a man of taste passing through the streets of antwerp a few days ago and observing the nakedness of the inhabitants he was so barbarous as to observe that he thought the best method the flemings could take was to sell their pictures and buy clothes ah coglione we shall go tomorrow to carwardens cabinet and the next day we shall see the curiosities collected by van ran and the day after we shall pay a visit to mount calvary and after that  but i find my paper finished so with the most sincere wishes to your lordships happiness and with hopes after having seen italy that center of pleasure to return home worthy the care and expense which has been generously laid out in my improvement  i remain my lord yours etc   letter xxxiv from hingpo a slave in persia to altangi a traveling philosopher of china by the way of moscow fortune has made me the slave of another but nature and inclination render me entirely subservient to you a tyrant commands my body but you are master of my heart and yet let not thy inflexible nature condemn me when i confess that i find my soul shrink with my circumstances i feel my mind not less than my body bend beneath the rigours of servitude the master whom i serve grows every day more formidable in spite of reason which should teach me to despise him his hideous image fills even my dreams with horror  a few days ago a christian slave who wrought in the gardens happening to enter an arbor where the tyrant was entertaining the ladies of his haram with coffee the unhappy captive was instantly stabbed to the heart for his intrusion i have been preferred to his place which though less laborious than my former station is yet more ungrateful as it brings me nearer him whose presence excites sensations at once of disgust and apprehension  into what a state of misery are the modern persians fallen a nation once famous for setting the world an example of freedom is now become a land of tyrants and a den of slaves the houseless tartar of kamkatsha who enjoys his herbs and his fish in unmolested freedom may be envied if compared to the thousands who pine here in hopeless servitude and curse the day that gave them being is this just dealing heaven to render millions wretched to swell up the happiness of a few cannot the powerful of this earth be happy without our sighs and tears must every luxury of the great be woven from the calamities of the poor it must it must surely be that this jarring discordant life is but the prelude to some future harmony the souls attuned to virtue here shall go from hence to fill up the universal choir where tien presides in person where there shall be no tyrants to frown no shackles to bind nor no whips to threaten where i shall once more meet my father with rapture and give a loose to filial piety where i shall hang on his neck and hear the wisdom of his lips and thank him for all the happiness to which he has introduced me  the wretch whom fortune has made my master has lately purchased several slaves of both sexes among the rest i hear a christian captive talked of with admiration the eunuch who bought her and who is accustomed to survey beauty with indifference speaks of her with emotion her pride however astonishes her attendant slaves not less than her beauty it is reported that she refuses the warmest solicitations of her haughty lord he has even offered to make her one of his four wives upon changing her religion and conforming to his it is probable she cannot refuse such extraordinary offers and her delay is perhaps intended to enhance her favors  i have just now seen her she inadvertently approached the place without a veil where i sat waiting she seemed to regard the heavens alone with fixed attention there her most ardent gaze was directed genius of the sun what unexpected softness what animated grace her beauty seemed the transparent covering of virtue celestial beings could not wear a look of more perfection while sorrow humanized her form and mixed my admiration with pity i rose from the bank on which i sat and she retired happy that none observed us for such an interview might have been fatal  i have regarded till now the opulence and the power of my tyrant without envy i saw him with a mind incapable of enjoying the gifts of fortune and consequently regarded him as one loaded rather than enriched with its favors but at present when i think that so much beauty is reserved only for him that so many charms shall be lavished on a wretch incapable of feeling the greatness of the blessing i own i feel a reluctance to which i have hitherto been a stranger  but let not my father impute these uneasy sensations to so trifling a cause as love no never let it be thought that your son and the pupil of the wise fum hoam could stoop to so degrading a passion i am only displeased at seeing so much excellence so unjustly disposed of  the uneasiness which i feel is not for myself but for the beautiful christian when i reflect on the barbarity of him for whom she is designed i pity indeed i pity her when i think that she must only share one heart who deserves to command a thousand excuse me if i feel an emotion which universal benevolence extorts from me as i am convinced that you take a pleasure in those sallies of humanity and are particularly pleased with compassion i could not avoid discovering the sensibility with which i felt this beautiful strangers distress i have for a while forgot in hers the miseries of my own hopeless situation our tyrant grows every day more severe and love which softens all other minds into tenderness seems only to have increased his severity  adieu letter xxxv from the same the whole haram is filled with a tumultuous joy zelis the beautiful captive has consented to embrace the religion of mahomet and become one of the wives of the fastidious persian it is impossible to describe the transport that sits on every face on this occasion music and feasting fill every apartment the most miserable slave seems to forget his chains and sympathizes with the happiness of mostadad the herb we tread beneath our feet is not made more for our use than every slave around him for their imperious master mere machines of obedience they wait with silent assiduity feel his pains and rejoice in his exultation heavens how much is requisite to make one man happy  twelve of the most beautiful slaves and i among the number have got orders to prepare for carrying him in triumph to the bridal apartment the blaze of perfumed torches are to imitate the day the dancers and singers are hired at a vast expense the nuptials are to be celebrated on the approaching feast of barboura when an hundred taels in gold are to be distributed among the barren wives in order to pray for fertility from the approaching union  what will not riches procure an hundred domestics who curse the tyrant in their souls are commanded to wear a face of joy and they are joyful an hundred flatterers are ordered to attend and they fill his ears with praise beauty all commanding beauty sues for admittance and scarcely receives an answer even love itself seems to wait upon fortune or though the passion be only feigned yet it wears every appearance of sincerity and what greater pleasure can even true sincerity confer or what would the rich have more  nothing can exceed the intended magnificence of the bridegroom but the costly dresses of the bride six eunuchs in the most sumptuous habits are to conduct him to the nuptial couch and wait his orders six ladies in all the magnificence of persia are directed to undress the bride their business is to assist to encourage her to divest her of every encumbering part of her dress all but the last covering which by an artful complication of ribbons is purposely made difficult to unloose and with which she is to part reluctantly even to the joyful possessor of her beauty  mostadad o my father is no philosopher and yet he seems perfectly contented with his ignorance possessed of numberless slaves camels and women he desires no greater possession he never opened the page of mentius and yet all the slaves tell me that he is happy  forgive the weakness of my nature if i sometimes feel my heart rebellious to the dictates of wisdom and eager for happiness like his yet why wish for his wealth with his ignorance to be like him incapable of sentimental pleasures incapable of feeling the happiness of making others happy incapable of teaching the beautiful zelis philosophy  what shall i in a transport of passion give up the golden mean the universal harmony the unchanging essence for the possession of an hundred camels as many slaves thirtyfive beautiful horses and seventythree fine women first blast me to the center degrade me beneath the most degraded pare my nails ye powers of heaven ere i would stoop to such an exchange what part with philosophy which teaches me to suppress my passions instead of gratifying them which teaches me even to divest my soul of passion which teaches serenity in the midst of tortures philosophy by which even now i am so very serene and so very much at ease to be persuaded to part with it for any other enjoyment never never even though persuasion spoke in the accents of zelis  a female slave informs me that the bride is to be arrayed in a tissue of silver and her hair adorned with the largest pearls of ormus but why teize you with particulars in which we both are so little concerned the pain i feel in separation throws a gloom over my mind which in this scene of universal joy i fear may be attributed to some other cause how wretched are those who are like me denied even the last resource of misery their tears  adieu letter xxxvi from the same i begin to have doubts whether wisdom be alone sufficient to make us happy whether every step we make in refinement is not an inlet into new disquietudes a mind too vigorous and active serves only to consume the body to which it is joined as the richest jewels are soonest found to wear their settings  when we rise in knowledge as the prospect widens the objects of our regard become more obscure and the unlettered peasant whose views are only directed to the narrow sphere around him beholds nature with a finer relish and tastes her blessings with a keener appetite than the philosopher whose mind attempts to grasp an universal system  as i was some days ago pursuing this subject among a circle of my fellow slaves an ancient guebre of the number equally remarkable for his piety and wisdom seemed touched with my conversation and desired to illustrate what i had been saying with an allegory taken from the zendavesta of zoroaster by this we shall be taught says he that they who travel in pursuit of wisdom walk only in a circle and after all their labor at last return to their pristine ignorance and in this also we shall see that enthusiastic confidence or unsatisfying doubts terminate all our enquiries  in early times before myriads of nations covered the earth the whole human race lived together in one valley the simple inhabitants surrounded on every side by lofty mountains knew no other world but the little spot to which they were confined they fancied the heavens bent down to meet the mountain tops and formed an impenetrable wall to surround them none had ever yet ventured to climb the steepy cliff in order to explore those regions that lay beyond it they knew the nature of the skies only from a tradition which mentioned their being made of adamant traditions make up the reasonings of the simple and serve to silence every enquiry  in this sequestered vale blessed with all the spontaneous productions of nature the honeyd blossom the refreshing breeze the gliding brook and golden fruitage the simple inhabitants seemed happy in themselves in each other they desired no greater pleasures for they knew of none greater ambition pride and envy were vices unknown among them and from this peculiar simplicity of its possessors the country was called the valley of ignorance  at length however an unhappy youth more aspirring than the rest undertook to climb the mountains side and examine the summits which were hitherto deemed inaccessible the inhabitants from below gazed with wonder at his intrepidity some applauded his courage others censured his folly still however he proceeded toward the place where the earth and heavens seemed to unite and at length arrived at the wished for height with extreme labor and assiduity  his first surprise was to find the skies not as he expected within his reach but still as far off as before his amazement increased when he saw a wide extended region lying on the opposite side of the mountain but it rose to astonishment when he beheld a country at a distance more beautiful and alluring than even that he had just left behind  as he continued to gaze with wonder a genius with a look of infinite modesty approaching offered to be his guide and instructor the distant country which you so much admire says the angelic being is called the land of certainty in that charming retreat sentiment contributes to refine every sensual banquet the inhabitants are blessed with every solid enjoyment and still more blessed in a perfect consciousness of their own felicity ignorance in that country is wholly unknown all there is satisfaction without allay for every pleasure first undergoes the examination of reason as for me i am called the genius of demonstration and am stationed here in order to conduct every adventurer to that land of happiness through those intervening regions you see overhung with fogs and darkness and horrid with forests cataracts caverns and various other shapes of danger but follow me and in time i may lead you to that distant desirable land of tranquillity  the intrepid traveller immediately put himself under the direction of the genius and both journeying on together with a slow but agreeable pace deceived the tediousness of the way by conversation the beginning of the journey seemed to promise true satisfaction but as they proceeded forward the skies became more gloomy and the way more intricate they often inadvertently approached the brow of some frightful precipice or the brink of a torrent and were obliged to measure back their former way the gloom increasing as they proceeded their pace became more slow they paused at every step frequently stumbled and their distrust and timidity increased the genius of demonstration now therefore advised his pupil to grope upon hands and feet as a method though more slow yet less liable to error  in this manner they attempted to pursue their journey for some time when they were overtaken by another genius who with a precipitate pace seemed traveling the same way he was instantly known by the other to be the genius of probability he wore two wide extended wings at his back which incessantly waved without increasing the rapidity of his motion his countenance betrayed a confidence that the ignorant might mistake for sincerity and he had but one eye which was fixed in the middle of his forehead  servant of hormizda cried he approaching the mortal pilgrim if thou art traveling to the land of certainty how is it possible to arrive there under the guidance of a genius who proceeds forward so slowly and is so little acquainted with the way follow me we shall soon perform the journey to where every pleasure awaits our arrival  the peremptory tone in which this genius spoke and the speed with which he moved forward induced the traveller to change his conductor and leaving his modest companion behind he proceeded forward with his more confident director seeming not a little pleased at the increased velocity of his motion  but soon he found reasons to repent whenever a torrent crossed their way his guide taught him to despise the obstacle by plunging him in whenever a precipice presented he was directed to fling himself forward thus each moment miraculously escaping his repeated escapes only served to increase his guides temerity he led him therefore forward amidst infinite difficulties till they arrived at the borders of an ocean which appeared unnavigable from the black mists that lay upon its surface it is unquiet waves were of the darkest hue and gave a lively representation of the various agitations of the human mind  the genius of probability now confessed his temerity owned his being an improper guide to the land of certainty a country where no mortal had ever been permitted to arrive but at the same time offered to supply the traveller with another conductor who should carry him to the land of confidence a region where the inhabitants lived with the utmost tranquillity and tasted almost as much satisfaction as if in the land of certainty not waiting for a reply he stamped three times on the ground and called forth the demon of error a gloomy fiend of the servants of arimanes the yawning earth gave up the reluctant savage who seemed unable to bear the light of the day his stature was enormous his color black and hideous his aspect betrayed a thousand varying passions and he spread forth pinions that were fitted for the most rapid flight the traveller at first was shocked at the spectre but finding him obedient to superior power he assumed his former tranquillity  i have called you to duty cries the genius to the demon to bear on your back a son of mortality over the ocean of doubts into the land of confidence i expect you will perform your commission with punctuality and as for you continued the genius addressing the traveller when once i have bound this fillet round your eyes let no voice of persuasion nor threats the most terrifying persuade you to unbind it in order to look round keep the fillet fast look not at the ocean below and you may certainly expect to arrive at a region of pleasure  thus saying and the travellers eyes being covered the demon muttering curses raised him on his back and instantly upborne by his strong pinions directed his flight among the clouds neither the loudest thunder nor the most angry tempest could persuade the traveller to unbind his eyes the demon directed his flight downwards and skimmed the surface of the ocean a thousand voices some with loud invective others in the sarcastic tones of contempt vainly endeavored to persuade him to look round but he still continued to keep his eyes covered and would in all probability have arrived at the happy land had not flattery effected what other means could not perform for now he heard himself welcomed on every side to the promised land and an universal shout of joy was sent forth at his safe arrival the wearied traveller desirous of seeing the long wishedfor country at length pulled the fillet from his eyes and ventured to look round him but he had unloosed the band too soon he was not yet above half way over the demon who was still hovering in the air and had produced those sounds only in order to deceive was now freed from his commission wherefore throwing the astonished traveller from his back the unhappy youth fell headlong into the subjacent ocean of doubts from whence he never after was seen to rise  letter xxxvii from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial academy at pekin in china when parmenio the grecian had done something which excited an universal shout from the surrounding multitude he was instantly struck with the doubt that what had their approbation must certainly be wrong and turning to a philosopher who stood near him pray sir says he pardon me i fear i have been guilty of some absurdity  you know that i am not less than him a despiser of the multitude you know that i equally detest flattery to the great yet so many circumstances have concurred to give a luster to the latter part of the present english monarchs reign that i cannot withhold my contribution of praise i cannot avoid the acknowledging the crowd for once just in their unanimous approbation  yet think not that battles gained dominion extended or enemies brought to submission are the virtues which at present claim my admiration were the reigning monarch only famous for his victories i should regard his character with indifference the boast of heroism in this enlightened age is justly regarded as a qualification of a very subordinate rank and mankind now begin to look with becoming horror on these foes to man the virtue in this aged monarch which i have at present in view is one of a much more exalted nature is one of the most difficult of attainment is the least praised of all kingly virtues and yet deserves the greatest praise the virtue i mean is justice a strict administration of justice without severity and without favor  of all virtues this is the most difficult to be practiced by a king who has a power to pardon all men even tyrants themselves lean to mercy when unbiassed by passions or interest the heart naturally persuades to forgiveness and pursuing the dictates of this pleasing deceiver we are led to prefer our private satisfaction to public utility what a thorough love for the public what a strong command over the passions what a finely conducted judgment must he possess who opposes the dictates of reason to those of his heart and prefers the future interest of his people to his own immediate satisfaction  if still to a mans own natural biass for tenderness we add the numerous solicitations made by a criminals friends for mercy if we survey a king not only opposing his own feelings but reluctantly refusing those he regards and this to satisfy the public whose cries he may never hear whose gratitude he may never receive this surely is true greatness let us fancy ourselves for a moment in this just old mans place surrounded by numbers all soliciting the same favor a favor that nature disposes us to grant where the inducements to pity are laid before us in the strongest light suppliants at our feet some ready to resent a refusal none opposing a compliance let us i say suppose ourselves in such a situation and i fancy we should find ourselves more apt to act the character of good natured men than of upright magistrates  what contributes to raise justice above all other kingly virtues is that it is seldom attended with a due share of applause and those who practice it must be influenced by greater motives than empty fame the people are generally well pleased with a remission of punishment and all that wears the appearance of humanity it is the wise alone who are capable of discerning that impartial justice is the truest mercy they know it to be difficult very difficult at once to compassionate and yet condemn an object that pleads for tenderness  i have been led into this commonplace train of thought by a late striking instance in this country of the impartiality of justice and of the kings inflexible resolution of inflicting punishment where it was justly due a man of the first quality in a fit either of passion melancholy or madness murdered his servant it was expected that his station in life would have lessened the ignominy of his punishment however he was arraigned condemned and underwent the same degrading death with the meanest malefactor it was well considered that virtue alone is true nobility and that he whose actions sink him even beneath the vulgar has no right to those distinctions which should be the rewards only of merit it was perhaps considered that crimes were more heinous among the higher classes of people as necessity exposes them to fewer temptations  over all the east even china not excepted a person of the same quality guilty of such a crime might by giving up a share of his fortune to the judge buy off his sentence there are several countries even in europe where the servant is entirely the property of his master if a slave kills his lord he dies by the most excruciating tortures but if the circumstances are reversed a small fine buys off the punishment of the offender happy the country where all are equal and where those who sit as judges have too much integrity to receive a bribe and too much honor to pity from a similitude of the prisoners title or circumstances with their own such is england yet think not that it was always equally famed for this strict impartiality there was a time even here when titles softened the rigours of the law when dignified wretches were suffered to live and continue for years an equal disgrace to justice and nobility  to this day in a neighboring country the great are often most scandalously pardoned for the most scandalous offenses a person is still alive among them who has more than once deserved the most ignominious severity of justice his being of the blood royal however was thought a sufficient atonement for his being a disgrace to humanity this remarkable personage took pleasure in shooting at the passengers below from the top of his palace and in this most princely amusement he usually spent some time every day he was at length arraigned by the friends of a person whom in this manner he had killed was found guilty of the charge and condemned to die his merciful monarch pardoned him in consideration of his rank and quality the unrepenting criminal soon after renewed his usual entertainment and in the same manner killed another man he was a second time condemned and strange to think a second time received his majestys pardon would you believe it a third time the very same man was guilty of the very same offense a third time therefore the laws of his country found him guilty  i wish for the honor of humanity i could suppress the rest  a third time he was pardoned will you not think such a story too extraordinary for belief will you not think me describng the savage inhabitants of congo alas the story is but too true and the country where it was transacted regards itself as the politest in europe  adieu letter xxxviii from lien cbi altangi to  merchant in amsterdam ceremonies are different in every country but true politeness is every where the same ceremonies which take up so much of our attention are only artificial helps which ignorance assumes in order to imitate politeness which is the result of good sense and goodnature a person possessed of those qualities though he had never seen a court is truly agreeable and if without them would continue a clown though he had been all his life a gentleman usher  how would a chinese bred up in the formalities of an eastern court be regarded should he carry all his good manners beyond the great wall how would an englishman skilled in all the decorums of western good breeding appear at an eastern entertainment would he not be reckoned more fantastically savage than even his unbred footman  ceremony resembles that base coin which circulates through a country by the royal mandate it serves every purpose of real money at home but is entirely useless if carried abroad a person who should attempt to circulate his native trash in another country would be thought either ridiculous or culpable he is truly well bred who knows when to value and when to despise those national peculiarities which are regarded by some with so much observance a traveller of taste at once perceives that the wise are polite all the world over but that fools are polite only at home  i have now before me two very fashionable letters upon the same subject both written by ladies of distinction one of whom leads the fashion in england and the other sets the ceremonies of china they are both regarded in their respective countries by all the beaumonde as standards of taste and models of true politeness and both give us a true idea of what they imagine elegant in their admirers which of them understands true politeness or whether either

is flat so well dressed so neat so sprightly and plays about one so agreeably that i vow he has as much spirits as the marquis of monkeymans italian greyhound i first saw him at renelagh he shines there he is nothing without renelagh and renelagh nothing without him the next day he sent a card and compliments desiring to wait on mamma and me to the music subscription he looked all the time with such irresistible impudence that possitively he had something in his face gave me as much pleasure as a pairroyal of naturals in my own hand he waited on mamma and me the next morning to know how we got home you must know the insidious devil makes love to us both rap went the footman at the door bounce went my heart i thought he would have rattled the house down chariot drove up to the window with his footmen in the prettiest liveries he has infinite taste that is flat mamma had spent all the morning at her head but for my part i was in an undress to receive him quite easy mind that no way disturbed at his approach mamma pretended to be as degagee as i and yet i saw her blush in spite of her positively he is a most killing devil we did nothing but laugh all the time he staid with us i never heard so many very good things before at first he mistook mamma for my sister at which she laughed then he mistook my natural complexion for paint at which i laughed and then he showed us a picture in the lid of his snuff box at which we all laughed he plays picquet so very ill and is so very fond of cards and loses with such a grace that positively he has won me i have got a cool hundred but have lost my heart i need not tell you that he is only a colonel of the trainbands  i am dear charlotte yours for ever belinda   the chinese lady addresses her confidant a poor relation of the family upon the same occasion in which she seems to understand decorums even better than the western beauty you who have resided so long in china will readily acknowledge the picture to be taken from nature and by being acquainted with the chinese customs will better apprehend the ladys meaning from yaoua to yaya papa insists upon one two three four hundred taels from the colonel my lover before he parts with a lock of my hair ho how i wish the dear creature may be able to produce the money and pay papa my fortune the colonel is reckoned the politest man in all shensi the first visit he paid at our house mercy what stooping and cringing and stopping and fidgeting and going back and creeping forward there was between him and papa one would have thought he had got the seventeen books of ceremonies all by heart when he was come into the hall he flourished his hands three times in a very graceful manner papa who would not be outdone flourished his four times upon this the colonel began again and both thus continued flourishing for some minutes in the politest manner imaginable i was posted in the usual place behind the screen where i saw the whole ceremony through a slit of this the colonel was sensible for papa informed him i would have given the world to have shown him my little shoes but had no opportunity it was the first time i had ever the happiness of seeing any man but papa and i vow my dear yaya i thought my three souls would actually have fled from my lips ho but he looked most charmingly he is reckoned the best shaped man in the whole province for he is very fat and very short but even those natural advantages are improved by his dress which is fashionable past description his head was close shaven all but the crown and the hair of that was braided into a most beautiful tail that reaching down to his heels was terminated by a bunch of yellow roses upon his first entering the room i could easily perceive he had been highly perfumed with assafoetida but then his looks his looks my dear yaya were irresistible he kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the wall during the whole ceremony and i sincerely believe no accident could have discomposed his gravity or drawn his eyes away after a polite silence of two hours he gallantly begged to have the singing women introduced purely for my amusement after one of them had for some time entertained us with her voice the colonel and she retired for some minutes together i thought they would never have come back i must own he is a most agreeable creature upon his return they again renewed the concert and he continued to gaze upon the wall as usual when in less than half an hour more ho but he retired out of the room with another he is indeed a most agreeable creature  when he came to take his leave the whole ceremony began afresh papa would see him to the door but the colonel swore he would rather see the earth turned upside down than permit him to stir a single step and papa was at last obliged to comply as soon as he was got to the door papa went out to see him on horseback here they continued half an hour bowing and cringing before one would mount or the other go in but the colonel was at last victorious he had scarce gone an hundred paces from the house when papa running out hallood after him a good journey upon which the colonel returned and would see papa into his house before ever he would depart he was no sooner got home than he sent me a very fine present of duck eggs painted of twenty different colors his generosity i own has won me i have ever since been trying over the eight letters of good fortune and have great hopes all i have to apprehend is that after he has married me and that i am carried to his house close shut up in my chair when he comes to have the first sight of my face he may shut me up a second time and send me back to papa however i shall appear as fine as possible mamma and i have been to buy the clothes for my wedding i am to have a new song whang in my hair the beak of which will reach down to my nose the milliner from whom we bought that and our ribbons cheated us as if she had no conscience and so to quiet mine i cheated her all this is fair you know i remain my dear yaya  your ever faithful yaoua     letter xxxix from the same you have always testified the highest esteem for the english poets and thought them not inferior to the greeks romans or even the chinese in the art but it is now thought even by the english themselves that the race of their poets is extinct every day produces some pathetic exclamation upon the decadence of taste and genius pegasus say they has slipped the bridle from his mouth and our modern bards attempt to direct his flight by catching him by the tail  yet my friend it is only among the ignorant that such discourses prevail men of true discernment can see several poets still among the english some of whom equal if not surpass their predecessors the ignorant term that alone poetry which is couched in a certain number of syllables in every line where a vapid thought is drawn out into a number of verses of equal length and perhaps pointed with rhymes at the end but glowing sentiment striking imagery concise expression natural description and modulated periods are full sufficient entirely to fill up my idea of this art and make way to every passion  if my idea of poetry therefore be just the english are not at present so destitute of poetical merit as they seem to imagine i can see several poets in disguise among them men furnished with that strength of soul sublimity of sentiment and grandeur of expression which constitutes the character many of the writers of their modern odes sonnets tragedies or rebusses it is true deserve not the name though they have done nothing but clink rhymes and measure syllables for years together their johnsons and smollets are truly poets though for aught i know they never made a single verse in their whole lives  in every incipient language the poet and the prose writer are very distinct in their qualifications the poet ever proceeds first treading unbeaten paths enriching his native funds and employed in new adventures the other follows with more cautious steps and though slow in his motions treasures up every useful or pleasing discovery but when once all the extent and force of the language is known the poet then seems to rest from his labor and is at length overtaken by his assiduous pursuer both characters are then blended into one the historian and orator catch all the poets fire and leave him no real mark of distinction except the iteration of numbers regularly returning thus in the decline of ancient european learning seneca though he wrote in prose is as much a poet as lucan and longinus though but a critic more sublime than apollonius  from this then it appears that poetry is not discontinued but altered among the english at present the outward form seems different from what it was but poetry still continues internally the same the only question remains whether the metric feet used by the good writers of the last age or the prosaic numbers employed by the good writers of this be preferable and here the practice of the last age appears to me superior they submitted to the restraint of numbers and similar sounds and this restraint instead of diminishing augmented the force of their sentiment and style fancy restrained may be compared to a fountain which plays highest by diminishing the aperture of the truth of this maxim in every language every fine writer is perfectly sensible from his own experience and yet to explain the reason would be perhaps as difficult as to make a frigid genius profit by the discovery  there is still another reason in favor of the practice of the last age to be drawn from the variety of modulation the musical period in prose is confined to a very few changes the numbers in verse are capable of infinite variation i speak not now from the practice of modern verse writers few of whom have any idea of musical variety but run on in the same monotonous flow through the whole poem but rather from the example of their former poets who were tolerable masters of this variety and also from a capacity in the language of still admitting various unanticipated music  several rules have been drawn up for varying the poetic measure and critics have elaborately talked of accents and syllables but good sense and a fine ear which rules can never teach are what alone can in such a case determine the rapturous flowings of joy or the interruptions of indignation require accents placed entirely different and a structure consonant to the emotions they would express changing passions and numbers changing with those passions make the whole secret of western as well as eastern poetry in a word the great faults of the modern professed english poets are that they seem to want numbers which should vary with the passion and are more employed in describing to the imagination than striking at the heart  adieu letter xl to the same some time since i sent thee oh holy disciple of confucius an account of the grand abbey or mausoleum of the kings and heroes of this nation i have since been introduced to a temple not so ancient but far superior in beauty and magnificence in this which is the most considerable of the empire there are no pompous inscriptions no flattery paid the dead but all is elegant and awfully simple there are however a few rags hung round the walls which have at a vast expense been taken from the enemy in the present war the silk of which they are composed when new might be valued at half a string of copper money in china yet this wise people fitted out a fleet and an army in order to seize them though now grown old and scarce capable of being patched up into a handkerchief by this conquest the english are said to have gained and the french to have lost much honor is the honor of european nations placed only in tattered silk  in this temple i was permitted to remain during the whole service and were you not already acquainted with the religion of the english you might from my description be inclined to believe them as grossly idolatrous as the disciples of lao the idol which they seem to address strikes like a colossus over the door of the inner temple which here as with the jews is esteemed the most sacred part of the building its oracles are delivered in an hundred various tones which seem to inspire the worshippers with enthusiasm and awe an old woman who appeared to be the priestess was employed in various attitudes as she felt the inspiration when it began to speak all the people remained fixed in silent attention nodding assent looking approbation appearing highly edified by those sounds which to a stranger might seem inarticulate and unmeaning  when the idol had done speaking and the priestess had locked up its lungs with a key observing almost all the company leaving the temple i concluded the service was over and taking my hat was going to walk away with the crowd when i was stopped by the man in black who assured me that the ceremony had scarcely yet begun what cried i do i not see almost the whole body of the worshippers leaving the church would you persuade me that such numbers who profess religion and morality would in this shameless manner quit the temple before the service was concluded you surely mistake not even the kalmouks would be guilty of such an indecency though all the object of their worship was but a joint stool my friend seemed to blush for his countrymen assuring me that those whom i saw running away were only a parcel of musical blockheads whose passion was merely for sounds and whose heads were as empty as a fiddle case those who remain behind says he are the true religious they make use of music to warm their hearts and to lift them to a proper pitch of rapture examine their behavior and you will confess there are some among us who practice true devotion  i now looked round me as he directed but saw nothing of that fervent devotion which he had promised one of the worshippers appeared to be ogling the company through a glass another was fervent not in addresses to heaven but to his mistress a third whispered a fourth took snuff and the priest himself in a drowsy tone read over the duties of the day  bless my eyes cried i as i happened to look toward the door what do i see one of the worshippers fallen fast asleep and actually sunk down on his cushon is he now enjoying the benefit of a trance or does he receive the influence of some mysterious vision alas alas replied my companion no such thing he has only had the misfortune of eating too hearty a dinner and finds it impossible to keep his eyes open turning to another part of the temple i perceived a young lady just in the same circumstances and attitude strange cried i can she too have overeaten herself o fie replied my friend you now grow censorious she grow drowsy from eating too much that would be profanation she only sleeps now from having sat up all night at a brag party turn me where i will then says i i can perceive no single symptom of devotion among the worshippers except from that old woman in the corner who sits groaning behind the long sticks of a mourning fan she indeed seems greatly edified with what she hears aye replied my friend i knew we should find some to catch you i know her that is the deaf lady who lives in the cloisters  in short the remissness of behavior in almost all the worshippers and some even of the guardians struck me with surprise i had been taught to believe that none were ever promoted to offices in the temple but men remarkable for their superior sanctity learning and rectitude that there was no such thing heard of as persons being introduced into the church merely to oblige a senator or provide for the younger branch of a noble family i expected as their minds were continually set upon heavenly things to see their eyes directed there also and hoped from their behavior to perceive their inclinations corresponding with their duty but i am since informed that some are appointed to preside over temples they never visit and while they receive all the money are contented with letting others do all the good  adieu letter xli from fum hoam to lien chi altangi the discontented wanderer by the way of moscow must i ever continue to condemn thy perseverence and blame that curiosity which destroys thy happiness what yet untasted banquet what luxury yet unknown has rewarded thy painful adventures name a pleasure which thy native country could not amply procure frame a wish that might not have been satisfied in china why then such toil and such danger in pursuit of raptures within your reach at home  the europeans you will say excel us in sciences and in arts those sciences which bound the aspiring wish and those arts which tend to gratify even unrestrained desire they may perhaps outdo us in the arts of building ships casting cannons or measuring mountains but are they superior in the greatest of all arts the art of governing kingdoms and ourselves  when i compare the history of china with that of europe how do i exult in being a native of that kingdom which derives its original from the sun upon opening the chinese history i there behold an ancient extended empire established by laws which nature and reason seem to have dictated the duty of children to their parents a duty which nature implants in every breast forms the strength of that government which has subsisted for time immemorial filial obedience is the first and greatest requisite of a state by this we become good subjects to our emperors capable of behaving with just subordination to our superiors and grateful dependants on heaven by this we become fonder of marriage in order to be capable of exacting obedience from others in our turn by this we become good magistrates for early submission is the truest lesson to those who would learn to rule by this the whole state may be said to resemble one family of which the emperor is the protector father and friend  in this happy region sequestered from the rest of mankind i see a succession of princes who in general considered themselves as the fathers of their people a race of philosophers who bravely combated idolatry prejudice and tyranny at the expense of their private happiness and immediate reputation whenever an usurper or a tyrant intruded into the administration how have all the good and great been united against him can european history produce an instance like that of the twelve mandarines who all resolved to apprize the vicious emperor tisiang of the irregularity of his conduct he who first undertook the dangerous task was cut in two by the emperors order the second was ordered to be tormented and then put to a cruel death the third undertook the task with intrepidity and was instantly stabbed by the tyrants hand in this manner they all suffered except one but net to be turned from his purpose the brave survivor entering the palace with the instruments of torture in his hand here cried he addressing himself to the throne here o tisiang are the marks your faithful subjects receive for their loyalty i am wearied with serving a tyrant and now come for my reward the emperor struck with his intrepidity instantly forgave the boldness of his conduct and reformed his own what european annals can boast of a tyrant thus reclaimed to lenity  when five brethren had set upon the great emperor ginsong alone with his sabre he slew four of them he was struggling with the fifth when his guards coming up were going to cut the conspirator into a thousand pieces no no cried the emperor with a calm and placid countenance of all his brothers he is the only one remaining at least let one of the family be suffered to live that his aged parents may have some body left to feed and comfort them  when haitong the last emperor of the house of ming saw himself besieged in his own city by the usurper he was resolved to issue from his palace with six hundred of his guards and give the enemy battle but they forsook him being thus without hopes and choosing death rather than to fall alive into the hands of a rebel he retired to his garden conducting his little daughter an only child in his hand there in a private arbor unsheathing his sword he stabbed the young innocent to the heart and then dispatching himself left the following words written with his blood on the border of his vest forsaken by my subjects abandoned by my friends use my body as you will but spare o spare my people  an empire which has thus continued invariably the same for such a long succession of ages which though at last conquered by the tartars still preserves its ancient laws and learning and may more properly be said to annex the dominions of tartary to its empire than to admit a foreign conqueror an empire as large as europe governed by one law acknowledging subjection to one prince and experiencing but one revolution of any continuance in the space of four thousand years this is something so peculiarly great that i am naturally led to despise all other nations on the comparison here we see no religious persecutions no enmity between mankind for difference in opinion the disciples of lao kium the idolatrous sectaries of fohi and the philosophical children of confucius only strive to show by their actions the truth of their doctrines  now turn from this happy peaceful scene to europe the theater of intrigue avarice and ambition how many revolutions does it not experience in the compass even of one age and to what do these revolutions tend but the destruction of thousands every great event is replete with some new calamity the seasons of serenity are passed over in silence their histories seem to speak only of the storm  there we see the romans extending their power over barbarous nations and in turn becoming a prey to those whom they had conquered we see those barbarians when become christians engaged in continual wars with the followers of mahomet or more dreadful still destroying each other we see councils in the earlier ages authorizing every iniquity crusades spreading desolation in the country let as well as that to be conquered excommunications freeing subjects from natural allegiance and persuading to sedition blood flowing in the fields and on scaffolds tortures used as arguments to convince the recusant to heighten the horror of the piece behold it shaded with wars rebellions treasons plots politics and poison  and what advantage has any country of europe obtained from such calamities scarce any their dissentions for more than a thousand years have served to make each other unhappy but have enriched none all the great nations still nearly preserve their ancient limits none have been able to subdue the other and so terminate the dispute france in spite of the conquests of edward the third and henry the fifth notwithstanding the efforts of charles the fifth and philip the second still remains within its ancient limits spain germany great britain poland the states of the north are nearly still the same what effect then has the blood of so many thousands the destruction of so many cities produced nothing neither great or considerable the christian princes have lost indeed much from the enemies of christendom but they have gained nothing from each other their princes because they preferred ambition to justice deserve the character of enemies to mankind and their priests by neglecting morality for opinion have mistaken the interests of society  on whatever side we regard the history of europe we shall perceive it to be a tissue of crimes follies and misfortunes of politics without design and wars without consequence in this long list of human infirmity a great character or a shining virtue may sometimes happen to arise as we often meet a cottage or a cultivated spot in the most hideous wilderness but for an alfred an alphonso a frederic or one alexander iii we meet a thousand princes who have disgraced humanity  letter xlii from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial academy at pekin in china we have just received accounts here that voltaire the poet and philosopher of europe is dead he is now beyond the reach of the thousand enemies who while living degraded his writings and branded his character scarce a page of his latter productions that does not betray the agonies of an heart bleeding under the scourge of unmerited reproach happy therefore at last in escaping from calumny happy in leaving a world that was unworthy of him and his writings  let others my friend bestrew the hearses of the great with panegyric but such a loss as the world has now suffered affects me with stronger emotions when a philosopher dies i consider myself as losing a patron an instructor and a friend i consider the world as losing one who might serve to console her amidst the desolations of war and ambition nature every day produces in abundance men capable of filling all the requisite duties of authority but she is nigard in the birth of an exalted mind scarcely producing in a century a single genius to bless and enlighten a degenerate age prodigal in the production of kings governors mandarines chams and courtiers she seems to have forgotten for more than three thousand years the manner in which she once formed the brain of a confucius and well it is she has forgotten when a bad world gave him so very bad a reception  whence my friend this malevolence which has ever pursued the great even to the tomb whence this more than fiendlike disposition of embittering the lives of those who would make us more wise and more happy  when i cast my eye over the fates of several philosophers who have at different periods enlightened mankind i must confess it inspires me with the most degrading reflections on humanity when i read of the stripes of mentius the tortures of tchin the bowl of socrates and the bath of seneca when i hear of the persecutions of dante the imprisonment of galileo the indignities suffered by montagne the banishment of cartesius the infamy of bacon and that even lock himself escaped not without reproach when i think on such subjects i hesitate whether most to blame the ignorance or the villainy of my fellow creatures  should you look for the character of voltaire among the journalists and illiterate writers of the age you will there find him characterized as a monster with a head turned to wisdom and an heart inclining to vice the powers of his mind and the baseness of his principles forming a detestable contrast but seek for his character among writers like himself and you find him very differently described you perceive him in their accounts possessed of good nature humanity greatness of soul fortitude and almost every virtue in this description those who might be supposed best acquainted with his character are unanimous the royal prussian philosophe sans souci  dargens let chin  diderot encycloped  dalambert and fontenelle conspire in drawing the picture in describing the friend of man and the patron of every rising genius  an inflexible perseverance in what he thought was right and a generous detestation of flattery formed the groundwork of this great mans character from these principles many strong virtues and few faults arose as he was warm in his friendship and severe in resentment all that mention him seem possessed of the same qualities and speak of him with rapture or detestation a person of his eminence can have few indifferent as to his character every reader must be an enemy or an admirer  this poet began the course of glory so early as the age of eighteen and even then was author of a tragedy which deserves applause possessed of a small patrimony he preserved his independance in an age of venality and supported the dignity of learning by teaching his cotemporary writers to live like him above the favors of the great he was banished his native country for a satire upon the royal concubine he had accepted the place of historian to the french king but refused to keep it when he found it was presented only in order that he should be the first flatterer of the state  the great prussian received him as an ornament to his kingdom and had sense enough to value his friendship and profit by his instructions in this court he continued till an intrigue with which the world seems hitherto unacquainted obliged him to quit that country his own happiness the happiness of the monarch of his sister of a part of the court rendered his departure necessary  tired at length of courts and all the follies of the great he retired to switzerland a country of liberty where he enjoyed tranquillity and the muse here though without any taste for magnificence himself he usually entertained at his table the learned and polite of europe who were attracted by a desire of seeing a person from whom they had received so much satisfaction the entertainment was conducted with the utmost elegance and the conversation was that of philosophers every country that at once united liberty and science were his peculiar favorites the being an englishman was to him a character that claimed admiration and respect  between voltaire and the disciples of confucius there are many differences however being of a different opinion does not in the least diminish my esteem i am not displeased with my brother because he happens to ask our father for favors in a different manner from me let his errors rest in peace his excellencies deserve admiration let me with the wise admire his wisdom let the envious and the ignorant ridicule his foibles the folly of others is ever most ridiculous to those who are themselves most foolish  adieu letter xliii from lien chi altangi to hingpo a slave in persia it is impossible to form a philosophic system of happiness which is adapted to every condition in life since every person who travels in this great pursuit takes a separate road the differing colors which suit different complections are not more various than the different pleasures appropriated to particular minds the various sects who have pretended to give lessons to instruct men in happiness have described their own particular sensations without considering ours have only loaded their disciples with constraint without adding to their real felicity  if i find pleasure in dancing how ridiculous would it be in me to prescribe such an amusement for the entertainment of a cripple should he on the other hand place his chief delight in painting yet would he be absurd in recommending the same relish to one who had lost the power of distinguishing colors general directions are therefore commonly useless and to be particular would exhaust volumes since each individual may require a peculiar system of precepts to direct his choice  every mind seems capable of entertaining a certain quantity of happiness which no institutions can increase no circumstances alter and entirely independent on fortune let any man compare his present fortune with the past and he will probably find himself upon the whole neither better nor worse than formerly  gratified ambition or irreparable calamity may produce transient sensations of pleasure or distress those storms may discompose in proportion as they are strong or the mind is pliant to their impression but the soul though at first lifted up by the event is every day operated upon with diminished influence and at length subsides into the level of its usual tranquillity should some unexpected turn of fortune take thee from fetters and place thee on a throne exultation would be natural upon the change but the temper like the face would soon resume its native serenity  every wish therefore which leads us to expect happiness somewhere else but where we are every institution which teaches us that we should be better by being possessed of something new which promises to lift us a step higher than we are only lays a foundation for uneasiness because it contracts debts which it cannot repay it calls that a good which when we have found it will in fact add nothing to our happiness  to enjoy the present without regret for the past or solicitude for the future has been the advice rather of poets than philosophers and yet the precept seems more rational than is generally imagined it is the only general precept respecting the pursuit of happiness that can be applied with propriety to every condition of life the man of pleasure the man of business and the philosopher are equally interested in its disquisition if we do not find happiness in the present moment in what shall we find it either in reflecting on the past or prognosticating the future but let us see how these are capable of producing satisfaction  a remembrance of what is past and an anticipation of what is to come seem to be the two faculties by which man differs most from other animals though brutes enjoy them in a limited degree yet their whole life seems taken up in the present regardless of the past and the future man on the contrary endeavors to derive his happiness and experiences most of his miseries from these two sources  is this superiority of reflection a prerogative of which we should boast and for which we shall thank nature or is it a misfortune of which we should complain and be humble either from the abuse or from the nature of things it certainly makes our condition more miserable  had we a privilege of calling up by the power of memory only such passages as were pleasing unmixed with such as were disagreeable we might then excite at pleasure an ideal happiness perhaps more poignant than actual sensation but this is not the case the past is never represented without some disagreeable circumstance which tarnishes all its beauty the remembrance of an evil carries in it nothing agreeable and to remember a good is always accompanied with regret thus we lose more than we gain by remembrance  and we shall find our expectation of the future to be a gift more distressful even than the former to fear an approaching evil is certainly a most disagreeable sensation and in expecting an approaching good we experience the inquietude of wanting actual possession  thus whichever way we look the prospect is disagreeable behind we have left pleasures we shall never more enjoy and therefore regret and before we see pleasures which we languish to possess and are consequently uneasy till we possess them was there any method of seizing the present unimbittered by such reflections then would our state be tolerably easy  this indeed is the endeavor of all mankind who untutored by philosophy pursue as much as they can a life of amusement and dissipation every rank in life and every size of understanding seems to follow this alone or not pursuing it deviates from happiness the man of pleasure pursues dissipation by profession the man of business pursues it not less as every voluntary labor he undergoes is only dissipation in disguise the philosopher himself even while he reasons upon the subject does it unknowingly with a view of dissipating the thoughts of what he was or what he must be  the subject therefore comes to this which is the most perfect sort of dissipation pleasure business or philosophy which best serves to exclude those uneasy sensations which memory or anticipation produce  the enthusiasm of pleasure charms only by intervals the highest rapture lasts only for a moment and all the senses seem so combined as to be soon tired into languor by the gratification of any one of them it is only among the poets we hear of men changing to one delight when satiated with another in nature it is very different the glutton when sated with the full meal is unqualified to feel the real pleasure of drinking the drunkard in turn finds few of those transports which lovers boast in enjoyment and the lover when cloyed finds a diminution of every other appetite thus after a full indulgence of any one sense the man of pleasure finds a languor in all is placed in a chasin between past and expected enjoyment perceives an interval which must be filled up the present can give no satisfaction because he has already robbed it of every charm a mind thus left without immediate employment naturally recurs to the past or the future the reflector finds that he was happy and knows that he cannot be so now he sees that he may yet be happy and wishes the hour was come thus every period of his continuance is miserable except that very short one of immediate gratification instead of a life of dissipation none has more frequent conversations with disagreeable self than he his enthusiasms are but few and transient his appetites like angry creditors continually making fruitless demands for what he is unable to pay and the greater his former pleasure the more strong his regret the more impatient his expectations a life of pleasure is therefore the most unpleasing life in the world  habit has rendered the man of business more cool in his desires he finds less regret for past pleasures and less solicitude for those to come the life he now leads though tainted in some measure with hope is yet not afflicted so strongly with regret and is less divided between shortlived rapture and lasting anguish the pleasures he has enjoyed are not so vivid and those he has to expect cannot consequently create so much anxiety  the philosopher who extends his regard to all mankind must have still a smaller concern for what has already affected or may hereafter affect himself the concerns of others make his whole study and that study is his pleasure and this pleasure is continuing in its nature because it can be changed at will leaving but few of these anxious intervals which are employed in remembrance or anticipation the philosopher by this means leads a life of almost continued dissipation and reflection which makes the uneasiness and misery of others serves as a companion and instructor to him  in a word positive happiness is constitutional and incapable of increase misery is artificial and generally proceeds from our folly philosophy can add to our happiness in no other manner but by diminishing our misery it should not pretend to increase our present stock but make us oeconomists of what we are possessed of the great source of calamity lies in regret or anticipation he therefore is most wise who thinks of the present alone regardless of the past or the future this is impossible to the man of pleasure it is difficult to the man of business and is in some measure attainable by the philosopher happy were we all born philosophers all born with a talent of thus dissipating our own cares by spreading them upon all mankind  letter xliv from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial academy at pekin in china though the frequent invitations i receive from men of distinction here might excite the vanity of some i am quite mortified however when i consider the motives that inspire their civility i am sent for not to be treated as a friend but to satisfy curiosity not to be entertained so much as wondered at the fame earnestness which excites them to see a chinese would have made them equally proud of a visit from the rhinoceros  from the highest to the lowest this people seem fond of sights and monsters i am told of a person here who gets a very comfortable livelihood by making wonders and then selling or showing them to the people for money no matter how insignificant they were in the beginning by locking them up close and showing for money they soon became prodigies his first essay in this way was to exhibit himself as a waxwork figure behind a glass door at a puppet show thus keeping the spectators at a proper distance and having his head adorned with a copper crown he looked extremely natural and very like the life itself he continued this exhibition with success till an involuntary fit of sneezing brought him to life before all the spectators and consequently rendered him for that time as entirely useless as the peaceable inhabitant of a catacomb  determined to act the statue no more he next levied contributions under the figure of an indian king and by painting his face and counterfeiting the savage howl he frighted several ladies and children with amazing success in this manner therefore he might have lived very comfortably had he not been arrested for a debt that was contracted when he was the figure in waxwork thus his face underwent an involuntary ablution and he found himself reduced to his primitive complexion and indigence  after some time being freed from gaol he was now grown wiser and instead of making himself a wonder was resolved only to make wonders he learned the art of pasting up mummies was never at a loss for an artificial lusus naturae nay it has been reported that he has sold seven petrified lobsters of his own manufacture to a noted collector of rarities but this the learned cracovius putridus has undertaken to refute in a very elaborate dissertation  his last wonder was nothing more than an halter yet by this halter he gained more than by all his former exhibitions the people it seems had got it in their heads that a certain noble criminal was to be hanged with a silken rope now there was nothing they so much desired to see as this very rope and he was resolved to gratify their curiosity he therefore got one made not only of silk but to render it the more striking several threads of gold were intermixed the people paid their money only to see silk but were highly satisfied when they found it was mixed with gold into the bargain it is scarce necessary to mention that the projector sold his silkenrope for almost what it had cost him as soon as the criminal was known to be hanged in hempen materials  by their fondness of sights one would be apt to imagine that instead of desiring to see things as they should be they are rather solicitous of seeing them as they ought not to be a cat with four legs is disregarded though never so useful but if it has but two and is consequently incapable of catching mice it is reckoned inestimable and every man of taste is ready to raise the auction a man though in his person faultless as an aerial genius might starve but if stuck over with hideous warts like a porcupine his fortune is made for ever and he may propagate the breed with impunity and applause  a good woman in my neighborhood who was bred an habitmaker though she handled her needle tolerably well could scarcely get employment but being obliged by an accident to have both her hands cut off from the elbows what would in another country have been her ruin made her fortune here she now was thought more fit for her trade than before business flowed in apace and all people paid for seeing the mantuamaker who wrought without hands  a gentleman showing me his collection of pictures stopped at one with peculiar admiration there cries he is an inestimable piece i gazed at the picture for some time but could see none of those graces with which he seemed enraptured it appeared to me the most paltry piece of the whole collection i therefore demanded where those beauties lay of which i was yet insensible sir cries he the merit does not consist in the piece but in the manner in which it was done the painter drew the whole with his foot and held the pencil between his toes i bought it at a very great price for peculiar merit should ever be rewarded  but these people are not more sond of wonders than liberal in rewarding those who show them from the wonderful dog of knowledge at present

subscriptions in her own coach and fix a fellow shall make a fortune by tossing a straw from his toe to his nose one in particular has found that eating fire was the most ready way to live and another who gingles several bells fixed to his cap is the only man that i know of who has received emolument from the labors of his head  a young author a man of good nature and learning was complaining to me some nights ago of this misplaced generosity of the times here says he have i spent part of my youth in attempting to instruct and amuse my fellow creatures and all my reward has been solitude poverty and reproach while a fellow possessed of even the smallest share of fiddling merit or who has perhaps learned to whistle double is rewarded applauded and caressed prithee young man says i to him are you ignorant that in so large a city as this it is better to be an amusing than an useful member of society can you leap up and touch your feet four times before you come to the ground no sir can you pimp for a man of quality no sir can you stand upon two horses at full speed no sir can you swallow a penknife i can do none of these tricks why then cried i there is no other prudent means of subsistence left but to apprize the town that you speedily intend to eat up your own nose by subscription  i have frequently regretted that none of our eastern posture masters or show men have ever ventured to england i should be pleased to see that money circulate in asia which is now sent to italy and france in order to bring their vagabonds hither several of our tricks would undoubtedly give the english high satisfaction men of fashion would be greatly pleased with the postures as well as the condescension of our dancing girls and ladies would equally admire the conductors of our fireworks what an agreeable surprise would it be to see a huge fellow with whiskers flash a charged blunderbuss full in a ladys face without singing her hair or melting her pomatum perhaps when the first surprise was over she might then grow familiar with danger and the ladies might vie with each other in standing fire with intrepidity  but of all the wonders of the east the most useful and i should fancy the most pleasing would be the lookingglass of lao which reflects the mind as well as the body it is said that the emperor chusi used to make his concubines dress their heads and their hearts in one of these glasses every morning while the lady was at her toilet he would frequently look over her shoulder and it is recorded that among the three hundred which composed his seraglio not one was found whose mind was not even more beautiful than her person  i make no doubt but a glass in this country would have the very same effect the english ladies concubines and all would undoubtedly cut very pretty figures in so faithful a monitor there should we happen to peep over a ladys shoulder while dressing we might be able to see neither gaming nor ill nature neither pride debauchery nor a love of gadding we should find her if any sensible defect appeared in the mind more careful in rectifying it than plaistering up the irreparable decays of the person nay i am even apt to fancy that ladies would find more real pleasure in this utensil in private than in any other bauble imported from china though never so expensive or amusing  letter xlv to the same upon finishing my last letter i retired to rest reflecting upon the wonders of the glass of lao wishing to be possessed of one here and resolved in such a case to oblige every lady with a sight of it for nothing what fortune denied me waking fancy supplied in a dream the glass i know not how was put into my possession and i could perceive several ladies approaching some voluntarily others driven forward against their wills by a set of discontented genii whom by intuition i knew were their husbands  the apartment in which i was to show away was filled with several gaming tables as if just forsaken the candles were burnt to the socket and the hour was five oclock in the morning placed at one end of the room which was of prodigious length i could more easily distinguish every female figure as she marched up from the door but guess my surprise when i could scarce perceive one blooming or agreeable face among the number this however i attributed to the early hour and kindly considered that the face of a lady just risen from bed ought always to find a compassionate advocate  the first person who came up in order to view her intellectual face was a commoners wife who as i afterward found being bred during her virginity in a pawnbrokers shop now attempted to make up the defects of breeding and sentiment by the magnificence of her dress and the expensiveness of her amusements mr showman cried she approaching i am told you has something to show in that there sort of magic lanthorn by which folks can see themselves on the inside i protest as my lord beetle says i am sure it will be vastly pretty for i have never seen any thing like it before but how are we to strip off our clothes and be turned inside out if so as lord beetle says i absolutely declare off for i would not strip for the world before a mans face and so i tells his lordship almost every night of my life i informed the lady that i would dispense with the ceremony of stripping and immediately presented my glass to her view  as when a firstrate beauty after having with difficulty escaped the small pox revisits her favorite mirror that mirror which had repeated the flattery of every lover and even added force to the compliment expecting to see what had so often given her pleasure she no longer beholds the cherried lip the polished forehead and speaking blush but an hateful phyz quilted into a thousand seams by the hand of deformity grief resentment and rage fill her bosom by turns she blames the fates and the stars but most of all the unhappy glass feels her resentment so it was with the lady in question she had never seen her own mind before and was now shocked at its deformity one single look was sufficient to satisfy her curiosity i held up the glass to her face and she shut her eyes no entreaties could prevail upon her to gaze once more she was even going to snatch it from my hands and break it in a thousand pieces i found it was time therefore to dismiss her as incorrigible and show away to the next that offered  this was an unmarried lady who continued in a state of virginity till thirty six and then admitted a lover when she despaired of an husband no woman was louder at a revel than she perfectly freehearted and almost in every respect a man she understood ridicule to perfection and was once known even to sally out in order to beat the watch here you my dear with the outlandish face said she addressing me let me take a single peep not that i care three dams what figure i may cut in the glass of such an old fashioned creature if i am allowed the beauties of the face by people of fashion i know the world will be complaisant enough to toss me the beauties of the mind into the bargain i held my glass before her as she desired and must confess was shocked with the reflection the lady however gazed for some time with the utmost complacency and at last turning to me with the most satisfied smile said she never could think she had been half so handsome  upon her dismission a lady of distinction was reluctantly hawled along to the glass by her husband in bringing her forward as he came first to the glass himself his mind appeared tinctured with immoderate jealousy and i was going to reproach him for using her with such severity but when the lady came to present herself i immediately retracted for alas it was seen that he had but too much reason for his suspicions  the next was a lady who usually teized all her acquaintance in desiring to be told of her faults and then never mended any upon approaching the glass i could readily perceive vanity affectation and some other illlooking blots on her mind wherefore by my advice she immediately set about mending but i could easily find she was not earnest in the work for as she repaired them on one side they generally broke out on another thus after three or four attempts she began to make the ordinary use of the glass in settling her hair  the company now made room for a woman of learning who approached with a slow pace and a solemn countenance which for her own sake i could wish had been cleaner sir cried the lady flourishing her hand which held a pinch of snuff i shall be enraptured by having presented to my view a mind with which i have so long studied to be acquainted but in order to give the sex a proper example i must insist that all the company be permitted to look over my shoulder i bowed assent and presenting the glass showed the lady a mind by no means so fair as she had expected to see ill nature ill placed pride and spleen were too legible to be mistaken nothing could be more amusing than the mirth of her female companions who had looked over they had hated her from the beginning and now the apartment ecchoed with an universal laugh nothing but a fortitude like here is could have withstood their raillery she stood it however and when the burst was exhausted with great tranquillity she assured the company that the whole was a deceptio visus and that she was too well acquainted with her own mind to believe any false representations from another thus saying she retired with a fullen satisfaction resolved not to mend her faults but to write a criticism on the mental reflector  i must own by this time i began myself to suspect the fidelity of my mirror for as the ladies appeared at least to have the merit of rising early since they were up at five i was amazed to find nothing of this good quality pictured upon their minds in the reflection i was resolved therefore to communicate my suspicions to a lady whose intellectual countenance appeared more fair than any of the rest not having above seventynine spots in all besides slips and foibles i own young woman said i that there are some virtues upon that mind of yours but there is still one which i do not see represented i mean that of rising betimes in the morning i fancy the glass false in that particular the young lady smiled at my simplicity and with a blush confessed that she and the whole company had been up all night gaming  by this time all the ladies except one had seen themselves successively and disliked the show or scolded the showman i was resolved however that she who seemed to neglect herself and was neglected by the rest should take a view and going up to a corner of the room where she still continued sitting i presented my glass full in her face here it was that i exulted in my success no blot no stain appeared on any part of the faithful mirror as when the large unwritten page presents its snowy spotless bosom to the writers hand so appeared the glass to my view here o ye daughters of english ancestors cried i turn hither and behold an object worthy imitation look upon the mirror now and acknowledge its justice and this womans preeminence the ladies obeying the summons came up in a groupe and looking on acknowledged there was some truth in the picture as the person now represented had been deaf dumb and a fool from her cradle  thus much of my dream i distinctly remember the rest was filled with chimaeras enchanted castles and flying dragons as usual as you my dear fum hoam are particularly versed in the interpretation of those midnight warnings what pleasure should i find in your explanation but that our distance prevents i make no doubt however but that from my description you will very much venerate the good qualities of the english ladies in general since dreams you know go always by contraries  adieu letter xlvi from lien chi altangi to hingpo a slave in persia this letter appears to be little more than a rhapsody of sentiments from confucius vid the latin translation  your last letters betray a mind seemingly fond of wisdom yet tempested by a thousand various passions you would fondly persuade me that my former lessons still influence your conduct and yet your mind seems not less enslaved than your body knowledge wisdom erudition arts and elegance what are they but the mere trappings of the mind if they do not serve to increase the happiness of the possessor a mind rightly instituted in the school of philosophy acquires at once the stability of the oak and the flexibility of the osier the truest manner of lessening our agonies is to shrink from their pressure is to confess that we feel them  the fortitude of european sages is but a dream for where lies the merit in being insensible to the strokes of fortune or in dissembling our sensibility if we are insensible that arises only from an happy constitution that is a blessing previously granted by heaven and which no art can procure no institutions improve  if we dissemble our feelings we only artificially endeavor to persuade others that we enjoy privileges which we actually do not possess thus while we endeavor to appear happy we feel at once all the pangs of internal misery and all the selfreproaching consciousness of endeavoring to deceive  i know but of two sects of philosophers in the world that have endeavored to inculcate that fortitude is but an imaginary virtue i mean the followers of confucius and those who profess the doctrines of christ all other sects teach pride under misfortunes they alone teach humility night says our chinese philosopher not more surely follows day than groans and tears grow out of pain when misfortunes therefore oppress when tyrants threaten it is our interest it is our duty to fly even to dissipation forsupport to seek redress from friendship to seek redress from that best of friends who loved us into being  philosophers my son have long declaimed against the passions as being the source of all our miseries they are the source of all our misfortunes i own but they are the source of our pleasures too and every endeavor of our lives and all the institutions of philosophy should tend to this not to dissemble an absence of passion but to repel those which lead to vice by those which direct to virtue  the soul may be compared to a field of battle where two armies are ready every moment to encounter not a single vice but has a more powerful opponent and not one virtue but may be overborne by a combination of vices reason guides the bands of either host nor can it subdue one passion but by the assistance of another thus as a bark on every side beset with storms enjoys a state of rest so does the mind when influenced by a just equipoise of the passions enjoy tranquillity  i have used such means as my little fortune would admit to procure your freedom i have lately written to the governor of argun to pay your ransom though at the expense of all the wealth i brought with me from china if we become poor we shall at least have the pleasure of bearing poverty together for what is fatigue or famine when weighed against friendship and freedom  adieu letter xlvii from lien chi altangi to  merchant in amsterdam happening some days ago to call at a painters to amuse my self in examining some pictures i had no design to buy it surprised me to see a young prince in the working room dressed in a painters apron and assiduously learning the trade we instantly remembered to have seen each other and after the usual compliments i stood by while he continued to paint on as every thing done by the rich is praised as princes here as well as in china are never without followers three or four persons who had the appearance of gentlemen were placed behind to comfort and applaud him at every stroke  need i tell that it struck me with very disagreeable sensations to see a youth who by his station in life had it in his power to be useful to thousands thus letting his mind run to waste upon canvas at the same time fancying himself improving in taste and filling his rank with proper decorum  as seeing an error and attempting to redress it are only one and the same with me i took occasion upon his lordships desiring my opinion of a chinese scroll intended for the frame of a picture to assure him that a mandarine of china thought a minute acquaintance with such mechanical trifles below his dignity  this reply raised the indignation of some and the contempt of others i could hear the names of vandal goth taste polite arts delicacy and fire repeated in tones of ridicule or resentment but considering that it was vain to argue against people who had so much to say without contradicting them i begged leave to repeat a fairy tale this request redoubled their laughter but not easily abashed at the rallery of boys i persisted observing that it would set the absurdity of placing our affections upon trifles in the strongest point of view and adding that it was hoped the moral would compensate for its stupidity for heavens sake cried the great man washing his brush in water let us have no morality at present if we must have a story let it be without any moral i pretended not to hear and while he handled the brush proceeded as follows  in the kingdom of bonbobbin which by the chinese annal appears to have flourished twenty thousand years ago there reigned a prince endowed with every accomplishment which generally distinguishes the sons of kings his beauty was brighter than the sun the sun to which he was nearly related would sometimes stop his course in order to look down and admire him  his mind was not less perfect than his body he knew all things without having ever read philosophers poets and historians submitted their works to his decision and so penetrating was he that he could tell the merit of a book by looking on the cover he made epic poems tragedies and pastorals with surprising facility song epigram or rebus was all one to him though it is observed he could never finish an acrostic in short the fairy who presided at his birth had endowed him with almost every perfection or what was just the same his subjects were ready to acknowledge he possessed them all and for his own part he knew nothing to the contrary a prince so accomplished received a name suitable to his merit and he was called bonbenin bonbobbin bonbobbinet which signifies enlightener of the sun  as he was very powerful and yet unmarried all the neighboring kings earnestly sought his alliance each sent his daughter dressed out in the most magnificent manner and with the most sumptuous retinue imaginable in order to allure the prince so that at one time there were seen at his court not less than seven hundred foreign princesses of exquisite sentiment and beauty each alone sufficient to make seven hundred ordinary men happy  distracted in such a variety the generous bonbennin had he not been obliged by the laws of the empire to make choice of one would very willingly have married them all for none understood gallantry better he spent numberless hours of solicitude in endeavoring to determine whom he should choose one lady was possessed of every perfection but he disliked her eyebrows another was brighter than the morning star but he disapproved her fong whang a third did not lay white enough on her cheek and a fourth did not sufficiently blacken her nails at last after numberless disappointments on the one side and the other he made choice of the incomparable nanhoa queen of the scarlet dragons  the preparations for the royal nuptials or the envy of the disappointed ladies needs no description both the one and the other were as great as they could be the beautiful princess was conducted amidst admiring multitudes to the royal couch where after being divested of every encumbering ornament she was placed in expectance of the youthful bridegroom who did not keep her long in expectation he came more cheerful than the morning and printing on her lips a burning kiss the attendants took this as a proper signal to withdraw  perhaps i ought to have mentioned in the beginning that among several other qualifications the prince was fond of collecting and breeding mice which being an harmless pastime none of his counselors thought proper to dissuade him from he therefore kept a great variety of these pretty little animals in the most beautiful cages enriched with diamonds rubies emeralds pearls and other precious stones thus he innocently spent four hours each day in comtemplating their innocent little pastimes  but to proceed the prince and princess were now in bed one with all the love and expectation the other with all the modesty and fear which is natural to suppose both willing yet afraid to begin when the prince happening to look toward the outside of the bed perceived one of the most beautiful animals in the world a white mouse with green eyes playing about the floor and performing an hundred pretty tricks he was already master of blue mice red mice and even white mice with yellow eyes but a white mouse with green eyes was what he long endeavored to possess wherefore leaping from bed with the utmost impatience and agility the youthful prince attempted to seize the little charmer but it was fled in a moment for alas the mouse was sent by a discontented princess and was itself a fairy  it is impossible to describe the agony of the prince upon this occasion he sought round and round every part of the room even the bed where the princess lay was not exempt from the enquiry he turned the princess on one side and the other stripped her quite naked but no mouse was to be found the princess herself was kind enough to assist but still to no purpose  alas cried the young prince in an agony how unhappy am i to be thus disappointed never sure was so beautiful an animal seen i would give half my kingdom and my princess to him that would find it the princess though not much pleased with the latter part of his offer endeavored to comfort him as well as she could she let him know that he had an hundred mice already which ought to be at least sufficient to satisfy any philosopher like him though none of them had green eyes yet he should learn to thank heaven that they had eyes she told him for she was a profound moralist that incurable evils must be born and that useless lamentations were vain and that man was born to misfortunes she even entreated him to return to bed and she would endeavor to lull him on her bosom to repose but still the prince continued inconsolable and regarding her with a stern air for which his family was remarkable he vowed never to sleep in the royal palace or indulge himself in the innocent pleasures of matrimony till he had found the white mouse with the green eyes  prithee col leech cried his lordship interrupting me how do you like that nose dont you think there is something of the manner of rembrandt in it a prince in all this agony for a white mouse o ridiculous dont you think major vampyre that eyebrow stippled very prettily but pray what are the green eyes to the purpose except to amuse children i would give a thousand guineas to lay on the coloring of this cheek more smoothly but i ask pardon pray sir proceed  letter xlviii from the same kings continued i at that time were different from what they are now they then never engaged their word for any thing which they did not rigorously intend to perform this was the case of bonbenin who continued all night to lament his misfortunes to the princess who ecchoed groan for groan when morning came he published an edict offering half his kingdom and his princess to the person who should catch and bring him the white mouse with green eyes  the edict was scarce published when all the traps in the kingdom were baited with cheese numberless mice were taken and destroyed but still the much wished for mouse was not among the number the privy council were assembled more than once to give their advice but all their deliberations came to nothing even though there were two complete verminkillers and three professed ratcatchers of the number frequent addresses as is usual on extraordinary occasions were sent from all parts of the empire but though these promised well though in them he received an assurance that his faithful subjects would assist in his search with their lives and fortunes yet with all their loyalty they failed when the time came that the mouse was to be caught  the prince therefore was resolved to go himself in search determined never to lie two nights in one place till he had found what he sought for thus quitting his palace without attendants he set out upon his journey and traveled through many a desert and crossed many a river high over hills and down along vales still restless still enquiring wherever he came but no white mouse was to be found  as one day fatigued with his journey he was shading himself from the heat of the midday sun under the arching branches of a bananatree meditating on the object of his pursuit he perceived an old woman hideously deformed approaching him by her stoop and the wrinkles of her visage she seemed at least five hundred years old and the spotted toad was not more freckled than was her skin ah prince bonbeninbonbobbin bonbobbinet cried the creature what has led you so many thousand miles from your own kingdom what is it you look for and what induces you to travel into the kingdom of emmets the prince who was excessively complaisant told her the whole story three times over for she was hard of hearing well says the old fairy for such she was i promise to put you in possession of the white mouse with green eyes and that immediately too upon one condition one condition cried the prince in a rapture name a thousand i shall undergo them all with pleasure nay interrupted the old fairy i ask but one and that not very mortifying neither it is only that you instantly consent to marry me  it is impossible to express the princes confusion at this demand he loved the mouse but he detested the bride he hesitated he desired time to think upon the proposal he would have been glad to consult his friends on such an occasion nay nay cried the odious fairy if you demur i retract my promise i do not desire to force my favors on any man here you my attendants cried she stamping with her foot let my machine be driven up barbacela queen of emmets is not used to contemptuous treatment she had no sooner spoken than her fiery chariot appeared in the air drawn by two snails and she was just going to step in when the prince reflected that now or never was the time to be possessed of the white mouse and quite forgetting his lawful princess nanhoa falling on his knees he implored forgiveness for having rashly rejected so much beauty this welltimed compliment instantly appeased the angry fairy she affected an hideous leer of approbation and taking the young prince by the hand conducted him to a neighboring church where they were married together in a moment as soon as the ceremony was performed the prince who was to the last degree desirous of seeing his favorite mouse reminded the bride of her promise to confess a truth my prince cried she i myself am that very white mouse you saw on your wedding night in the royal apartment i now therefore give you the choice whether you would have me a mouse by day and a woman by night or a mouse by night and a woman by day though the prince was an excellent casuist he was quite at a loss how to determine but at last thought it most prudent to have recourse to a blue cat that had followed him from his own dominions and frequently amused him with its conversation and assisted him with its advice in fact this cat was no other than the faithful princess nanhoa herself who had shared with him all his hardships in this disguise  by her instructions he was determined in his choice and returning to the old fairy prudently observed that as she must have been sensible he had married her only for the sake of what she had and not for her personal qualifications he thought it would for several reasons be most convenient if she continued a woman by day and appeared a mouse by night  the old fairy was a good deal mortified at her husbands want of gallantry though she was reluctantly obliged to comply the day was therefore spent in the most polite amusements the gentlemen talked smut the ladies laughed and were angry at last the happy night drew near the blue cat still stuck by the side of its master and even followed him to the bridal apartment barbacela entered the chamber wearing a train fifteen yards long supported by porcupines and all ever beset with jewels which served to render her more detestable she was just stepping into bed to the prince forgetting her promise when he insisted upon seeing her in the shape of a mouse she had promised and no fairy can break her word wherefore assuming the figure of the most beautiful mouse in the world she skipped and played about with an infinity of amusement the prince in an agony of rapture was desirous of seeing his pretty playfellow move a slow dance about the floor to his own singing he began to sing and the mouse immediately to perform with the most perfect knowledge of time and the finest grace and greatest gravity imaginable it only began for nanhoa who had long waited for the opportunity in the shape of a cat flew upon it instantly without remorse and eating it up in the hundredth part of a moment broke the charm and then resumed her natural figure  the prince now found that he had all along been under the power of enchantment that his passion for the white mouse was entirely fictitious and not the genuine complexion of his soul he now saw that his earnestness after mice was an illiberal amusement and much more becoming a ratcatcher than a prince all his meannesses now stared him in the face he begged the discreet princesss pardon an hundred times the princess very readily forgave him and both returning to their palace in bonbobbin lived very happily together and reigned many years with all that wisdom which by the story they appear to have been possessed of perfectly convinced by their former adventures that they who place their affections on trifles at first for amusement will find those trifles at last become their most serious concern  adieu letter xlix from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial acadamy at pekin in china ask an englishman what nation in the world enjoys most freedom and he immediately answers his own ask him in what that freedom principally consists and he is instantly silent this happy preeminence does not arise from the peoples enjoying a larger share in legislation than elsewhere for in this particular several states in europe excel them nor does it arise from a greater exemption from taxes for few countries pay more it does not proceed from their being restrained by fewer laws for no people are burdened with so many nor does it particularly consist in the security of their property for property is pretty well secured in every polite state of europe  how then are the english more free for more free they certainly are than the people of any other country or under any other form of government whatever their freedom consists in their enjoying all the advantages of democracy with this superior prerogative borrowed from monarchy that the severity of their laws may be relaxed without endangering the constitution  in a monarchical state in which the constitution is strongest the laws may be relaxed without danger for though the people should be unanimous in the breach of any one in particular yet still there is an effective power superior to the people capable of enforcing obedience whenever it may be proper to inculcate the law either toward the support or welfare of the community  but in all those governments where laws derive their sanction from the people alone transgressions cannot be overlooked without bringing the constitution into danger they who transgress the law in such a case are those who prescribe it by which means it loses not only its influence but its sanction in every republic the laws must be strong because the constitution is feeble they must resemble an asiatic husband who is justly jealous because he knows himself impotent thus in holland switzerland and genoa new laws are not frequently enacted but the old ones are observed with unremitting severity in such republics therefore the people are slaves to laws of their own making little less than in unmixed monarchies where they are slaves to the will of one subject to frailties like themselves  in england from a variety of happy accidents their constitution is just strong enough or if you will monarchical enough to permit a relaxation of the severity of laws and yet those laws still to remain sufficiently strong to govern the people this is the most perfect state of civil liberty of which we can form any idea here we see a greater number of laws than in any other country while the people at the same time obey only such as are immediately conducive to the interests of society several are unnoticed many unknown some kept to be revived and enforced upon proper occasions others left to grow obsolete even without the necessity of abrogation  scarce an englishman who does not almost every day of his life offend with impunity against some express law and for which in a certain conjuncture of circumstances he would not receive punishment gaming houses preaching at prohibited places assembled crowds nocturnal amusements public shows and an hundred other instances are forbid and frequented these prohibitions are useful though it be prudent in their magistrates and happy for their people that they are not enforced and none but the venal or mercenary attempt to enforce them  the law in this case like an indulgent parent still keeps the rod though the child is seldom corrected were those pardoned offenses to rise into enormity were they likely to obstruct the happiness of society or endanger the state it is then that justice would resume her terrors and punish those faults she had so often overlooked with indulgence it is to this ductility of the laws that an englishman owes the freedom he enjoys superior to others in a more popular government every step therefore the constitution takes toward a democratic form every diminution of the legal authority is in fact a diminution of the subjects freedom but every attempt to render the government more popular not only impairs natural liberty but even will at last dissolve the political constitution  every popular government seems calculated to last only for a time it grows rigid with age new laws are multiplying and the old continue in force the subjects are oppressed burdened with a multiplicity of legal injunctions there are none from whom to expect redress and nothing but a strong convulsion in the state can vindicate them into former liberty thus the people of rome a few great ones excepted found more real freedom under their emperors though tyrants than they had experienced in the old age of the commonwealth in which their laws were become numerous and painful in which new laws were every day enacting and the old ones executed with rigor they even refused to be reinstated in their former prerogatives upon an offer made them to this purpose for they actually found emperors the only means of softening the rigours of their constitution  the constitution of england is at present possessed of the strength of its native oak and the flexibility of the bending tamarisk but should the people at any time with a mistaken zeal pant after an imaginary freedom and fancy that abridging monarchy was increasing their privileges they would be very much mistaken since every jewel plucked from the crown of majesty would only be made use of as a bribe to corruption it might enrich the few who shared it among them but would in fact impoverish the public  as the roman senators by slow and imperceptible degrees became masters of the people yet still flattered them with a show of freedom while themselves only were free so is it possible for a body of men while they stand up for privileges to grow into an exuberance of power themselves and the public become actually dependent while some of its individuals only governed  if then my friend there should in this country ever be on the throne a king who through good nature or age should give up the smallest part of his prerogative to the people if there should come a minister of merit and popularity  but i have room for no more  adieu letter xlix to the same as i was yesterday seated at breakfast over a pensive dish of tea my meditations were interrupted by my old friend and companion who introduced a stranger dressed pretty much like himself the gentleman made several apologies for his visit begged of me to impute his intrusion to the sincerity of his respect and the warmth of his curiosity  as i am very suspicious of my company when i find them very civil without any apparent reason i answered the strangers caresses at first with reserve which my friend perceiving instantly let me into my visitants trade and character asking mr fudge whether he had lately published any thing new i now conjectured that my guest was no other than a bookseller and his answer confirmed my suspicions  excuse me sir says he it is not the season books have their time as well as cucumbers i would no more bring out a new work in summer than i would sell pork in the dog days nothing in my way goes off in summer except very light goods indeed a review a magazine or a sessions paper may amuse a summer reader but all our stock of value we reserve for a spring and winter trade i must confess sir says i a curiosity to know what you call a valuable stock which can only bear a winter perusal sir replied the bookseller it is not my way to cry up my own goods but without exaggeration i will venture to show with any of the trade my books at least have the peculiar advantage of being always new and it is my way to clear off my old to the trunkmakers every season i have ten new title pages now about me which only want books to be added to make them the finest things in nature others may pretend to direct the vulgar but that is not my way i always let the vulgar direct me wherever popular clamor arises i always echo the million for instance should the people in general say that such a man is a rogue i instantly give orders to set him down in print a villain thus every man buys the book not to learn new sentiments but to have the pleasure of seeing his own reflected but sir interrupted i you speak as if you yourself wrote the books you publish may i be so bold as to ask a sight of some of those intended publications which are shortly to surprise the world as to that sir replied the talkative bookseller i only draw out the plans myself and though i am very cautious of communicating them to any yet as in the end i have a favor to ask you shall see a few of them here sir here they are diamonds of the first water i assure you imprimis a translation of several medical precepts for the use of such physicians as do not understand latin item the young clergymans art of placing patches regularly with a dissertation on the different manner of smiling without distorting the face item the whole art of love made perfectly easy by a broker of change alley item the proper manner of cutting blacklead pencils and making crayons by the right hon the earl of  item the muster master general or the review of reviews   sir cried i interrupting him my curiosity with regard to title pages is satisfied i should be glad to see some longer manuscript an history or an epic poem  bless me cries the man of industry now you speak of an epic poem you shall see an excellent farce here it is dip into it where you will it will be found replete with true modern humor strokes sir it is filled with strokes of wit and satire in every line do you call these dashes of the pen strokes replied i for i must confess i can see no other and pray sir returned he what do you call them do you see any thing now adays that is not filled with strokes  and dashes  sir a well placed dash makes half the wit of our writers of modern humor i bought last season a piece that had no other merit upon earth than nine hundred and ninetyfive breaks seventytwo ha has three good things and a garter and yet it played off and bounced and cracked and made more sport than a fire work i fancy then sir you were a considerable gainer it must be owned the piece did pay but upon the whole i cannot much boast of last winters success i gained by two murders but then i lost by an ill timed charity sermon i was a considerable sufferer by my direct road to an estate but the infernal guide brought me up again ah sir that was a piece touched off by the hands of a master filled with good things from one end to the other the author had nothing but the jest in view no dull moral lurking beneath nor illnatured satire to sour the readers good humor he wisely considered that moral and humor at the same time were quite overdoing the business to what purpose was the book then published cried i sir the book was published in order to be sold and no book sold better except the criticisms upon it which came out soon after of all kinds of writing that goes off best at present and i generally fasten a criticism upon every selling book that is published  i once had an author who never left the least opening for the critics close was the word always very right and very dull ever on the safe side of an argument yet with all his qualifications incapable of coming into favor i soon perceived that his bent was for criticism and as he was good for nothing else supplied him with pens and paper and planted him at the beginning of every month as a censor on the works of others in short i found him a treasure no merit could escape him but what is most remarkable of all he ever wrote best and bitterest when drunk but are there not some works interrupted i that from the very manner of their composition must be exempt from criticism particularly such as profess to disregard its laws there is no work whatsoever but he can criticize replied the bookseller even though you wrote in chinese he would have a pluck at you suppose you should take it into your head to publish a book let it be a volume of chinese letters for instance write how you will he shall show the world you could have written better should you with the most local exactness stick to the manners and customs of the country from whence you come should you confine yourself to the narrow limits of eastern knowledge and be perfectly simple and perfectly natural he has then the strongest reason to exclaim he may with a sneer send you back to china for readers he may observe that after the first or second letter the iteration of the same simplicity is insupportably tedious but the worst of all is the public in such a case will anticipate his censures and leave you with all your uninstructive simplicity to be mauled at discretion  yes cried i but in order to avoid his indignation and what i should fear more that of the public i would in such a case write with all the knowledge i was master of as i am not possessed of much learning at least i would not suppress what little i had nor would i appear more stupid than nature made me here then cries the bookseller we should have you entirely in our power unnatural uneastern quite out of character erroneously sensible would be the whole cry sir we should then hunt you down like a rat head of my father said i sure there are but two ways the door must either be shut or it must be open i must either be natural or unnatural be what you will we shall criticize you returned the bookseller and prove you a dunce in spite of your teeth but sir it is time that i should come to business i have just now in the press an history of china and if you will but put your name to it as the author i shall repay the obligation with gratitude what sir replied i put my name to a work which i have not written never while i retain a proper respect for the public and myself the bluntness of my reply quite abated the ardour of the booksellers conversation and after about half an hours disagreeable reserve he with some ceremony took his leave and withdrew  adieu letter l to the same in all other countries my dear fum hoam the rich are distinguished by their dress in persia china and most parts of europe those who are possessed of much gold and silver put some of it upon their clothes but in england those who carry much upon their clothes are remarked for having but little in their pockets a tawdry outside is regarded as a badge of poverty and those who can sit at home and glote over their thousands in silent satisfaction are generally found to do it in plain clothes  this diversity of thinking from the rest of the world which prevails here i was first at a loss to account for but am since informed that it was introduced by an intercourse between them and their neighbors the french who whenever they came in order to pay those islanders a visit were generally very well dressed and very poor daubed with lace but all the gilding on the outside by this means laced clothes have been brought so much into contempt that at present even their mandarines are ashamed of finery  i must own myself a convert to english simplicity i am no more for oftentation of wealth than of learning the person who in company should pretend to be wiser than others i am apt to regard as illiterate and ill bred the person whose clothes are extremely fine i am too apt to consider as not being possessed of any superiority of fortune but resembling those indians who are found to wear all the gold they have in the world in a bob at the nose  i was lately introduced into a company of the best dressed men i have seen since my arrival upon entering the room i was struck with awe at the grandeur of the different dresses that personage thought i in blue and gold must be some emperors son that in green and silver a prince of the blood he in embroidered scarlet a prime minister all first rate noblemen i suppose and well looking noblemen too i sat for some time with that uneasiness with conscious inferiority produces in the ingenuous mind all attention to their discourse however i found their conversation more vulgar than i could have expected from personages of such distinction if these thought i to myself be princes they are the most stupid princes i have ever conversed with yet still i continued to venerate their dress for dress has a kind of mechanical influence on the mind  my friend in black indeed did not behave with the same deference but contradicted the finest of them all in the most peremptory tones of contempt but i had carce time to wonder at the imprudence of his conduct when i found occasion to be equally surprised at the absurdity of theirs for upon the entry of a middleaged man dressed in a cap dirty shirt and boots the whole circle seemed diminished of their former importance and contended who should be first to pay their obeisance to the stranger they somewhat resembled a circle of kalmucs offering incense to a bear  eager to know the cause of so much seeming contradiction i whispered my friend out of the room and found that the august company consisted of no other than a dancing master two fiddlers and a third rate actor all assembled in order to make a set at country dances as the middleaged gentleman whom i saw enter was a squire from the country and desirous of learning the new manner of footing and smoothing up the rudiments of his rural minuet  i was no longer surprised at the authority which my friend assumed among them nay was even displeased pardon my eastern education that he had not kicked every creature of them down stairs what said i shall a set of such paltry fellows dress themselves up like sons of kings and claim even the transitory respect of half an hour there should be some law to restrain so manifest a breach of privilege they should go from house to house as in china with the instruments of their profession strung round their necks by this means we might be able to distinguish and treat them in a style of becoming contempt hold my friend replied my companion were your reformation to take place as dancing masters and fiddlers now mimic gentlemen in appearance we should then find our fine gentlemen conforming to theirs a beau might be introduced to a lady of fashion with a fiddle case hanging at his neck by a red ribbon and instead of a cane might carry a fiddle stick though to be as dull as a first rate dancing master might be used with proverbial justice yet dull as he is many a fine gentleman sets him up as the proper standard of politeness copies not only the pert vivacity of his air but the flat insipidity of his conversation in short if you make a law against dancing masters imitating the fine gentleman you should with as much reason enact that no fine gentleman shall imitate the dancing master  after i had left my friend i made toward home reflecting as i went upon the difficulty of distinguishing men by their appearance invited however by the freshness of the evening i did not return directly but went to ruminate on what had passed in a public garden belonging to the city here as i sat upon one of the benches and felt the pleasing sympathy which nature in bloom inspires a disconsolate figure who sat on the other end of the feat seemed no way to enjoy the serenity of the season  his dress was miserable beyond description a threadbare coat of the rudest materials a shirt though clean yet extremely coarse hair that seemed to have been long unconscious of the comb and all the rest of his equipage impressed with the marks of genuine poverty  as he continued to sigh and testify every symptom of despair i was naturally led from a motive of humanity to offer comfort and assistance you know my heart and that all who are miserable may claim a place there the pensive stranger at first declined any conversation but at last perceiving a peculiarity in my accent and manner of thinking he began to unfold himself by degrees  i now found that he was not so very miserable as he at first appeared upon my offering him a small piece of money he refused my favor yet without appearing displeased at my intended generosity it is true he sometimes interrupted the conversation with a sigh and talked pathetically of neglected merit yet still i could perceive a serenity in his countenance that upon a closer inspection bespoke inward content  upon a pause in the conversation i was going to take my leave when he begged i would favor him with my company home to supper i was surprised at such a demand from a person of his appearance but willing to indulge curiosity i accepted his invitation and though i felt some repugnance at being seen with one who appeared so very wretched went along with seeming alacrity  still as he approached nearer home his good humor proportionably seemed to increase at last he stopped not at the gate of an hovel but of a magnificent palace when i cast my eyes upon all the sumptuous elegance which every where presented upon entering and then when i looked at my seeming miserable conductor i could scarce think that all this finery belonged to him yet in fact it did numerous servants ran through the apartments with silent assiduity several ladies of beauty and magnificently dressed came to welcome his return a most elegant supper was provided in short i found the person whom a little before i had sincerely pitied to be in reality a most refined epicure one who courted contempt abroad in order to feel with keener gust the pleasure of preeminence at home  adieu letter li from the same how often have we admired the eloquence of europe that strength of thinking that delicacy of imagination even beyond the efforts of the chinese themselves how were we enraptured with those bold figures which sent every sentiment with force to the heart how have we spent whole days together in learning those arts by which european writers got within the passions and led the reader as if by enchantment  but though we have learned most of the rhetorical figures of the last age yet there seems to be one or two of great use here which have not yet traveled to china the figures i mean are called bawdy and pertness none are more fashionable none so sure of admirers they are of such a nature that the merest blockhead by a proper use of them shall have the reputation of a wit they lie level to the meanest capacities and address those passions which all have or would be ashamed to disown  it has been observed and i believe with some truth that it is very difficult for a dunce to obtain the reputation of a wit yet by the assistance of the figure bawdy this may be easily effected and a bawdy blockhead often passes for a fellow of smart parts and pretensions every object in nature helps the jokes forward without scarce any effort of the imagination if a lady stands something very good may be said upon that if she happens to fall with the help of a little fashionable pruriency there are forty sly things ready on the occasion but a prurient jest has always been found to give most pleasure to a few very old gentlemen who being in some measure dead to other sensations feel the force of the allusion with double violence on the organs of risibility  an author who writes in this manner is generally sure therefore of having the very old and impotent among his admirers for these he may properly be said to write and from these he ought to expect his reward his works being often a very proper succedaneum to cantharides or an assafoetida pill his pen should be considered in the same light as the squirt of an apothecary both being directed at the same generous end  but though this manner of writing be perfectly adapted to the taste of gentlemen and ladies of fashion here yet still it deserves greater praise in being equally suited to the most vulgar apprehensions the very ladies and gentlemen of benin or cafraria are in this respect tolerably polite and might relish a prurient joke of this kind with critical propriety probably too with higher gust as they wear neither breeches nor petticoats to intercept the application  it is certain i never could have expected the ladies here biassed as they are by education capable at once of bravely throwing off their prejudices and not only applauding books in which this figure makes the only merit but even adopting it in their own conversation yet so it is the pretty innocents now carry those books openly in their hands which formerly were hid under the cushion they now lisp their double meanings with so much grace and talk over the raptures they bestow with such little reserve that i am sometimes reminded of a custom among the entertainers in china who think it a piece of necessary breeding to whet the appetites of their guests by letting them smell dinner in the kitchen before it is served up to table  the veneration we have for many things entirely proceeds from their being carefully concealed were the idolatrous tartar permitted to lift the veil which keeps his idol from view it might be a certain method to cure his future superstition with what a noble spirit of freedom therefore must that writer be possessed who bravely paints things as they are who lifts the veil of modesty who displays the most hidden recesses of the temple and shows the erring people that the object of their vows is either perhaps a mouse or a monkey  however though this figure be at present so much in fashion though the professors of it are so much caressed by the great those perfect judges of literary excellence yet it is confessed to be only a revival of what was once fashionable here before there was a time when by this very manner of writing the gentle tom durfey as i read in english authors acquired his great reputation and became the favorite of a king  the works of this original genius though they never traveled abroad to china and scarce have reached posterity at home were once found upon every fashionable toilet and made the subject of polite i mean very polite conversation  has your grace seen mr durfeys last new thing the oylet hole a most facetious piece sure my lord all the world must have seen it durfey is certainly the most comical creature alive it is impossible to read his things and live was there ever any thing so natural and pretty as when the squire and bridget meet in the cellar and then the difficulties they both find in broaching the beer barrel are so arch and so ingenious we have certainly nothing of this kind in the language in this manner they spoke then and in this manner they speak now for though the successor of durfey does not excel him in wit the world must confess he outdoes him in obscenity  there are several very dull fellows who by a few mechanical helps sometimes learn to become extremely brilliant and pleasing with a little dexterity in the management of the eyebrows fingers and nose by imitating a cat a sow and pigs by a loud laugh and a slap on the shoulder the most ignorant are furnished out for conversation but the writer finds it impossible to throw his winks his shrugs or his attitudes upon paper he may borrow some assistance indeed by printing his face at the title page but without wit to pass for a man of ingenuity no other mechanical help but downright obscenity will suffice by speaking to some peculiar sensations we are always sure of exciting laughter for the jest does not lie in the writer but in the subject  but bawdry is often helped on by another figure called pertness and few indeed are found to excel in one that are not possessed of the other  as in common conversation the best way to make the audience laugh is by first laughing yourself so in writing the properest manner is to show an attempt at humor which will pass upon most for humor in reality to effect this readers must be treated with the most perfect familiarity in one page the author is to make them a low bow and in the next to pull them by the nose he must talk in riddles and then send them to bed in order to dream for the solution he must speak of himself and his chapters and his manner and what he would be at and his own importance and his mothers importance with the most unpitying prolixity now and then testifying his contempt for all but himself smiling without a jest and without wit possessing vivacity  adieu letter lii from the same though naturally pensive yet i am fond of gay company and take every opportunity of thus dismissing the mind from duty from this motive i am often found in the center of a crowd and wherever pleasure is to be sold am always a purchaser in those places without being remarked by any i join in whatever goes forward work my passions into a similitude of frivolous earnestness shout as they shout and condemn as they happen to disapprove a mind thus sunk for a while below its natural standard is qualified for stronger flights as those first retire who would spring forward with greater vigor  attracted by the serenity of the evening my friend and i lately went to gaze upon the company in one of the public walks near the city here we sauntered together for some time either praising the beauty of such as were handsome or the dresses of such as had nothing else to recommend them we had gone thus deliberately forward for some time when stopping on a sudden my friend caught me by the elbow and led me out of the public walk i could perceive by the quickness of his pace and by his frequently looking behind that he was attempting to avoid somebody who followed we now turned to the right then to the left as we went forward he still went faster but in vain the person whom he attempted to escape hunted us through every doubling and gained upon us each moment so that at last we fairly stood still resolving to face what we could not avoid  our pursuer soon came up and joined us with all the familiarity of an old acquaintance my dear drybone cries he shaking my friends hand where have you been hiding this half a century positively i had fancied you were gone down to cultivate matrimony and your estate in the country during the reply i had an opportunity of surveying the appearance of our new companion his hat was pinched up with peculiar smartness his looks were pale thin and sharp round his neck he wore a broad black ribbon and in his bosom a buckle studded with glass his coat was trimmed with tarnished twist he wore by his side a sword with a black hilt and his stockings of silk though newly washed were grown yellow by long service i was so much engaged with the peculiarity of his dress that i attended only to the latter part of my friends reply in which he complimented mr tibbs on the taste of his clothes and the bloom in his countenance psha psha will cried the figure no more of that if you love me you know i hate flattery on my soul i do and yet to be sure an intimacy with the great will improve ones appearance and a course of venison will fatten and yet faith i despise the great as much as you do but there are a great many damned honest fellows among them and we must not quarrel with one half because the other wants weeding if they were all such as my lord mudler one of the most goodnatured creatures that ever squeezed a lemon i should myself be among the number of their admirers i was yesterday to dine at the duchess of piccadillys my lord was there ned says he to me ned says he i will hold gold to silver i can tell where you were poaching last night poaching my lord says i faith you have missed already for i staid at home and let the girls poach for me that is my way i take a fine woman as some animals do their prey stand still and swoop they fall into my mouth  ah tibbs thou art an happy fellow cried my companion with looks of infinite pity i hope your fortune is as much improved as your understanding in such company improved replied the other you shall know  but let it go no further  a great secret  five hundred a year to begin with  my lords word of honor for it  his lordship took me down in his own chariot yesterday and we had a teteatete dinner in the country where we talked of nothing else i fancy you forget sir cried i you told us but this moment of your dining yesterday in town did i say so replied he cooly to be sure if i said so it was so  dined in town egad now i do remember i did dine in town but i dined in the country too for you must know my boys i eat two dinners by the bye i am grown as nice as the devil in my eating i will tell you a pleasant affair about that we were a select party of us to dine at lady grograms an affected piece but let it go no farther a secret well there happened to be no assafoetida in the sauce to a turkey upon which says i i will hold a thousand guineas and say done first that  but dear dry bone you are an honest creature lend me half acrown for a minute or two or so just till  but hearkee ask me for it the next time we meet or it may be twenty to one but i forget to pay you  when he left us our conversation naturally turned upon so extraordinary a character his very dress cries my friend is not less extraordinary than his conduct if you meet him this day you find him in rags if the next in embroidery with those persons of distinction of whom he talks so familiarly he has scarce a coffeehouse acquaintance however both for interests of society and perhaps for his own heaven has made him poor and while all the world perceive his wants he fancies them concealed from every eye an agreeable companion because he understands flattery and all must be pleased with the first part of his conversation though all are sure of its ending with a demand on their purse while his youth countenances the levity of his conduct he may thus earn a precarious subsistence but when age comes on the gravity of which is incompatible with buffoonery then will he find himself forsaken by all condemned in the decline of life to hang upon some rich family whom he once despised there to undergo all the ingenuity of studied contempt to be employed only as a spy upon the servants or a bugbear to fright the children into obedience  adieu letter liii to the same i am apt to fancy i have contracted a new acquaintance whom it will be no easy matter to shake off my little beau yesterday overtook me again in one of the public walks and slapping me on the shoulder saluted me with an air of the most perfect familiarity his dress was the same as usual except that he had more powder in his hair wore a dirtier shirt a pair of temple spectacles and his hat under his arm  as i knew him to be an harmless amusing little thing i could not return his smiles with any degree of severity so we walked forward on terms of the utmost intimacy and in a few minutes discussed all the usual topics preliminary to particular conversation  the oddities that marked his character however soon began to appear he bowed to several well dressed persons who by their manner of returning the compliment appeared perfect strangers at intervals he drew out a pocket book seeming to take memorandums before all the company with much importance and assiduity in this manner he led me through the length of the whole walk fretting at his absurdities and fancying myself laughed at not less than him by every spectator  when we were got to the end of our procession blast me cries he with an air of vivacity i never saw the park so thin in my life before there is no company at all to day not a single face to be seen no company interrupted i peevishly no company where there is such a crowd why man there is too much what are the thousand that have been laughing at us but company lord my dear returned he with the utmost good humor you seem immensely chagrined but blast me when the world laughs at me i laugh at the world and so we are even my lord trip bill squash the creolian and i sometimes make a party at being ridiculous and so we say and do a thousand things for the joke sake but i see you are grave and if you are for a fine grave sentimental companion you shall dine with me and my wife to day i must insist on it i will introduce you to mrs tibbs a lady of as elegant qualifications as any in nature she was bred but that is between ourselves under the inspection of the countess of allnight a charming body of voice but no more of that she shall give us a song you shall see my little girl too carolina wilhelmina amelia tibbs a sweet pretty creature i design her for my lord drumsticks eldest son but that is in friendship let it go no farther she is but six years old and yet she walks a minuet and plays on the guittar immensely already i intend she shall be as perfect as possible in every accomplishment in the first place i will make her a scholar i will teach her greek myself and learn that language purposely to instruct her but let that be a secret  thus saying without waiting for a reply he took me by the arm and hauled me along we passed through many dark alleys and winding ways for from some motives to me unknown he seemed to have a particular aversion to every frequented street at last however we got to the door of a dismal looking house in the outlets of the town where he informed me he chose to reside for the benefit of the air  we entered the lower door which ever seemed to lie most hospitably open and i began to ascend an old and creaking staircase when as he mounted to show me the way he demanded whether i delighted in prospects to which answering in the affirmative then says he i shall show you one of the most charming in the world out of my windows we shall see the ships sailing and the whole country for twenty miles round tip top quite high my lord swamp would give ten thousand guineas for such a one but as i sometimes pleasantly tell him i always love to keep my prospects at home that my friends may see me the oftener  by this time we were arrived as high as the stairs would permit us to ascend till we came to what he was facetiously pleased to call the first floor down the chimney and knocking at the door a voice from within demanded who is there my conductor answered that it was him but this not satisfying the querist the voice again repeated the demand to which he answered louder than before and now the door was opened by an old woman with cautious reluctance  when we were got in he welcomed me to his house with great ceremony and turning to the old woman asked where was her lady good troth replied she in a peculiar dialect she is washing your two shirts at the next door because they have taken an oath against lending out the tub any longer my two shirts cries he in a tone that faultered with confusion what does the idiot mean i ken what i mean well enough replied the other she is washing your two shirts at the next door because   fire and fury no more of thy stupid explanations cried he  go and inform her we have got company were that scotch hag to be for ever in my family she would never learn politeness nor forget that absurd poisonous accent of hers or testify the smallest specimen of breeding or high life and yet it is very surprising too as i had her from a parliament man a friend of mine from the highlands one of the politest men in the world but that is a secret  we waited some time for mrs tibbss arrival during which interval i had a full opportunity of surveying the chamber and all its furniture which consisted of four chairs with old wrought bottoms that he assured me were his wifes embroidery a square table that had been once japanned a cradle in one corner a lumbering cabinet in the other a broken shepherdess and a mandarine without an head were stuck over the chimney and round the walls several paltry unframed pictures which he observed were all his own drawing what do you think sir of that head in the corner done in the manner of grisoni there is the true keeping in it its my own face and though there happens to be no likeness a countess offered me an hundred for its fellow i refused her for hang it that would be mechanical you know  the wife at last made her appearance at once a slattern and a coquet much emaciated but still carrying the remains of beauty she made twenty apologies for being seen in such an odious dishabille but hoped to be excused as she had staid out all night at the gardens with the countess who was excessively fond of the horns and indeed my dear added she turning to her husband his lordship drank your health in a bumper poor jack cries he a dear goodnatured creature i know he loves me but i hope my dear you have given orders for dinner you need make no great preparations neither there are but three of us something elegant and little will do a turbot an ortolan or a  or what do you think my dear interrupts the wife of a nice pretty bit of ox cheek piping hot and dressed with a little of my own sauce  the very thing replies he it will eat best with some smart bottled beer but be sure to let us have the sauce his grace was so fond of i hate your immense loads of meat that is country all over extreme disgusting to those who are in the least acquainted with high life  by this time my curiosity began to abate and my appetite to increase the company of fools may at first make us smile but at last never fails of rendering us melancholy i therefore pretended to recollect a prior engagement and after having shown my respect to the house according to the fashion of the english by giving the old servant a piece of money at the door i took my leave mr tibbs assuring me that dinner if i staid would be ready at least in less than two hours  letter live from fum hoam to altangi the discontented wanderer the distant sounds of music that catch new sweetness as they vibrate through the long drawn valley are not more pleasing to the ear than the tidings of a far distant friend  i have just received two hundred of thy letters by the russian carravan descriptive of the manners of europe you have left it to geographers to determine the site of their mountains and extent of their lakes seeming only employed in discovering the genius the government and disposition of the people  in those letters i perceive a journal of the operations of your mind upon whatever occurs rather than a detail of your travels from one building to another of your taking a draught of this ruin or that obelisk of paying so many tomans for this commodity or laying up a proper store for the passage of some new wilderness  from your accounts of russia i learn that this nation is again relaxing into pristine barbarity that its great emperor wanted a life of an hundred years more to bring about his vast design a savage people may be resembled to their own forests a few years are sufficient to clear away the obstructions to agriculture but it requires many ere the ground acquires a proper degree of fertility the russians attached to their ancient prejudices again renew their hatred to strangers and indulge every former brutal excess so true it is that the revolutions of wisdom are slow and difficult the revolutions of folly or ambition precipitate and easy we are not to be astonished says confucius though this fine maxim be not found in the latin edition of of the morals of confuciu yet we find it ascribed to him by le comte etat present de  chine vol i p      that the wise walk more slowly in their road to virtue than fools in their passage to vice since passion drags us along while wisdom only points out the way  the german empire that remnant of the majesty of ancient rome appears from your accounts on the eve of dissolution the members of its vast body want every tie of government to unite them and seem feebly held together only by their respect for an ancient institution the very name of country and countrymen which in other nations makes one of the strongest bonds of government has been here for some time laid aside each of its inhabitants seeming more proud of being called from the petty state which gives him birth than by the more well known title of german  this government may be regarded in the light of a severe master and a feeble opponent the states which are now subject to the laws of the empire are only watching a proper occasion to fling off the yoke and those which are become too powerful to be compelled to obedience now begin to think of dictating in their turn the struggles in this state are therefore not in order to preserve but to destroy the ancient constitution if one side succeeds the government must become despotic if the other several states will subsist without even nominal subordination but in either case the germanic constitution will be no more  sweden on the contrary though now seemingly a strenuous assertor of its liberties is probably only hastening on to despotism their senators while they pretend to vindicate the freedom of the people are only establishing their own independance the deluded people will however at last perceive the miseries of an aristocratical government they will perceive that the administration of a society of men is ever more painful than that of one only they will fly from this most oppressive of all forms where one single member is capable of controlling the whole to take refuge under the throne which will ever be attentive to their complaints no people long endure an aristocratical government when they could apply elsewhere for redress the lower orders of people may be enslaved for a time by a number of tyrants but upon the first opportunity they will ever take a refuge in despotism or democracy  as the swedes are making concealed approaches to despotism the french on the other hand are imperceptibly vindicating themselves into freedom when i consider that those parliaments the members of which are all created by the court the presidents of which can act only by immediate direction presume even to mention privileges and freedom who till of late received directions from the throne with implicit humility when this is considered i cannot help fancying that the genius of freedom has entered that kingdom in disguise if they have but three weak monarchs more successively on the throne the mask will be laid aside and the country will certainly once more be free  when i compare the figure which the dutch make in europe with that they assume in asia i am struck with surprise in asia i find them the great lords of all the indian seas in europe the timid inhabitants of a paltry state no longer the sons of freedom but of avarice no longer assertors of their rights by courage but by negotiations fawning on those who insult them and crouching under the rod of every neighboring power without a friend to save them in distress and without virtue to save themselves their government is poor and their private wealth will serve but to invite some neighboring invader  i long with impatience for your letters from england denmark holland and italy yet why wish for relations which only describe new calamities which show that ambition and avarice are equally terrible in every region  adieu letter lv from lien chi altangi to fum hoam first president of the ceremonial academy at pekin in china i have frequently admired the manner of criticizing in china where the learned are assembled in a body to judge of every new publication to examine the merits of the work without knowing the circumstances of the author and then to usher it into the world with the proper marks of respect or reprobation  in england there are no such tribunals erected but if a man thinks proper to be a judge of genius few will be at the pains to contradict his pretensions if any choose to be critics it is but saying they are critics and from that time forward they became invested with full power and authority over every caitiff who aims at their instruction or entertainment  as almost every member of society has by this means a vote in literary transactions it is no way surprising to find the rich leading the way here as in other common concerns of life to see them either bribing the numerous herd of voters by their interest or browbeating them by their authority  a great man says at his table that such a book is no bad thing immediately the praise is carried off by five flatterers to be dispersed at twelve different coffeehouses from whence it circulates still improving as it proceeds through fortyfive houses where cheaper liquors are sold from thence it is carried away by the honest tradesman to his own fireside where the applause is eagerly caught up by his wife and children who have been long taught to regard his judgment as the standard of perfection thus when we have traced a wide extended literary reputation up to its original source we shall find it derived from some great man who has perhaps received all his education and english from a tutor of berne or a dancing master of picardie  the english are a people of good sense and i am the more surprised to find them swayed in their opinions by men who often from their very education are incompetent judges men who being always bred in affluence see the world only on one side are surely improper judges of human nature they may indeed describe a ceremony a pageant or a ball but how can they pretend to dive into the secrets of the human heart who have been nursed up only in forms and daily behold nothing but the same insipid adulation smiling upon every face few of them have been bred in that best of schools the school of adversity and by what i can learn fewer still have been bred in any school at all  from such a description one would think that a droning duke or a dowager duchess was not possessed of more just pretensions to taste than persons of less quality and yet whatever the one or the other may write or praise shall pass for perfection without farther examination a nobleman has but to take pen ink and paper and write away through three large volumes and then sign his name to the title page though the whole might have been before more disgusting than his own rentroll yet signing his name and title gives value to the deed title being alone equivalent to taste imagination and genius  as soon as a piece therefore is published the first questions are who is the author does he keep a coach where lies his estate what sort of a table does he keep if he happens to be poor and unqualified for such a scrutiny he and his works sink into irremediable obscurity and too late he finds that having fed upon turtle is a more ready way to same than having digested tully  the poor devil against whom fashion has set its ace vainly alleges that he has been bred in every part of europe where knowledge was to be sold that he has grown pale in the study of nature and himself his works may please upon the perusal but his pretensions to fame are entirely disregarded he is treated like a fiddler whose music though liked is not much praised because he lives by it while a gentleman performer though the most wretched scraper alive throws the audience into raptures the fiddler indeed may in such a case console himself by thinking that while the other goes off with all the praise he runs away with all the money but here the parallel drops for while the nobleman triumphs in unmerited applause the author by profession steals off with  nothing  the poor therefore here who draw their pens auxiliary to the laws of their country must think themselves very happy if they find not fame but forgiveness and yet they are hardly treated for as every country grows more polite the press becomes more useful and writers become more necessary as readers are supposed to increase in a polished society that man though in rags who has the power of enforcing virtue from the press is of more real use than forty stupid brachmans or bonzes or guebres though they preached never so often never so loud or never so long that man though in rags who is capable of deceiving even indolence into wisdom and who professes amusement while he aims at reformation is more useful in refined society than twenty cardinals with all their scarlet and tricked out in all the fopperies of scholastic finery  letter lvi to the same as the man in black takes every opportunity of introducing me to such company as may serve to indulge my speculative temper or gratify my curiosity i was by his influence lately invited to a visitation dinner to understand this term you must know that it was formerly the custom here for the principal priests to go about the country once a year and examine upon the spot whether those of subordinate orders did their duty or were qualified for the task whether their temples were kept in proper repair or the laity pleased with their administration  though a visitation of this nature was very useful yet it was found to be extremely trouble ome and for many reasons utterly inconvenient for as the principal priests were obliged to attend at court in order to solicit preferment it was impossible they could at the same time attend in the country which was quite out of the road to promotion if we add to this the gout which has been time immemorial a clerical disorder here together with the bad wine and ill dressed provisions that must infallibly be served up by the way it was not strange that the custom has been long discontinued at present therefore every head of the church instead of going about to visit his priests is satisfied if his priests come in a body once a year to visit him by this means the duty of half a year is dispatched in a day when assembled he asks each in his turn how they have behaved and are liked upon which those who have neglected their duty or are disagreeable to their congregation no doubt accuse themselves and tell him all their faults for which he reprimands them most severely  the thoughts of being introduced into a company of philosophers and learned men for as such i conceived them gave me no small pleasure i expected our entertainment would resemble those sentimental banquets so finely described by xenophon and plato i was hoping some socrates would be brought in from the door in order to harangue upon divine love but as for eating and drinking i had prepared myself to be disappointed in that particular i was apprized that fasting and temperance were tenets strongly recommended to the professors of christianity and i had seen the frugality and mortification of the priests of the east so that i expected an entertainment where we should have much reasoning and little meat  upon being introduced i confess i found no great signs of mortification in the faces or persons of the company however i imputed their florid looks to temperance and their corpulency to a sedentary way of living i saw several preparations indeed for dinner but none for philosophy the company seemed to gaze upon the table with silent expectation but this i easily excused men of wisdom thought i are ever slow of speech they deliver nothing unadvisedly silence says confucius is a friend that will never betray they are now probably inventing maxims or hard sayings for their mutual instruction when some one shall think proper to begin  my curiosity was now wrought up to the highest pitch i impatiently looked round to see if any were going to interrupt the mighty pause when at last one of the company declared that there was a sow in his neighborhood that farrowed fifteen pigs at a litter this i thought a very preposterous beginning but just as another was going to second the remark dinner was served which interrupted the conversation for that time  the appearance of dinner which consisted of a variety of dishes seemed to diffuse new cheerfulness upon every face so that i now expected the philosophical conversation to begin as they improved in good humor the principal priest however opened his mouth with only observing that the venison had not been kept enough though he had given strict orders for having it killed ten days before i fear continued he it will be found to want the true beathy flavor you will find nothing of the original wildness in it a priest who sat next him having smelt it and wiped his nose ah my good lord cries he you are too modest it is perfectly fine every body knows that no body understands keeping venison with your lordship ay and partridges too interrupted another i never find them right any where else his lordship was going to reply when a third took off the attention of the company by recommending the pig as inimitable i fancy my lord continues he it has been smothered in its own blood if it has been smothered in its blood cried a facetious member helping himself well now smother it in egg sauce this poignant piece of humor produced a long loud laugh which the facetious brother observing and now that he was in luck willing to second his blow assured the company he would tell them a good story about that as good a story cries he bursting into a violent fit of laughter himself as ever you heard in your lives there was a farmer of my parish who used to sup upon wild ducks and flummery so this farmer  doctor marrowfat cries his lordship interrupting him give me leave to drink your health  so being fond of wild ducks and flummery  doctor adds a gentleman who sat next him let me advise you to a wing of this turkey  so this farmer being fond  hob nob doctor which do you choose white or red  so being fond of wild ducks and flummery  take care of your band sir it may dip in the gravy the doctor now looking round found not a single eye disposed to listen wherefore calling for a glass of wine he gulped down the disappointment and the tale in a bumper  the conversation now began to be little more than a rhapsody of exclamations as each had pretty well satisfied his own appetite he now found sufficient time to press others excellent the very thing let me recommend the pig do but taste the bacon never eat a better thing in my life exquisite delicious this edifying discourse continued through three courses which lasted as many hours till every one of the company were unable to swallow or utter any thing more  it is very natural for men who are abridged in one excess to break into some other the clergy here particularly those who are advanced in years think if they are abstemious with regard to women and wine they may indulge their other appetites without censure thus some are found to rise in the morning only to a consultation with their cook about dinner and when that has been swallowed make no other use of their faculties if they have any but to ruminate on the succeeding meal  a debauch in wine is even more pardonable than this since one glass insensibly leads on to another and instead of sateing whets the appetite the progressive steps to it are cheerful and seducing the grave are animated the melancholy relieved and there is even classic authority to countenance the excess but in eating after nature is once satisfied every additional morsel brings stupidity and distempers with it and as one of their own poets expresses it the soul subsides and wickedly inclines to seem but mortal even in sound divines   let me suppose after such a meal as this i have been describing while all the company are sitting in lethargic silence round the table grunting under a load of soup pig pork and bacon let me suppose i say some hungry beggar with looks of want peeping through one of the windows and thus addressing the assembly prithee pluck those napkins from your chins after nature is satisfied all that you  extraordinary is my property and i claim it as mine it was given you in order to relieve me and not to oppress yourselves how can they comfort or instruct others who can scarce feel their own existence except from the unsavory returns of an ill digested meal but though neither you nor the cushions you sit upon will hear me yet the world regards the excesses of its teachers with a prying eye and notes their conduct with double severity i know no other answer any one of the company could make to such an expostulation but this friend you talk of our losing a character and being disliked by the world well and supposing all this to be true what then who cares for the world well preach for the world and the world shall pay us for preaching whether we like each other or not  letter lvii from hingpo to lien chi altangi by the way of moscow you will probably be pleased to see my letter dated from terki a city which lies beyond the bounds of the persian empire here blessed with security with all that is dear i double my raptures by communicating them to you the mind sympathizing with the freedom of the body my whole soul is dilated in gratitude love and praise  yet were my own happiness all that inspired my present joy my raptures might justly merit the imputation of selfinterest but when i think that the beautiful zelis is also free forgive my triumph when i boast of having rescued from captivity the most deserving object upon earth  you remember the reluctance she testified at being obliged to marry the tyrant she hated her compliance at last was only feigned in order to gain time to try some future means of escape during the interval between her promise and the intended performance of it she came undiscovered one evening to the place where i generally retired after the fatigues of the day her appearance was like that of an aerial genius when it descends to minister comfort to undeserved distress the mild luster of her eye served to banish my timidity her accents were sweeter than the echo of some distant symphony unhappy stranger said she in the persian language you here perceive one more wretched than thyself all this solemnity of preparation this elegance of dress and the number of my attendants serve but to increase my miseries if you have courage to rescue an unhappy woman from approaching ruin and our detested tyrant you may depend upon my uture gratitude i bowed to the ground and she left me filled with rapture and astonishment night brought no rest nor could the ensuing morning calm the anxieties of my mind i projected a thousand methods for her delivery but each when strictly examined appeared impracticable in this uncertainty the evening again arrived and i placed myself on my former station in hopes of a repeated visit after some short expectation the bright perfection again appeared i bowed as before to the ground when raising me up she observed that the time was not to be spent in useless ceremony she observed that the day following was appointed for the celebration of her nuptials and that something was to be done that very night for our mutual deliverance i offered with the utmost humility to pursue whatever scheme she should direct upon which she proposed that instant to scale the garden wall adding that she had prevailed upon a female slave who was now waiting at the appointed place to assist her with a ladder  pursuant to this information i led her trembling to the place appointed but instead of the slave we expected to see mostadad himself was there awaiting our arrival the wretch in whom we confided it seems had betrayed our design to her master and he now saw the most convincing proofs of her information he was just going to draw his sabre when a principle of avarice repressed his fury and he resolved after a severe chastisement to dispose of me to another master in the mean time ordering me to be confined in the stricteit manner and the next day to receive an hundred blows on the soles of my feet  when the morning came i was led out in order to receive the punishment which from the severity with which it is generally inflicted upon slaves is worse even than death  a trumpet was to be a signal for the solemnization of the nuptials of zelis and for the infliction of my punishment each ceremony to me equally dreadful was just going to begin when we were informed that a large party of circassian tartars had invaded the town and were laying all in ruin every person now thought of saving himself i instantly unloosed the cords with which i was bound and seizing a scymetar from one of the slaves who had not courage to resist me flew to the womens apartment where zelis was confined dressed out for the intended nuptials i bade her follow me without delay and going forward cut my way through eunuchs who made but a faint resistance the whole city was now a scene of conflagration and terror every person was willing to save himself unmindful of others in this confusion seizing upon two of the fleetest coursers in the stables of mostadad we fled northward toward the kingdom of circassia as there were several others flying in the same manner we passed without notice and in three days arrived at terki a city that lies in a valley within the bosom of the owning mountains of caucasus  here free from every apprehension of danger we enjoy all those satisfactions which are consistent with virtue though i find my heart at intervals give way to unusual passions yet such is my admiration for my fair companion that i lose even tenderness in distant respect though her person demands particular regard even among the beauties of circassia yet is her mind far more lovely how very different is a woman who thus has cultivated her understanding and been refined into delicacy of sentiment from the daughters of the east whose education is only formed to improve the person and make them more tempting objects of prostitution  adieu letter lvii from hingpo to lien chi altangi by way of moscow when sufficiently refreshed after the fatigues of our precipitate flight my curiosity which had been restrained by the appearance of immediate danger now began to revive i longed to know by what distressful accidents my fair fugitive became a captive and could not avoid testifying a surprise how so much beauty could be involved in the calamities from whence she had been so lately rescued  talk not of personal charms cried she with emotion since to them i owe every misfortune look round on the numberless beauties of the country where we are and see how nature has poured its charms upon every face and yet by this profusion heaven would seem to show how little it regards such a blessing since the gift is lavished upon a nation of prostitutes  i perceive you desire to know my story and your curiosity is not so great as my impatience to gratify it i find a pleasure in telling past misfortunes to any but when my deliverer is pleased with the relation my pleasure is prompted by duty  i this story bears a striking similitude to the real history of miss sd who accompanied lady we in her retreat near florence and which the editor had from her own mouth was born in a country far to the west where the men are braver and the women more fair than those of circassia where the valor of the hero is guided by wisdom and where delicacy of sentiment points the shafts of female beauty i was the only daughter of an officer in the army the child of his age and as he used fondly to express it the only chain that bound him to the world or made his life pleasing his station procured him an acquaintance with men of greater rank and fortune than himself and his regard for me induced him to bring me into every family where he was acquainted thus i was early taught all the elegancies and fashionable foibles of such as the world calls polite and though without fortune myself was taught to despise those who lived as if they were poor  my intercourse with the great and my affectation of grandeur procured me many lovers but want of fortune deterred them all from any other views than those of passing the present moment agreeably or of meditating my future ruin in every company i found myself addressed in a warmer strain of passion than other ladies who were superior in point of rank and beauty and this i imputed to an excess of respect which in reality proceeded from very different motives  among the number of such as paid me their addresses was a gentleman a friend of my father rather in the decline of life with nothing remarkable either in his person or address to recommend him his age which was about forty his fortune which was moderate and barely sufficient to support him served to throw me off my guard so that i considered him as the only sincere admirer i had  designing lovers in the decline of life are ever most dangerous skilled in all the weaknesses of the sex they seize each favorable opportunity and by having less passion than youthful admirers have less real respect and therefore less timidity this insidious wretch used a thousand arts to succeed in his base designs all which i saw but imputed to different views because i thought it absurd to believe the real motives  as he continued to frequent my fathers the friendship between them became every day greater and at last from the intimacy with which he was received i was taught to look upon him as a guardian and a friend though i never loved yet i esteemed him and this was enough to make me wish for an union for which he seemed desirous but to which he feigned several delays while in the mean time from a false report of our being married every other admirer forsook me  i was at last however awakened from the delusion by an account of his being just married to another young lady with a considerable fortune this was no great mortification to me as i had always regarded him merely from prudential motives but it had a very different effect upon my father who rash and passionate by nature and besides stimulated by a mistaken notion of military honor upbraided his friend in such terms that a challenge was soon given and accepted  it was about midnight when i was awakened by a message from my father who desired to see me that moment i rose with some surprise and following the messenger attended only by another servant came to a field not far from the house where i found him the assertor of my honor my only friend and supporter the tutor and companion of my youth lying on one side covered over with blood and just expiring no tears streamed down my cheeks nor sigh escaped from my breast at an object of such terror i sat down and supporting his aged head in my lap gazed upon the ghastly visage with an agony more poignant even than despairing madness the servants were gone for more assistance in this gloomy stillness of the night no sounds were heard but his agonizing respirations no object was presented but his wounds which still continued to stream with silent anguish i hung over his dear face and with my hands strove to stop the blood as it flowed from his wounds he seemed at first insensible but at last turning his dying eyes upon me  my dear dear child cried he dear though you have forgotten your own honor and stained mine i will yet forgive you by abandoning virtue you have undone me and yourself yet take my forgiveness with the same compassion i wish heaven may pity me he expired all my succeeding happiness fled with him reflecting that i was the cause of his death whom only i loved upon earth accused of betraying the honor of his family with his latest breath conscious of my own innocence yet without even a possibility of vindicating it without fortune or friends to relieve or pity me abandoned to infamy and the wide censuring world i called out upon the dead body that lay stretched before me and in the agony of my heart asked why he could have left me thus why my dear my only pappa why could you ruin me thus and yourself for ever o pity and return since there is none but you to comfort me  i soon found that i had real cause for sorrow that i was to expect no compassion from my own sex not assistance from the other and that reputation was much more useful in our commerce with mankind than really to deserve it wherever i came i perceived myself received either with contempt or detestation or whenever i was civilly treated it was from the most base and ungenerous motives  thus driven from the society of the virtuous i was at last in order to dispell the anxieties of insupportable solitude obliged to take up with the company of those whose characters were blasted like my own but who perhaps deserved their infamy among this number was a lady of the first distinction whose character the public thought proper to brand even with greater infamy than mine a similitude of distress soon united us i knew that general reproach had made her miserable and i had learned to regard misery as an excuse for guilt though this lady had not virtue enough to avoid reproach yet she had too much delicate sensibility not to feel it she therefore proposed our leaving the country where we were born and going to live in italy where our characters and misfortunes would be unknown with this i eagerly complied and we soon found ourselves in one of the most charming retreats in the most beautiful province of that enchanting country  had my companion chosen this as a retreat for injured virtue an harbor where we might look with tranquillity on the distant angry world i should have been happy but very different was her design she had pitched upon this situation only to enjoy those pleasures in private which she had not sufficient effrontery to satisfy in a more open manner a nearer acquaintance soon showed me the vicious part of her character her mind as well as her body seemed formed only for pleasure she was sentimental only as it served to protract the immediate enjoyment formed for society alone she spoke infinitely better than she wrote and wrote infinitely better than she lived a person devoted to pleasure often leads the most miserable life imaginable such was her case she considered the natural moments of languor as insupportable passed all her hours between rapture and anxiety ever in an extreme of agony or of bliss she felt a pain as sincere for want of appetite as the starving wretch who wants a meal in those intervals she usually kept her bed and rose only when in expectation of some new enjoyment the luxuriant air of the country the romantic situation of her palace and the genius of a people whose only happiness lies in sensual refinement all contributed to banish the remembrance of her native country  but though such a life gave her pleasure it had a very different effect upon me i grew every day more pensive and my melancholy was regarded as an insult upon her good humor i now perceived myself entirely unfit for all society discarded from the good and detesting the infamous i seemed in a state of war with every rank of people that virtue which should have been my protection in the world was here my crime in short detesting life i was determined to become a recluse to leave a world where i found no pleasure that could allure me to stay thus determined i am embarked in order to go by sea to rome where i intend to take the veil but even in so short a passage my hard fortune still attended me our ship was taken by a barbary corsair the whole crew and i among the number being made slaves it carries too much the air of romance to inform you of my distresses or obstinacy in this miserable state it is enough to observe that i have been bought by several masters each of whom perceiving my reluctance rather than use violence sold me to another till it was my happiness to be at last rescued by you  thus ended her relation which i have abridgd but as soon as we are arrived at moscow for which we intend to set out shortly you shall be informed of all more particularly in the mean time the greatest addition to my happiness will to be to hear of yours  adieu letter lviii from lien chi altangi to hingpo the news of your freedom lifts the load of former anxiety from my mind i can now think of my son without regret applaud his resignation under calamity and his conduct in extricating himself from it  you are now free just let loose from the bondage of an hard master this is the crisis of your fate and as you now manage fortune succeeding life will be marked with happiness or misery a few years perseverance in prudence which at your age is but another name for virtue will ensure comfort pleasure tranquillity esteem too eager an enjoyment of every good that now offers will reverse the medal and present you poverty anxiety remorse contempt  as it has been observed that none are better qualified to give others advice than those who have taken the least of it themselves so in this respect i find myself perfectly authorized to offer mine even though i should wave my paternal authority upon this occasion  the most usual way among young men who have no resolution of their own is first to ask one friends advice and follow it for some time then to ask advice of another and turn to that so of a third still unsteady always changing however be assured that every change of this nature is for the worse people may tell you of your being unfit for some peculiar occupations in life but heed them not whatever employment you follow with perseverance and assiduity will be found fit for you it will be your support in youth and comfort in age in learning the useful part of every profession very moderate abilities will suffice even if the mind be a little balanced with stupidity it may in this case be useful great abilities have always been less serviceable to the possessors than moderate ones life has been compared to a race but the allusion still improves by observing that the most swift are ever the least manageable  to know one profession only is enough for one man to know and this whatever the professors may tell you to the contrary is soon learned be contented therefore with one good employment for if you understand two at a time people will give you business in neither  a conjurer and a tailor once happened to converse together alas cries the tailor what an unhappy poor creature am i if people should ever take it in their heads to live without clothes i am undone i have no other trade to have recourse to indeed friend i pity you sincerely replies the conjurer but thank heaven things are not quite so bad with me for if one trick should fail i have a hundred tricks more for them yet however if at any time you are reduced to beggary apply to me and i will relieve you a famine over spread the land the tailor made a shift to live because his customers could not be without clothes but the poor conjurer with all his hundred tricks could find none that had money to throw away it was in vain that he promised to eat fire or to vomit pins no single creature would relieve him till he was at last obliged to beg from the very tailor whose calling he had formerly despised  there are no obstructions more fatal to fortune than pride and resentment if you must resent injuries at all at least suppress your indignation until you become rich and then show away the resentment of a poor man is like the efforts of a harmless insect to sting it may get him crushed but cannot defend him who values that anger which is consumed only in empty menaces  once upon a time a goose fed its young by a pond side and a goose in such circumstances is always extremely proud and excessive punctilious if any other animal without the least design to offend happened to pass that way the goose was immediately at him the pond she said was hers and she would maintain a right in it and support her honor while she had a bill to hiss or a wing to flutter in this manner she drove away ducks pigs and chickens nay even the insidious cat was seen to scamper a lounging mastiff however happened to pass by and thought it no harm if he should lap a little of the water as he was thirsty the guardian goose flew at him like a fury pecked at him with her beak and slapped him with her feathers the dog grew angry had twenty times a good mind to give her a sly snap but suppressing his indignation because his master was nigh a pox take thee cries he for a fool sure those who have neither strength nor weapons to fight at least should be civil that fluttering and hissing of thine may one day get thine head snapt off but it can neither injure thy enemies or ever protect thee so saying he went forward to the pond quenched his thirst in spite of the goose and followed his master  another obstruction to the fortune of youth is that while they are willing to take offense from none they are also equally desirous of giving none offense from hence they endeavor to please all comply with every request attempt to suit themselves to every company have no will of their own but like wax catch every contiguous impression by thus attempting to give universal satisfaction they at last find themselves miserably disappointed to bring the generality of admirers on our side it is sufficient to attempt pleasing a very few  a painter of eminence was once resolved to finish a piece which should please the whole world when therefore he had drawn a picture in which his utmost skill was exhausted it was exposed in the public marketplace with directions at the bottom for every spectator to mark with a brush which lay by every limb and feature which seemed erroneous the spectators came and in general applauded but each willing to show his talent at criticism marked whatever he thought proper at evening when the painter came he was mortified to find the whole picture one universal blot not a single stroke that was not stigmatized with marks of disapprobation not satisfied with this trial the next day he was resolved to try them in a different manner and exposing his picture as before desired that every spectator would mark those beauties he approved or admired the people complied and the artist returning found his picture replete with the marks of beauty every stroke that had been yesterday condemned now received the character of approbation well cries the painter i now find that the best way to please one half of the world is not to mind what the other half says since what are faults in the eyes of these shall be by those regarded as beauties  adieu letter lix from the same a character such as you have represented that of your fair companion which continues virtuous though loaded with infamy is truly great many regard virtue because it is attended with applause your favorite only for the internal pleasure it confers i have often wished that ladies like her were proposed as models for female imitation and not such as have acquired fame by qualities repugnant to the natural softness of the sex  women famed for their valor their skill in politics or their learning leave the duties of their own sex in order to invade the privileges of ours i can no more pardon a fair one for endeavoring to wield the club of hercules than i could him for attempting to twirl her distaff  the modest virgin the prudent wife or the careful matron are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers blustering heroines or virago queens she who makes her husband and her children happy who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue is a much greater character than ladies described in romance whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes  women it has been observed are not naturally formed for great cares themselves but to soften ours their tenderness is the proper reward for the dangers we undergo for their preservation and the ease and cheerfulness of their conversation our desirable retreat from the fatigues of intense application they are confined within the narrow limits of domestic assiduity and when they stray beyond them they move beyond their sphere and consequently without grace  fame therefore has been very unjustly dispensed among the female sex those who least deserved to be remembered meet our admiration and applause while many who have been an honor to humanity are passed over in silence perhaps no age has produced a stronger instance of misplaced fame than the present the semiramis and the thalestris of antiquity are talked of while a modern character infinitely greater than either is unnoticed and unknown  this account seems taken from the manuscript memoirs of h spilman esquire catharina alexowna born near derpat a little city in livonia was heir to no other inheritance than the virtues and frugality of her parents her father being dead she lived with her aged mother in their cottage covered with straw and both though very poor were very contented here retired from the gaze of the world by the labor of her hands she supported her parent who was now incapable of supporting herself while catharina spun the old woman would sit by and read some book of devotion thus when the fatigues of the day were over both would sit down contentedly by their fireside and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant festivity  though her face and person were models of perfection yet her whole attention seemed bestowed upon her mind her mother taught her to read and an old lutheran minister instructed her in the maxims and duties of religion nature had furnished her not only with a ready but a solid turn of thought not only with a strong but a right understanding such truly female accomplishments procured her several solicitations of marriage from the peasants of the country but their offers were refused for she loved her mother too tenderly to think of a separation  catharina was fifteen when her mother died she now therefore left her cottage and went to live with the lutheran minister by whom she had been instructed from her childhood in his house she resided in quality of governess to his children at once reconciling in her character unerring prudence with surprising vivacity  the old man who regarded her as one of his own children had her instructed in dancing and music by the masters who attended the rest of his family thus she continued to improve till he died by which accident she was once more reduced to pristine poverty the country of livonia was at this time wasted by war and lay in a most miserable state of desolation those calamities are ever most heavy upon the poor wherefore catharina though possessed of so many accomplishments experienced all the miseries of hopeless indigence provisions becoming every day more scarce and her private stock being entirely exhausted she resolved at last to travel to marienburgh a city of greater plenty  with her scanty wardrobe packed up in a wallet she set out on her journey on foot she was to walk through a region miserable by nature but rendered still more hideous by the swedes and russians who as each happened to become masters plundered it at discretion but hunger had taught her to despise the dangers and fatigues of the way  one evening upon her journey as she had entered a cottage by the wayside to take up her lodging for the night she was insulted by two swedish soldiers who insisted upon qualifying her as they termed it to follow the camp they might probably have carried their insults into violence had not a subaltern officer accidentally passing by come in to her assistance upon his appearing the soldiers immediately desisted but her thankfulness was hardly greater than her surprise when she instantly recollected in her deliverer the son of the lutheran minister her former instructor benefactor and friend  this was an happy interview for catharina the little stock of money she had brought from home was by this time quite exhausted her clothes were gone piece by piece in order to satisfy those who had entertained her in their houses her generous countryman therefore parted with what he could spare to buy her clothes furnished her with an horse and gave her letters of recommendation to mr gluck a faithful friend of his fathers and superintendant of marienburgh  our beautiful stranger had only to appear to be well received she was immediately admitted into the superintendants family as governess to his two daughters and though yet but seventeen showed herself capable of instructing her sex not only in virtue but politeness such was her good sense and beauty that her master himself in a short time offered her his hand which to his great surprise she thought proper to refuse actuated by a principle of gratitude she was resolved to marry her deliverer only even though he had lost an arm and was otherwise disfigured by wounds in the service  in order therefore to prevent further solicitations from others as soon as the officer came to town upon duty she offered him her person which he accepted with transport and their nuptials were solemnized as usual but all the lines of her fortune were to be striking the very day on which they were married the russians laid siege to marienburgh the unhappy soldier had now no time to enjoy the well earned pleasures of matrimony he was called off before consummation to an attack from which he was never after seen to return  in the mean time the siege went on with fury aggravated on one side by obstinacy on the other by revenge this war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous the innocent peasant and the harmless virgin often shared the fate of the soldier in arms marienburgh was taken by assault and such was the fury of the assailants that not only the garrison but almost all the inhabitants men women and children were put to the sword at length when the carnage was pretty well over catharina was found hid in an oven  she had been hitherto poor but still was free she was now to conform to her hard fate and learn what it was to be a slave in this situation however she behaved with piety and humility and though misfortunes had abated her vivacity yet she was cheerful the fame of her merit and resignation reached even prince menzikoff the russian general he desired to see her was struck with her beauty bought her from the soldier her master and placed her under the direction of his own sister here she was treated with all the respect which her merit deserved while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune  she had not been long in this situation when peter the great paying the prince a visit catharina happened to come in with some dry fruits which she served round with peculiar modesty the mighty monarch saw and was struck with her beauty he returned the next day called for the beautiful slave asked her several questions and found her understanding even more perfect than her person  he had been forced when young to marry from motives of interest he was now resolved to marry pursuant to his own inclinations he immediately enquired the history of the fair livonian who was not yet eighteen he traced her through the vale of obscurity through all the vicissitudes of her fortune and found her truly great in them all the meanness of her birth was no obstruction to his design their nuptials were solemnized in private the prince assuring his courtiers that virtue alone was the properest ladder to a throne  we now see catharina from the low mudwalled cottage empress of the greatest kingdom upon earth the poor solitary wanderer is now surrounded by thousands who find happiness in her smile she who formerly wanted a meal is now capable of diffusing plenty upon whole nations to her fortune she owed a part of this preeminence but to her virtues more  she ever after retained those great qualities which first placed her on a throne and while the extraordinary prince her husband labored for the reformation of his male subjects she studied in her turn the improvement of her own sex she altered their dresses introduced mixed assemblies instituted an order of female knighthood and at length when she had greatly filled all the stations of empress friend wife and mother bravely died without regret regretted by all  adieu end of the
