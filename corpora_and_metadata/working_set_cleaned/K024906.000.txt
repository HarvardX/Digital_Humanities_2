sir william trumball first in these fields i try the sylvan strains nor blush to sport on windsors blissful plains fair thames flow gently from thy sacred spring while on thy banks sicilian muses sing let vernal airs through trembling osiers play and albions cliffs resound the rural lay you that too wise for pride too good for power enjoy the glory to be great no more and carrying with you all the world can boast to all the world illustriously are lost o let my muse her slender reed inspire till in your native shades you tune the lyre so when the nightingale to rest removes the thrush may chant to the forsaken groves but charmed to silence listens while she sings and all the aerial audience clap their wings soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews two swains whom love kept wakeful and the muse poured over the whitening vale their sleecy care fresh as the morn and as the season fair the dawn now blushing on the mountains side thus daphnis spoke and strephon thus replied daph hear how the birds every blooming spray with joyous music wake the dawning day why sit we mute when early linnets sing when warbling philomel salutes the spring why sit we sad when phosphor shines so slear and lavish nature paints the purple year  streph sing then and damon shall attend the strain while yon slow oxen turned the furrowed plain here the bright crocus and blue vilet glow here western winds on breathing roses blow i will stake yon lamb that near the fountain plays and from the brink his dancing shade surveys  daph and i this bowl where wanton ivy twines and swelling clusters bend the curling vines four figures rising from the work appear the various seasons of the rolling year and what is that which binds the radiant sky where twelve fair signs in beauteous order ly  dam then sing by turns by turns the muses sing now hawthorns blossom now the daisies spring now leaves the trees and flowers adorn the ground begin the vales shall every note rebound  streph inspire me phoebus in my delias praise with wallers strains or granvilles moving lays a milkwhite bull shall at your altars stand that threats a fight and spurns the rising sand  daph o love for sylvia let me gain the prize and make my tongue victorious as her eyes no lambs or sheep for victims i will impart thy victim love shall be the shepherds heart  streph me gentle delia beckons from the plain then hid in shades eludes her eager swain but feigns a laugh to see me search around and by that laugh the willing fair is found  daph the sprightly sylvia trips along the green she runs but hopes she does not run unseen while a kind glance at her pursuer flies how much at variance are her feet and eyes  streph over golden sands let rich pactolus flow and trees weep amber on the banks of po blessed thamess shores the brightest beauties yield feed here my lambs i will seek no distant field  daph celestial venus haunts idalias groves diana cynthus ceres hybla loves if windsor shades delights the matchless maid cynthus and hybla yield to windsor shade  streph all nature mourns the skies relent in showers hushed are the birds and closed the drooping flowers if delia smile the flowers begin to spring the skies to brighten and the birds to sing  daph all nature laughs the groves are fresh and fair the suns mild luster warms the vital air if sylvia smiles new glories gild the shore and vanquished nature seems to charm no more  streph in spring the fields in autumn hills i love at morn the plains at noon the shady grove but delia always absent from her sight nor plains at morn nor groves at noon delight  daph sylvias like autumn ripe yet mild as may more bright than noon yet fresh as early day even spring displeases when she shines not here but blessed with her t is spring throughout the year  streph say daphnis say in what glad soil appears a wondrous tree that sacred monarchs bears tell me but this and i will disclaim the prize and give the conquest to thy sylvias eyes  daph nay tell me first in what more happy fields the thistle springs to which the lily yields and then a nobler prize i will resign for sylvia charming sylvia shall be thine  dam cease to contend for daphnis i decree the bowl to strephon and the lamb to thee blessed swains whose nymphs in every grace excel blessed nymphs whose swains those graces sing so well now rise and haste to yonder woodbine bowers a soft retreat from sudden vernal showers the turf with rural dainties shall be crowned while opening blooms diffuse their sweets around for see the gathering flocks to shelter tend and from the pleiads fruitful showers descend  ii summer or alexis to dr garth a shepherds boy he seeks no better name led forth his flocks along the silver them where dancing sunbeams on the waters played and verdant alders formed a quivering shade soft as he mourned the streams forgot to flow the flocks around a dumb compassion show the naiads wept in every watery bower and jove consented in a silent shower accept o garth the muses early lays that adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays hear what from love unpracticed hearts endure from love the sole disease thou can not cure ye shady beeches and ye cooling streams defense from phoebus not from cupids beams to you i mourn nor to the deaf i sing the woods shall answer and their echo ring the hills and rocks attend my doleful lay why art thou prouder and more hard than they the bleating sheep with my complaints agree they parched with heat and i inflamed by thee the sultry sirius burns the thirsty plains while in thy heart eternal winter reigns where stray ye muses in what lawn or grove while your alexis pines in hopeless love in those fair fields where sacred isis glides or else where came his winding vales divides as in the crystal spring i view my face fresh rising blushes paint the watery glass but since those graces please thy eyes no more i shun the fountains which i sought before once i was skilled in every herb that grew and every plant that drinks the morning dew ah wretched shepherd what avails thy art to cure thy lambs but not to heal thy heart let other swains attend the rural care feed fairer flocks or richer fleeces sheer but nigh yon mountain let me tune my lays embrace my love and bind my brows with bays that flute is mine which colins tuneful breath inspired when living and bequeathed in death he said alexis take this pipe the same that taught the groves my rosalindas name but now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree for ever silent since despised by thee oh were i made by some transforming power the captive bird that sings within thy bower then might my voice thy listening ears employ and i those kisses he receives enjoy and yet my numbers please the rural throng rough satyrs dance and pan applauds the song the nymphs forsaking every cave and spring their early fruit and milkwhite turtles bring each amorous nymph prefers her gifts in vain on you their gifts are all bestowed again for you the swains the fairest flowers design and in one garland all their beauties join accept the wreath which you deserve alone in whom all beauties are comprised in one see what delights in sylvan scenes appear descending gods have found elysium here in woods bright venus with adonis strayed and chaste diana haunts the forestshade come lovely nymph and bless the silent hours when swains from sheering seek their nightly bowers when weary reapers quit the sultry field and crowned with corn their thanks to ceres yield this harmless grove no lurking viper hides but in my breast the serpent love abides here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew but your alexis knows no sweets but you oh deign to visit our forsaken seats the mossy fountains and the green retreats wherever you walk cool gales shall fan the glade trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade wherever you tread the blushing flowers shall rise and all things flourish where you turn your eyes oh how i long with you to pass my days invoke the muses and resound your praise your praise the birds shall chant in every grove and winds shall waft it to the powers above but would you sing and rival orpheus strain the wondering forests soon should dance again the moving mountains hear the powerful call and headlong streams hang listening in their fall but see the shepherds shun the noonday heat the lowing herds to murmuring brooks retreat to closer shades the panting flocks remove ye gods and is there no relief for love but soon the sun with milder rays descends to the cool ocean where his journey ends on me loves fiercer flames for ever prey by night he scorches as he burns by day iii autumn or hylas and aegon to mr wycherley beneath the shade a spreading beech displays hylas and aegon sung their rural lays this mourned a faithless that an absent love and delias name and doris filled the grove ye mantuan nymphs your sacred succor bring hylas and aegons rural lays i sing thou whom the nine with plautus wit inspire the art of terence and menanders fire whose sense instructs us and whose humor charms whose judgment sways us and whose spirit warms oh skilled in nature see the hearts of swains their artless passions and their tender pains now setting phoebus shone serenely bright and fleecy clouds were streaked with purple light when tuneful hylas with melodious moan taught rocks to weep and made the mountains groan go gentle gales and bear my sighs away to delias ear the tender notes convey as some sad turtle his lost love deplores and with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores thus far from delia to the winds i mourn alike unheard unpitied and forlorn go gentle gales and bear my sighs along for her the feathered quires neglect their song for her the limes their pleasing shades deny for her the liles hang their heads and die ye flowers that droop forsaken by the spring ye birds that left by summer cease to sing ye trees that fade when autumnheats remove say is not absence death to those who love go gentle gales and bear my sighs away cursed be the fields that cause my delias stay fade every blossom wither every tree die every flower and perish all but she what have i said wherever my delia flies let spring attend and sudden flowers arise let opening roses knotted oaks adorn and liquid amber drop from every thorn go gentle gales and bear my sighs along the birds shall cease to tune their evening song the winds to breathe the waving woods to move and streams to murmur ere i cease to love not bubbling fountains to the thirsty swain not balmy sleep to labrers faint with pain not showers to larks or sunshine to the be are half so charming as thy sight to me go gentle gales and bear my sighs away come delia come ah why this long delay through rocks and caves the name of delia sounds delia each cave and echoing rock rebounds ye powers what pleasing frenzy soothes my mind do lovers dream or is my delia kind she comes my delia comes  now cease my lay and cease ye gales to bear my sighs away next aegon sung while windsor groves admired rehearse ye muses what yourselves inspired resound ye hills resound my mournful strain of perjured doris dying i complain here where the mountains lessening as they rise lose the low vales and steal into the skies while laboring oxen spent with toil and heat in their loose traces from the field retreat while curling smoaks from villagetops are seen and the fleet shades glide ever the dusky green resound ye hills resound my mournful lay beneath yon poplar often we passed the da often on the rind i carved her amorous vows while she with garlands hung the bending boughs the garlands fade the vows are worn away so dies her love and so my hopes decay resound ye hills resound my mournful strain now bright arcturus glads the teeming grain now golden fruits on loaded branches shine and grateful clusters swell with floods of wine now blushing berries paint the yellow grove just gods shall all things yield returns but love resound ye hills resound my mournful lay the shepherds cry the flocks are left a prey  ah what avails it me the flocks to keep who lost my heart while i preserved my sheep pan came and asked what magic caused my smart or what ill eyes malignant glances dart what eyes but here is alas have power to move and is there magic but what dwells in love resound ye hills resound my mournful strains i will fly from shepherds flocks and flowery plains from shepherds flocks and plains i may remove forsake mankind and all the world  but love i know thee love on foreign mountains bred wolves gave thee suck and savage tigers fed thou were from aetnas burning entrails torn got by fierce whirlwinds and in thunder born resound ye hills resound my mournful lay farewell ye woods adieu the light of day one leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains no more ye hills no more resound my strains thus sung the shepherds till the approach of night the skies yet blushing with departing light when falling dews with spangles decked the glade and the low sun had lengthened every shade iv winter or daphne to the memory of mrs tempest lycidas thyrsis the music of that murmuring spring is not so mournful as the strains you sing nor rivers winding through the vales below so sweetly warble or so smoothly flow now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces ly the moon serene in glory mounts the sky whilst silent birds forget their tuneful lays oh sing of daphnes fate and daphnes praise  thyr behold the groves that shine with silver frost their beauty withered and their verdure lost here shall i try the sweet alexis strain that called the listening dryads to the plain thames heard the numbers as he flowed along and bade his willows learn the moving song  lyc so may kind rains their vital moisture yield and swell the future harvest of the field begin this charge the dying daphne gave and said ye shepherds sing around my grave sing while beside the shaded tomb i mourn and with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn  thyr ye gentle muses leave your crystal spring let nymphs and sylvans cypress garlands bring ye weeping loves the stream with myrtles hide and break your bows as when adonis died and with your golden darts now useless grown inscribe a verse on this relenting stone  let nature change let heaven and earth deplore  fair daphnes dead and love is now no more t is done and natures various charms decay see gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear their faded honors scattered on her bier see where on earth the flowery glories ly with her they flourished and with her they die ah what avail the beauties nature wore fair daphnes dead and beauty is no more for her the flocks refuse their verdant food the thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood the silver swans her hapless fate bemoan in notes more sad than when they sing their own in hollow caves sweet echo silent lies silent or only to her name replies her name with pleasure once she taught the shore now daphnes dead and pleasure is no more no grateful dews descend from evening skies nor morning odours from the flowers arise no rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield the balmy zephyrs silent since her death lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath the industrious bees neglect their golden store fair daphnes dead and sweetness is no more no more the mounting larks while daphne sings shall listening in mid air suspend their wings no more the birds shall imitate her lays or hushed with wonder hearken from the sprays no more the streams their murmurs shall forbear a sweeter music than their own to hear but tell the reeds and tell the vocal shore fair daphnes dead and music is no more her fate is whispered by the gentle breeze and told in sighs to all the trembling trees the trembling trees in every plain and wood her fate remurmur to the silver flood the silver flood so lately calm appears swelled with new passion and overflows with tears the winds and trees and floods her death deplore daphne our grief our glory now no more but see where daphne wondering mounts on high above the clouds above the starry sky eternal beauties grace the shining scene fields ever fresh and groves for ever green there while you rest in amaranthine bowers or from those meads select unfading flowers behold us kindly who your name implore daphne our goddess and our grief no more  lyc how all things listen while thy muse complains such silence waits on philomelas strains in some still evening when the whispering breeze pants on the leaves and dies upon the trees to thee bright goddess often a lamb shall bleed if teeming ewes increase my fleecy breed while plants their shade or flowers their odours give thy name thy honor and thy praise shall live  thyr but see orion sheds unwholesome dews arise the pines a noxious shade diffuse sharp boreas blows and nature feels decay time conquers all and we must time obey adieu ye vales ye mountains streams and groves adieu ye shepherds rural lays and loves adieu my flocks farewell ye sylvan crew daphne farewell and all the world adieu  end of popes pastorals
